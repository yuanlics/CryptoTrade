        "title": "SEC Delays BlackRock's Spot Ethereum ETF Decision - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "SEC Delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Decision\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), citing the need for more time to review the proposed rule change. The delay, announced one day ahead of the January 25 deadline, marks the first of several delays the SEC can exercise across a 240-day period. This first deadline comes nearly 45 days after BlackRock filed for an iShares Ethereum Trust through Nasdaq on December 11.\n\nBlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF has a final deadline decision date of August 7, 2024. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes that a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May, with the analyst giving a 70% chance of approval. May 23 is the earliest final deadline of all applicants, similar to the SEC's decision on 10 pending spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. Other spot Ether ETF applications have final decision deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 3.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expects to see more spot Ether ETF delays \"sporadically\" over the next few months. He also further emphasized the importance of May as the crucial decision date for Ether ETFs applications. The SEC's decision-making process for spot Ether ETFs is being closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry and investors alike. The approval of spot Ether ETFs would provide a more accessible and regulated way to invest in Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nHowever, the SEC's delay in deciding on BlackRock's spot Ether ETF proposal suggests that the Commission is taking a cautious approach to approving these products. The SEC's decision will likely depend on its assessment of the risks and benefits of spot Ether ETFs, as well as the adequacy of the proposed rule changes."

        "content": "Ethereum price extended losses and tested the $2,300 support. ETH is now attempting a recovery wave above the $2,340 level and might test $2,390.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $2,420 and $2,400 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair attempt a fresh increase if it clears the $2,390 and $2,400 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits $2,300\n\nEthereum price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $2,550 and $2,580 resistance levels. ETH started a fresh decline and traded below the $2,400 support like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,350 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,302 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,330 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,479 swing high to the $2,302 low.\n\nThere was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,365 level.\n\nThe next hurdle could be $2,390 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,479 swing high to the $2,302 low. The next major resistance is now near $2,400. A clear move above the $2,400 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,480 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,500 zone. A close above the $2,500 resistance could start another steady increase. In the stated case, Ether price could rise toward the $2,650 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,390 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,300 zone. A downside break below the $2,300 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,200 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,390\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Image source: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-gold-coin-with-the-word-ether-on-it-gWoL3zunCZE\n\nEthereum had a tough time in 2023, dealing with considerable external pressures from regulatory authorities, as well as the collapse of exchanges and crypto-friendly banks that rocked the digital money environment to its core. Binance data shows that the coin has regained much of its former strength over the past couple of months, but a lot of work remains to be done. As Ethereum continues to recover bit by bit, here are some of the most critical changes in the system that could mean prices will continue to change.\n\nCensorship\n\nThe cryptocurrency world is best known for being a fully decentralized environment. That means that no single person or company owns all the data; instead, it is distributed across the different nodes in the system. In light of the recent talks about imposing stricter regulations on blockchains, many investors have discussed the possibility that this is the beginning of the end for the decentralized ledger. Many traders believe that the only reason regulations would ever be enforced is to keep the system under control and switch it to a more centralized model.\n\nSome are concerned that these shifts have already begun to happen for Ethereum. The US government recently sanctioned an Ethereum blockchain program allowing investors to perform transactions without leaving a trace. The OFAC claimed that the program was used by entities prohibited by the United States, including military organizations. Many investors criticized the motion while also saying that the Ethereum blockchain will likely remain immune due to its decentralized nature.\n\nHowever, it seems now that they weren\u2019t exactly correct, and at the moment, over 70% of data blocks are considered censored. That\u2019s an almost 30% increase compared to November 2022, when Ethereum was going through one of its lowest periods. Block builders generally have complete authority over the order of transactions and how they are arranged in blocks, meaning they decide on the blockchain content by default. Right now, Titan Builder is the only one claiming not to censor transactions, but if it did, that means Ethereum could reach 90% in censorship.\n\nRelayers\n\nThe relayers are third parties who operate software that moves transactions from the builders to the validators. Back in November 2022, the numbers showed that over 75% of them had ceased passing along transactions that official authorities had sanctioned. However, this is also due, at least partially, to the fact that there wasn\u2019t a large number of relayers at the time, and the ones in charge of the larger volumes were removing these transactions from the central system.\n\nAccording to the latest definitions, only 30% of relayed blocks remain censored as of December 2023. Five builders directly contribute to over 90% of the blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, of which four have chosen to edit transactions. Several operators have chosen to be more cautious, especially if they are US-based. Refusing to comply with the regulations could attract significant trouble for both the individuals and their businesses.\n\nSolana\n\nThe phrase \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has been used for a while now to designate the coins and blockchains that have the potential to remove Ethereum from its throne. While ETH was never able to withstand the sheer force of Bitcoin and surpass it, it is nonetheless the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum isn\u2019t known just as a coin but also for the functionalities its blockchain introduced. The system pioneered the discovery and introduction of decentralized finance and apps, as well as non-fungible tokens and the play-to-earn concept.\n\nThis has made it very popular among tech lovers who follow the latest developments religiously. So, who are the supposed Ethereum killers that could replace it? The truth is that different investors and analysts will say different things, with each of them betting on a different coin and platform. However, Solana is probably the most widely discussed of all of them, mainly because it is much more visible and stable than the others.\n\nOne of its co-founders, Anatoly Yakovenko, recently dismissed these claims, saying that the dynamic between the two coins isn\u2019t what it has been made out to be and that it is essential to continue incorporating efficient technologies. Many in the crypto community believe that a multi-chain future is inevitable. Rather than seeing competition as something negative, the outlook instead is to see it as part of the more extensive evolution parameters of the blockchains.\n\nIn fact, some have already begun discussing the existence and emergence of a Solana killer. It\u2019s good for blockchains to collaborate and co-exist, as it shows the system\u2019s potential to continue growing and evolving, as well as expanding to cover different business areas and niches apart from crypto trading.\n\nPrice predictions\n\n2024 is just around the corner, and investors are debating which outcome is the most likely when it comes to the coins they\u2019re trading. There are several price prospects for Ethereum, and whether they\u2019ll occur and when is bound to change due to the different influences that affect the crypto environment. The market trends point towards a bullish upswing set to occur sooner rather than later, and many investors have already started buying more to consolidate their portfolios and see more considerable gains when the prices rise.\n\nHowever, the economic factors and regulatory issues can act as setbacks. The price has been affected by macro factors, especially inflation and interest rates. Even if they didn\u2019t directly cause prices to collapse, they nonetheless caused market stagnation, which affected holdings and caused considerable apprehension among investors. There\u2019s also the possibility that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, but that will largely depend on the network updates, as well as whether adoption rates continue to increase or not.\n\nTo sum up, many variables could influence how Ethereum will develop in the next year. That makes it impossible to predict the movements accurately. However, this has always been the case for blockchain currencies, and the investors who have been involved in the market for a few years are already familiar with these shifts. Make sure to carefully weigh your options before buying or selling to ensure you see gains and minimize losses."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extended the decision period on BlackRock\u2019s planned spot Ethereum ETF on Jan. 24.\n\nThat notice concerns a proposed rule change allowing Nasdaq to list and trade shares of the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nPreviously, the SEC was required to approve, reject, or institute proceedings to approve or reject BlackRock\u2019s proposal by Jan. 25, 2024. However, securities laws permit the agency to extend the decision period to March 10, 2024.\n\nThe SEC noted Nasdaq initially filed the proposed rule change on Nov. 21, 2023 and that the proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on Dec. 11, 2023. The date of publication determines the deadlines described above.\n\nThe SEC added that it has not received any comments on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal. By contrast, BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal received about 15 comments within two months of its June 2023 filing.\n\nSEC still expected to make decision in May\n\nThe delay around BlackRock is not expected to affect broader Ethereum ETF proceedings. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said today:\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. [The] next date that matters is May 23rd.\u201d\n\nMay 23 is relevant as the SEC must approve or deny VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF by that date without any possibility of further delays. The securities regulator will likely decide on other similar applications with different deadlines, including BlackRock\u2019s, alongside VanEck\u2019s application at that time.\n\nThe SEC similarly delayed proceedings around Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF this month. Once again, this will not impact the May decision deadline.\n\nThough it is required to make a decision by May 23, it is unclear whether the SEC will opt to approve the funds. FOX Business\u2019 Eleanor Terrett has reported internal resistance at the SEC while suggesting that some ETF issuers are optimistic.\n\nPolymarket odds currently suggest a 54% chance of approval by May 31. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts a 70% chance of approval."

        "content": "Polymer Labs, a modular IBC-based networking protocol, has secured a $23 million Series A co-led by Blockchain Capital, Maven 11 and Distributed Global.\n\nOther investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Placeholder, Digital Currency Group, North Island Ventures and Figment Capital also participated in the round.\n\nPolymer can be described as a modular layer-2 network that employs Cosmos SDK\u2019s IBC protocol, OP stack\u2019s settlement functionality and Eigenlayer\u2019s data availability layer. It is the brainchild of Bo Du and Peter Kim.\n\nAfter being in the blockchain industry for a few years, the Polymer founders experienced firsthand how difficult it was to build interchain products. In the summer of 2021, they made a decision to drop their side projects and focus on fixing blockchain interoperability.\n\nRead more: The Interchain Foundation puts aside $26.4M to grow Cosmos ecosystem\n\nInitially, the team wanted to design their own interoperability protocol \u2014 similar to that of many general message-passing protocols that exist today. However, during their research, they came across the Cosmos SDK\u2019s Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, Du told Blockworks.\n\nIBC is an inter-blockchain communication protocol, as its name suggests. It allows different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate with each other. The protocol is designed to ensure that information can be securely transferred between separate operating chains.\n\nRead More: DeFi users \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 what chain apps are on\n\n\u201cIBC already had years put into its design and architecture, so we decided to stick with IBC and not invent a whole new standard,\u201d Du said.\n\nKim added that at the time, IBC was the most decentralized, elegant solution to establish connections and pass messages between chains.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe realized this was something that could be expanded to other chains; basically export the technology to have industry penetration rather than just the Cosmos app chains,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe team wanted to find ways to make the already established interoperability protocol on Cosmos a mainstream standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to integrate IBC natively into all these different chains, which is why we designed the virtual IBC protocol, which essentially allows chains that don\u2019t natively implement IBC to access IBC execution through Polymer and have Polymer execute IBC on its behalf,\u201d Du said.\n\nMany blockchain interoperability protocols today are focused on the state component of interoperability, which involves aligning the status of the data stored within separate systems, but Du believes this is just one part of the interoperability problem.\n\nRead more: Interoperability isn\u2019t just a buzzword\n\nBeyond the state layer, two other layers need to be considered. This includes the application layer \u2014 that is, the layer responsible for encoding and decoding sent data and the transportation layer (TAO) \u2014 which manages the routing of raw data.\n\n\u201cAll of IBC\u2019s core logic will live on the transportation layer; this becomes decoupled from the application layer, and Polymer will hold the IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d Du said.\n\nThis means that at the end of the day, the application \u2014 which lives on Ethereum \u2014 will be able to interact with the IBC network through Polymer smart contracts.\n\n\u201cPolymer will then take the apps intended actions and execute the associated IBC logic and produce a commitment to the IBC state of that chain on Polymer \u2014 so essentially, Polymer is maintaining this merkle-ized IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: 2023\u2019s top 5 DeFi protocols by revenue\n\nSimilar work to decouple state, application and transport layers is being explored by the interoperability protocol LayerZero.\n\nIBC has been around for a long period of time. Du notes that its specs cover various considerations ranging from authentication, timeouts and acknowledgment, somethings its competitors may not have.\n\nThis means that applications will not have to individually implement these different changes when there are protocol upgrades.\n\n\u201cIf you want to design a protocol that is going to last for generations of builders, you need to be able to handle these different edge cases properly,\u201d Du said. \u201cThis is a foundational level protocol.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Polymer Labs, Yuan Han Li and Joshua Rivera from Blockchain Capital, shared this sentiment.\n\nThey note in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that \u201cwhile numerous arbitrary messaging protocols have emerged to address the cross-chain interoperability, they have all done so by building a new messaging standard, paradoxically causing more fragmentation when a standardized and battle tested way to move data between heterogeneous blockchains already exists.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Polymer team is hoping to ensure that IBC becomes a widely adopted interoperability standard that will shape how blockchain applications of the future will communicate. This latest funding round will bring the team closer to launching mainnet.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Step Data Insights revealed in subsequent tweets that the network\u2019s weekly NFT trading volume has experienced an impressive 77% surge, reaching $45 million.\n\nSolana Weekly NFT Volume skyrockets 77% to $45M. pic.twitter.com/4hgDAydZHr \u2014 Step Data Insights (@StepDataInsight) December 6, 2023\n\nETH Surges 20% vs. BTC: Glassnode Report Highlights ETF Boom\n\nThe latest report from Glassnode\u2019s \u201cThe Week Onchain,\u201d authored by Alice Kohn, casts a spotlight on the remarkable performances of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nEthereum has notably eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of market dynamics, achieving its strongest showing since late 2022. Kohn\u2019s research points to a significant increase of over 20% in Ethereum\u2019s value compared to Bitcoin, a trend that aligns with a renewed surge in the Ethereum derivatives market.\n\nETH Resurgence Fuels ETF Speculation, SOL Defies Odds\n\nThe recent resurgence in Ethereum\u2019s market performance, as highlighted in Glassnode\u2019s report, suggests a potential shift in capital flows within the crypto market, sparking increased speculation about the possible introduction of a spot-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nDespite these positive developments, Ethereum still lags behind the broader altcoin market, underperforming by 17%. In contrast, Solana (SOL) has followed a distinct trajectory. According to the same Glassnode report , Solana experienced remarkable price growth last year, overcoming challenges related to its association with the troubled FTX. This divergence in the paths of Ethereum and Solana illustrates the varied dynamics at play in the altcoin market.\n\n@Solana 's December month-over-month NFT volume growth outpaced other ecosystems significantly: pic.twitter.com/wBr2n3itNU \u2014 Syndica \u26c5\ufe0f (@Syndica_io) January 22, 2024\n\nIn striking contrast to Ethereum, Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable performance, with the SOL/BTC ratio soaring by 290% since October 2023. This divergence is particularly noteworthy as Solana\u2019s price did not undergo a significant revaluation following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, unlike Ethereum, according to Kohn.\n\nOverall, the altcoin market has experienced substantial growth, witnessing a nearly 69% increase in market capitalization since the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF filing, highlighting a general uptrend in the altcoin sector, with Solana leading the way.\n\nAltcoin Season in Full Swing as Top 50 Coins Outperform BTC\n\nRecently, Altcoin Season Index signaled the start of an \u2018altseason\u2019. This trend continues with the top 50 altcoins surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the last 90 days, as per the index.\n\nKohn pointed out that this uptrend is largely fueled by tokens associated with Ethereum scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Additionally, the early part of 2023 saw tokens in staking and GameFi sectors also exceeding Bitcoin\u2019s performance, highlighting a diverse risk preference among investors in various altcoin categories.\n\nKohn\u2019s latest research underscored the significant impact of recent market events:\n\n\u201cThe approval of new Bitcoin ETFs has morphed into a classic \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 occurrence, stirring a volatile period in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analysis reveals that Ethereum has come out on top in the short term, with investors achieving a multi-year peak in net realized profits. This trend indicates an increasing propensity among investors to participate in speculative activities, especially related to the potential launch of an ETH ETF and the rotation of capital.\n\nSolana\u2019s Explosive Price Growth: A Sign of Ethereum\u2019s Challenger?\n\nIn addition to a significant increase in its total value locked (TVL), Solana has also witnessed a staggering 800% surge in its price on a year-to-date basis. When compared to Ethereum, Solana has shown superior price growth; Ethereum\u2019s year-to-date growth stands at just 94% . This contrast is also mirrored in the TVL charts, where Solana\u2019s growth, although substantial, still falls behind Ethereum\u2019s, which remains the world\u2019s premier altcoin in terms of TVL. However, it\u2019s important to note that relying solely on TVL as a metric can be misleading, as it may offer a false sense of accuracy and can be easily manipulated.\n\nIn the ring of blockchain, it's #Ethereum vs #Solana ! \ud83e\udd4a \ud83c\udf52 #ETH : King of #DeFi & #NFTs \ud83c\udff0\n\n\ud83c\udf52 #SOL : Speed demon with lower fees \ud83d\ude80 Which blockchain has your vote for the future of crypto?

It is often viewed as a faster, more cost-effective alternative to Ethereum, with an added advantage of superior user interface and experience. The extent of actual development and building on the blockchain is a key factor in increasing TVL, potentially propelling Solana to greater prominence in the crypto world."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Really Bearish In 2024? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Crypto markets may have been volatile this week, triggered by a breakdown on Bitcoin\u2019s chart and a retracement in Ethereum (not the start of an Ethereum\u2019s crash is what we said). Consequently, the \u2018Ethereum bearish\u2018 message is suddenly found everywhere which is in contrast to the sentiment and messaging two weeks ago.\n\nWhile some \u2018pundits\u2019 may come out to call for the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, similarly the end of Ethereum\u2019s bull market, we have a different view.\n\nPreviously, we outlined why Ethereum could still reach $10,000 by 2025, though will probably reach the $3,000 \u2013 $4,000 region in 2024. We stand by this view.\n\nSome commentators have a different opinion, indicating that Ethereum could be a bearish asset in 2024, though such claims are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe problems with poor quality chart analysis\n\nThe issue with low-quality chart analysis is mainly with the timeframe. In the chart below, there are no structured price patterns and the content is short-term orientated. It\u2019s basically impossible to make a reasoned analysis by looking at a single chart \u2013 especially an intraday one!\n\nYet the fallacies contained within the analysis are not apparent to viewers when reading the content. It\u2019s also possible to take a different view on the same chart and draw an entirely different conclusion. Ideally, a lot of factors will converge to create a powerful signal (bullish or bearish).\n\nPractically all of the content regarding Ethereum on this Trading View blog is erroneous, indicating a drop to $700 for Ethereum. We find that highly unlikely and the charts simply don\u2019t back it up, even amidst a declining overall market.\n\nDespite the majority of false claims, there is some sound analysis. This Ethereum technical prediction outlines that despite a bearish outlook in the near term, Ethereum has a strong potential for a bullish reversal in 2024.\n\nEthereum is not bearish in 2024\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Ethereum is not bearish at all in 2024, and that\u2019s in spite of the Bitcoin retracement which we predicted in this altcoin season article. Our exact words were:\n\nArguably, before alt season 2024 will kick off, it might come with a drop in BTC. In a way, it makes sense that an explosive run starts with a drop. The market loves to mislead bulls, particularly at the start and end of bull markets\n\nWe predict an ETH price rise to $10,000 by 2025, and that\u2019s based on sound chart analysis. Take a look at the daily chart.\n\nThe price to hit for this to occur is $3,525. After this, it would be a 3x to $10k. The weekly price chart indicates a similar price rise for ETH, with a rounded reversal bullish pattern.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the headlines! Ethereum is unlikely to go to $700. And it\u2019s likely to end 2024 at a high, possibly even an all-time high. After all, as we keep repeating, 2024 is a hidden crypto bull market in disguise, with a fake drop to fool investors.\n\nTo truly understand what the market is doing, we have a unique crypto investment newsletter dedicated to finding the best coins at the most optimal entry points.

        "content": "Ethereum execution client Geth has seen its market share fall after community members raised concerns over the network\u2019s diversity, fearing Geth\u2019s concentration could lead to a \u201cblack swan event.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 23, Geth\u2019s market share of the Ethereum network execution clients fell 5.2% to 78.8% after reaching 84% the day prior.\n\nGeth is critical in handling transactions and executing smart contracts on Ethereum, but its preference among Ethereum validators has led to an imbalance in execution client diversity on Ethereum, sparking centralization concerns.\n\nPercentage share of Ethereum network execution clients. Source: Clientdiversity.org\n\nEthereum decentralization advocates, including the founding member of the ETHStaker community, known as \u201cSuperphiz,\u201d stressed in a Jan. 24 post on X (formerly Twitter) that a bug in Geth could lead to a more than 80% wipeout of Ether (ETH) staked on the network.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to convince you that every execution client is as robust or as mature as Geth. I\u2019m just telling you that it\u2019s a good idea to use less robust clients to prevent a black swan event,\u201d he explained in another post.\n\nLachlan Feeney, founder and CEO of Ethereum infrastructure firm Labrys, suggested in a Jan. 23 blog post that Ethereum validators could risk losing everything.\n\n\u201cStaked ETH is not risk-free yield. Would you invest a minimum of $75,000 USD into an instrument where the maximum potential gain is 3.5% p.a. but the potential for loss is 100%?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not, but this is what 84% of the Ethereum stakers are doing today,\u201d Feeney added.\n\nAs Geth\u2019s current share exceeds 2/3rds (or 66%), Feeney said a critical bug would \u201cinstantly stop the chain from finalizing.\u201d\n\nIn that scenario, Geth validators that go offline would be subject to an \u201cinactivity leak,\u201d which results in the burning of their staked Ether until the execution recalibrates to a 1/3rd (or 33.3%) share of the network.\n\nFeeney said 90% of a validator\u2019s staked Ether could be wiped within roughly 40 days.\n\n\u201cComparatively, a validator taken offline due to a minority client bug that does not stop the chain from finalizing would lose just 0.4% of its stake in 40 days.\u201d\n\nHowever, Feeney told Cointelegraph there would be a \u201cvery small window\u201d for validators to exit and limit their losses, as there is a rate-limited queue for how many validators can exit per epoch.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client, increased its share from around 8% to 14% on Jan. 23.\n\nNethermind\u2019s increased uptake came despite it identifying and fixing a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum two days earlier.\n\nCoinbase, one of the largest Ethereum validators running on Geth, announced its plan to transition to a multi-client infrastructure in the coming months.\n\nThe exchange explained Geth was the only Ethereum execution client that met its technical requirements since it started Ethereum staking in 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, the tide is turning,\u201d said Coinbase.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

ETH is struggling to recover and might continue to move down toward the $2,000 support zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $2,350 and $2,250 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair attempt a fresh increase if it clears the $2,240 and $2,280 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Losses\n\nEthereum price remained in a bearish zone below the $2,400 pivot level. ETH extended its decline and traded below the $2,250 support level, like Bitcoin.\n\nIt even spiked below the $2,000 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,165 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,220 level.

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has sold more than 1,000 Ether (ETH) in the past several weeks, according to blockchain analytics company Arkham Intelligence, which has been tracking his ETH holdings for the past several months. It obtained the data through Trump's financial filings and disclosures.\n\nMost of the ETH comes from royalties for non-fungible token (NFT) projects that Trump created. In December 2022, Trump released a set of 45,000 NFTs, each priced at $99. The project has amassed trading volumes of over $35 million or 15,000 ETH.\n\nThe NFTs are largely trading above their original price of $99. As of Jan. 19, the cheapest NFT is listed for over $600 and the highest sale was for 37 ETH.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn early 2024, Trump announced another trading card NFT project that has some unique rewards for owners. Some of the potential perks could be dinner with the former president, or even a small piece of fabric from the suit he wore in his Georgia mugshot.\n\nHowever, Trump and his companies are not directly associated with these NFT projects. NFT International created and distributed the NFTs and uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nTrump sold 1,075 ETH for over $2.4 million through Coinbase.. At its peak, it was worth more than $4 million.\n\nThe sale comes after a strong month for Ethereum. The price was up more than 17% in the month leading up to the sale, 30% in the six months before and 60% over the past year.\n\nEven though Trump said during his presidency that he was \"not a fan\" of Bitcoin and that crypto is a \"disaster waiting to happen,\" it is hard to pass on several million dollars. Though Trump is largely unaffiliated with the project, he is still earning royalties. While his stance on crypto is still up in the air, the recent sale is an interesting development in Trump's relationship with crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, it will be important to watch for news relating to presidential candidates' stances on crypto, as this could have large implications for prices, future adoption and use cases going forward.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Donald Trump Sold $2.4 Million Ethereum: Smart Move Or Big Mistake? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "A lawsuit won\u2019t be necessary to convince the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, says SEC Commissioner Hester \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d Peirce.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right,\u201d said Peirce in a Jan. 24 interview with Coinage Media, harking back to the Grayscale court ruling that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to do our approvals,\u201d Peirce added.\n\nPeirce \u2014 known as \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d for her comparatively sympathetic stance toward crypto \u2014 said the SEC would presumably apply the same precedent from Grayscale; however, she acknowledged that the facts and circumstances vary immensely with each ETF application.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes into getting an exchange-traded product ready for market, including making sure that the disclosures are lining up with how the product actually works,\u201d Peirce said.\n\n\u201cHaving heard from a court that the approach we were taking was wrong [...] I think that kind of a lesson will certainly stick with us.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale and Hashdex are among the spot Ether ETF applicants vying for SEC approval.\n\nRelated: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nSenior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pegged the chances of a spot Ether ETF approval at 70% by May.\n\nThe SEC must decide on VanEck\u2019s application by May 23, ARK 21Shares by May 24, Hashdex by May 30, Grayscale by June 18 and Invesco by July 5.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock\u2019s applications must be decided by Aug. 3 and Aug. 7.\n\nBalchunas recently told Cointelegraph that it seems likely that Ether ETFs now have a straight shot at approval, adding that it was difficult to imagine a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved while spot Ether ETFs are not.\n\n\u201cThe Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot for sure. It\u2019s gonna go wherever it goes. It\u2019s basically like on a 15-foot rope following it.\u201d\n\nHowever, other industry pundits are less optimistic.\n\nMorgan Creek Capital\u2019s CEO Mark Yusko predicts a less than 50% chance of an approved spot Ether ETF, arguing that the SEC remains broadly hostile toward the crypto industry.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler also stressed in a Jan. 11 letter that approving a spot Bitcoin ETF wouldn\u2019t lead to a mass approval of other cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\n\u201c[The spot Bitcoin ETF approval] should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\u201d Gensler wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "Coinbase is looking into ways to address client diversity concerns following an outage that affected 8% of Ethereum validators.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Nethermind client software \u2014 a tool that is used to connect validators with blockchain networks \u2014 saw a bug that pulled validators offline.\n\nAlthough the bug was resolved within four hours, concerns about client centralization on Ethereum began to surface.\n\nSpecifically, users flagged that if client software Geth \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s most popular execution client used by 84% of validators \u2014 were to shut down, then Ethereum itself would stop finalizing.\n\nRead more: Liquid Collective pitches efficiency standards for Ethereum validators\n\n\u201cWhen a minority client fails, the penalty is losing [ether] ETH at the same rate as you gained it, but if Geth fails because it instantly stops the chain from finalizing, the penalty is much harsher,\u201d Labrys, a Web3 development company in Australia, wrote in a post on X.\n\nCoinbase Cloud nodes currently rely solely on client software Geth, as does Binance and Kraken. Following urging from community members, a Coinbase Cloud spokesperson told Blockworks that Coinbase is actively assessing alternative execution clients.\n\n\u201cWe believe that client diversity helps the health of the Ethereum network. As industry leaders, we are committed to helping our customers participate in the crypto-economy safely and securely,\u201d a Coinbase spokesperson said.\n\nThey note that, to date, Geth has been the only execution layer client software that has met its technical requirements.\n\nRead more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won\u2019t scale blockchains alone\n\n\u201cMany other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning,\u201d Coinbase Cloud wrote in a post on X.\n\nIt added that \u201calternative execution clients have come a long way, and so we are conducting an updated technical assessment with the goal of adding another execution client to our infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIt is expected that Coinbase will share an update on alternative execution client solutions in late February.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "An Ethereum ETF is coming sooner than you expect - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "We finally have a Bitcoin spot ETF \u2014 an event few of us thought we would see in our careers \u2014 the industry has now turned to the approval of an Ether (ETH) spot ETF as its next target. Those gearing up for another decade of juicy headlines, though, will be disappointed.\n\nThe approval of an ETH spot ETF is now not only certain, but imminent. While the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was able to spout nonsense for over 10 years in its various denials of its BTC equivalent, the watchdog can no longer hide behind diffuse objections to what is a patently clear commodity ETP filing.\n\nIndeed, as was observed by Commissioner Hester Peirce in her damning indictment of the SEC\u2019s conduct over this approval published on Jan. 10, the denials of these applications never made sense.\n\nRelated: Will Bitcoin keep dropping because of the ETFs?\n\nRather than follow what was always a very clear process for these products, the regulator denied applications based only on \u201cprejudice\u201d against Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 a prejudice that was only, finally \u2014 ended by Greyscale\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe result, as Peirce observed, has not only been the erosion of trust in the SEC, but a \u201ccircus\u201d around these crypto products that would otherwise not have been witnessed \u2014 a fact to which the $1 billion of assets now sitting in BlackRock\u2019s BTC spot ETF can attest.\n\nSuch a circus will not be seen around an Ether ETF. Currently, there are seven ETH spot ETF applications sitting on the SEC's desk. This time, VanEck is the first in line with a deadline of May 23, 2024. The deadline for BlackRock\u2019s application is in August, but while typically we would expect the world's largest asset manager to dictate the terms of the approval, the securities watchdog has already instituted proceedings on VanEck's applications.\n\nEthereum ETF deadlines. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nAs such, it would have to come up with an awfully good reason for a denial, which would have a knock-on effect on other pending applications. This is why the market appears so certain that an approval is coming in May.\n\nAnd this will not be the result for just an ETH product, either. The path has now been cleared for any kind of crypto-backed or linked ETP \u2014 from spot products to more complex instruments like structured products, all linked to digital assets.\n\nAs a really long shot, the only potential obstacle in the way of a spot ETH approval is liquidity. Just as the size and scale of the market was a concern for a Bitcoin spot product, it will be even more so for Ethereum, whose move to proof-of-stake has further constrained the supply of ETH.\n\nMoreover, while BTC \u2014 now used almost purely as a store of value - can be held long-term inside large investment funds, ETH is a working currency used to pay for ever-growing numbers of transactions on the highly composable chain.\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler approved the ETFs \u2014 but now he\u2019s striking back\n\nThis and this only may throw a spanner in the works for the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency when it comes to a spot ETF approval, but it truly is an outside chance. Indeed, the same argument could be applied to equities \u2014 and it never is.\n\nThe liquidity issue will continue to plague almost all markets as these mega ETP funds soak up assets from the pensions savings of an aging global population, and solutions will continue to be found. Right now, in fact, we are seeing a lot of Bitcoin flowing into Coinbase wallets, which is almost certainly whales doing over-the-counter (OTC) deals to satisfy institutional demand.\n\nThe question of whether ETH is a security is also null and void as, once it becomes an ETF, it becomes a security. And we already have commodity ETFs \u2014 lots of them.\n\nThe reason it took 10 years for a Bitcoin ETF to be approved was politics \u2014 plain and simple. The SEC was neither sure or ready to be sure until the asset managers were sure and ready to be sure that this new asset class should be allowed through the door. We now have clarity on this.\n\nWith the approval of the BTC spot ETF, cryptocurrency is not only through TradFi\u2019s hallowed door, but sitting firmly at its table. Now, more than the approval of a spot ETH ETF, we can prepare for the full-scale institutional colonization of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nLucas Kiely is the chief investment officer for Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

        "title": "Making Vitalik Buterin's cypherpunk dream for Ethereum a reality - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has a dream. He wants to make Ethereum cypherpunk again \u2014 harkening back to the foundational values of blockchain, like decentralization, open participation, censorship resistance and credible neutrality.\n\nIn the Dec. 28, 2023 post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d Buterin argued that these concepts should shape not only the future of Ethereum but also the future of the internet as Web2 develops into Web3.\n\nAt the same time, Buterin lamented \u201cdegen [-erate] gamblers\u201d on Ethereum who put their money into memecoins or nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the hope of outsized financial rewards.\n\nAccording to Buterin, degens \u201ccan be okay in moderate doses,\u201d but \u201cwhen they are the largest group using the chain on a large scale, this adjusts the public perception and the crypto space\u2019s internal culture,\u201d among other negatives.\n\nIf the Ethereum founder is to avoid what he sees as degeneracy and ever get closer to his dream, he has a long way to go. As Buterin says himself, \u201cThe only non-financial application that is actually being used at a large scale on-chain is ENS.\u201d\n\nWhile that\u2019s a grand endorsement of ENS \u2014 the Ethereum Name Service \u2014 it\u2019s not a fantastic record of achievement either. ENS launched in 2017, so by Buterin\u2019s admission, not a single successful Ethereum project launch since then has met the standards he\u2019s setting. That\u2019s a fairly lamentable record.\n\nWith that being the case, can all of the blame really be laid at the feet of degens?\n\nA single shining cypherpunk beacon\n\nIf the vast bulk of projects on Ethereum can either be classed as cypherpunk and not successful or as successful and not cypherpunk, then it is worth examining the supposed single exception to the rule: the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nENS is a domain naming service for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a standard Ethereum address\u2019s randomly created letters and words to be personalized into easily recognizable words or phrases, such as a name or a brand. As the internet has \u201c.com,\u201d Ethereum thusly has \u201c.eth.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service, to find out what kind of forces might drive Ethereum\u2019s cypherpunk renaissance.\n\nAs Johnson sees it, the cypherpunk idealogy -\u2014 which also drives the shift from Web2 to Web3 \u2014 will prove increasingly popular with the public as ordinary people become more familiar with centralization and its negative associations. He believes this is especially true for hot-button issues such as privacy:\n\n\u201cWeb3 is poised to be a tangible reality as individuals see the impact of centralized technology on their lives, especially their data, and gradually recognize the inherent value in decentralized and credibly neutral technologies.\u201d\n\nJohnson pointed out that while the solutions take time to develop and emerge, \u201cAs blockchain technology advances, there is a decentralized alternative for every centralized option.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Buterin singled out ENS as unique among the whole Ethereum ecosystem because it brings \u201ca true non-financial use case to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nRecent: Crypto community speculates about Bitcoin transfer to Satoshi\u2019s genesis block\n\n\u201cThe .eth naming system now stands as a foundational pillar within Web3\u2019s architecture and is a gateway for Web2 companies scaling into Web3, proving we have slowly entered the transition to Web3. ENS believes in building an internet that adheres to the original ethos of Ethereum to foster inclusivity and self-sovereignty,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe transaction fee problem\n\nVitalik Buterin may lament the rise of \u201cdegeneracy\u201d on Ethereum, but he sees high transaction fees, rather than individual users, as the main culprit and driver of the phenomenon.\n\nButerin writes, \u201cWhen the cost of writing to the chain is $0.001, or even $0.1, you could imagine people making all kinds of applications that use blockchains in various ways, including non-financial ways. But when transaction fees go to over $100, as they have during the peak of the bull markets, there is exactly one audience that remains willing to play \u2014 and in fact, because coin prices are going up and they\u2019re getting richer, becomes even more willing to play: degen gamblers.\u201d\n\nIf that point is accepted as true, there is a further argument to be made that the high cost of transactions on Ethereum is due to historical and current network limitations. A more charitable assessment may be that Ethereum is a victim of its own success, making it difficult to keep up. However you chose to phrase the matter, it boils down to an essential indisputable point: Ethereum is struggling to meet demand.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum switched from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake in a bid to improve throughput and provide a future platform for increased scalability.\n\nBut even with Ethereum\u2019s consensus change, much work remains. The network currently processes 30 transactions per second or lower. The stated goal is to reach anywhere up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nEthereum can do it with time\n\nThe road to a cypherpunk Ethereum may be long, but some have confidence that the network is on the right path.\n\nBarney Mannerings, co-founder of the Vega Protocol decentralized exchange, believes that Buterin can succeed in making Ethereum a more cypherpunk network, but \u201cThe caveat is that it remains to be seen how big the market for this is and how much adoption can be gained.\u201d\n\nWhat founders envisage and what the market responds to do not always perfectly align.\n\nMannerings told Cointelegraph that he sees a parallel with end-to-end encryption for messaging, saying that cypherpunks \u201cfought for strongly end-to-end encrypted communications for years. Initially, they succeeded, technically, with the likes of Phil Zimmernan\u2019s PGP [Pretty Good Privacy], but this has always suffered from a bad UX and low adoption \u2014 a lack of \u2018product market fit.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecent: 100 days out: What the Bitcoin halving means after BTC ETF approvals\n\nMannerings says it wasn\u2019t until later, when Signal arrived with its improved user experience (UX), that the concept fared better. Mainstream messaging apps such as WhatsApp now offer encryption but with some compromises.\n\n\u201cI expect the same to happen here,\u201d said Mannerings. \u201cIt will be easier to technically create and disseminate the tools and building blocks of Vitalik\u2019s cypherpunk dream than it will be to get everyone using them, and for these building blocks to filter through to the real world in a big way could take decades.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to make an argument against the attempt. In fact, as Mannerings points out, \u201cI think it is a strong vision and one worth building toward and fighting for, and I think Ethereum is well placed to lead the charge from a position of strength, with an aligned community and ecosystem.\u201d"

ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $2,300 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nIn the past few weeks, Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,320 resistance zone against the US Dollar. ETH price climbed above the $2,500 and $2,600 resistance levels.\n\nFinally, it tested the $2,720 resistance zone. A high was formed near $2,718 before there was a downside correction. There was a move below the $2,550 support zone. The price even traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,168 swing low to the $2,718 high.\n\nETH is now trading below $2,550 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bearish trend line forming with support at $2,400 on the 4-hour chart.\n\nOn the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $2,380 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,400 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,440 zone. A clear move above the $2,400 and $2,440 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $2,550.\n\nAny more gains could even send the price toward the $2,700 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $2,300 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,168 swing low to the $2,718 high.\n\nThe next major support is now near the $2,200 level. A break below the $2,200 support could push the price to $2,120. If the bulls fail to protect the $2,120 support, the price might decline toward $2,075.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly trading below $2,450 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, Ether price could continue to move down if it breaks the $2,300 support zone.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $2,300, followed by the $2,200 zone.\n\nKey Resistance Levels \u2013 $2,380 and $2,400."

Despite SEC Chair Gensler\u2019s assertion that the Bitcoin ETF approval does not signify the embrace of crypto assets, investors are optimistic about the approval setting a precedent substantial enough to impact its consideration of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAs the industry anticipates the potential outcome, \u201ccrypto mom\u201d Hester Peirce, renowned for her liberty-focused approach to the industry, has offered insights into the commission\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nEthereum ETF Won\u2019t Get \u2018Circus-Like\u2019 Approach\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has expressed optimism about a balanced decision-making process for Ethereum ETF, asserting that the regulatory commission is unlikely to adhere strictly to its traditional stringent approach.\n\nPeirce emphasized that the \u201ccircus-like\u201d consideration process witnessed for Bitcoin ETFs, characterized by legal battles, extensive delays, and security breaches, will not reoccur in the case of Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right,\u201d she stated in an interview with Zack Guzman.\n\nReflecting on her past frustrations with the delays in approving Bitcoin ETFs, Peirce underscored the importance of providing choices to investors in the spirit of liberty and asserted the need for clear thinking and consideration in enforcing regulations on the industry.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things that we can draw on, and I hope that we draw in more than just our general skepticism of anything that touches on crypto, which seems to be how we've approached a lot of these problems in the past,\u201d she emphasized.\n\nHester Peirce\u2019s sentiments align with industry predictions on the likelihood of an approval.\n\nEthereum ETF: Approval or Not?\n\nBusiness journalist Eleanor Terrett has shared varying perspectives on whether the SEC will approve Ethereum ETFs and when the regulatory decision is expected.\n\nTerret stated that there is prevailing optimism among issuers and analysts, forecasting the approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs to influence the SEC\u2019s decision-making process regarding Ethereum ETFs positively.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nContrasting opinions, however, challenge the optimism. Other predictions suggest a \u201chard no\u201d within the regulatory commission, indicating internal resistance to endorsing the ETFs.\n\nETF analyst James Seyffart anticipates a 5-month consideration process for the SEC and has predicted May as a plausible timeframe for the commission\u2019s verdict.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Hester Peirce\u2019s comments express optimism for Ethereum ETFs, they do not guarantee the SEC\u2019s approval.\n\nThe SEC recently extended its decision deadline for Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF application by 45 days.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink is bullish on the potential of Ethereum, further fueling expectations for an imminent ETF approval.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDespite varying forecasts on the fate of Ethereum ETFs, the final decision lies with the SEC. Given the unpredictability of the outcome, it is important to maintain balanced expectations to avoid overestimation or disappointment.\n\nFind out more about the SEC hack prior to Bitcoin ETF approval:\n\nSEC Claims \u2018SIM Swap\u2019 Attack Behind X Account Breach\n\n\n\nDiscover how to stay safe from SIM swap attacks:\n\nHow to Prevent a SIM Swap Attack as SEC Falls Prey"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction 2024 \u2013 2030\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency (by market cap) and the world\u2019s most popular smart contracting platform. It was designed to operate as a world computer and has overcome many hurdles in its short, 8 year existence\u2014some self-induced, others put there by those threatening to stifle innovation.\n\nIn this Ethereum price prediction, we dive into what Ethereum is aiming to accomplish through its development roadmap, what has happened to it in the past, and how all this has, and will, affect Ethereum\u2019s price in the future. We\u2019ll also look at the myriad of factors that affect the Ethereum price.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Ethereum and the ETH price at this crucial moment in Ethereum\u2019s history?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Overview\n\nThe Ethereum network was launched in 2015, and ETH\u2019s first registered price is $1.2222\n\nThrough 2017 Ethereum gained an astounding 17,970.6%, rising from $8.10 to peak at $1,463.72\n\nEthereum lost value after The Merge, the biggest network upgrade in its history\n\nWe predict that Ethereum will get its first 5 figure all-time high (ATH) of $10,200 in 2029, as a result of the Bitcoin Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, regulators, the global economic picture, network upgrades, and institutional usage rates are all factors impacting the price of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap lays out how it is going to scale to 100,000 transactions per second and onboard thousands of users\u2014we discuss how these upgrades will affect the price of ETH\n\nThe table below contains a summary of our Ethereum price prediction for each year:\n\nYear Low Prediction Average Prediction High Prediction 2024 $2,200 $3,600 $4,200 2025 $3,400 $4,200 $6,600 2026 $3,500 $4,500 $5,800 2027 $3,900 $5,200 $4,400 2028 $4,200 $5,800 $6,300 2029 $7,100 $8,800 $10,200 2030 $8,800 $9,000 $9,600\n\nHistorical Evolution of Ethereum\n\n\n\nThe idea for Ethereum was first conceived in 2013 by a young programmer, Vitalik Buterin, after his father introduced him to Bitcoin. Vitalik authored the initial Ethereum whitepaper, outlining the idea that blockchain technology could be used for more than just the transfer of value\u2014as Bitcoin is.\n\nMore specifically, Vitalik proposed that blockchain technology could be used to host contracts (what we today call \u201csmart contracts\u201d) that could perform a whole host of functions and that the distributed network could function as a world computer.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Beginnings\n\nIn 2014, Vitalik took his idea to the North American Bitcoin Conference, in Miami, where he outlined his vision in a 25 minute speech. After this address, Vitalik and a few others from the conference, now considered the cofounders of Ethereum, who were excited by the idea, rented a house to work on the idea.\n\nOne of these individuals, Gavin Wood (creator of Polkadot), then wrote the Ethereum Yellow Paper, which defines the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u2014the operating environment that makes smart contract execution possible.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the Ethereum Foundation was created, as a non-profit to oversee the development of Ethereum. Funds for this development were raised through a crowdsale\u2014which was one of the first initial coin offerings (ICOs)\u2014where Ethereum tokens were sold for Bitcoin\u2014raising more than $18 million.\n\nOver the next 18 months, the initial Ethereum protocol was developed, multiple testnets were run and the network was officially launched on July 30th, 2015, with the creation of the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum was initially a proof-of-work network. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum had an uncapped supply, which made it an inflationary asset.\n\nThe DAO Hack and DAO Hard Fork Controversy\n\nAn important part of Ethereum\u2019s history is often glossed over as it is considered a stain on the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency\u2019s reputation.\n\nIn 2016 a group, containing many members of the Ethereum Foundation, proposed a project simply called The DAO. The DAO\u2019s goal was to become a crowdfunded venture capital firm to invest in new projects building on Ethereum.\n\nThe DAO had initial success, raising $150 million\u201414% of the total supply of Ethereum at the time\u2014in its own crowdsale.\n\n\n\nHowever, after the crowdsale had concluded, a bug was found in the DAO\u2019s smart contract that allowed someone to drain funds from the contract. A hacker noticed it first and made away with 30% of all the raised funds before well-intentioned hackers stepped in to secure the other 70%.\n\nTo solve the problem of stolen funds a soft fork was proposed and implemented on the network. However, a bug was quickly found in the soft fork and the miners rejected it, forcing the need for another solution.\n\nA hardfork was proposed which, controversially, would return all the funds from the hacker\u2019s account to The DAO. A short, and also controversial, vote was held to authorize the fork, which was subsequently implemented 5 days later.\n\nPrior to this incident, the mantra \u201ccode is law\u201d was one of Ethereum\u2019s calling cards, meaning that whatever happens on the blockchain cannot be changed\u2014regardless of its origin. There are those who vehemently disagreed with the idea of the hard fork on these grounds, and its implementation can be seen as an evolution in the network\u2019s principles.\n\nThe Birth of a Classic (Ethereum Classic) After the hardfork was implemented it was thought that just one chain would exist, and the unchanged chain would disappear. However, some miners continued to support the original chain. Two exchanges gave this chain price discovery and rebranded it to Ethereum Classic, which is still its name today. The DAO hack and subsequent infighting is a long story with many twists and turns. If you want to know more, this post tells the in-depth story of the DAO hack and subsequent community divisions, and this timeline offers a chronological overview of events.\n\n\n\nHardforks and Network Evolution\n\nThe DAO fork was not the first or last hard fork on the Ethereum blockchain, as hard forks are how the Ethereum protocol is upgraded. There have been multiple in Ethereum\u2019s history, some of which are more consequential in the history of Ethereum than others, these we\u2019ve summarized in the table below:\n\nHardfork Name Date Most Significant Impact Byzantium October 2017 Allowed for the creation of layer 2s to scale the network Constantinople February 2019 Initial setup for move to proof-of-stake (PoS) Istanbul December 2019 Improved layer 2 and smart contract functionality Beacon Chain December 2020 The initial deployment of the PoS chain for Ethereum London August 2021 Introduction of fee burning mechanism reducing the inflation rate and increasing the chance of ETH being deflationary Bellatrix September 6th 2022 Second upgrade to the Beacon chain, preparing it for The Merge \u201cParis\n\n(The Merge)\u201d September 15th 2022 Proof-of-work (PoW) was switched off, PoS was switched on, completing The Merge and Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake consensus\n\nAs said, this isn\u2019t a complete list, and each hardfork introduced more than just the significant impact we\u2019ve stated here. Those looking for a deeper dive into each hardfork and the technical evolution of the Ethereum blockchain can read this complete history of Ethereum hardforks.\n\nCryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, and NFTs Here it is worth noting another important step in the evolution of Ethereum and the cryptocurrency world, NFTs. In 2017 a revolution started on Ethereum with the launch of CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks were one of the earliest examples of NFTs on Ethereum, and have continued to remain relevant; the current lowest price for a CryptoPunk is just under 60 ETH, around $150,000. This collection of 10,000 algorithmically generated pixel characters were not actually NFTs, but they did help to spur the creation and implementation of the ERC-721 NFT standard on Ethereum. Later on in 2017, the cats began to take over Ethereum, with the rise in popularity of the CryptoKitties game. In this game, users take NFT kittens and breed them together to create new, unique kittens that draw on the traits of their parents. This game grew so popular that it took up 20% of Ethereum\u2019s computation and drastically increased transaction costs. This hastened the need for scaling solutions, because who\u2019s going to want to use a network that can be put out of action by a viral cat game?\n\n\n\nEthereum, The Merge, and Proof-of-Stake\n\nThe Merge was an event almost 5 years in the making, and it was the talking point of the cryptocurrency ecosystem for a long time before, and even after, it happened. Ethereum cofounder, Joe Lubin, said to Time that the Merge \u201cmay end up being more significant\u201d than the genesis day.\n\nThe Merge combined the existing Ethereum PoW blockchain with the PoS Beacon chain that had been running alongside it since December 2020. This merging of the two chains meant that the Ethereum network didn\u2019t lose any of its history as it switched from PoW to PoS\u2014all without affecting the users at all.\n\nThere are several reasons Ethereum switched to a POS consensus model:\n\nReduced Energy Consumption: Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption was reduced by over 99% after the switch to proof-of-stake, and some even stated that \u201cthe merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%\u201d. This was all coming at a time when passions around climate change were high and the power consumption of blockchains was one of the pieces of vitriol being thrown at them.\n\nDeflationary Potential: Prior to The Merge around 13,000 ETH was issued per day. With the switch to PoS this shrank to around 1,700 ETH per day\u2014significantly reducing ETH inflation.\n\nThe London hardfork also introduced a burning mechanism that removes the minimum fee attached to each transaction from circulation. If a single day has an average gas price of more than 16 gwei then the burned amount of ETH exceeds the issuance limit and results in deflation of ETH in that day.\n\nStaking Interest: Ethereum users can now stake their ETH to help secure the network and earn interest (in newly issued ETH) for doing so. A user requires a minimum of 32 ETH to operate a validator and earn this reward.\n\nLower Barrier to Entry: Mining is an expensive operation that requires massive amounts of energy, limiting the number of people with the resources and capacity to secure the network. Staking made it easier for more people to participate in securing the network, making it more decentralized in the process. However, at current prices, a user needs over $88,000 worth of ETH to run a validator node.\n\nNew Scaling Possibilities: Moving to a PoS consensus mechanism allows for future scalability upgrades that are not possible when using a PoW consensus mechanism. This allows Ethereum to scale to meet the needs of a global, digital society.\n\nCurrent State of Ethereum\n\n\n\nEthereum is a fully functioning, decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain that works as a global computer where people can interact and transact in a permissionless manner, from anywhere in the world. It is used by individuals and enterprises for a wide variety of functions, from transferring value to taking out loans to storing data in an immutable fashion.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem contains many of the world\u2019s most popular dApps and some of the biggest technological transformations to come from the cryptocurrency movement, including NFTs, DeFi, zero-knowledge privacy solutions, and layer 2 scaling networks. Here\u2019s a quick look at the Ethereum blockchain in numbers:\n\nAlongside these stats, the Ethereum network processed an average of more than 1 million transactions per day over the past year, a number that is only expected to grow as the number of unique addresses and daily active addresses continue to increase.\n\nWhile these numbers are impressive there are also more than 8 layer 2 networks posting their transactions to Ethereum and taking the load off the main chain, and many more in the pipeline to be launched\u2014meaning the number of transactions secured by the Ethereum layer 1 is much higher than the counts expressed above.\n\nRecently there has also been the launch of an application-specific (for gaming) layer 3 on top of the Arbitrum layer 2.\n\nMarket Position and Performance\n\nEthereum is sat at #2 on CoinMarketCap\u2019s ranking of coins by market cap, as it has been since 2016. In the same article linked above, it is also pointed out that Ethereum is the third best performing asset in the CoinMarketCap top 100 since 2013, with a more than 700x increase.\n\nIn the past year, the price of Ethereum has seen a over 80% increase in price, from $1,643.30 on February 22nd, 2023, to $2,966.91 on February 22nd, 2024. The total supply of available ETH has also been slowly decreasing since the introduction of The Merge in September 2022 making Ethereum a deflationary asset, a move that Vitalik said was giving Ethereum \u201clegitimacy\u201d as \u201cultra sound money\u201d.\n\nOverall, Ethereum\u2019s recent performance has been strong through the Crypto Winter of 2022\u20132023. Its market dominance of 17\u201319%, also held strong through the Bitcoin ETF speculation-fueled price rises and a sudden and sustained surge by Solana in early 2024.\n\nFinally, before we dive into our Ethereum price prediction, Ethereum is the only cryptocurrency that is currently available to institutional investors as a futures contract, approved in October 2023 by the SEC. It is also seen as the next candidate for ETF approval, reflected in the markets the day after Bitcoin ETF approval with a 9% ETH price pump. There are already 7 Ethereum ETF spot applications registered with the SEC, with the first approval deadline set for May 23rd, 2024, and a Bloomberg analyst giving them a 70% chance of being approved.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions 2024-2050\n\n\n\nHere we take a look at what is in store for the Ethereum network in each of the coming years, along with the impact it could have on the price of Ethereum, and we make an Ethereum price prediction for each year.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2024\n\n2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the world of cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators on the weekly chart for Ethereum, we find that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is toying with the 200-day SMA after coming down to touch in Q2 of 2023. The last time this happened was in late 2020, when a \u201cgolden cross\u201d movement had ETH make the move upward to make those ATHs 12 months later.\n\nEthereum has also broken upward out of the trading channel on the chart below, but has met heavy resistance at $3,000\u2014just as the Bitcoin price has also net heavy resistance at $52,000. If the current rally is sustained and Ethereum sustains this breakout then we could have the same scenario as in 2020\u20132021 on our hands, wit the potential of new all-time highs.\n\nMany things could help to spur this move onward, not just market sentiment built on indicators. These other factors include the upcoming deadline for Ethereum ETF approval in May, increasing investor confidence throughout the year as the Fed cuts interest rates, and the release of the Dencun upgrade for the network, targeted for March 13th, that will make Ethereum more secure and introduce faster operations for layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\nAll-in-all, our Ethereum price prediction 2024 is a low of $2,200, a high of $4,200, and a median price of $3,600.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2025\n\nIt is widely predicted that the cryptocurrency narrative in 2025 will be dominated by the effects of the 2024 Bitcoin Halving event. These Halving events typically induce new ATHs for Bitcoin and many altcoins 12\u201318 months after they\u2019ve occurred, meaning that these gains are expected to arrive in 2025.\n\nAs a result, our ETH price prediction 2025 is a new ATH high of $6,600, a low of $3,400, and an average price of $4,200.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2026\n\nIf the expected narrative is correct, and we feel the positive price effects of the 2024 Bitcoin Halving in 2025, then 2026 is when we\u2019ll be coming down off these highs.\n\nHowever, with Crypto prices prominent in the news last year thanks to new ATHs, we can expect governments around the world to be well on the way to implementing cryptocurrency regulations. So long as these are positive and foster the continued evolution of crypto, which we expect them to and be and do, then we can expect the bleeding to be somewhat restrained by these positive developments.\n\nAdd to this the fact that scaling developments should be implemented onto the Ethereum network by this point, greatly increasing its utility, and we are mutedly bullish for Ethereum in 2026, with no new ATH predictions but sustained highs of $5,800, lows of $3,500, and an average price of $4,500.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2027\n\nNot every year is going to be as exciting as the others, and 2027 might be that year for Ethereum. Many big regulatory moves have already been made, no Halving events are affecting the price, and the global economy should be chugging along nicely after everything has settled from the recession scares of 2022 and 2023.\n\nInstitutional use of the Ethereum protocol will hopefully continue to grow into 2027, increasing demand for ETH. However, this demand will be countered by technical improvements that make ETH cheaper and easier to use.\n\nAs a result, we may find that prices have contracted into a smaller range for 2027, with highs of $5,200, lows of $3,900, and an average price of $4,400\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2028\n\n2028 will be the year of the 5th Bitcoin Halving event, and with cryptocurrencies now mainstream and, with investors knowledgeable of the Bitcoin Halving cycle and the expected increase in cryptocurrency prices, we can expect rises in the price of Ethereum based on investors speculation. However, will the Ethereum and Bitcoin prices have decoupled by this point? It is unlikely, and ETH will still be at BTC\u2019s mercy.\n\nThis is why we predict highs of $6,300\u2014close to the ATHs set in 2025 as no one wants to buy higher than this just yet. We also predict lows of $4,200, and a high median price of $5,800.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2029\n\nIn 2029 we can expect most of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades to either be complete or very close to implementation. Here we\u2019re likely to see growing institutional and public use of the network for all sorts of business and personal use cases that greatly impact the way we conduct commerce and value transfer.\n\nOn top of this, while everyone thought the Bitcoin Halving event was priced in, prices continue to climb and Ethereum, if it retains the title of the most used and most popular smart contracting platform in the world, could see its first 5 figure ATH of $10,200, a low of $7,100, and an average price of $8,800.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2030\n\nIf Ethereum has retained its place as the top altcoin then we could see it decouple from the Bitcoin price, and the fallout from the Bitcoin Halving event, if it does hit the crypto market at all, will hardly impact the Ethereum price, helping to bring greater price stability to ETH.\n\nWe should also be in, or close to, the Splurge section of the Ethereum roadmap, where developers are tidying up the existing code and fine-tuning the Ethereum protocol. It is also highly likely that new ideas will be under development by this point, and may even be close to implementation\u2014with the possibility of taking blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to new heights.\n\nWith all that said, 2030 could bring much more stability to the Ethereum price with people looking to the future for it to be a major part of society. This is why we\u2019re predicting a much tighter range, with highs of $9,600, lows of $8,800, and an average price of $9,000\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\n\n\nThere are numerous items that affect the price of Ethereum. The most important of those have been detailed here.\n\nBitcoin: Arguably the biggest influence on any altcoin is the price of Bitcoin and the happenings on the Bitcoin network. The price action of Ethereum, just like any other altcoin, is closely tied to that of the world\u2019s #1 cryptocurrency.\n\nHere we must also mention the Bitcoin Halving, which has historically driven Bitcoin and all altcoins to new ATHs 12\u201318 months after the event occurs. The next Bitcoin Halving event is due to happen in April of 2024 and investors will be watching it closely.\n\nRegulator\u2019s Definition of Ethereum: In June of 2023, the SEC separately sued both Coinbase and Binance, labeling Ethereum as a security in both lawsuits (prompting large drops in the price of Ethereum). The New York General Attorney also called Ethereum a security in 2023, in a lawsuit against the KuCoin exchange.\n\nUntil these regulators remove this label, the presumption that ETH is a security will keep downward pressure on the price. However, when, or if, this is cleared up, we could likely see the price of Ethereum skyrocket.\n\nRegulatory Landscape: Changing the stance on Ethereum as a security is one thing, but once regulators around the globe begin enacting regulations for cryptocurrencies there\u2019ll be a lot clearer picture for retail investors about what will happen to them if they use or interact with cryptocurrencies.\n\nRegulations permitting and clarifying the use of crypto will likely result in positive price action, whereas those decrying and restricting crypto are likely to drive negative price action.\n\nInstitutional Usage Rate: If Ethereum is accepted under a regulatory framework in some of the world\u2019s biggest economies then this gives institutions and corporations the green light to begin using it for products and services\u2014which could include everything from identity solutions, to tokenized assets and supply chain tracking.\n\nThe news of big companies or institutions choosing to use Ethereum is sure to drive price action, while the increase in network traffic brought by such use will also drive demand for ETH, increasing the price.\n\nProtocol Upgrades: The Ethereum roadmap is discussed below and there we discuss the connection between network upgrades and price movements. In short, until the price of Ethereum decouples from that of Bitcoin, protocol upgrades are unlikely to have a large price impact.\n\nHowever, if, or once, Ethereum\u2019s price does decouple from that of Bitcoin, then protocol upgrades will have a much larger impact, expected to result in a net-positive, on the price of Ethereum.\n\nThe Macroeconomic Environment: At the moment, cryptocurrencies are seen as a monetary asset and speculative asset class. These are traditionally only popular during times of economic growth and stability. While the global economy has been quite chaotic since the global pandemic, with interest rates hitting new highs as the Fed tries to avoid an recession in the USA, an occurrence that could have a knock-on effect in other economies around the world.\n\nHowever, the worst is said to be behind us\u2014with the Fed expected to cut interest rates 3 times or more in 2024. A return to normal means investors typically move out of safer assets and into more speculative assets, like cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is expected to be one of those cryptocurrencies thanks to its prominent position and future hopes of an EFT approval.\n\nSupply and Demand: When it switched from a PoW to a PoS network the Ethereum network\u2019s daily reward rate was greatly reduced\u2014and there is now the potential for it to be a deflationary asset. According to the Ether Supply Growth Chart on Etherscan, the total supply of ETH has been steadily decreasing since The Merge.\n\nThis might only be a 0.30% decrease over the course of 17 months, but as network usage grows, the supply is expected to continue decreasing. The increase in network usage will also increase demand for ETH, and these two factors combined will put upward pressure on the price of ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis and Historical Sentiments\n\n\n\nEthereum was officially launched on July 30th, 2015, and the first price information for Ethereum on CoinMarketCap is from August 12th, 2015, where it was valued at $1.2222 per coin. Here we\u2019ll briefly cover the history of Ethereum and its price action from Launch thought to today.\n\nHistorical Price Movements\n\nIn its first few months of existence, Ethereum traded below $2 and also hit its all-time low of $0.4209 on October 21st, 2015. Then, at the beginning of 2016, Ethereum started to climb, and hit local highs of $18.36 in mid-June 2016. This climb existed alongside Bitcoin\u2019s price rise back in 2016\u2014showing just how long altcoins, even new altcoins, have been tracking Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nHowever, any further positive price movement was halted by the news of The DAO hack. ETH lost almost half its value over the next few months, trading as low as $7.2764.\n\n2017 was when a larger part of the world really heard about cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin climbed from ~$900 at the beginning of the year to peak just below $20,000 in December 2017. Ethereum was one of the altcoins that faired best in this time, rising from an opening price of $8.10 on January 1st, to peak at $1,463.72 just over a year later, on January 13th, 2018\u2014a meteoric gain of 17,970.6% that made it one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies of the time and firmly placed it as the world\u2019s most popular altcoin.\n\nLike Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s price then plummeted, reaching lows around $80 in 2018, and finding critical support at $120. Ethereum then bumbled along slowly and didn\u2019t see prices above $1,000 again until January 4th 2021, spending most of its time between 2018 and 2021 under $400.\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving happened in May 2020 and is widely said to be responsible for the price action that started in the crypto markets in 2021, resulting in new ATHs for the majority of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is included in that list, rallying 563% from an opening price of $737.60 at the start of 2021 to its current ATH of $4,891.70 on November 16th.\n\nFrom here the price of Ethereum steadily declined along with the rest of the crypto market as the Crypto Winter of 2022 set in\u2014all assisted by the collapse of Luna and the Terra (UST) in May\u2014to hit local lows of $880 in June 2022, an 82% decrease, before quickly establishing support at $1,000 and $1,275.\n\nEthereum remained at these levels for a month, until the 13th of July when it bounced off a low of $1,005.61 to start a price rise in anticipation of The Merge event, now scheduled for September 2022 after numerous delays. This culminated in highs of just over $2,000 in August.\n\nOn September 6th, the Belatrix hardfork successfully upgraded the Beacon Chain causing ETH to 15% in anticipation of The Merge on September 15th with the Paris upgrade. However, by this date Ethereum had lost these gains and was trading in the same range as it was for the Belatrix hardfork on the day of The Merge\u2014a day where, despite the success of Ethereum\u2019s biggest ever upgrade, ETH lost 8.29% of its price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Post-Merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s poor start to life as a PoS blockchain continued, as further losses throughout the remainder of September and October saw it lose another 19.74% of its value and hit lows of $1,181.76. It then traded sideways before rallying to above $1,600 for the beginning of November 2022.\n\nNovember 2022 saw the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, which shook the crypto markets to its core, and caused huge sell-offs. Ethereum lost over 34% of its value before finding support at $1100.\n\nFrom here Ethereum has recovered well, starting 2023 with a three week rally that saw it gain 40%, and retake the same price levels as before the collapse of FTX.\n\nHowever, from here regulatory scrutiny, and vagueness, around the case of whether ETH is a security, by both the New York Attorney General, Gary Gensler, and the SEC, caused some wild individual day drops in the Ethereum price throughout 2023\u2014some of over 15%.\n\nDespite all this regulator-induced FUD, the price of ETH continued to rise throughout the year\u2014showing hugely positive sentiment from investors. ETH also ended 2023 on a high, thanks, in part, to gains driven by the expected approval of a Bitcoin ETF\u2014closing 2023 at $2,282.89 with YoY gains of 91%.\n\n2024 has since been positive, and the approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 saw ETH pump 9% (while Bitcoin remained stable) on expectations that it might be the next cryptocurrency to have an ETF approved. Ethereum has since followed in the lead of Bitcoin as it rallied toward $52,000 in February, and rallied up toward $3,000, with both cryptocurrencies meeting strong resistance at these marks.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions by Experts and Analysts\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s position as the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency by market cap and the world\u2019s most popular smart contracting platform, means that there\u2019s no shortage of ETH price predictions from experts and analysts. Here we\u2019ve summarized Ethereum price predictions from some expert analysts.\n\nCathie Woods\u2019 ETH Prediction\n\nCathie Woods, the Ark Invest CEO, has stated that she expects Ethereum to reach a $20 trillion market cap by 2030. If the circulating supply of ETH remains relatively stable between now and then, then that equates to a $160,000 to $180,000 valuation for a single ETH.\n\nBill Barhydt\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nBill Barhydt, the CEO of the Abra platform for private and institutional investment in cryptocurrencies, predicts that Ethereum could reach prices as high as $40,000, albeit, without specifying a timeframe. He also states that he is more bullish on Ethereum than he is on Bitcoin.\n\nFinder\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nA panel of experts at Finder.com, a renowned comparison website, offers an ETH price prediction that sees the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency hit $5,824 by 2025 and $14,411 by 2030. Notably, this is a slight reduction in their predictions, previously given in July 2023.\n\nVanEck\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nThe VanEck investment management company predicts that ETH will hit a token price of $11,800 by 2030. This, they state, will be driven by \u201cimproving functionality, lower take-rates and an ethos of inclusivity.\u201d\n\nGeoff Kendrick\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nGeoff Kendrick, analyst and Head of Crypto Research at the Standard Chartered Bank, predicts that Ethereum could hit $8,000 by 2026. But labeled this as only a \u201cstepping stone\u201d on the way to a larger valuation of $26,000\u2013$25,000, with no timeframe given for this larger valuation.\n\nBonus Prediction: While they have not predicted the price, at the end of 2023 JP Morgan said that they expect Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024 as a result of the release of proto-danksharding on the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum development roadmap lays out the future of the Ethereum network and how developers plan to upgrade it in the near and distant future. At the Ethereum Developer Conference in July 2022, Vitalik Buterin shared that Ethereum would only be about 55% complete after the Merge.\n\nIn the same talk, Vitalik described the next steps\u2014which rhyme\u2014for Ethereum\u2019s growth, these are called the Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The most updated roadmap was shared by Vitalik at the end of 2023 on X\u2014with an added step called the Scourge. Here we\u2019ll take a closer look at what these upgrades involve, and their potential impact on the Ethereum price.\n\nUpcoming Developments and Roadmap\n\nThe Surge:\n\nA focus on scaling and getting Ethereum to 100,000 transactions per second using a combination of scaling solutions like sharding and layer 2s like rollups. This stage, specifically the development of rollup technology, is well underway, with numerous layer 2s already deployed on the network, and a rollup friendly network update scheduled for March 13th.\n\nThe Scourge: According to Vitalik, this is \u201cabout fighting economic centralization\u201d, specifically that caused by liquid staking platforms\u2014issues which he raised in a blog post\u2014like Lido, which, at the time of writing, controlled 31.61% of all the staked ETH securing the network.\n\nThe Verge: Introduces Verkle trees, which, in short, will allow for stateless clients to exist\u2014a stateless client is a node that validates blocks but doesn\u2019t have to store the state of the entire blockchain\u2014lowering the hardware requirements for nodes and increasing decentralization.\n\nThe Purge: This will simplify the protocol by allowing the existence of nodes that only store the last year of data, significantly reducing their storage requirements, reducing network congestion, and making it easier to participate in the network.\n\nThe Splurge: The tinkering phase, where developers are making sure that everything already done is working smoothly, and adding upgrades to fine-tune all the elements of the protocol.\n\nPotential Impacts on ETH Price\n\nThese protocol upgrades will happen over a course of 5\u201310 years, and it is likely to be closer to the higher end of that period before we\u2019re near the Splurge. If we look back at the most significant protocol upgrades in Ethereum\u2019s history, detailed in the Historical Evolution of Ethereum section earlier, and the price action around them, we find little to no correlation between the release of these upgrades and price movements in either direction.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum seems to correlate much more tightly with movements in the price of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market than it does with any calendar of previous protocol upgrades.\n\nAs an example, the two hardforks, Belatrix and Paris, that initiated The Merge\u2014the biggest and most anticipated event in Ethereum history\u2014happened in the first half of September 2022. Over the course of that month Ethereum saw gains of just 1.57%.\n\nAs a result, it is unlikely that upgrades to the Ethereum protocol will significantly impact its price. That is, at least until it has decoupled from tracking the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBottom Line for Ethereum Price Prediction\n\n\n\nPrice predictions are just that, predictions, and those that you\u2019ve read here should not be taken as gospel. There are many Ethereum price predictions out there and this one, looking at technical indicators for the short term, and diving deep into the many technical, economic, and regulatory factors for the long term, has returned a positive price prediction for the future of Ethereum\n\nIf we\u2019re to look to the other end of the scale, for balance, we need to look no further than the words of successful investor Warren Buffet, who is one of the world\u2019s 10 richest people: \u201dIn terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.\u201d\n\nFAQs\n\nWill ETH Price Cross Key Milestones? (e.g., $3,000, $5,000)\n\nAccording to our comprehensive Ethereum price prediction, Ethereum will be back above $3,000 in 2024, and will climb above $5,000 to hit new ATHs of $6,600 in 2025. Furthermore, we expect Ethereum to reach $10,000 in 2029.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Long-Term Investment?\n\nIn our in-depth Ethereum price prediction, which takes into account a myriad of factors, we find that Ethereum is indeed a good long-term investment as the price of Ethereum is likely to increase multiple-fold between now and 2030\u2014making it a solid pick for any investor.\n\nRisks and Considerations in Ethereum Investment\n\nThose investing in Ethereum should know that it comes with many risks and price influences. These include regulatory scrutiny, price volatility, and the macroeconomic climate. We dive into these elements in detail in our Ethereum price prediction for 2024-2030. Investors also have to consider exchange hacks and how they should store their coins."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nHester Peirce believes that spot Ether ETFs will not require legal action to be approved.\n\nSeveral major players are vying for SEC approval for their spot Ether ETF applications.\n\nThere are mixed expectations for spot Ether ETF approval, with some experts optimistic and others cautious.\n\nAccording to SEC Commissioner Hester \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d Peirce, legal action won\u2019t be necessary to persuade the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight applications for spot Ether ETFs.\n\nShe emphasized that the regulator has taken lessons from its past errors, suggesting that the introduction of these products might proceed more seamlessly.\n\nPeirce Notes Nuances In Judging Each Ether ETF Application\n\nPeirce referenced the Grayscale court ruling, which set a precedent for the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., stating:\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nHester Peirce, often referred to as \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d due to her relatively favorable view towards cryptocurrencies, mentioned that the SEC is likely to use the same precedent set by the Grayscale case in future considerations.\n\nHowever, she recognized that the specifics and context can differ greatly with each ETF application, indicating a nuanced approach to each case.\n\nShe commented :\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes into getting an exchange-traded product ready for market, including making sure that the disclosures are lining up with how the product actually works. Having heard from a court that the approach we were taking was wrong [\u2026] I think that kind of a lesson will certainly stick with us.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex are among the key players seeking SEC approval for their spot Ether ETF applications. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, recently estimated a 70% chance of approval for a spot Ether ETF by May.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Anticipation Builds As Deadlines Approach\n\nThe SEC has specific deadlines for deciding on these applications. VanEck\u2019s application is due by May 23, followed by ARK 21Shares on May 24, Hashdex by May 30, Grayscale by June 18, and Invesco\u2019s decision is due by July 5. Meanwhile, the applications from Fidelity and BlackRock are slated for decisions by August 3 and August 7, respectively.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nBalchunas expressed a strong likelihood of Ether ETFs receiving approval, especially in the wake of spot Bitcoin ETFs being approved. He finds it hard to envision a scenario where Ether ETFs wouldn\u2019t be approved given the precedent set by Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHe stated :\n\n\u201cThe Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot for sure. It\u2019s gonna go wherever it goes. It\u2019s basically like on a 15-foot rope following it.\u201d\n\nExperts Divided on SEC\u2019s Spot Ether ETF Outlook\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook from some, not all industry experts share the same sentiment regarding the approval of spot Ether ETFs. Mark Yusko, the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, is less hopeful , estimating the chances of approval at below 50%. He commented that the SEC maintains a generally adversarial stance towards the crypto industry, which could impact the approval process.\n\nAnd how likely is the approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by year's end? \ud83e\udd14 Find out in our latest interview with Mark Yusko, Founder, CEO & CIO of Morgan Creek Capital. \ud83d\udcac\n\nClick the link below and dive into the game-changing world of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval \u2013 from market dynamics\u2026 pic.twitter.com/yjPnrVLKl9 \u2014 Cindy (@Natasha1s2K4) January 17, 2024\n\nThis perspective is somewhat echoed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who emphasized in a letter dated January 11 that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF should not be interpreted as a blanket endorsement for other cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\nGensler specifically stated :\n\n\u201c[The spot Bitcoin ETF approval] should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nThis comment suggests a cautious and case-by-case approach to the approval of cryptocurrency-related products by the SEC.\n\nHe commented :\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETF Approval Opens Doors for Ethereum\u2019s Spot ETF Bid\n\nThe fact is, while BTC is primarily seen as a store of value, ETH serves as a functional currency, facilitating transactions on its highly composable chain. Despite their operational differences, ETH\u2019s spot ETF approval remains a possibility. The growing liquidity crunch in global markets is being addressed by institutional demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which is moving into wallets.\n\nThe debate over ETH\u2019s security status becomes irrelevant once it transforms into an ETF, similar to many existing commodity ETFs. With BTC\u2019s ETF approval, cryptocurrency has entered TradFi and is poised for institutional integration, paving the way for broader acceptance and potential approval of a spot ETH ETF."

Peirce mentioned that the regulators will change their approval process for ETH ETF applicants, and they will make regular consumer and market considerations, as it does with all ETF products.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right.\u201d \u2013 Hester Peirce, SEC Commissioner\n\nNEW: SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce tells me the SEC won't repeat the same mistakes with ETH ETFs after fumbling Bitcoin ETFs:\n\n\n\n\"That's not how we're going to do our approvals \u2026 I think that kind of a lesson will certainly stick with us.pic.twitter.com/QNu52Gmr3H \u2014 Zack Guzm\u00e1n (@zGuz) January 23, 2024\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase faces headwinds as Bitcoin and ETF interest dips, says JPMorgan\n\nThe Commissioner also expressed her frustration over the long delays in Bitcoin ETF approvals, as she always thought these products met the requirements for approval long ago.\n\nPeirce also shed light on the SEC\u2019s X account hack, which previously posted the fake approval post, leading to a brief market manipulation. She believes the hack might not have happened if the SEC hadn\u2019t built up so much attention around these approvals and that the agency could\u2019ve avoided this by using its regular approach to ETF applications.\n\nThe lack of heightened anticipation will be a key consideration in Ethereum ETF approvals, as the SEC shouldn\u2019t be building hype around a regulatory decision.\n\nPeirce further emphasized that approving spot Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the SEC will change how it regulates crypto. She also mentioned that the agency is not in the business of policing crypto, rather its focus will also be on regulating securities products based on crypto that trades on securities exchanges, just as it does with the gold market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, announced plans to diversify its execution clients amidst concerns over the dominance of go-Ethereum (Geth).\n\nIn a Jan. 23 statement on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Coinbase Cloud disclosed ongoing evaluations to identify alternative qualified execution clients for its platform while acknowledging the growth being made in the industry.\n\n\u201cAlternative execution clients have come a long way, and so we are conducting an updated technical assessment with the goal of adding another execution client to our infrastructure,\u201d Coinbase said.\n\nThe Brian Armstrong-led exchange added that it will release a formal update on the process by the end of February.\n\nGeth dominance raises concern\n\nGeth is an Ethereum execution client responsible for handling transactions and the deployment of smart contracts. According to Ethereum client diversity data, 84% of Ethereum validators rely on it, raising security apprehensions within the community over its dominance.\n\nThe concerns were escalated after a bug issue briefly took all Nethermind validators (approximately 10% of the network) offline. Although a prompt fix was implemented, community members highlighted the potential impact of a similar occurrence on Geth.\n\nLachlan Feeney of Labrys, the development studio behind MEV Watch, a tool addressing censorship risks on the Ethereum blockchain, explicitly warned that stakers running Geth face the prospect of losing up to 100% of their assets in the event of critical bug discovery, which instantly halts the network chain\u2019s finalization."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s a new entrant in the already very crowded field of Ethereum layer-2 solutions\u2014and this one wants to be the chain that rules them all.\n\nPolymer today announced it has completed a $23 million Series A with investments from top-tier VCs in the crypto space, including Coinbase, Placeholder, and Digital Currency Group. The company plans to use the cash to build its eponymous network, which it describes as \u201cthe first Ethereum Layer 2 that provides interoperability-as-a-service to Ethereum and its rollups.\u201d\n\nWhat that means, essentially, is that Polymer aims to be a hub, of sorts, for Ethereum and all other Ethereum-based networks, such as Arbitrum and Optimism. It\u2019s the network you\u2019d use to defragment the vast Ethereum ecosystem, and the one that would make sure that the financial data, assets, and applications across the ecosystem all play nice\u2014at least, that\u2019s the plan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo do that, Polymer uses the Cosmos IBC protocol. Cosmos basically provides the software framework from which all manner of blockchains can be built. There are many popular Cosmos-based chains on the market today, such as Injective, Cronos, Thorchain, and the buzzy Celestia. The Polymer team thinks IBC can be to Web3 what TCP/IP was for the internet.\n\n\u201cThere were several different organizations and universities that established TCP/IP as the internet\u2019s standard. We\u2019re one of those organizations trying to establish IBC as the standard for interoperability in Web3,\u201d Polymer co-founder Peter Kim told Decrypt.\n\nThe interoperability holy grail\n\nPolymer aims to empower developers to build cross-chain applications by introducing a \u201cneutral standard\u201d that can be used to deploy applications on multiple chains, without the usual headaches that this entails. The standard, according to Polymer, will allow applications on different chains to communicate with each other\u2014without introducing new trust assumptions.\n\nUniversal communication across blockchains is hard, and users end up carrying the burden of this by being confined to only using applications that are available on the blockchain or layer-2 network they\u2019re using at any given time. This results in users typically picking a chain where they place most of their capital and leaving it there. And this can be especially problematic in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nData can\u2019t be passed between decentralized applications on different layer 2\u2019s because the system \u201clacks a decentralized and open interoperability standard,\u201d Polymer said in a press release. As such, Ethereum and its many rollups are the first market Polymer is focusing on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolymer co-founder Bo Du told Decrypt that while Polymer is still in a private testnet, he encourages builders working on interesting projects to reach out to him directly so that he can \u201cget them building right away.\u201d Once they\u2019ve moved on from their private testnet, they\u2019ll be launching a partner program to help onboard new developers.\n\nDu will have plenty of competition though. Ethereum is littered with layer-2s, rollups and sidechains that all compete for both market and mindshare. Throughout the years, we\u2019ve seen many Layer 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s make a big splash\u2014only to fizzle out due to not being able to capture the attention of builders. There was a point in time where even Tezos was called a \u201cghost chain\u201d due to its lack of developer attention. There are only so many crypto devs to go around, after all\u2014and fewer and fewer every year, according to Electric Capital.\n\nBlockchain interoperability is also something of a \u201choly grail\u201d in crypto\u2014and has been for some time. Competing Ethereum-based network Layer Zero has also thrown its hat in the interoperability ring, and has seen a lot of usage\u2014although it\u2019s largely driven by speculation that early participants will receive an airdrop.\n\nWhy neutral standards are important\n\nStill, Polymer believes it can set itself apart from the pack by introducing a \u201cneutral standard\u201d that other Ethereum-based chains will then abide by.\n\n\u201cThe reason standards are important is that any of these subprotocols can be difficult for an application developer to spec out, implement, and most importantly, do the prior two correctly,\u201d Du told Decrypt.\n\nIn other words, having no standards in place for cross-chain operability makes building applications that facilitate it far more challenging. Developers have to essentially build everything from scratch. If you\u2019re a developer building a cross-chain application, you need to build an integration for each chain you want to be compatible with. Without standards in place, each of these integrations looks different. Each chain integration is a new problem for a dev team to figure out.\n\nBut creating a new standard is easier said than done.\n\nYou not only need to build the product, you then need to build the social consensus from the community being addressed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolymer believes the best way to achieve this is through neutrality, and making it as easy and robust as possible for developers to work with. The company acknowledges that there are others out there already addressing cross-chain operability, but it believes those competitors sacrifice neutrality in exchange for simplicity or speed to market.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, both chain developers and application developers are more likely to adopt standards that are neutral and not tied to any one company. While Polymer is, in fact, a company, IBC is an open-source framework\u2014one that has the neutrality that Polymer believes it needs in order to become the new standard for interoperability."

Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.\n\nEthereum price struggles\n\nThe timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.\n\nCoinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYou never know when a huge pile of meme coins can turn into serious cash. Early Dogecoin (DOGE) investors know this well, as do Solana developers who received an airdrop of BONK. And the latest beneficiary of a meme coin glow-up is\u2026 former U.S. president Donald Trump?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet that blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously tied to Trump, which holds a share of royalties from sales of the official Trump NFT collections, also holds over 579,000 MAGA (TRUMP) tokens. And a recent surge in price for the meme coins means that Trump\u2019s holdings are valued at about $1.1 million as of this writing, as first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nThe TRUMP token has jumped 222% this week alone, per data from CoinGecko, and 689% over the past 14 days. Meme coins are famously volatile and can be driven by social media sentiment and real-world events, and Trump has racked up a pair of 2024 presidential primary wins in recent days as he attempts to win a second term in office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s wallet isn\u2019t associated with the creation of the TRUMP token, and in many cases, meme coins inspired by celebrities and public figures aren\u2019t created by the person in question. Instead, they\u2019re often created anonymously in an effort to ride the wave of hype and FOMO.\n\nIn this case, Trump\u2019s wallet was sent the sizable allotment of TRUMP tokens across multiple transactions in August and October 2023, per public blockchain data tracked by Etherscan. At the time of the largest transfer, on August 19, the 469,901 tokens received on that date were collectively worth approximately $5,670, per data from DexScreener.\n\nNow his stash of TRUMP tokens is valued at $1.1 million, making up the largest single holding in the Trump-affiliated wallet. Overall, it holds nearly $2.6 million worth of cryptocurrency as of this writing, including about $755,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and $731,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIn December, the wallet dumped $2.4 million worth of ETH across a period of three weeks, following the launch of his third collection of NFTs minted on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Only about half of the latest NFT collection has been minted so far, after the two previous collections both sold out.\n\nThe wallet was tied to Trump by Arkham last year following a financial disclosure notice from the former president, as the wallet receives royalties from the sale of his officially licensed NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Ethereum's record number of hodlers downgrades Bitcoin to second place - Baltic Times",
        "content": "Comparisons between Bitcoin and Ethereum have made the topic of many crypto debates, leading to many different conclusions. Bitcoin is the holder of many notable records and achievements, including being the first decentralized cryptocurrency established by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the most valuable digital asset and the one that occupies the largest share in the cryptocurrency market. As a result, Ethereum, which was founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has always lived in Bitcoin\u2019s shadow, alongside all the other digital currencies that emerged in its wake, forming the altcoin pack.\n\nHistorical cryptocurrency data reveals that the two assets have moved in tandem, with the flagship crypto dictating the price trajectory. Judging by the difference between the current Ethereum price and the Bitcoin price, the latter wins by a landslide. Ethereum always seems to be several steps behind Bitcoin, unable to pose a real threat to its dominance and yank it off its throne.\n\nHowever, if we delve a bit deeper, we can see that the altcoin leader also showcases a series of strong suits and key metrics that place it at the top of the cryptocurrency hierarchy, in front of its longtime rival, and hodler count is one of the areas where Ethereum excels.\n\nEthereum hits record number of hodlers in 2023\n\n2023 has been a good year for Ethereum for several reasons. The second-ranked crypto has been on an appreciation journey for the better part of the year, with a 20% gain in the last month and a 38% gain over the past 60 days. Apart from the considerable price increase, Ethereum has also seen a significant surge in hodler numbers.\n\nHodler is a popular crypto slang term that designates long-term holders of a cryptocurrency. These investors buy and hold onto assets regardless of price volatility, trusting their long-term value and their ability to weather market fluctuations.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, addresses that have held Ether for more than 12 months currently make up 72% of all Ethereum holders, reaching the highest level since 2018. At the moment, Ethereum counts approximately 73.9 million long-term holders, after a 44.2% increase, while Bitcoin\u2019s holder figures stand at 33.6 million.\n\nHodlers play an important role in the health and performance of digital assets. Coins backed by a large number of holders tend to be less susceptible to market volatility and are generally perceived as more resilient and trustworthy. So, the fact that Ethereum\u2019s holder community is growing is certainly a positive development for the network.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum also outclasses Bitcoin in terms of whales, which refers to persons or entities that own a large amount of a single cryptocurrency, between 1000 and 10,000 coins. By the latest count, the number of Ethereum whale addresses has recently reached 5,370, marking a 12% yearly increase, while Bitcoin whale wallets amount to 1,920.\n\nThis proves that Bitcoin is not the only coin boasting record-breaking performances in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ethereum outshines the original crypto in many ways, so even though there\u2019s still a huge price discrepancy between the two, the top altcoin continues to attract an increasing number of investors.\n\nWhat prompted Ethereum\u2019s holder increase?\n\nNot too long ago, Bitcoin used to hold supremacy in hodler numbers as well. What\u2019s more, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have had impressive runs this year and recorded increases in their hodler metrics. So, what exactly caused the tables to turn and lead to such a notable disparity between the two assets?\n\nEthereum\u2019s surge in long-term holders can be attributed to a series of factors. One of the most likely causes for the increase is the rise in Ethereum staking registered this year. The amount of staked Ether has nearly doubled since the beginning of 2023, with roughly 24% of all Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply being locked in staking deposits. Since most staked funds remained untouched for more than 12 months, this led to a major rise in the Holder Ratio.\n\nHowever, there are other factors that have contributed to the phenomenon which have to do with the purpose and the evolution of the two crypto projects. On one hand, Bitcoin has continued to operate as a deflationary store of value and a peer-to-peer form of digital money, so it hasn\u2019t strayed away from its original purpose and use cases.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has undergone massive transformations since its launch back in 2013. Designed by Vitalik Buterin as a programable blockchain, Ethereum started its journey as a platform that enables the deployment of decentralized apps (dApps). However, over the years and after multiple upgrades and updates, the Ethereum ecosystem expanded considerably, with applications and use cases spanning across many other areas, including gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nBitcoin is clearly more established and mainstream than Ethereum, having a longer track record in the market and being superior in terms of price performance and scalability. Ethereum is in a weaker position from this point of view, but price action is not the only aspect that attracts investors and drives crypto adoption.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum boasts a diversity of use cases and represents a hub for innovation in the crypto sphere has caught the eye of stakeholders and that has led to an increase in hodler numbers.\n\nThe Ethereum network also seems to respond better to the changing needs and demands of market participants. The Merge and Shapella upgrades, which saw Ethereum switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, stand as proof of Ethereum\u2019s adaptability, flexibility and its constant focus on innovation. These attributes have turned it into a decentralized blockchain powerhouse and continue to draw in more investors and holders.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s record number of long-term holders might not be enough to steal the leader position from Bitcoin, so it\u2019s rather premature to make assumptions about a potential flippening in the near future. However, changes in this key metric serve as an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s strength and potential and are worth taking into account by crypto enthusiasts."

The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.\n\nThis potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum\u2019s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.\n\nAdditional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum\u2019s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.\n\nThe current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.\n\nBitcoin in trouble\n\nBitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.\n\nOn the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.\n\nShiba Inu gets hit\n\nThe token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.\n\nThe current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.\n\nIn terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is working to add another Ethereum execution client to its infrastructure as critics continue to sound the alarm over Geth dominance across the ecosystem.\n\nA post on X (formerly Twitter) published on Jan. 22 drew attention to the exchange\u2019s renewed efforts to move away from its total dependence on go-ethereum, or Geth. As the thread details, Coinbase Cloud found that Geth was the only Ethereum execution client that met its technical requirements when it launched Ethereum staking.\n\n1/ Execution client diversity on Ethereum is a critical concern for all of us at Coinbase. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing about it. \u2193 \u2014 Coinbase Cloud \ufe0f (@CoinbaseCloud) January 23, 2024\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve evaluated execution clients since 2020, none have met Coinbase Cloud\u2019s requirements to date. Many other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning,\u201d the thread reads.\n\nGeth is an Ethereum execution client that handles transactions and the deployment and execution of smart contracts.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs air concern over Vitalik\u2019s plan to increase gas limit\n\nCoinbase is now undertaking a technical assessment of alternative Ethereum execution clients with the intention of adding another to its infrastructure. The exchange is set to release a formal update on the process by the end of February 2024.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s statement regarding its dependence on Geth was prompted by an X post from cryptocurrency investor Aftab Hossain. Posting from his DCinvestor profile, which has around 236,000 followers, Hossain unpacked his decision to unstake Ether (ETH) from Coinbase due to its reliance on Geth:\n\ndear @coinbase\n\n\n\ntoday, i unstaked all of the ETH i had staked with you since the first day you offered it as a service. i kept it there to earn passive yield, but also to support your work for the crypto industry (which i greatly value)\n\n\n\nbut i can't ignore the risks of what\u2026 \u2014 DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) January 22, 2024\n\n\u201cI can't ignore the risks of what appears to be a single client staking setup (reliant on geth) at this time. If I have misinterpreted your architecture, please use this post as an opportunity to clarify it,\u201d Hossain wrote.\n\nThe post drew a direct reply from Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong, who noted that the exchange was looking into the matter. Hossain also had contact with Coinbase staking product lead John Zettler and protocol specialist Bienvenido (Ben) Rodriguez, with both indicating that the exchange is working to address community feedback.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Zettler and Coinbase regarding its reliance on Geth, the potential alternatives, and the potential risks of relying on a single execution client.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\n\nEthereum.org has a page dedicated to client diversity and estimates that 85% of all nodes operate on Geth. The page highlights the potential for a bug in Geth that affects transaction handling or execution payload, which could lead to consensus clients finalizing problematic or bugged transactions.\n\nConcerns around execution client bugs are pertinent after Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind addressed a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that reportedly caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum on Jan. 22.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "According to on-chain data from SolanaFloor, Solana is dominating other blockchains, including Ethereum and Polygon, across various non-fungible token (NFT) activity metrics in the third week of January.\n\nSolana Dominates Ethereum, Bitcoin In NFT Activity\n\nIn a post shared on X on January 23, Solana maintained its NFT dominance among competing blockchains, mainly Ethereum and other high throughput alternatives. Thus far, the blockchain has the highest numbers in unique wallets, transactions, unique buyers, and first-time wallets over the past week.\n\nTo illustrate, Solana had over 106,000 unique wallets by the third week of January 2024. This is more than twice those created in Ethereum. Meanwhile, there were over 22,000 first-time wallets on Solana, roughly 3X those in Ethereum and 2X in Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, more than 2.8 million transactions were posted on Solana. This figure is over 20X those in Ethereum during the same time frame.\n\nExtrapolating from this data suggests that the blockchain is increasingly popular among NFT projects, collectors, and traders. Several factors could be contributing to Solana\u2019s NFT success.\n\nThe platform is known for its high throughput and low transaction fees. Considering how minters and active traders are sensitive to trading fees, Solana is emerging as a layer-1 option for projects wishing to enjoy the security of the mainnet while also benefiting from low transaction fees.\n\nLegacy chains, including Ethereum, continue to struggle with on-chain scalability. Minting on the mainnet often translates to high fees, which can decrease profitability, especially for active traders and collectors.\n\nBeyond scalability advantages, Solana\u2019s ecosystem is rapidly expanding. Despite the catastrophic drop of SOL prices at the end of 2022, the spectacular revival in 2023 activated on-chain activity with meme coins blooming and NFT projects opting to launch on Solana.\n\nThe ongoing recovery of SOL and the increasing number of projects opting to deploy on the mainnet could further drive on-chain activities, including NFT minting and trading, to new levels in 2024.\n\nDevelopers At Work, Will SOL Reclaim $125?\n\nAs the network draws users, its developers are also working to make the platform more robust and decentralized. In 2024, Solana developers plan to activate Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Capital. This client will help further decentralize Solana\u2019s infrastructure, improve performance, and substantially improve reliability, eliminating network hitches that plagued the blockchain in 2022 and early 2023.\n\nSOL is cooling off, trading at around $80 when writing. The coin is down 34% from December 2023 peaks and below the dynamic 20-day moving average, pointing to bears.\n\nKey support remains at around $70. If there is demand at this price point, SOL may recover and retest $125 in the sessions ahead.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Investors were initially curious about Spot Ethereum ETH/USD Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). However, after the approval of Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs, these have now captured their full attention.\n\nBenzinga gathered exclusive commentary from several experts to gauge the prospects for a spot Ethereum ETF approval this summer.\n\nWhat Is The Current Status Of Spot Ethereum ETFs?\n\nTom Staudt, president and COO of ARK Invest, recently expressed confidence in the progression of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHe cited the maturing dialogue with regulators and the sophistication of conversations surrounding the ETF, saying, \"This is not the same place where we were on the timeline with Bitcoin at this stage.\"\n\nStaudt notes that potential issuers now possess greater legal, operational, and philosophical expertise, partly due to the successful approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut skeptics warn of regulatory roadblocks and lingering doubts about Ethereum's classification as a security. At the heart of the debate lies, once again, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWill The SEC Play Ball?\n\nAnndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain advisor, tells Benzinga that the SEC should act in the \"best interest of the public and the crypto industry\" by making a \"timely and positive decision\" on Spot ETH ETFs.\n\nHis comments highlight the widespread anticipation surrounding the potential ETF's arrival, with both retail investors and institutional giants eager to gain exposure to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the SEC had to be \"dragged kicking and screaming\" to approve one spot cryptocurrency ETF, he adds, and there is no guarantee a second one would be any easier.\n\nRead Also: Russia, India Collaborate On Building Joint Digital Economy: BRICS Currency Soon?\n\nEthereum ETFs Could Spur \"Full-Scale, Global Adoption\"\n\nThe case for Ethereum is simple, according to Stijn Paumen, the founder of Helio.\n\nHe paints a vivid picture of a future transformed by Ethereum's mainstream adoption. The ETF approval would be a catalyst for \"full-scale, global adoption of cryptocurrency.\"\n\nEveryday purchases, from your morning coffee to online shopping sprees, could be made with a simple tap of your crypto wallet.\n\nHis infectious enthusiasm captures the transformative potential of blockchain technology and its ability to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nEven Bitcoiners Think It's Coming\n\nTerrence Yang, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, acknowledges the inevitability of an ETH ETF, albeit somewhat grudgingly.\n\nHe concedes that legal precedents and the SEC's recent Bitcoin approvals have tilted the scales in favor of Ethereum.\n\nIndeed, as Decrypt reported, analysts agree that Bitcoin's approval has set a precedent: Grayscale argued in court - and won - that the SEC could not approve a futures ETF and reject a spot ETF. Since futures Ethereum ETFs have already been approved, logic holds that a spot ETF would have to follow - as it did for Bitcoin.\n\nSo...When Ethereum ETF?\n\nChris Martin, head of research at Amberdata, a crypto data analytics firm, says an Ethereum ETF should come sooner rather than later.\n\nIssuers will face two major challenges at the SEC:\n\nThe SEC doesn't have the public pressure it did for the Bitcoin ETF which means, they can take their time and don't have to worry about passing all of the issuers at once The SEC is still pushing the security vs commodity stance without any clarity.\n\n\"Approving an Ethereum ETF may impact their current cases against Coinbase Inc COIN and Binance BNB/USD, and may push them closer to defining their stance on cryptocurrencies,\" he says.\n\nPrediction markets agree, with Polymarket rating the probability of an approval by May 31 only at 54%.\n\nShould the SEC grant its blessing, the implications for the financial landscape could be profound. Mass adoption may come a step closer after all.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Trader Loses $250,000 In January, Swears Off Leverage: I'm A 'Changed Man Now'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Danksharding and proto-danksharding, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Danksharding vs. proto-danksharding Danksharding and proto-danksharding are critical components in upgrading the Ethereum consensus layer. These technologies aim to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency, particularly in the context of layer-2 rollup solutions. Danksharding is a layer-2 scaling solution designed to empower the world\u2019s second most popular blockchain, Ethereum, to achieve its full potential. Proto-danksharding is an intermediate step in the danksharding roadmap. Proto-danksharding, approved as part of EIP-4844, has been officially incorporated into Ethereum improvement proposals within the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade. The upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17. As per Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, the next significant phase is scheduled for Jan. 30, with the implementation on the Sepolia testnet. The Holesky testnet is set to follow on Feb 7. However, the Ethereum development team has not yet disclosed the mainnet implementation date for the upgrade. Danksharding Ethereum aims to make Ethereum layer-2 solutions, particularly rollups, as cost-effective and as fast as possible as the blockchain becomes more congested with users. Danksharding and proto-danksharding are core to the future of Ethereum scaling. Danksharding is one of Danksharding is one of the final stages of various long-term Ethereum network upgrades to maximize the network\u2019s capacity. So far, core elements of this process have included major network shifts, including the staggered transition from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake\n\nHow layer-2 solutions enhance blockchain efficiency and scalability Layer 2s boost and enhance the capabilities of base layer blockchains like Ethereum. For Ethereum, rollups have emerged as a viable and effective layer-2 solution. Layer-2 solutions refer to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. Layer 2 operates as separate off-chain networks from layer 1 base chains, where transactions are processed and then verified periodically on-chain. While base Ethereum can only process about 15 transactions per second, layer 2s can process thousands of transactions at low costs because of design choices within the periphery network that optimize the transaction processing capabilities of layer-2 solutions. Security and decentralization are still maintained because there is a process where the larger, decentralized base chain still validates transactions from the off-chain layer 2. Blockchain users can interact with a layer-2 front-end like Arbitrum, which processes transactions much more quickly and cheaply than Ethereum. Rollups are a form of layer-2 solution alongside channels, plasma, sidechains and validium. Rollup-based layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism dominate transactions among Ethereum layer 2s. Rollups execute transactions on a layer 2 before batching (rolling up) together the information they contain and sending this to the mainchain periodically for verification. This method enables the spread of fixed costs across multiple transactions, reducing costs arising from gas price volatility.\n\nEthereum scalability and the evolution of rollups In the pursuit of enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability, a primary solution has emerged: Rollups. Rollups powered with technology like danksharding represent a robust effort to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, reduce transaction costs and maintain the network\u2019s foundational principles of decentralization and security. Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) are the two primary forms of rollups available. Optimistic rollups are currently the most popular form of Ethereum scalability solutions. They operate alongside the Ethereum blockchain and are composable, which is a critical advantage. Optimistic rollups are called \u201coptimistic\u201d because they assume the transactions they shift off-chain are valid. There is no on-chain proof of validity, and the ability to challenge transactions is built into optimistic rollups to maintain security. The challenge period of an optimistic rollup is the window when users may dispute a transaction they view as invalid. Within the window, they can challenge the validity of a transaction by submitting a fraud proof, which is a mechanism for demonstrating the invalidity of a particular transaction or batch of transactions. Both the sequencer \u2014 similar to a validator in layer 1s, which submits and orders a block of translation \u2014 and the disputer are required to post a bond. If a transaction is found to be invalid, the sequencer\u2019s bond is slashed. If the fraud proof is found to be invalid and the transaction is valid, then the disputer\u2019s bond will be forfeited. The other primary form of rollup is the ZK-rollup. Zero-knowledge rollups publish cryptographic proofs-of-validity for off-chain transactions. Operators of ZK-rollup chains submit validity proofs to the main chain that demonstrate with cryptographic certainty that the proposed changes to Ethereum\u2019s state are due to a batch of valid transactions that were processed off-chain. Optimistic rollups are more popular than ZK-rollups because they can execute smart contracts. ZK-rollups, however, are mostly limited to simple transactions. Rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum but, currently, inefficiently post transaction data to the mainnet as calldata. This process is set to be optimized by proto-danksharding and danksharding. Rollups execute transactions outside of Ethereum but, currently, inefficiently post transaction data to the mainnet as calldata. This process is set to be optimized by proto-danksharding and danksharding.\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding introduce data blobs to Ethereum The optimization of Ethereum\u2019s rollup solutions relies on specific components of danksharding and proto-danksharding, such as data blobs and the KZG polynomial commitment scheme. These technological elements serve as the foundation for enhancing Ethereum\u2019s rollup capabilities. Core to the layer-2 scaling danksharding implementation is the introduction of blobs. Blobs refer to large units of data that are designed to be part of Ethereum\u2019s transactional structure. Rollups currently use calldata to store transaction data. Calldata is imperfect for rollups because data stored in it needs to be processed by all Ethereum nodes, and it is left on the blockchain permanently. This permanence is not always necessary for rollups since they typically only require the data for a limited time to validate and execute transactions. Proto-danksharding will introduce data blobs that can be attached to transaction blocks and will automatically delete in one to three months. Blobs are transactions carrying a 125-kilobyte \u201cblob\u201d payload stored on the Ethereum consensus layer, not the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) like calldata. This method helps reduce the storage overhead and allows the data in rollup transactions to be sent more cheaply, enabling savings for end users (i.e., less gas fees). Proto-danksharding utilizes the KZG polynomial commitment scheme, which is named after the scheme\u2019s three original authors (Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg). KZG compresses data blobs into small cryptographic commitments. KZG uses a cryptographic technique that allows data stored within blobs to be validated without needing to process the entire blob directly and without revealing the full contents of the blob. This is compatible with the zero-knowledge design used by some layer-2 protocols, which will be used across Ethereum scaling at some stage. That said, danksharding is the full realization of rollups. While proto-danksharding allows rollup transactions to attach one blob to a block, danksharding will expand this to 64 blobs. Danksharding is set to create a huge amount of space for optimistic rollups to dump their compressed transaction data. Danksharding hopes to support an expanding rollup ecosystem and allow thousands of transactions per second.\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding challenge the blockchain trilemma For a blockchain, achieving a balance between scalability, decentralization and security is almost impossible. Optimized layer 2s help overcome this trilemma. The blockchain trilemma concept posits that it is extremely challenging for a blockchain network to achieve scalability, decentralization and security simultaneously. The term was coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and in his view, blockchain platforms can only achieve two of these three goals effectively. Blockchains often need to find out-of-the-box ways to scale effectively and maintain blockchain transaction throughput without sacrificing security and decentralization. Unlike traditional financial networks, blockchains do not rely on third parties like banks to maintain a record and verify transaction ledgers. In a blockchain, this process is conducted by a decentralized network of independent computers called nodes. A more decentralized network with a larger group of nodes also contributes to security. The more nodes a blockchain has, the more theoretically secure it becomes. A potential attacker would need to invest more computational power to take over a larger network and conduct a 51% attack or network takeover. Security powered by higher decentralization directly affects the scalability of a network, as every transaction needs to be validated across a large number of nodes. This means that as the network becomes larger, more information needs to be processed by more participants. These issues have often emerged with larger blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where transactions for end users become expensive and slow during periods of network congestion because blockchain security models mandate a process that cannot be overridden. Ethereum protocol development has prioritized scaling to address these issues, especially given the substantial growth of the network.\n\nOptimized layer-2 solutions empower blockchains against centralized payment giants While blockchain systems may inherently struggle to match the transaction processing efficiency of centralized giants like Visa, layer-2 solutions, such as rollups, optimized by technology like danksharding, level the playing field. Centralized payment systems like Visa can process transactions at scale much more quickly because these networks are closed and don\u2019t require shared consensus. Solutions like danksharding and proto-danksharding are designed to challenge the blockchain trilemma by sharding the blockchain. Layer-2-based off-chain transaction processing is built to enable an increase in Ethereum network capacity, and danksharding helps to optimize one of Ethereum\u2019s core layer-2 solutions: rollups. While both danksharding and proto-danksharding contain the word sharding, neither follows the traditional blockchain sharding technology model, which aims to split up a blockchain into multiple parts. Ethereum shard chains are no longer part of the blockchain\u2019s roadmap. Instead, danksharding uses distributed data sampling across blobs to scale Ethereum. This is much simpler to implement than the more advanced blockchain sharding techniques. This model has sometimes been referred to as \u201cdata-sharding.\u201d Instead, danksharding uses distributed data sampling across blobs to scale Ethereum.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced plans to diversify its Ethereum execution client infrastructure.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s decision comes in response to the increasing dominance of Geth (go-ethereum) in the ecosystem, which has been a point of contention among industry experts and stakeholders. The company announced the initiative in a Jan. 23 X post. According to the thread published by Coinbase Cloud, since its inception, Geth was the only Ethereum (ETH) execution client that fulfilled the company\u2019s technical needs for Ethereum staking.\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve evaluated execution clients since 2020, none have met Coinbase Cloud\u2019s requirements to date. Many other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning. Coinbase Cloud | Source: X\n\nYou might also like: Uranium Finance hacker executes $2.5m BUSD transfer to Ethereum\n\nGeth plays a crucial role in the Ethereum network, handling transactions and the deployment and execution of smart contracts. The dominance of Geth has raised concerns about centralization and the risks associated with a single client.\n\nCoinbase is now proactively conducting a technical assessment of alternative Ethereum execution clients and is committed to integrating another client into its infrastructure. The exchange plans to provide a comprehensive update on this process by the end of February 2024.\n\nThe situation underscores a broader issue within the Ethereum network, as highlighted by Ethereum.org. The website notes that approximately 85% of all nodes operate using Geth, raising the specter of systemic risks should a major bug occur, affecting transaction processing or allowing for the execution of payloads.\n\nThis concern gained further traction following a critical bug discovered in several versions of Nethermind\u2019s execution client on Jan. 22, which reportedly led to processing failures of blocks on Ethereum.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported a wide range of expectations regarding spot Ethereum ETF approvals on Jan. 23.\n\nNotably, Terrett suggested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is opposed to approving a spot Ethereum ETF. She said:\n\n\u201cAnother source tells me the line at the SEC at this very moment is a \u2018hard no\u2019 and there\u2019s currently \u2018some internal resistance\u2019 to the idea.\u201d\n\nTerrett did not state whether that source is a member of the SEC itself or a member of an asset manager seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nTerrett also noted that SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-cryptocurrency stances, has advocated for a more straightforward decision process. The SEC in part approved spot Bitcoin ETFs because one applicant, Grayscale, obtained a legal victory, as SEC chair Gary Gensler explained in a statement. Peirce criticized that approach in an interview with crypto news platform Coinage today, as she said that ETF approvals should involve \u201cregular way consideration\u201d rather than court cases compelling action.\n\nTerrett concluded that further indications of the SEC\u2019s stance will emerge in the coming months as it becomes clear whether it engages with S-1 registration statements. The SEC typically posts notices of meetings with asset managers and exchanges on each ETF\u2019s page as they occur.\n\nAsset managers appear to be optimistic\n\nDespite resistance within the SEC, Terrett suggested that the asset managers responsible for issuing each fund are optimistic about approval.\n\nAccording to Terrett:\n\n\u201c[One] issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the approval and smooth launch of the Bitcoin spots will compel the [SEC] to approve ETH spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nAnother unnamed issuer said that they expect a spot Ethereum ETF to launch by the end of the summer because of the SEC\u2019s earlier approval of Ethereum futures ETFs, and because of BlackRock\u2019s strong ETF approval record.\n\nThat source also cited the CFTC comments suggesting Ethereum is a commodity, as well as Ripple\u2019s partial legal victory against the SEC, as factors that could more broadly prevent the SEC from labeling crypto assets as securities. However, it is not clear that those developments will directly impact spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the coming months.\n\nPublic expectations around approval vary. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posits a 70% chance that an spot Ethereum ETF will be approved in May, while JP Morgan executive Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has predicted a 50% chance of approval. Polymarket odds suggest a 53% chance of approval."

However, JP Morgan analysts, in a note to clients, have expressed skepticism about the likelihood of approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nETH Facing Regulatory Challenges\n\nJP Morgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, are not so optimistic about the SEC approving Ethereum ETFs. The analysts attributed their cautious stance to regulatory and judicial considerations, estimating the likelihood of approval to be no higher than 50%.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand the arguments, we doubt the SEC will classify ether as a commodity by May,\u201d said JP Morgan analysts.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC recently delayed the decision on Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF, extending the deadline to March 5, 2024, for further evaluation. Moreover, the SEC\u2019s final decision on Spot Ethereum ETF applications is now anticipated between late January and August 2024.\n\nPerhaps, the approval of Ethereum futures ETFs in January 2024, completely acknowledging Ethereum as a commodity, brings a glimmer of hope. However, JP Morgan analysts emphasized that the SEC\u2019s classification of Ethereum\u2014whether as a commodity or a security\u2014will play a pivotal role in determining the fate of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Impact on SEC Decision\n\nA key date that could provide more clarity on the possible introduction of these ETFs is January 25\u2014the deadline for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF application\n\nEarlier, grayscale, which successfully challenged the SEC in the past for rejecting its Bitcoin ETF, is now seeking approval for an Ethereum Spot ETF.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nEthereum has seen a considerable decline in recent hours, following Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to keep its momentum within the $38K-$40K mark. This situation has plunged Ethereum\u2019s market dominance, as it finds difficulty in attracting buyers around its support levels. Currently, the market behavior hints at a further decline as a crucial on-chain metric shows selling opportunities. As a result, there\u2019s a bearish threat for ETH price as it could record another dip in the coming hours.\n\nProfitable Addresses Look For Selling Opportunities\n\nRecently, Ethereum (ETH) witnessed a notable price fall from its peak of $2,400, now targeting the $2,100 level. This shift resulted in a wave of long position closures. According to Coinglass, Ethereum faced total liquidations over $77 million, with bullish traders contributing to approximately $70 million in liquidations, contrasted with about $7 million from bearish traders. This trend has established a stronger resistance near the $2,400 level due to continuous bearish pressure.\n\nYet, the potential for an even greater decline in ETH\u2019s price looms, as a key on-chain metric suggests a correction. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, an important indicator, points to a significant sell-off opportunity for Ethereum, particularly with its recent drop toward $2,100.\n\nCurrently, the MVRV ratio is at 1.49, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s market value significantly surpasses its realized value, or the value at the last transaction. This gap may lure traders to realize profits by selling their Ethereum holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Again? Grayscale\u2019s $335M Coinbase Transfer Sparks Concern\n\nThe ETH price tends to stabilize around a MVRV of 1.1, which could indicate a potential further decrease in its value. Meanwhile, the long/short ratio is showing signs of activity, trading at 1.1993, with 54.5% of positions anticipating a price increase and 45.5% predicting a drop.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEfforts by bulls to push Ethereum past the $2,400 resistance were met with resistance, evident from a significant decline in the price chart. This led to a sharp crash in Ethereum\u2019s price, falling below its moving averages and is now aiming to drop below $2,100. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,209, a 6.7% decrease from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price faces a significant test at $2,100 as it recently dropped below the ascending support line. However, buyers continue to defend the price and have quickly triggered a rebound above $2,200. Holding below this could strengthen bearish control, potentially bringing ETH down to the $2,000-$2,100 support area. However, a notable accumulation might be expected near that level.\n\nThe recent price behavior suggests ETH might fluctuate between $2,100 and $2,400 for quite some time. However, a break below $2,100 might send the price below the psychological level of $2K. On the other hand, a rebound and close above the EMA20 trend line might send the price toward $2,400 and then to $2,700."

Speaking to Coinage Media, Peirce emphasized that the SEC should learn from the Grayscale court ruling that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. She believes that the SEC should not need a court to tell it that its approach is \"arbitrary and capricious\" in order to make the right decisions.\n\nPeirce acknowledged that the facts and circumstances vary with each ETF application, but she expects the SEC to apply the same precedent that came from the Grayscale case. She stressed the importance of ensuring that the disclosures align with how the product actually works.\n\nSeveral companies, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, have submitted spot Ether ETF applications to the SEC for approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates a 70% chance of a spot Ether ETF approval by May. The SEC has specific deadlines to decide on each application, ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously stated that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF does not signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for other cryptocurrency ETF applications. He emphasized that most crypto assets are investment contracts subject to federal securities laws."

He added that there is no incentive to run a minority client, at the moment.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. A bug could also mean a chain unable to finalize, ending up \u201cin a world with incorrect forks,\u201d Cygaar said.\n\nKarapetsas said large stakers are in a position to make an impact.\n\n\u201cWe need Lido Finance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Figment to take action,\u201d he said. According to him, they have the resources to easily switch their infrastructure.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cPlease take action for the good of the network and your end users.\u201d"

But some of the biggest losers near the top of the market were once recently stars of the show, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIn recent weeks, all three of those top 20 cryptocurrencies were making big gains as they attracted institutional investor interest. Now, each has slipped by at least 14% over the past seven days, and have posted sizable losses on the day.\n\nEthereum is down sharply this morning, per data from CoinGecko, falling 7% over the past 24 hours to a current price of about $2,200 and pushing its seven-day dip to 14%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana is down almost 16% over the past seven days at a current price of $82.50. It has rebounded slightly from earlier this morning, but remains down about 5% on the day.\n\nMeanwhile AVAX, which is the 11th largest cryptocurrency, has plunged 19% on the week to a current price of just under $29. Like Solana, it has shored up some of its losses since this morning, now down about 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nIt was just over a week ago that Ethereum came just shy of hitting $2,700, its highest price since April 2022. Excitement over Ethereum grew amid the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs as investors considered the next wave of prospective institutional adoption, particularly as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked up the prospect of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nSOL had been on a big run starting from the end of October. It was expected to take a hit during the trial of disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, who was heavily invested in the asset via his now collapsed crypto empire, FTX.\n\nBut major companies such as Visa and Shopify sung the project's praises and said they'd use its blockchain. A growing developer base also meant the price of SOL shot up. It rose as high as $123 in December 2023, nearing a two-year high after plunging to a price of about $8 in December 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAVAX also attracted interest when investment banking giant J.P. Morgan said in November it had used the Avalanche blockchain to tokenize portfolios.\n\nLong-term holders have reason to be optimistic, though\u2014despite the recent dips in price, both coins over a one-year period are doing well: SOL is up 239%, while AVAX has jumped by 64%. Even Ethereum is up by 35% over the last year.\n\nThe broader crypto market has taken a nosedive as it follows the price action of the biggest digital asset by market cap, Bitcoin.\n\nSince crypto fund Grayscale converted its flagship BTC fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and started trading on the stock market, investors have been keen to redeem shares previously locked into the product.\n\nThis has put pressure on the price of the biggest and oldest digital coin in recent days.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "ETH Price: Celsius Moves Massive Ethereum Holdings to Exchange, ETH Price Down 4% - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Networks has been moving a very large number of its Ethereum holdings to exchanges in recent days. This unstaking of ETH and moving it to exchanges comes as part of its recovery plans amid the ongoing bankruptcy process.\n\nCelsius Moves $35 Million Worth of Ethereum\n\nIn the latest insights from on-chain data provider LookonChain, the Celsius wallet has executed significant transactions in the past 10 hours. A deposit of 13,000 ETH, equivalent to $30.34 million, was made to Coinbase, while another transaction involved the deposit of 2,200 ETH, amounting to $5.13 million, to FalconX.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs of the latest data, two staking wallets associated with Celsius continue to hold a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH). The combined holdings in these staking wallets total 557,081 ETH, valuing approximately $1.3 billion. These transactions and the significant Ethereum holdings in Celsius wallets add an interesting dimension to the ongoing movements and activities within the crypto space.\n\nArkham Intelligence revealed that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius liquidated over $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) coins. As said, this sale particularly aims at repaying creditors. Concurrently, Dune Analytics reported a more extensive trend of redemptions, with over $1.6 billion worth of staked Ethereum redeemed in the same timeframe. These redemptions represent the largest recorded since the Shanghai upgrade last year.\n\nETH Price Pressure\n\nAmid the recent movement of ETH coins by Celsius, the ETH price has come under strong selling pressure. As of press time, the ETH price has tanked an additional 4% dropping under $2,350 levels. Thus, one area of concern is that the ETH price has dropped under its key demand zone of $2,388 and $2,460.\n\nIf Ethereum is unable to sustain the mentioned support, there is a potential for a retracement to the subsequent significant support level, projected to be approximately $2,000. As shown in the Santiment chart, when there are sudden increases in big transactions by wealthy investors (whales), it aligns with moments when Ethereum holders are also taking profits, according to the NRPL metric. When these large wallet owners sell to take profits, it usually puts more selling pressure on the asset and causes prices to go down."

        "content": "ETHEREUM'S DIVERSITY PROBLEM. In the blockchain tech context, \"client diversity\" refers to the goal of having multiple software programs \u2013 known as \"clients\" \u2013 available for node operators and validators to access networks; as the thinking goes, if one of these clients goes down, due to a bug or some other mishap, there are plenty of other clients that would remain largely unaffected, preserving the blockchain's uptime. Ethereum's problem , based on a debate that erupted on the social-media platform X over the past few days, is that it's heavily reliant on the client software Geth, which powers around 85% of the blockchain's validators . As our Sam Kessler reported this week , a bug on the \"minority\" client software Nethermind, which powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, knocked out a chunk of those operators on Sunday. Since the share was relatively small, the blockchain kept running as designed. But some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have gotten if Geth had gone out. Cygaar, a crypto educator, noted in an X post that \"Ethereum has terrible client diversity,\" adding that, \"A critical issue in Geth can lead to potentially millions of ETH being destroyed from validators running Geth.\" DCinvestor, a pseudonymous crypto investor with a large social media following, claimed in an X post that they were pulling their staked funds from Coinbase until the company switches its validator operations to a system that relies less on the Geth client: \"I can't ignore the risks.\" Per the website, ClientDiversity.org , which billboards the mantra, \"Diversify Now,\" the goal is for no individual client software to have more than a 33% market share."

        "title": "Polygon May Struggle To Match the Surge of Retik Finance and Ethereum - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Retik Finance and Ethereum as these platforms make significant strides in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. While Retik Finance showcases rapid fundraising success and innovative features, Ethereum remains a stalwart with its imminent 2.0 upgrade. Amidst these surges, Polygon, known for its commitment to scalability and interoperability, faces challenges in keeping pace. Lets explore the unique strengths of Retik Finance and Ethereum, analyzing the potential obstacles that Polygon might encounter in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK)\n\nRetik Finance has swiftly carved its niche in the DeFi sector, introducing a range of innovative features that redefine global transactions. With Futuristic DeFi Debit Cards, Smart Crypto Payment Gateways, AI-Powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending, and a Multi-Chain Non-Custodial Highly Secured DeFi Wallet, Retik Finance offers a comprehensive approach to financial solutions. The project\u2019s ability to raise $1 million in just nine days and nearly $6 million in less than a month underscores its rapid momentum and robust community support. Retik Finance has raised over $8.34 million in total.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, a pioneer in smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With its imminent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, designed to address scalability concerns and enhance sustainability through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ethereum continues to set the standard. The platform\u2019s thriving ecosystem, diverse range of DApps, and widespread adoption contribute to its enduring influence.\n\nChallenges for Polygon in the Face of Retik Finance and Ethereum\u2019s Momentum\n\nCompetition in DeFi Innovation: Retik Finance\u2019s introduction of novel DeFi features, including privacy-centric solutions and rapid fundraising success, intensifies the competition in the DeFi space. Polygon may find it challenging to match the uniqueness and momentum Retik Finance brings to the table.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dominance: Ethereum\u2019s established reputation and ongoing upgrades, particularly the imminent Ethereum 2.0, pose challenges for Polygon. As Ethereum addresses scalability concerns, Polygon may need to strategically position itself to stand out in a market where Ethereum remains a dominant force.\n\nRapid Fundraising Success of Retik Finance: Retik Finance\u2019s ability to swiftly raise substantial funds reflects community trust and interest. Polygon may face challenges in capturing the same level of attention, especially as Retik Finance introduces innovative features that resonate with the evolving demands of the crypto community.\n\nPrivacy-Centric Approach of Retik Finance: Retik Finance\u2019s emphasis on user privacy, offering anonymous transactions without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, adds a unique dimension. Polygon may need to explore avenues to differentiate itself in terms of user privacy and security.\n\nForming strategic partnerships within the crypto space can enhance Polygon\u2019s visibility and credibility. Collaborating with projects that align with Polygon\u2019s values and goals can contribute to its growth. As Retik Finance and Ethereum lead the charge in the cryptocurrency landscape, Polygon faces challenges in maintaining a comparable level of momentum. The competition in DeFi innovation, Ethereum\u2019s enduring dominance, and the rapid success of Retik Finance present hurdles for Polygon to navigate.However, by strategically positioning itself, emphasizing unique features, fostering community engagement, and exploring strategic partnerships, Polygon can navigate these challenges and contribute to the diverse and dynamic ecosystem of blockchain solutions. The coming months will be pivotal for Polygon as it adapts to the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAbout Retik Finance\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions. Introducing futuristic DeFi Debit Cards, a Smart Crypto Payment Gateway, AI-powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, and a Multi-Chain Non-Custodial Highly Secured DeFi Wallet.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has seen another leg down over the past 24 hours, shedding 4% of its value as the bears maintain control of the market.\n\nETH now trades around $2,230 \u2013 17% below its local high of $2,710 set on January 12.\n\nHowever, while Ethereum struggles, the Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) presale continues gaining momentum and has now raised a staggering $9.1 million in funding.\n\nEthereum Extends Losses as Selling Pressure Mounts\n\nETH has closed in the red for four straight days, dropping below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) in that time frame.\n\nThe token is now trading at the same level it was during the first week of January, right before its 25% surge.\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price has been dropping, trading volumes have increased by 26%, hitting $16.6 million in the past day.\n\nThis suggests that crypto traders are actively selling ETH at current levels, prompting additional downside momentum.\n\nThe next potential support for ETH is located around $2,150, which held firm throughout most of December.\n\nHowever, if ETH were to break this level, it could result in a further 10% drop to the next support region at $1,900.\n\nWith the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to a value of 48, there\u2019s a growing belief among traders that a decline like this could be on the cards \u2013 especially given the bearish pressure seen throughout the rest of the crypto market.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Hopes Face Regulatory Resistance from the SEC\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price woes have dampened sentiment recently, there is a potential catalyst on the horizon that could give ETH a significant boost.\n\nNumerous companies have filed applications with the SEC for a spot ETH ETF in the US, and approval would allow mainstream investors easy access to Ethereum exposure for the first time.\n\nHowever, the prospects of such an ETF being launched remain uncertain, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler remaining tight-lipped.\n\nMoreover, while spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved earlier this year, Gensler stated this does not indicate a willingness to green-light other crypto funds.\n\nThe first decision deadlines fall in May 2024, with additional rulings on other applications expected over the summer.\n\nIf a spot ETH ETF was approved, analysts predict it could have a massive impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nNevertheless, with clarity on the matter still months away, Ethereum holders may have to brace for further downside in the interim.\n\nRevolutionary Bitcoin Minetrix Defies Bear Trend with Stake-to-Mine Innovation\n\nWhile the markets wait to see if Ethereum can bounce back or gain momentum from a potential ETF approval, some crypto projects are powering forward despite the bearish sentiment.\n\nOne example is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an innovative platform offering a \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d mechanism for earning Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix allows users to stake its native token to earn mining credits.\n\nThese credits provide access to the project\u2019s cloud mining operation, enabling stakers to generate BTC payouts without purchasing or maintaining hardware.\n\nIn addition, BTCMTX offers staking rewards of 72% per year for simply holding the token.\n\nThis provides compounding passive income, allowing users to accumulate more BTCMTX to boost their mining earnings.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this dual-reward mechanism has driven significant interest in the ongoing BTCMTX presale event and helped the project\u2019s Twitter account reach 18,800 followers.\n\nBTCMTX has even been referenced by high-profile YouTubers like Austin Hilton, who endorsed the token to his 244,000 followers.\n\nWhile macro conditions weigh on major cryptos like Ethereum, Bitcoin Minetrix demonstrates projects with innovative use cases can still thrive.\n\nEarly investors can buy BTCMTX tokens through the presale for just $0.013 \u2013 although this price is only available for two more days before increasing.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a move that is sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, Celsius Network, currently navigating through bankruptcy proceedings, has executed substantial Ethereum (ETH) transactions worth $40 million on Coinbase. This latest development comes as part of Celsius' ongoing efforts to meet its financial obligations and settle with creditors, even as it holds a considerable Ethereum reserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a recent tweet from Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, the Celsius wallet deposited 18,000 ETH ($40 million) to Coinbase just 12 hours ago. This follows a pattern of consistent Ethereum deposits by Celsius, totaling a staggering $280,760 ETH ($621 million) to various platforms including Coinbase, FalconX and OKX since Nov. 13.\n\nThe accumulated Ethereum holding for Celsius currently stands at an impressive 540,029 ETH, equivalent to a valuation of around $1.2 billion. Arkham Intelligence, another blockchain analytics provider, revealed that Celsius engaged in Ethereum sales amounting to more than $125 million between Jan. 8 and Jan. 12. These sales are part of a strategic plan to satisfy outstanding debts and fulfill the requirements of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nEthereum price movements\n\nThe current market price of Ethereum stands at $2,259, reflecting a 1.42% increase over the last 24 hours. However, the coin has experienced an 11.33% decrease in the past seven days. The trading volume for ETH is also down by 1.81% in the last 24 hours, with a total value of $14,257,423,116.\n\nMarket analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring how these substantial Ethereum transactions by Celsius will impact overall market sentiment. With the cryptocurrency community already grappling with volatility, this move by Celsius adds another layer of uncertainty."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has piled on the pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s move has sparked fears about forming a local ETH price top.\n\nETH has continued to dip amid a broader market correction.\n\nCrypto project teams selling tokens to fund operations are nothing new. However, it hardly ceases to spark concern. In the latest instance, a move from the Ethereum Foundation has sparked concerns about forming a local price top and beginning a price dump, particularly amid uncertain market conditions.\n\nEthereum Foundation on the Move\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation sold 700 ETH for about 1.7 million DAI in four transactions between 8:54 am UTC and 9:02 am UTC on Monday, January 22, per Etherscan data. The sum was later transferred to a \u201cGrant Provider\u201d address, potentially for distribution.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (0xd7\u2026c1f4) sold 700 ETH on Cow Protcol between 16:54-17:05 UTC+8 at a price of $2,406 and exchanged it for 1,684,445 DAI.

However, this price decline has continued amid a broader market correction.\n\nETH Sheds Recent Gains\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $2,320, down nearly 6% in the past 24 hours as it sheds gains that had seen it surpass the $2,600 price point on speculation that the SEC was set to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024.\n\nThe recent market correction follows concerns over significant outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, which have placed downward pressure on the BTC price.\n\nOn Sunday, January 21, prominent analyst Ali Martinez warned that ETH risked a pullback to the $2,000 price level if it failed to hold support at $2,388.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum\u2019s price dip appears more linked to a broader market correction than the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sell-off.\n\nExperts have predicted that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe move from the Ethereum Foundation potentially increases the selling pressure on ETH.\n\nRead this for more on Ethereum\u2019s recent dump:\n\nWhales Pour XRP & ETH into CEXs, Triggering Altcoin Sell-off\n\n\n\nFind out more about the oral arguments in the SEC case against Binance:\n\nHere\u2019s Why Tense Binance SEC Court Drama May End in a Split"

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) continues to face strong selling pressure. In the last 24 hours, the ETH price has tanked another 5% and is currently trading at $2,213 with a market cap of $265 billion. It seems that the ETH price can correct an additional 10% to take support at $2,000.\n\nThe Spot Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nEleanor Terrett from Fox Business sheds light on the varied opinions and perspectives surrounding the potential approval timeline for an Ethereum ($ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Discussions involve insights from ETF issuers, investment management firms, and sources close to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne issuer of a Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETF, concurrently awaiting approval for an ETH Spot ETF, expresses confidence that the successful approval and seamless launch of Bitcoin spots may influence the SEC to greenlight ETH spot ETFs.\n\nConversely, another source presents a contrasting viewpoint, stating that the current sentiment at the SEC is a \u201chard no,\u201d with some internal resistance to the idea.\n\nAnother source believes that the approval path for ETH spot ETFs could be smoother, pointing to the listing of ETH futures ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s track record in obtaining ETF approvals. They anticipate a potential launch by the end of the summer. Addressing SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s ambiguous stance on Ethereum\u2019s status as a potential security, the source notes the CFTC\u2019s classification of ETH as a commodity and Ripple\u2019s partial victory with $XRP not being deemed a security during secondary market transactions. This leads them to believe Gensler may find it challenging to assert that most digital assets are securities.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasizes the need to avoid repeating past delays with ETH ETFs, emphasizing the importance of applying \u2018regular way\u2019 consideration to these products, similar to other comparable offerings.\n\nTerrett concludes that the SEC holds the key to the fate of Ethereum ETFs, with upcoming months expected to provide clues on the depth of SEC staff engagement with S-1 filings, akin to their scrutiny of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nThe ETH Price Action\n\nEthereum experienced a significant decline in the recent trading session, particularly falling below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The analysis suggests that Ethereum might target the $2,100 level. A crucial factor to watch is whether the price breaks below $2,100 and then swiftly rebounds above it, potentially indicating a bullish move.\n\nThe 200-day EMA is positioned around the $1,950 level, and its upward trajectory aligns with this zone. The interaction between Ethereum\u2019s price and the rising 200-day EMA presents an intriguing scenario, warranting close observation to discern the potential market dynamics."

When this indicator returns a positive value and rises, it means that the coin is trading at a premium on Coinbase.\n\nConversely, when it declines, it means that the coin trades at a much lower price on Coinbase than on Binance, mostly due to a shift in sentiment or buying pressure between US-based investors.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, ETH\u2019s Coinbase Premium Gap was -1.53 at press time, declining by over 450% since BTC ETF went live.\n\nAn assessment of the Asian markets revealed that the coin\u2019s Korean Premium Gap stayed positive after BTC ETFs became tradable.\n\nETH\u2019s Korean Premium Gap measures the price gap between South Korean exchanges and other exchanges. When it climbs, it indicates the presence of strong buying pressure among Korean retail investors.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s Korean Premium Gap was 3.32, per data from CryptoQuant.\n\nImpending price volatility?\n\nCoinbase ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Hence, the sustained decline in ETH\u2019s Premium Gap on the exchange is one to take note of.\n\nThis is because a sustained discrepancy between exchange prices could increase Ethereum\u2019s market volatility.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator on a daily chart showed a steady widening of the gap between this indicator\u2019s upper and lower bands.\n\nWhenever this gap widens, it signals that an asset\u2019s price deviates more from its average.\n\nHowever, at the same time, ETH\u2019s Average True Range (ATR) and its Chaikin Volatility, which are also market volatility markers, have trended downward.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s ATR was 102.20, falling by 18% since the 12th of January. Likewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Volatility has since plunged by over 150%.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWhen these indicators trend downward, it suggests a decrease in the volatility of an asset\u2019s price movements.\n\nTherefore, while ETH\u2019s BB indicator hints at potential price swings, the declining ATR and Chaikin Volatility suggest that the trend has become less volatile."

        "content": "Ethereum is now paving the way for sustainable altcoins after its recent upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has proven to be one of the most reliable platforms for building decentralised applications and smart contracts. This reputation has prompted numerous developers to leverage the Ethereum platform, crafting their own distinctive cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s thriving altcoin ecosystem, two projects stand out: Chainlink, with its decentralised oracle network and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), with its novel mining protocol. Both leverage Ethereum\u2019s strengths, but which boasts stronger investor appeal for the future?\n\nEthereum Leading the Way for Environmentally Friendly Altcoins\n\nEthereum has become a go-to platform for various blockchain applications and smart contracts. Offering developers a robust toolkit, it serves as a versatile space for creating and launching diverse blockchain-based projects.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade to version 2.0 on March 12, 2023, was the next phase for Ethereum. This upgrade not only made the network eco-friendly but also set it apart from other widely used cryptocurrencies that consume substantial energy for mining.\n\nThe latest iteration, Ethereum 2.0, is geared towards making the platform even more scalable, faster and environmentally sustainable.\n\nChainlink: A New-and-Improved Ethereum Platform?\n\nChainlink functions as a decentralised oracle network embedded within the Ethereum blockchain. Its main purpose is to facilitate connections between smart contracts and real-world data, bridging the gap to external APIs.\n\nWith a market capitalisation surpassing $8 billion, Chainlink has gained recognition in the cryptocurrency community, currently holding the 12th position on CoinMarketCap.\n\nKnown for its technological advancements, Chainlink plays a crucial role in supporting decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. By providing secure and reliable data feeds, the platform empowers developers to create DeFi applications without constraints from on-chain data sources. Additionally, Chainlink boasts an active community of developers dedicated to ongoing improvements and innovations on the platform.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix: A Community-centric Crypto with the Technical Power of Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is quickly gaining attention for its innovative \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d approach to Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain, this project presents a user-friendly method for individuals to earn Bitcoin passively, eliminating the need for technical expertise.\n\nThe platform is tailored to make Bitcoin mining more accessible to a broader audience, removing the requirements for expensive hardware and specialised skills. By staking their BTCMTX tokens, users gain access to cloud computing resources, simplifying the entire mining process.\n\nThe project has built a solid reputation rooted in security and transparency. Through Ethereum-compatible wallets like MetaMask, users can easily acquire and stake BTCMTX tokens within the ecosystem.\n\nThe onboarding process involves buying tokens, opting for \u201cbuy-and-stake,\u201d and collecting rewards in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s native token, $BTCMTX, is based on the ERC-20 standard, within the Ethereum blockchain. With a total supply limit of 4 billion tokens, the project demonstrates a thoughtful distribution strategy, allocating portions to the presale, marketing activities, staking and community-related projects.\n\nA major benefit of Bitcoin Minetrix is its ability to address typical challenges associated with Bitcoin mining, such as complexity and high entry costs. The token-based system offers a higher level of decentralisation and security compared to standard cloud mining services, reducing barriers for regular crypto enthusiasts.\n\nWhen users stake their tokens, they not only receive \u201cmining credits\u201d for cloud mining power but also enjoy two streams of income: potential staking rewards of up to 87% annually and a share of the mining profits. This dual-revenue model is a significant draw for those interested in both mining and staking in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhat Future Users of Web 3.0 Want for DeFi Currency\n\nAs the crypto market continues evolving, users seek sustainable and reliable DeFi currencies. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform has proven to be one of the most reliable and eco-friendly platforms for building decentralised applications and smart contracts. Chainlink and Bitcoin Minetrix are two cryptocurrencies that have used Ethereum\u2019s platform to create unique and reliable DeFi currencies.\n\nChainlink\u2019s decentralised oracle network has proven to be a valuable asset for the DeFi ecosystem. Its secure and reliable data feeds allow developers to create DeFi applications not limited by on-chain data sources. Bitcoin Minetrix, on the other hand, offers a unique community-led approach that has proven to be popular among users.\n\nIn conclusion, Chainlink and Bitcoin Minetrix are two of the most promising Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies currently on the market. While Chainlink has an advantage in its focus on decentralisation, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s unique features, such as its stake-to-mine feature and strong community governance, make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking for the next big project.\n\nFor investors seeking dramatic growth, turning attention to presale tokens like Bitcoin Minetrix is a strategic move. The $BTCMTX token holds the promise of potentially soaring 50x \u2013 100x, and with its final presale stage underway, early investors have a prime opportunity to get involved and potentially see significant profits in the coming weeks.\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "For Ethereum ETFs, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce strongly believes that the securities regulator would not repeat the same mistakes it made in the run-up to spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Approval Might Come Without Hassle\n\nAward-winning Web3.0 host Zac Guzm\u00e1n interviewed Peirce to discuss the regulation of cryptocurrency. During their discussion, he asked the commissioner if Ethereum ETF filers would need to go to court before receiving approval from the SEC just as Grayscale had done. Peirce responded that the SEC would not need to \u201crepeat same mistake\u201d as it did before.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPopularly known as the \u2018Crypto mom\u2019, the commissioner went on to state that the agency would not need a court to explain that its approach is arbitrary and capricious before it gets things right this time around. In her opinion, the SEC has learned its lessons and they will stick to it as applications for Ethereum ETF kept coming in.\n\nBefore approving spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, the SEC had constantly rejected applications from several interested parties including Grayscale. Notably, Grayscale took the rejection of its GBTC conversion application a step further by going to court. After several months of legal tussle, a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit handed Grayscale a win against the SEC.\n\nThis was pivotal for the crypto industry, especially as the court further mandated the regulator to reconsider its decision over Grayscale\u2019s application. There had been several postponement of a spot Bitcoin ETF decision from the United States SEC but in less than six months of receiving this mandate from the court, the SEC greenlighted eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Impact\n\nNow the race is for Ethereum ETFs and the SEC seems to be taking its time to reach a decision. Based on a 45-day extension granted earlier, the regulator\u2019s decision on Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s ETF is expected within the next two days. Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which aims to incorporate spot Ethereum and futures contracts into its portfolio has had its decision postponed earlier.\n\nSimilarly, the SEC has announced a 45-day extension for Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF, pushing the decision on the product to March 5, 2024. As the broad market awaits the decision of the regulator, there are certain forecasts that ETH will reach as high as $4,800 when an approval is eventually given.\n\nConsidering how Bitcoin has reacted to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, there is no guarantee that it would be any different for Ethereum but the prospects remains high for approval for now."

This alignment signals a bullish sentiment in the market.\n\nHowever, caution is warranted as elevated funding rates can indicate an overheated state in the perpetual markets, potentially foreshadowing a looming long-squeeze event.\n\nFollowing a recent short-term correction, a notable development has emerged with a major decline in funding rates.\n\nThe on-chain intelligence platform said the decline not only signifies that the overall sentiment remains bullish but also points to a cooling-off in the perpetual markets from their previously overheated state.\n\nThis shift in sentiment sets the stage for a potential resurgence in Ethereum\u2019s price, with the market undergoing a corrective phase.\n\nSuch a trend also suggests a moderation in aggressive trading, providing an opportunity for the market to stabilize before potentially resuming its upward trajectory.\n\n\u201cConsequently, there exists the potential for the price to resume its upward trajectory following the completion of the ongoing correction stage.\u201d"

There were 10 or 11 that went live at the same time that brought a certain amount of competition. You\u2019ve seen some competition that investors benefited from lower fees.\u201d\n\nThere are varying levels of confidence among crypto experts regarding the approval of spot ether ETFs, with some speculating that an approval could come sometime in May. Shortly after Gensler\u2019s comments, the SEC revealed that it had delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to March.\n\nSeveral prominent firms, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have already submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\n\n\nOn January 10, the agency greenlit the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that followed a D.C. court\u2019s decision by three judges. However, the court ruled that the SEC needed to re-examine a bid related to Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Legal Disputes\n\n\n\nThe SEC is currently entangled in legal battles with crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\n\nGensler, when asked about his thoughts on the current cases, reiterated that noncompliant crypto companies were not \u201cnecessarily\u201d providing appropriate disclosures.\n\n\u201cBut stepping back from any one case, I just think that the investing public, if they\u2019re interested in investing in crypto securities, they should be aware and careful that these crypto security tokens are not necessarily giving them the appropriate disclosures and they\u2019re not getting those disclosures from these non compliant token operators,\u201d Gensler said."

They also noted skepticism about the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity as early as May.\n\nAs the SEC continues to deliberate on spot Ethereum ETFs, market participants eagerly await clues from the regulatory body in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Terrett, the SEC\u2019s handling of S-1 filings will likely provide insights into the agency\u2019s stance. The ball remains firmly in the SEC\u2019s court, and the crypto community keenly watches how things unfold."

Immediately, cryptocurrency enthusiasts went to social media to blast the commission, signaling a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.

Despite a slippery slope, BTC has managed to reclaim the $40,000 psychological level after a range low of $38,555. BTC holders remain in murky waters until such a time when the price breaks and closes above the $40,726 support on the three-day timeframe.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicators remain in positive territory above their respective mean lines, inspiring hope for a possible move north.\n\nIf the bulls have their way, a decisive move above $40,726 would set the pace for Bitcoin price to breach $43,750, or in highly bullish cases, reclaim the $48,000 level. Overly ambitious outcomes could send BTC past the $50,000 psychological level, last tested in December 2021.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 50 and still southbound, Bitcoin price could extend the fall, potentially slipping past the $37,800 support.

This level is critical for Ether market value, as it continues to hold Ether afloat after a prolonged consolidation since December 3.\n\nIt therefore marks a possible inflection point or another measure of quicksand to invalidate the prevailing bullish outlook.\n\nThe odds support the bearish thesis, suggesting the drop could come as the RSI is showing falling momentum as the MACD is subdued and moving in tandem with the signal line (orange band). The AO histogram bar is flashing red but still in positive territory, reinforcing the assumption that $2,135 will be critical in determining the next directional bias.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nIf the $2,135 support holds, the Ethereum price could bounce, with the potential to overcome resistance due to the midline of the channel as it targets the $2,800 level, 25% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs likely to get better deal than their Bitcoin counterparts\n\nRipple price likely to bounce from here\n\nRipple (XRP) price looks ready for recovery after a second retest of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.4927 and $0.5111. The RSI has tagged 30, suggesting XRP is oversold and a bullish correction may be due. A reentry by the bulls could see the Ripple price reclaim the support offered above $0.5442. In a highly ambitious case, XRP could extend the gains to the $0.5784 level. Beyond this, the next logical target for the XRP price could be the $0.6000 psychological level, standing around 16% above current levels.\n\n\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if the XRP price extends the fall below the midline of the FVG at $0.5029, the load-shedding exercise could extend with Ripple price likely to revisit the $0.4746 support, around 8% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could gain nearly 12% as on-chain metrics signal recovery"

Paired with other substantial Ethereum movements, these transactions highlight Celsius\u2019s proactive approach in addressing financial challenges.\n\nThe $35 Million Ethereum Sell-Off\n\nReports from Arkham Intelligence shed light on Celsius\u2019s extensive Ethereum sales, totaling over $125 million from January 8 to January 12. This strategic move aligns with the platform\u2019s commitment to liquidating assets to meet financial obligations and fulfill creditor demands.\n\nSimultaneously, Dune Analytics identified a noteworthy trend of Ethereum redemptions, surpassing $1.6 billion during the same period. This surge in redemption activity, the highest since last year\u2019s Shanghai update, indicates a substantial shift in Ethereum market dynamics.\n\nDespite facing financial constraints from court proceedings, Celsius still maintains a significant Ethereum reserve. Two staking wallets belonging to Celsius currently hold over 557,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.3 billion. This reserve complicates the matter further for Celcius.\n\nThe Ethereum Market Reacts\n\nIn an effort to satisfy creditors during bankruptcy proceedings, Celsius is auctioning its Ethereum holdings, leading to a 4% dip in Ethereum\u2019s value. Analysts express concern over breaching the $2,350 threshold, a crucial point within the demand zone of $2,380 to $2,461.\n\nAnalysts anticipate a potential descent to $2,000 or lower should this level be breached.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval Is Next \u2013 With 50% Chances\n\nWhales at Play\n\nSantiment\u2019s historical data introduces the intriguing concept of \u201cwhales,\u201d significant players capable of triggering profit-taking activities. While this often results in market dips, decreasing funding rates suggest underlying optimism. This subtle shift hints at a possible cooldown in perpetually overheated markets, offering hope for Ethereum\u2019s resurgence once selling pressures subside."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Crash 2024 Happening Now? Or Is Ethereum \u2018Simply\u2019 Retracing? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "The short answer: we are not concerned about an Ethereum price crash, for many reasons. However, the panic that is being created for Ethereum\u2019s retracement might make you think otherwise. As always, we prefer to let the data speak, first and foremost the charts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s topping pattern was too obvious\n\nWe explained that is not the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, contrary to what many make you believe. Consequently, this is not the end of Ethereum\u2019s bull market and there should be no Ethereum price crash.\n\nIt was so clear that a breakdown in Bitcoin would occur, it was too obvious.\n\nBut a pullback and a price crash are two completely different things.\n\nWe predicted, mid-December, in our premium service, and recommended members in our crypto investing research service to take profits. We called for a choppy January, that\u2019s what we got.\n\nFrom our premium crypto alert sent on Dec 21st, 2023, \u2018How To Spend Cash Realized From Free Tokens? Hint: The Mega Opportunities Of 2024!\u2018 (available for anyone after signing up here):\n\nShort term, it is blatantly clear that we are hitting a big resistance area. Like with any resistance area that has its roots many years back in time, the local top requires time to complete. In the end, if anything, the market would like to keep this bull market hidden. BTC has to come down a bit, it might be 34.5k or a little higher where it will find support. It might be a slow process, choppy, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nIt\u2019s not a crash. It is a buy opportunity.\n\nIn that same premium research alert, mentioned before, we wrote the following:\n\nMuch more important is the following: the big, huge, giant profits will be made in tokens that nobody is talking about. We see tremendous reversals. We cannot believe what we start seeing on the charts: it\u2019s going to be huge, mark our words. But a minority will hit those multi-baggers. Why? Because the market will follow a different script, a very different script. The point is that the market never follows the same path, every cycle is different. The majority of investors will be looking for a replay of 2020/2021, we are telling you \u2018it won\u2019t happen like 2 years ago\u2019, it will happen in a very different way.\n\nIndeed, the concept of the HIDDEN BULL MARKET is one we have covered extensively in our research service. Interestingly, we explained it even on our public blog: Crypto\u2019s bull market 2024 is an hidden bull market.\n\nHidden bull market? What about Ethereum\u2019s price crash?\n\nThe one and only way to neutralize these loaded topics, like the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market and the so-called Ethereum price crash, is to look at the data. Charts are data. They may be read differently, but it\u2019s data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price chart, shown below, shows a rising channel.\n\nA rising channel is an uptrend.\n\nAn Ethereum price crash would occur in a downtrend. The direction of the channel would point down, the color of the channel would be red.\n\nWe have the exact opposite in place now.\n\nDownside targets of Ethereum\u2019s retracement? We see $2100.56 and $1849.01 as candidates, in that order. We think in terms of closing prices, so we cannot exclude a scenario in which Ethereum dips, intraday, to $1849 only to close that same day around $2100. This is the world of crypto, volatile are normal.\n\nMore evidence: no Ethereum price crash\n\nWe have been shouting from the roof: crypto in 2024 will come with a HIDDEN BULL MARKET. We also have been calling for a bi-furcated alt season 2024.\n\nHardly anyone is talking about this, but finally there is this one social media post that suggests there is another analyst on this planet that shares our expectations:\n\nWith the #Bitcoin ETF becoming a classic sell-the-news event, we explore the market\u2019s risk appetite for tokens further out on the risk curve. There are some indicators alluding to #Ethereum outperformance, as well as interesting divergences in altcoin price action relative to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/r2P897hmVd \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) January 23, 2024\n\nBuying Ethereum? Sentiment is negative, selling makes more sense.\n\nThat\u2019s the sentiment when price is dropping, indeed.\n\nYou need a lot of courage to be contrarian. When prices are dropping, they can continue to drop. A contrarian call can be disastrous if you don\u2019t have a decent price analysis methodology in place as an analyst.\n\nAt InvestingHaven, we are convinced there will be no Ethereum price crash in the coming months, certainly not in the coming 3 months.\n\nHow can we know?\n\nBecause there is no secular bearish turning point in our cycle analysis.\n\nAnalyzing charts, analyzing Ethereum, analyzing any other market or stock requires price analysis combined with time analysis. Both, combined, make a price analysis methodology complete.\n\nWhile we can always be wrong, we simply have not detected a secular bearish turning point that suggests a crash is underway in the short term, not in Bitcoin nor in Ethereum.\n\nYou may want to consider receiving our premium research notes because all the points we made in this article were shared a month ago in our research service.

        "title": "ClayStack to Launch Ethereum Restaking and Offer Reward Points Redeemable for Clay Tokens - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "Users restaking Ethereum will get points that they can exchange for Clay tokens when the native tokens officially launch.\n\nCrypto staking platform ClayStack has announced it will support Ethereum (ETH) restaking via ETH native protocol EigenLayer. The platform has also announced it will give users rewards comprising Clay points and EigenLayer points.\n\nClayStack Restaking Ethereum\n\nAs part of the new offering, ClayStack will change its ETH liquid staking token known as csETH, to a liquid restaking asset. At the moment, users can only use ETH for direct restaking on EigenLayer. However, ClayStack CEO and founder Mohak Agarwal said the plan is to provide support for Rocket Pool Ether (rETH) and Lido staked Ether (stETH) very soon.\n\nEigenLayer launched in June 2023 and has significantly driven Ethereum staking since then. By November, the protocol had processed 170,000 ETH in staking. As of Tuesday, the total value locked (TVL) on EigenLayer is $1.7 billion.\n\nRestaking is a process that uses liquid staking tokens and staked Ether to improve earnings across multiple platforms. It combines traditional staking, which locks tokens to generate rewards, and liquid staking, which also creates rewards but by using liquid tokens as representations of locked assets.\n\nClayStack started liquid staking for the MATIC token in 2022. It then launched ETH liquid staking in September 2023, and is now focusing on ETH staking. On moving on from Polygon, CEO Agarwal said:\n\n\u201cDue to shrinking yield and the limited DeFi ecosystem on Polygon outside major ones like Compound and Aave (which delisted the majority of the less traded or volatile assets), it became very difficult to build more utility on Polygon liquid staking.\u201d\n\nReward Points\n\nClayStack has plans to launch its network token and is offering early users of its ETH staking service the opportunity to earn. According to the platform, restakers who earn clay points can redeem them 1:1 for clay tokens. Agarwal pointed out that \u201cthere is no other points system currently that offers 1:1 redemption. You can own 1 million points in other programs and you could end up getting 100 tokens.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to allocate 20 clay points per ETH each week. While the rate may change weekly, users have no minimum or maximum points to maintain. Nonetheless, ClayStack will maintain a cap on points that all users can get. This cap will refresh weekly.\n\nIn addition to Clay points, users will also get EigenLayer restaked points. Agarwal said:\n\n\u201cWhen ClayStack natively restakes the ETH on \u00c9igenLayer, ClayStack\u2019s smart contract ends up accruing those points. We don\u2019t know what they will be redeemable to; we will just pass along those points to csETH holders, considering so much excitement amongst users for EigenLayer points.\u201d\n\nLast November, non-custodial staking services provider Stakin announced a partnership with ClayStack. The collaboration between both providers offers users a new staking experience without compromising security and resilience. Users will also enjoy more control over their staked assets.\n\nIn 2021, ClayStack received $5.2 million in seed funds from several investors, including Solana Foundation and Coinbase Ventures. ParaFi Capital and CoinFund led the seed round."

On September 7, 2023, Ark Invest became the first to file for a spot Ether ETF in the United States. The fund was initially aimed at expanding its portfolio of crypto products, at a time when the market was increasingly becoming confident of a Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the ARK Invest COO said the discussions with the SEC gives confidence of the possibility of an ETH ETF approval, both from legal principle and implementation standpoint. Compared to the timeline in the lead up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the case for Ethereum ETF approval has changed philosophically, operationally and also legally, he explained.\n\nAccumulation Continues\n\nMeanwhile, ARK Invest chief executive officer Cathie Wood said a majority of the investment community are underestimating Bitcoin, in the context of the top cryptocurrency dropping below the $40,000 mark. Showing confidence in a potential turnaround in the prospects of crypto market, the Cathie Wood firm increased its holdings in Ark 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, offloading ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO).\n\nAlso Read: Terra Classic L1TF Core Security Upgrade Proposal Up For Vote, LUNC Price Soars 8%"

        "content": "Wed 24 Jan 2024 \u25aa 6 min of reading \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nThe price of Ethereum has entered a correction phase since reaching $2,700. Let\u2019s examine the future outlook for ETH together.\n\nSituation of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nAs noted in the analysis of January 11, Ethereum marked a new high. It reached $2,700 before starting a downward movement. Ethereum plunged below the 38.2 % Fibonacci retracement level (taken from the ATH) before dropping just above its daily support at $2,150. Ethereum\u2019s medium and long-term trend remains bullish. However, the breach of this support could jeopardize the short-term trend of the token. At the time of writing, one Ether is trading around $2,200. These recent bearish movements have brought its price below the 50-day moving average. This development suggests the possibility of a trend reversal, thereby calling for increased vigilance from investors.\n\nRegarding the oscillators, they are currently below the midline, which could suggest that Ethereum is currently in an oversold state. From an optimistic angle, this could indicate that it is undervalued. However, adopting a more pessimistic view, it could be interpreted as a sign that the cryptocurrency\u2019s momentum is turning bearish. Note that the existence of a divergence between the price of Ethereum and its oscillators could reinforce this assumption.\n\nDaily ETH/USD Chart\n\nThe current technical analysis was carried out in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and trader passionate about the cryptocurrency market. Now a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. Here you will find Live sessions, educational content, and peer assistance around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nFocus on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest for Ethereum has experienced a notable decline of nearly 15% since Monday, January 22. This decrease represents a withdrawal of over $700 million in ETH/USDT perpetual contracts. Out of these withdrawals, more than $60 million were executed forcibly. Although these amounts may seem significant, their impact on the market requires a more nuanced analysis. When compared to the price evolution of ETH relative to its open interest, it becomes apparent that the latter maintains relative stability compared to the ETH price itself. This observation could indicate that entry and exit of traders in the market are not particularly high, or that new traders are entering the market at the same rate as others leave. Thus, this situation opens the door to various interpretations, such as a period of indecision in the market, possible accumulation of orders, etc.\n\nETHUSD Open Interest\n\nThe Ethereum liquidations heat map shows that the cryptocurrency has recently reached an important liquidation zone, situated between $2,200 and $2,150. At present, the price appears to be stabilizing in this area, indicating a period of uncertainty among investors. If the price cannot maintain itself above this last level, the next significant liquidation zone below its price is around $2,000. Above the current price, the $2,500 zone is also worth monitoring. The approach of the price towards these levels could lead to a massive triggering of orders, thus increasing the possibility of a period of heightened volatility on Ethereum. These zones are therefore crucial points of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum\u2019s Price (ETH)\n\nIf the price of Ethereum maintains above the $2,200 \u2013 $2,100 levels, we could anticipate a bullish continuation up to the $2,400 level. The next resistance to consider, should the bullish movement continue, would be the last peak, namely $2,700 and higher if this level is breached. At this stage, that would represent an increase of over +25%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to maintain itself above the $2,200 \u2013 $2,100 levels, we might expect a return to $2,000. The next support to consider, should the bearish movement continue, would be around the levels of $1,900. At this stage, that would represent a drop of nearly -13%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter marking a new high, Ethereum has initiated a correctional phase, leading it towards its former daily resistance. Could this decline be due to the delay in the decision on the Ethereum spot ETFs? What is certain is that it will be crucial to closely observe the price\u2019s reaction to the various key levels to confirm or refute the current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant of potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that the price of cryptocurrencies can also quickly evolve based on other, more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum price faces immense bottlenecks amid a sustained drop from its 2024 peak at $2,715 to slightly above $2,200. The sell-off impacting the performance of ETH over the last couple of weeks stems from the downturn that swiftly followed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nWhile many altcoins and even Bitcoin crumbled under the weight of post-ETF approval blues, Ethereum price stood defiant, briefly basking in the warm glow of investor optimism. But even its flame couldn\u2019t withstand the icy grip of the relentless market malaise.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNow, the king of smart contracts teeters precariously, its crown at risk of slipping below the $2,000 mark.\n\nIs this a good time to buy Ethereum price dips?\n\nThe path of least resistance is majorly inclined downwards, reinforced by a vivid sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nAccording to the daily chart, most traders and speculators missed a negative Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergence from ETH price possibly due to optimism around the ETF.\n\nWith the RSI neutral but falling below 40, an immediate recovery could be a pipe dream. Therefore, it could be prudent for traders to be ready to dollar-cost average (DCA) while anticipating a rebound.\n\nRecommended: Which Top Altcoin To Buy For The Bull Run Today: LINK, SHIB, LUNC?\n\nFibonacci levels reveal that the trend reversal might continue slightly below $2,000 but precisely at $1,980, as highlighted by the 0.618 retracement ratio.\n\nFor such an outcome, Ethereum price will have to flip the highly contested $2,200 level into a resistance as well as the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (purple) at $2,016.\n\nHolding above $2,200, on the other hand, could usher in another bullish era, where bulls push for an upswing beyond the January peak of $2,715 and aim for highs above $3,000.\n\nSeveral crypto analysts like @Gotzeuus agree with the short-term bearish outlook, suggesting that Ethereum price will dive to sweep the $2,067 low. If this level holds, a rebound could ensue.\n\nThe analyst warned on X that Ethereum and altcoins could take a beating from Bitcoin price action, implying that this might not be the time to \u201coverexpose\u201d the crypto portfolio to altcoins.\n\n$ETH update There is high change we go to take 2067 low if we don't hold here, so patience ETH/BTC also looking ready for a pullback after 0.061 bearish retest, therefore expect ETH and alts to suffer from BTC price action Not the days to overexpose yourself in conclusion https://t.co/5Cjqz0DGis pic.twitter.com/mSiLtzrwYD \u2014 Gotzeuus (@Gotzeuus) January 23, 2024\n\nFor now, the best advice could be to exercise patience and avoid rushed decisions. Letting the doldrums settle will provide a clear trajectory Ethereum will likely follow.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "In anticipation of the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, Hester Peirce, a Commissioner with the US SEC, reiterated that the regulator has learned from its past mistakes, signaling the products\u2019 emergence may be smoother.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs to trade in the US. Behind this celebrated milestone was more than ten years of pursuit of the investment product, with the regulator notably rejecting several applications from many asset managers.\n\nRiding on this history, many in the industry are now speculating on whether Ethereum spot ETF might suffer the same fate as Bitcoin.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPer Hester Peirce\u2019s position, the delays recorded in the approval process for crypto ETFs are long gone, and the commission will approach Ethereum ETFs with a different strategy.\n\nSEC Has Learned from Its Mistake\n\nOne of the major turning points for the market regulator in granting approvals for the spot Bitcoin ETF product was the defeat in the Court case against Grayscale Investments.\n\nThe asset manager sued the regulator when it initially denied its request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a full-fledged spot ETF.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of Grayscale and ordered the commission to review the applications. When asked by Coinage media\u2019s Zac Guzman whether a court case might be required before the commission approves a spot Ethereum ETF, Hester Peirce responded:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to do our approvals \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nWith Bitcoin ETF approval setting a precedent, it might only be a matter of time before Ethereum and even XRP ETF start trading in US markets.\n\nDissenting Views on Potential Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite the filings for several spot Ethereum ETF products, with the US SEC in the queue for decision, there is a diverse opinion on whether the product will be approved or not.\n\nFox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett highlighted these discrepancies, clearly pointing out how a spot Bitcoin ETF issuer expressed confidence that spot Ethereum ETF will see the light of day.\n\nShe also noted that sources at the SEC confirmed that based on the current disposition of the regulator, Ethereum ETFs are a \u201chard no\u201d based on internal resistance to the idea for now.\n\nHowever, with the presence of BlackRock in the race once again and the firm\u2019s track record of securing approvals, Ethereum ETFs might also be close to being approved."

This decline has been linked to substantial Bitcoin sales, notably influenced by the Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin ETF, fueling concerns about a possible further descent to the $38,000 level.\n\nBitcoin has fallen about 20% since the Jan. 11 launch of the first ETFs funds investing directly in the token https://t.co/3jGyNKrvfT \u2014 Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 23, 2024\n\nConcurrently, Ethereum, another major player in the crypto arena, is grappling with its own bearish momentum, having fallen to $2,347, marking a significant 24-hour drop of nearly 3%.\n\nThese movements come amidst a broader market context where Bitcoin has seen over a 20% decline since the launch of the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\n#BTC looks ready for bounce imo\ud83d\udc40 I\u2019m expecting bounce from here cause most important liquidity levels got hit last night \ud83d\udcaf In most worst case we can see $37K-$38K, hope this will not happen..

This correction not only rattled holders but also posed challenges for BTC miners.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, miners faced financial struggles with transaction fees hitting their lowest since June 2022. The pressure on miners may lead to selling, adding downward momentum to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin's average transaction fee hits $6.85, surging 35.5% from yesterday & a massive 448% YOY.

However, this could impact short-term market dynamics and potentially concentrate BTC ownership.\n\nChanges in address numbers and the long/short ratio hint at evolving market sentiment, while increased network activity offers stability.\n\nConsequently, this news of Bitcoin\u2019s dip below $40,000 pressures miners with low transaction fees, potentially deepening the price decline amid institutional accumulation.\n\nGoogle Bard\u2019s Forecast: Bitcoin\u2019s Potential Slide to $35,000 in Current Market\n\n\n\nInsights from Google\u2019s AI, Google Bard, suggest Bitcoin could further decline to $35,000, influenced by inflation, interest rates, and regulatory factors.\n\nHowever, potential uplifts from block reward halving, rising demand, institutional adoption, and positive developments may facilitate recovery.\n\n#Bitcoin: Google Bard forecasts a critical juncture for Bitcoin: Regulatory headwinds and macro pressures could push prices below $38K, while the April halving and institutional adoption may reignite the climb. #BitcoinPrediction #GoogleBardForecast #CryptoEconomy #BitcoinHalving pic.twitter.com/33WpZ4VDJk \u2014 Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) January 23, 2024\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s current position just under $39,000, Google Bard indicates a possible stagnation with prices oscillating between $35,000 and $45,000 as market forces collide.\n\nAmidst these fluctuations, investors are advised to proceed with caution.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds faces uncertainty as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exhibits resistance. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett sheds light on diverse expectations surrounding the SEC\u2019s stance, revealing potential challenges and conflicting opinions.\n\nSEC\u2019s Current Position\n\nTerrett reports a \u201chard no\u201d from sources within the SEC, signaling \u201csome internal resistance\u201d to approving spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn her tweet, Terrett also mentions SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-cryptocurrency stance, who has been advocating for a more straightforward decision process. Pierce criticized the reliance on legal victories to guide ETF approvals.\n\nDespite SEC resistance, Terrett highlights optimism among asset managers like BlackRock, whose track record of getting ETFs approved has raised hopes of getting Ethereum ETFs approved by summer this year. Blackrock expresses confidence, citing the smooth launch of Bitcoin spots as a potential catalyst for Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nTerrett anticipates further insights into the SEC\u2019s stance in the coming months, mainly through engagements with S-1 registration forms.\n\nVarying Expectations\n\nExpectations on spot Ethereum ETF are varying. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggests a 70% chance of approval in May, while JP Morgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou is less optimistic, predicting a 50% chance.\n\nJP Morgan Analysts\u2019 Cautious Stance\n\nJP Morgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, remain cautious, estimating the likelihood of approval to be no higher than 50%. Regulatory and judicial considerations and uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification as a commodity or security contribute to their skepticism.\n\nUpcoming Developments\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent delay in deciding on Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF until March 5, 2024, extends the evaluation period. The final decision on Spot Ethereum ETFs is expected between late January and August 2024.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs remains clouded in uncertainty, with conflicting signals from the SEC, varying expectations from expert figures, and ongoing regulatory uncertainties."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its review period for considering a proposed rule change to list the iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF, designating March 10, 2024 as the new deadline for taking action, according to today\u2019s filing.\n\nOriginally filed by The Nasdaq Stock Market on November 21, 2023, the proposal aims to provide direct exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price movements under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) for Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\n\nThe SEC extended the original 45-day review period, which would have ended on January 25, 2024, stating it required more time to thoroughly consider the proposal and related issues around a spot Ethereum ETF product.\n\nOriginally published for comment on December 11, 2023, the proposed rule change has received no public comments so far. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the longer review period indicates a cautious approach by the SEC towards crypto-based ETFs amid an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has been at the forefront of integrating digital assets into traditional investment vehicles. However, the SEC\u2019s hesitancy reflects ongoing concerns over the volatility, security, and regulatory compliance of crypto products.\n\nInvestors and industry experts are closely watching the SEC\u2019s moves, as approval of such an ETF would mark a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. The extended review period suggests that the SEC is taking a thorough approach to ensure that any potential risks associated with the iShares Ethereum Trust are mitigated."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe landscape of crypto is dynamic, with new entrants regularly capturing attention. This week, three distinct players\u2014Meme Moguls (MLGS), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Stellar (XLM)\u2014take center stage. While each has forged its path in the crypto sphere, the question arises: which emerges as the best?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) on a Bullish Run \u2013 What Could Be the Driving Force?\n\nBorn from the original Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has garnered appreciation for its stability and commitment to the initial Ethereum vision. Its decentralized platform, designed for smart contracts and DApps, continues to attract developers.\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s endorsement of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF on January 10th, Ethereum Classic has witnessed a remarkable surge, presently maintaining a trading value of approximately $26.\n\nThis upswing reflects a significant boost in confidence, hinting at the possibility of additional gains in the near future. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ethereum Classic price was 34.79% over the past week.\n\nStellar (XLM) Hit With High Volatility, Decreases 12% in a Week\n\nStellar XLM, renowned for its efficient cross-border payment solutions, has experienced a notable decline in its market performance. The token recently reached an all-time high of $0.13 but has now retreated to $0.1162, reflecting a 12% drop in the past week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commencement of 2024 witnessed Stellar\u2019s impressive price surge, but the recent downturn underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts had anticipated a modest decrease in Stellar\u2019s value, signalling mixed sentiments and a challenging landscape for the token moving forward.\n\nDespite this, Stellar\u2019s recent mainnet upgrade, coupled with excitement surrounding its potential impact on the token\u2019s value has continued to drive enthusiasm amongst many.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) Emerges As the Next Meme World Contender\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) stands out as a strong contender in the meme coin market, departing from the typical reliance on internet trends associated with meme coins. What distinguishes Meme Moguls is its introduction of a play-to-earn game, providing users with entertainment and educational value in the realm while earning $MGLS tokens.\n\nIn contrast to other meme coins, Meme Moguls incorporates a variety of features, including interactive gameplay modes, community tournaments, an NFT marketplace, and ambitious plans for a metaverse. This multifaceted approach positions Meme Moguls as the best cryptocurrency.\n\nMoreover, the focus on practical utility with $MGLS serving as both an in-game currency and a governance token adds a layer of legitimacy, setting Meme Moguls apart from meme coins driven solely by hype. The $MGLS token is gaining traction. It is currently priced at $0.0036 per token in its stage 5 presale, with limited units available before another anticipated price surge.\n\nIn summary, Meme Moguls\u2019 innovative features and real-world earning potential indicate its potential as a significant contender in challenging the top position within the meme coin space.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "content": "Coinbase Begins Technical Assessment to Onboard New Ethereum Execution Client for Diversity\n\nDigital asset exchange Coinbase has revealed its effort toward Ethereum execution client diversity after users complained about the platform\u2019s overreliance on Go.Ethereum (Geth).\n\nIn a Jan 23 X (formerly Twitter) post, Coinbase quelled community concerns about the dominance of Geth as the only execution layer on the platform noting that plans were in motion for more giving reasons for the status quo.\n\n1/ Execution client diversity on Ethereum is a critical concern for all of us at Coinbase. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing about it. \u2193 \u2014 Coinbase Cloud \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcde (@CoinbaseCloud) January 23, 2024\n\nAccording to the post, diversity concerns on the exchange are a serious problem for both users and the team. Consequently, Coinbase has taken steps to move away from complete dependence on Go.ethereum.\n\nIt was revealed that launching the staking feature on the platform Geth was the only execution client that met the requirements of the exchange.\n\n\u201cCoinbase Cloud prioritizes the security of customer assets, and the underlying blockchain, above all else. When launching Ethereum staking and evaluating execution layer clients to maximize these traits, Geth was the only client that met our technical requirements.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, two years before the staking feature was rolled out, Coinbase Cloud and other network operators came to the exact conclusion that has led to the dominance of Geth.\n\nPresently 84% of Ethereum validators operate on Geth but alternative solutions are being developed and scaled up with the possibility of network integration in the future.\n\nThe exchange added that it has a record of taking client diversity seriously to improve users\u2019 overall experience. Coinbase also added that it would perform the latest assessments and conclusions towards the next step in this direction, which will be revealed in February.\n\nCoinbase user flags Geth dominance\n\n\n\nThis recent controversy was sparked with a post on X when a user complained of the risk Geth\u2019s dominance poses to the system. The user specifically stressed that he could lose his assets in the event of a bug.\n\n\u201cand in the event of an unforeseen geth consensus bug in the meantime, I could stand to lose a large percentage of my deposit. today, I\u2019ve decided that this is not worth the risk.\u201d\n\ndear @coinbase today, i unstaked all of the ETH i had staked with you since the first day you offered it as a service. i kept it there to earn passive yield, but also to support your work for the crypto industry (which i greatly value) but i can't ignore the risks of what\u2026 \u2014 DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) January 22, 2024\n\nBrain Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase noted that he would take a look into the incident spurring the comprehensive response.\n\nAddressing previous concerns\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the exchange addressed similar concerns of client diversity of eth2 regarding validators\u2019 dependence on Prysm. Coinbase noted that securing user assets was paramount to the network and decided to start with Prysm because it was the viable option.\n\n\u201cRemote signers allow validators to generate and store keys in isolated environments instead of keeping them on the validator itself, which greatly increases the security of the eth2 validators on Coinbase.\u201d\n\nA conclusion was drawn to secure onboard Lighthouse remote signers giving users and partners more options."

The token registered a double-digit price drop in the last seven days, and the latest dataset suggested that the ETH price could touch $2,100 soon.\n\nIs confidence in Ethereum dwindling?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price witnessed a massive price correction last week, as its value dropped by more than 13%.\n\nIn the last 24 hours alone, its value sank by over 5%. This pushed the token\u2019s price under $2,300. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,224.49 with a market capitalization of over $267 billion.\n\nCaleb Franzen, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting the reason behind this price plummet. As per the tweet, ETH failed to test a pattern, resulting in the price drop.\n\nThe downtrend hinted that the king of altcoins\u2019 price might touch $2,135 in the days to follow.\n\nEthereum $ETH analysis: \u2022 Failed base breakout\n\n\u2022 Failed megaphone breakout When bullish structure fails to produce bullish outcomes, that's bearish.

This clearly indicated that selling pressure on the token was high.\n\nHistorically, whenever Celsius has sold ETH, most of the time the token\u2019s price has declined soon after the transaction.\n\nWhat to expect from Ethereum\n\nSince Celsius deposited a substantial number of ETH, AMBCrypto checked ETH\u2019s on-chain metrics. Our analysis revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven-day average, indicating high selling pressure.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we found that investors were still holding their ETH. This was evident from the fact that Ethereum\u2019s supply outside of exchanges remained considerably higher than its supply on exchanges.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges was 10.51 million, while its supply outside of exchanges stood at over 121.7 million.\n\nSince investors were willing to hold their assets, we checked ETH\u2019s daily chart to see if there were any chances of a recovery in the short term.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe analysis revealed that Ethereum\u2019s price touched the lower limit of Bollinger bands, which indicated a possible price rebound.\n\nAdditionally, its Money Flow Index (MFI) was also headed towards the oversold zone. If it enters that zone, buying pressure on ETH might increase."

Discover SCENE\n\nWhistleblower turned international fugitive Edward Snowden today backed and endorsed the legal defense fund for the Tornado Cash founder.\n\nIn a Tuesday post on Twitter, the exiled former CIA contractor asked followers to pitch in to help Roman Storm, co-founder of the once popular but fatally sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing service.\n\nYesterday, Storm said on Twitter that he would launch a campaign\u2014in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\u2014to raise money for a lawyer. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Storm and charged him with money laundering for his part in the creation of Tornado Cash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTornado Cash was a popular cryptocurrency coin mixing application that allowed users to anonymously send and receive Ethereum, the second largest digital asset by market cap.\n\nBut the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022 banned Americans from using the service, claiming that criminals had used it to launder dirty money.\n\nThey then alleged that Storm and his colleague Roman Semenov laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Developer Alex Pertsev was also arrested.\n\nBut the new fundraiser\u2019s website argues that \u201cthe arrests of Roman Storm and Alex Pertsev are considered a direct attack on the open-source development space and may have devastating consequences for developers who write and publish code.\u201d\n\nIf you can help, please help.

The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap is pseudonymous: a user\u2019s identity isn\u2019t recorded on the blockchain but every single transaction is.\n\nAuthorities are, therefore, able to track down people who send and receive the digital coin if necessary.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH) whale has recently executed a series of transactions, carrying out a considerable movement of funds across various platforms. The blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain initially brought to light this activity, involving roughly $46.02 million in ETH tokens.\n\nDeciphering The Whale\u2019s $46M ETH Transfer Across Major Platforms\n\nThe whale, operating through a network of eight wallets, initiated the withdrawal of these funds from major exchanges, Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nThe complexity of these transactions did not end there. Following the withdrawals at an average price of around $2,419 per ETH, the whale engaged with Lido, a prominent liquid staking solution.\n\nThis move involved withdrawing 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a well-known decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, and exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, amounting to $46.02 million. Spot On Chain also revealed that three wallets still hold about 30 million USDT in Aave.\n\nOver the past 2 days, an entity with 8 wallets withdrew $46.02M in $ETH from #Binance and #Bitfinex at ~$2,419, then staked with #Lido: \u2013 5 wallets withdrew 50.15M $USDT from #Aave to CEX for 19,021 $ETH ($46.02M). \u2013 3 wallets still hold ~30M $USDT in #Aave and may deposit it\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqPYTTaWjT \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 23, 2024\n\nThis lingering balance has sparked curiosity as it might indicate that these funds might soon be deployed into a centralized exchange (CEX) for further acquisition of Ethereum.\n\nThe context of these whale movements is particularly crucial, considering the current market conditions Ethereum is experiencing. Over the last 24 hours, Ethereum\u2019s price has dropped by 7.7% to trade at $2,211.\n\nThis bearish trend is not isolated, as the entire crypto market, led by Bitcoin, appears to be in a downturn. Based on the key support zone between $2,380 and $2,461 highlighted by crypto analyst Ali, Ethereum appears to have breached a critical demand zone. This break could lead to a further plunge towards the $2,000 mark, escalating concerns about a bigger correction.\n\nEthereum Plunge: Liquidations Amid Sell-offs\n\nThe Ethereum market has seen a dip in value and a noticeable impact on traders. Data from Coinglass highlights that the recent market conditions have led to significant liquidations. In just 24 hours, over 137,000 traders were liquidated, amounting to $357 million.\n\nEthereum traders bear a significant portion of these total liquidations, with long and short traders suffering $72.82 million and 6.30 million in liquidations, respectively, in the past 24 hours.\n\nInterestingly, these market conditions have coincided with notable actions by Celsius, a crypto lending firm currently navigating financial challenges. Recent on-chain analysis indicated that Celsius has been actively moving large sums of Ethereum, including a 13,000 ETH deposit on Coinbase.\n\nThis aligns with reports from Arkham Intelligence, which noted that Celsius liquidated over $125 million in Ethereum to address its financial obligations. This auction was primarily geared towards paying off creditors, aligning with the firm\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade to Affect ETH Price, Analysts Say - TOKENPOST",
        "content": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade to Affect ETH Price, Analysts Say\n\nThe upcoming Dencun upgrade of the Ethereum network might have repercussions on the supply of ether, as noted by Luke Nolan, a research associate specializing in Ethereum at CoinShares.\n\nLuke Nolan, a research associate specializing in Ethereum at CoinShares, warns that the upcoming Dencun upgrade of the Ethereum network may influence the supply of Ether.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces the blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism, facilitating Layer 2 transactions on the Ethereum network. This change can reduce gas usage, decreasing the amount of Ether burned during transactions.\n\nCurrently, all Esther used for gas base fees in transactions is burned. Nolan explained, \"Layer 2s pay 90% of their gas fees for transactional calldata. With the Dencun upgrade, instead of using calldata, Layer 2s can opt for the new blobspace mechanism, significantly reducing gas costs. This shift could stabilize gas prices at lower levels, resulting in less Ether being burned.\"\n\nImpact on Ether Burn Mechanism\n\nThe anticipated reduction in Ether burned may impact the overall growth of Ether supply. Gas demand on the Ethereum network is a crucial driver of Ether's deflation mechanism through gas burn, potentially reducing the circulating supply of Ether. Nolan emphasized that even with reduced gas prices due to blobspace usage, Ethereum is unlikely to become significantly inflationary.\n\n\"Layer 1 demand is crucial for driving deflation. The Dencun upgrade aims to decrease gas fees for roll-up transactions, attracting users back to the network with lower fees. Increased activity means higher overall gas usage,\" Nolan explained.\n\nAccording to The Block, despite potential changes to the Ether burn mechanism, Nolan highlighted that secondary effects of the Dencun upgrade are likely to be a net positive in the long run. He underscored that Ethereum's goal is to solidify its market share, and any short-term gas fluctuations are overshadowed by the broader objective of enhancing user experience and network activity.\n\nDencun Upgrade Schedule\n\nThe Dencun network upgrade was initiated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, introducing Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including EIP-4844 for the blobspace mechanism. The Sepolia testnet is set to activate the Dencun upgrade by Jan. 30, with the Holesky testnet following on Feb. 7.\n\nAccording to Coin Gape, Nolan indicated that mainnet activation of the Dencun upgrade could occur as early as March this year. However, he cautioned that unforeseen testnet issues could impact the timeline. Ethereum core developers anticipate the mainnet activation to happen at least one month after Holesky, but exact timing remains uncertain due to potential testnet challenges.\n\nPhoto by: Blank/Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "title": "Ethereum Futures Market Cool Off Sets Stage For ETH To Rally: Quant - NewsBTC",
        "content": "An analyst has explained that the latest cooldown in the Ethereum futures market could suggest there is potential for a price rise to resume for ETH.\n\nEthereum Funding Rates Have Seen A Decline Recently\n\nAn analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the ETH funding rates have seen a cooldown from their previously overheated levels. The \u201cfunding rate\u201d refers to the periodic fees that futures contract holders on derivative platforms currently exchange with each other.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are paying a premium to the shorts to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies that most traders share a bullish sentiment right now.\n\nOn the other hand, the under zero indicates that a bearish sentiment is currently dominant in the futures market, as the short traders are overwhelming the longs.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum funding rates over the last few months:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been low in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum funding rates have been mostly positive during the last few months, implying that traders on the futures side of the market have mostly been bullish about the asset.\n\nThe few times that the metric did dip into the negative inside this period didn\u2019t turn out to be anything major, as the indicator only attained low red values and rebounded back inside the green territory without too much wait.\n\nThe chart shows that during some phases of this lasting period of bullish sentiment, the metric attained particularly high values. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that elevated values in funding rates raise concerns about a potential overheated state in the perpetual markets, signaling the possibility of an impending long-squeeze event,\u201d notes the quant.\n\nA \u201csqueeze\u201d is an event in which a sharp swing in the price triggers a large number of liquidations, which in turn feed into this price move, elongating it and causing further liquidations.\n\nWhen such a cascade of liquidations affects the long side of the market (that is, the price move in question is a rapid drawdown), the event is known as a \u201clong squeeze.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the side of the futures market most heavily dominated by traders is likelier to fall prey to a squeeze. Thus, when the funding rates are highly positive, a long squeeze can be more probable.\n\nRecently, though, as Ethereum has gone through its latest correction, so have the funding rates. Although they are still positive, their magnitude may no longer be associated with an overheated market, and the risk of a long squeeze would have thus fallen.\n\n\u201cConsequently, there exists the potential for the price to resume its upward trajectory following the completion of the ongoing correction stage,\u201d explains the analyst.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has declined by around 5% during the past week as its price has now fallen under $2,400.\n\nLooks like the price of the coin has been sliding off recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Celsius Dump Triggers Ethereum Dive: $35 Million Sell-Off Sends ETH Price Crashing - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Celsius Networks, currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, has engaged in significant Ethereum transactions that are causing ripples within the digital currency landscape.\n\nIn the past 10 hours, on-chain analysts at LookonChain detected noteworthy transfers, including a 13,000 ETH deposit ($30 million) on Coinbase and an additional 2,200 ETH ($5 million) on FalconX. These transactions suggest a proactive stance by Celsius in addressing its ongoing financial challenges.\n\nCelsius Sells $125M ETH, Maintains $1.3B Reserve\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Celsius sold more than $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) coins between January 8 and January 12. The primary goal of this auction is to pay off creditors.\n\nDune Analytics also revealed a more widespread pattern of redemptions, with over $1.6 billion of staked Ethereum being redeemed during the same period. Since the Shanghai update last year, the amount of redemptions recorded is the highest.\n\nDespite facing financial constraints imposed by the court, Celsius still holds a substantial Ethereum reserve. This reserve amounts to over 557,000 coins in two staking wallets, with a total valuation of approximately $1.3 billion. The size of this reserve adds a layer of complexity to Celsius\u2019 current financial situation and underscores the evolving narrative within the crypto space.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nAs part of its obligations to creditors, Celsius has been actively liquidating its Ethereum holdings. These auctions, aimed at paying off outstanding debts, are integral to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nThe market has responded to these Ethereum transactions, resulting in a 4% decline in the price of ETH. The cryptocurrency slipped below the $2,350 mark, raising concerns among analysts, especially as ETH now wavers below its crucial demand zone ranging from $2,380 to $2,461.\n\nAnalysts predict that a failure to maintain this level could lead to a potential retreat towards the $2,000 mark.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,307.2 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nWealthy Investors Trigger Ethereum Profit-Taking\n\nSantiment\u2019s historical data reveals that significant transactions by wealthy investors, commonly known as whales, often trigger profit-taking activities among regular ETH holders. This phenomenon intensifies selling pressure and contributes to price declines.\n\nMeanwhile, decreasing funding rates suggest an underlying optimism in the market, hinting at a possible cooldown in previously overheated perpetual markets. This situation leaves room for ETH to rebound once the selling pressure subsides.\n\nAs the bankruptcy drama of Celsius unfolds, the scrutiny on its Ethereum transactions and the resulting market dynamics will persist. Investors and observers are closely monitoring the situation, eagerly awaiting further developments and anticipating the broader implications for both Celsius and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
