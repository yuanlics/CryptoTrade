        "content": "The Ethereum wallet landscape is changing at breakneck speed as it has become more than a simple payment and storage device. There is an all out war to win what futurists see as the browser to Web3 and maybe even the metaverse.\n\nThis new ecosystem can be intimidating for someone who just learned the difference between a seed phrase and a private key. How do you compare Ethereum wallets when their scope of use keeps changing? It is important to know that your wallet of choice will give you the functionality you need to traverse worlds and decentralized applications with ease.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nEthereum wallets are now more than just a banking app without the bank. They have become a place to store digital art, community membership, voting privileges and even online gaming personas.\n\nEthereum wallets are different from wallets only used for non-smart contract blockchains like Bitcoin. They have a signing function that enables users to execute complex smart functions such as depositing liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nThe need to sign multiple transactions can make it difficult to use various wallets for more complex applications such as DEXes and games.\n\nWallets that try to offer a better user experience through browser extensions of mobile apps tend to have more security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis guide will walk you through the basics of evaluating and comparing the best Ethereum wallets on the market. But first, the highlights:\n\nTop Ethereum wallets:\n\nMost Compatible: MetaMask\n\nMost Secure: Ellipal\n\nMost Secure and Compatible: Ledger\n\nMost User-Friendly: Trust Wallet\n\nMost Versatile: Argent\n\nMost Affordable: Coinbase, Meta Mask and Trust Wallet\n\nWhat\u2019s an Ethereum wallet?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is a hardware device or software enabling users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its decentralized applications (dapps) ecosystem. An Ethereum wallet supports sending and receiving ETH and Ethereum-based tokens, including crypto tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThere are three main functions of an Ethereum wallet, with one being more used than the others. These functions include:\n\nAn app: The primary use case for an Ethereum wallet is to help you manage your funds. It provides an interface to transfer assets and use the Ethereum network without much technical knowledge. Your Ethereum account: An Ethereum wallet holds access to a user\u2019s unique addresses on the blockchain and provides an immutable account of their activities on the network. With an Ethereum account, users can build a social identity across different applications such as Twitter, Reddit, and Web3 applications. A login for Ethereum apps: The Ethereum ecosystem includes a variety of dapps built around finance, gaming, predictions, NFTs, and more. An Ethereum wallet provides login access to these applications and allows users to interact with them seamlessly.\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is one of the many types of cryptocurrency wallets. You can learn more about them in our in-depth guide on crypto wallets. Meanwhile, the next section analyzes what to consider when choosing an Ethereum wallet.\n\nWhat to look for in an Ethereum wallet?\n\nWhen choosing an Ethereum wallet, you need to first identify your priorities. Do you plan to use it for investing or storage or as your main interface for Ethereum-based applications? You may need multiple wallets for different purposes. Comparing these features will help you determine the best Ethereum wallet.\n\nSecurity and reputable history: Choose a wallet that integrates advanced security features and boasts a strong reputation within the crypto industry. The wallet seed phrase generation process, PIN options, and recovery process should be highly-secure for even less experienced users.\n\nIt is advisable to choose wallets with no record of a security breach. That way, users can rest assured that the company implements the best security practices and thus maintains a good reputation within the crypto industry.\n\nUser-friendliness : Investors find it helpful to look for wallets with an easy-to-navigate interface. Basic functionalities such as sending, receiving, and swapping crypto tokens should work seamlessly. Additional features such as NFT display, multiple accounts, portfolio tracking, and others should work in an intuitive manner.\n\n: Investors find it helpful to look for wallets with an easy-to-navigate interface.

Additional features such as NFT display, multiple accounts, portfolio tracking, and others should work in an intuitive manner. Broad ecosystem support : If you intend to use the wallet to access Web3 applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and NFT marketplaces, then it is advisable to choose a broadly supported wallet. This way, you can easily connect to these platforms without transferring funds to another compatible wallet.\n\n: If you intend to use the wallet to access Web3 applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and NFT marketplaces, then it is advisable to choose a broadly supported wallet. This way, you can easily connect to these platforms without transferring funds to another compatible wallet. EVM compatibility : The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to build Ethereum-like applications across other blockchain networks. The best Ethereum wallets implement support for other EVM-compatible networks such as Polygon, BNBChain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, Gnosis, and many others. Thus, users can use a single wallet to access dapps built on these networks.\n\n: The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to build Ethereum-like applications across other blockchain networks.

Hot or cold wallet: A hot wallet is connected to the internet and intended for regular usage. On the other hand, a cold wallet is designated for the long-term storage of your ETH and other assets. Many investors combine hot and cold wallet setups to balance their portfolio risk.\n\n10 Best Ethereum Wallets for All Users\n\nType of wallet: Browser and mobile wallet\n\nBrowser and mobile wallet USP: Connect to dapps and Web3\n\nConnect to dapps and Web3 User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Free-to-use The wallet experience could be significantly improved MetaMask is widely supported across the dapp ecosystem MetaMask does not support new-age networks such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc The wallet is EVM compatible (with support for BNBChain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.) Being a hot-wallet solution makes users susceptible to hacks and other online attack vectors MetaMask offers a built-in swap feature and portfolio tracker\n\nReleased in September 2016 by Ethereum development studio Consensys, MetaMask is arguably the most popular Ethereum wallet. It boasts over 10 million active monthly users and has grown significantly since launching on mobile devices. Initially, the wallet was only available as a browser extension.\n\nThe MetaMask wallet is a self-custodial solution. Users create a new seed phrase upon installation or import an existing one. There is also the option to import wallets via a cryptographic private key. The MetaMask wallet features a relatively straightforward experience on both mobile and browsers. MetaMask users can send and receive tokens and connect with decentralized applications across Ethereum and almost all other EVM networks.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware wallet\n\nUSP: Advanced security\n\nUser-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons The Ledger Nano X provides secure offline storage for crypto assets Expensive for the average crypto investor The wallet is durable and portable The Ledger Live application might confuse users with more than one wallet \u2014 because the app sums up user balances, users must label wallets correctly The device supports over 5,000 crypto tokens, making it an option for investors with a diverse portfolio The device isn\u2019t completely air gapped, so it is still vulnerable to certain security threats Directly exchange and swap cryptocurrencies through supported partners\n\nThe Ledger Nano X is a USB-shaped hardware device for storing cryptocurrencies. The device stores your cryptographic keys offline, eliminating the risk of losing funds to online attackers.\n\nUsers can connect to their mobile devices via Bluetooth to manage their portfolios using the Ledger Live application available on Android and iOS. A wired connection is required to use Ledger Nano X with a Windows, macOS or Linux device.\n\nEven though this wallet is a hardware device, it is not considered cold storage or air gapped. This makes it vulnerable to certain attacks that can exploit Bluetooth and USB connections. Air-gapped wallets use QR codes to sign transactions instead of direct connections. The process can make for a clunky user experience, but it is more secure.\n\nUpon installing Ledger Live, users can set up their Ethereum app to manage ether (ETH) and other ETH-based tokens. The Ledger Nano X wallet supports Ethereum staking and is among the best-supported options for decentralized applications.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware wallet\n\nUSP: Affordable security\n\nUser-friendliness: Simple\n\nPros Cons Secure offline storage Has fewer functionalities than the Nano Optimized to offer a seamless NFT and DeFi experience Not compatible with iOS devices It weighs less than the Nano X and is thus more portable A known issue of summing portfolio balances presents a challenge to users who manage more than one wallet with Ledger Live The device isn\u2019t completely air gapped, so it is still vulnerable to certain security threats\n\nThe Ledger Nano S Plus is a pocket-friendly alternative to the Nano X device. For around 60% of the price of the older counterpart, the Nano S device also features secure offline private key storage. More importantly, the device enables users to manage ETH and ETH-based tokens and interact with dapps.\n\nThe Ledger Nano S Plus is a predecessor to the Ledger Nano S device. An immediate improvement to the newer hardware wallet is an increased focus on optimizing the wallet for NFT and DeFi transactions. Meanwhile, the Nano S Plus device is not Bluetooth-enabled, one of the core differences between the most expensive Nano X.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware wallet\n\nHardware wallet USP: Advanced offline security\n\nAdvanced offline security User friendliness: Simple\n\nPros Cons Trezor hardware wallets are user-friendly and offer seamless management with the Trezor Suite web and desktop apps Trezor hardware wallets do not offer native support for displaying and managing NFTs, although users can sign transactions Trezor supports the use of an advanced seed phrase for additional security Trezor devices support fewer coins and tokens compared to competitors Built-in exchange to buy, sell, and swap cryptocurrencies The device isn\u2019t completely air gapped, so it is still vulnerable to certain security threats\n\nProduced by Satoshi Labs, Trezor hardware wallets are another popular physical storage device for managing ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Trezor offers two products, the Trezor Model T and Trezor One devices.\n\nThe Trezor Model T is the more expensive option, offering advanced security features such as a touchscreen display and support for more cryptocurrencies. The Trezor One device is more affordable, enables managing fewer cryptocurrencies, and is sold at approximately 30% of the price of the Model T.\n\nHowever, both wallets are easy to set up and rank highly on the list of best Ethereum wallets. Users can connect their Trezor device to MetaMask via a simple integration to enjoy top-notch DeFi experiences.\n\nType of wallet: Hardware, cold air-gapped wallet\n\nUSP: Most secure\n\nUser-friendliness: Complex\n\nPros Cons Most secure storage Cannot connect to smart contract applications User-friendly touch screen Sending crypto requires multiple steps on different devices Wide selection of coins and staking options Requires USB updates\n\nEllipal Titan Wallet is a cold storage wallet that utilizes air-gap technology. Unlike traditional cold storage wallets, the Ellipal Titan does not connect to the internet, Bluetooth or USB. Instead, transactions are conducted using QR codes, which are generated on the Ellipal app and scanned using the Titan\u2019s camera.\n\nThis air gap technology ensures a higher level of security as it prevents the wallet from being hacked through internet connections. The Ellipal app allows users to receive coins but not to send coins, as the private keys are stored inside the Titan wallet and transactions must be signed and approved using the QR code on the wallet.\n\nThe Ellipal Titan is a highly secure wallet, but it does have the drawback of requiring manual updates using a mini-USB, as it does not connect to the internet. Unlike Trezor and Ledger, it cannot connect to Metamask to approve transactions and interact with Ethereum dapps. Overall, the Ellipal Titan is a unique and secure option for those seeking to store their cryptocurrencies in cold storage.\n\nType of wallet: Web and mobile wallet\n\nUSP: Open source\n\nUser-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Open-source wallet with multi-device support A hot wallet solution, making users susceptible to online attacks Native dapp store and NFT management application Users report frequent crashes on MyEtherWallet mobile and instability while interacting with the Polygon network Built-in token cross-chain swap functionality powered by decentralized exchanges MyEtherWallet is developer friendly, including a smart contract interaction, gas unit conversion, and verification message add-ons\n\nLaunched in 2015, MyEtherWallet is the oldest Ethereum wallet, becoming the first open-source solution for users to create and manage assets on the network. The wallet has since evolved to provide new functionalities, including a web, mobile application, and browser extension (Enkrypt).\n\nIn addition to pioneering self-custodial ownership, MyEtherWallet is compatible with most EVM-compatible networks and tokens. Users also enjoy the luxury of a built-in dapp store that features the most popular protocols and an NFT manager app.\n\nLike MetaMask, users can connect MyEtherWallet with many hardware wallets, including Ledger, Trezor and Keep Key. This integration provides another gateway for accessing dapps with funds stored in a secure offline location.\n\nType of wallet: Mobile and browser extension\n\nMobile and browser extension USP: Multichain\n\nMultichain User-friendliness: Extremely easy\n\nPros Cons Trust Wallet users can directly stake ETH and several Ethereum-based tokens Trust Wallet popularity makes users susceptible to phishing attacks Trust Wallet includes an option to track charts and prices Prone to mobile wallet malware attacks Users can swap assets across different networks using the built-in multichain swap widget\n\nTrust Wallet is one of the best Ethereum wallets and boasts remarkable adoption with over 25 million users. The self-custodial wallet launched in 2017 and is notably backed by popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n\nTrust Wallet enables storing ETH and managing ERC-20 tokens. Users can simply toggle support for several assets and manage Ethereum gas fee settings based on network usage.\n\nThe Trust Wallet application also includes an NFT display feature and a native dapp store for accessing protocols across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks. Trust Wallet launched its browser extension in 2022 to broaden its user appeal and ward off competition.\n\nType of wallet: Desktop, web, and mobile wallet\n\nDesktop, web, and mobile wallet USP: Beginner friendly and multi-signature features\n\nBeginner friendly and multi-signature features User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Multi-signature features available for ether and bitcoin At the time of writing, users pay a relatively high fee of 5.7% when using the in-app purchase option to buy cryptocurrencies Guarda provides advanced security options, including biometrics unlock and Face ID The wallet is not purpose-built for accessing dapps and NFTs The wallet supports native Ethereum staking Guarda Wallet is developer-friendly with several add-ons for token creation\n\nLaunched in 2017, Guarda is another top wallet for Ethereum users. Guarda Wallet supports over 50 blockchain networks and 400,000 tokens, making it an excellent option for investors with a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe Guarda wallet is available on multiple devices and offers a user-friendly interface for managing assets. Guarda provides developer-friendly add-ons such as a token generator, mnemonic converter, Etherscan integration, and smart contract deployer.\n\nOther prominent features include a built-in multichain swap widget, fiat purchases, and a Visa debit card for users to spend cryptoassets. Unlike a handful of self-custodial wallets, Guarda also prides itself in providing prompt customer service through LiveChat and email.\n\nType of wallet: Smart contract mobile wallet\n\nSmart contract mobile wallet USP: Ethereum layer-2 wallet\n\nEthereum layer-2 wallet User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Cheap and fast transactions via Ethereum layer-2 Argent Wallet is only available on mobile Argent offers a user-friendly interface ideal for onboarding new investors to Ethereum Only supports tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain Native Ethereum-staking solution and DeFi integration No seed phrase recovery required\n\nArgent is a smart contract wallet specially designed for accessing the Ethereum layer-2 network zkSync. It replaces the traditional Externally Owned Account (EOA) model of Ethereum wallets with a smart contract model.\n\nThis enables account abstraction \u2014 where the user can interact with the Ethereum ecosystem with more functionality. For example, instead of using a seed phrase recovery system, you can set up a multi-signature solution that utilizes social recovery. It also enables transaction bundling so that engaging with smart contracts does require multiple transaction approvals.\n\nArgent offers direct Ethereum staking and the option for users to earn interest across DeFi protocols on the layer-2 solution. There is also an inbuilt swap widget and a novel recovery process for users to retrieve lost wallets without a paper backup. The only trade-off is that the wallet is focused on optimizing user experience and thus does not support the layer-1 Ethereum network.\n\nRead more: The Seed Phrase Debate: Do Wallets Really Need Them?\n\nType of wallet: Desktop, mobile, and browser wallet\n\nDesktop, mobile, and browser wallet USP: Multichain and beginner friendly\n\nMultichain and beginner friendly User-friendliness: Relatively easy\n\nPros Cons Exodus wallet offers full multichain functionalities, enabling access to Ethereum, EVM-compatible networks, and new-age networks such as Solana Supports fewer cryptocurrencies than some competitors Multi-device support, including desktop and mobile synchronization Prone to mobile wallet malware attacks Native support for Ethereum staking and earning interest via DeFi protocols Exodus provides customer support through LiveChat and email\n\nLaunched in 2015, Exodus is one of the oldest cryptocurrency wallets and among the best Ethereum wallets. Exodus offers a user-friendly experience and native integrations with the Ethereum dapp ecosystem. One of these integrations is an app store that allows users to access DeFi protocols such as Compound Finance and Aave with a single click.\n\nExodus is accessible across multiple devices with Android, iOS, desktop, and browser options available to users. The wallet features an intuitive portfolio tracker and support for the Trezor Model T hardware wallet. Users can also seamlessly buy and sell crypto using Exodus mobile\u2019s numerous fiat on-ramp solutions.\n\nType of wallet: Browser and mobile wallet\n\nBrowser and mobile wallet USP: Retail friendly\n\nRetail friendly User-friendliness: Straightforward\n\nPros Cons The Coinbase wallet is more user-friendly Integrates few EVM-compatible networks compared to competitors The wallet integrates native support for Ethereum and Polygon NFTs Close ties with the Coinbase exchange mean limited privacy options for connected users Users can store ETH, all Ethereum-based tokens, and several other cryptocurrencies Prone to mobile wallet malware attacks Coinbase Wallet lets users buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat\n\nDeveloped by the famous cryptocurrency exchange company Coinbase, the Coinbase Wallet is a self-custodial solution for Ethereum investors. Users can browse decentralized applications from the built-in dapp store and manage NFTs from the Ethereum and Polygon networks.\n\nThe wallet initially only existed as a mobile app for Android and iOS devices. However, the company released the Coinbase Wallet browser extension in 2021, expanding its grip on market share. Coinbase\u2019s wallet is synonymous with a seamless user experience powered by a minimalistic design that even new investors can navigate.\n\nAmong other features, the Coinbase Wallet allows users to set up usernames. Thus, users can execute transactions without using hard-to-read cryptocurrency addresses. The wallet also supports Ethereum staking and the option to earn interest on crypto using DeFi protocols.\n\nEthereum wallet FAQs\n\nWhich wallet is best for Ethereum?\n\nThe best wallet for Ethereum depends on a user\u2019s needs. For instance, MetaMask is considered the best Ethereum wallet by many to easily interact with dapps across the DeFi and Web3 gaming ecosystem. However, a hardware wallet provides the best security for the long-term storage of ETH and Ethereum-based assets. Mobile wallets are ideal for day-to-day transactions involving smaller amounts, while connecting your hardware wallet to browser extensions for transaction signing provides greater security while using dapps.\n\nWhich wallet is best for Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nMost Ethereum-focused wallets, such as MetaMask and MyEtherWallet, do not support Bitcoin. Therefore, the best choice for Bitcoin and Ethereum is any of the hardware wallet devices listed in this article. Other options, including Trust Wallet, Guarda Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet, enable storage and transfers for ETH and BTC.\n\nWhich is the safest Ethereum wallet?\n\nThe safest Ethereum wallet is a hardware solution such as Ledger Nano X or Trezor Model T device. These devices store a user\u2019s private key offline and provide advanced security options such as extra passphrases and customized backup solutions. Users can further ensure safety by setting up a cold-storage wallet, one not used for regular transactions.\n\nWhich is the most popular crypto wallet for Ethereum?\n\nWith more than 30 million users, MetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet for Ethereum. It is the most supported wallet on dapps and boasts significant usage within and outside the Ethereum ecosystem. Other popular options include MyEtherWallet and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nWhat is the crypto wallet with the lowest fees?\n\nMost crypto wallets allow users to set the lowest transaction fees based on network usage. Because users pay transaction fees to validators/miners on the underlying networks, crypto wallets technically do not offer low fees.\n\nChoosing rightly to secure your Ethereum assets\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has significantly evolved from its early days. Nowadays, a user can choose the best Ethereum wallet for them based on their portfolio size, dapp usage, and other specific needs. Combining one or more wallet types may help users achieve the best security practices and benefit from the numerous opportunities available on Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What investors need to know about \u2018staking,\u2019 the passive income opportunity at the center of crypto\u2019s latest regulation scare - CNBC",
        "content": "Not six months ago, ether led a recovery in cryptocurrency prices ahead of a big tech upgrade that would make something called \"staking\" available to crypto investors.\n\nMost people have hardly wrapped their heads around the concept, but now, the price of ether is falling amid mounting fears that the Securities and Exchange Commission could crack down on it.\n\nOn Thursday, Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, closed its staking program in a $30 million settlement with the SEC, which said the company failed to register the offer and sale of its crypto staking-as-a-service program.\n\nThe night before, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong warned his Twitter followers that the securities regulator may want more broadly to end staking for U.S. retail customers.\n\n\"This should put everyone on notice in this marketplace,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Friday morning. \"Whether you call it lend, earn, yield, whether you offer an annual percentage yield \u2013 that doesn't matter. If someone is taking [customer] tokens and transferring to their platform, the platform controls it.\"\n\nStaking has widely been seen as a catalyst for mainstream adoption of crypto and a big revenue opportunity for exchanges like Coinbase. A clampdown on staking, and staking services, could have damaging consequences not just for those exchanges, but also Ethereum and other proof-of-stake blockchain networks. To understand why, it helps to have a basic understanding of the activity in question.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nStaking is a way for investors to earn passive yield on their cryptocurrency holdings by locking tokens up on the network for a period of time. For example, if you decide you want to stake your ether holdings, you would do so on the Ethereum network. The bottom line is it allows investors to put their crypto to work if they're not planning to sell it anytime soon.\n\nHow does staking work?\n\nStaking is sometimes referred to as the crypto version of a high-interest savings account, but there's a major flaw in that comparison: crypto networks are decentralized, and banking institutions are not.\n\nEarning interest through staking is not the same thing as earning interest from a high annual percentage yield offered by a centralized platform like those that ran into trouble last year, like BlockFi and Celsius, or Gemini just last month. Those offerings really were more akin to a savings account: people would deposit their crypto with centralized entities that lent those funds out and promised rewards to the depositors in interest (of up to 20% in some cases). Rewards vary by network but generally, the more you stake, the more you earn.\n\nBy contrast, when you stake your crypto, you are contributing to the proof-of-stake system that keeps decentralized networks like Ethereum running and secure; you become a \"validator\" on the blockchain, meaning you verify and process the transactions as they come through, if chosen by the algorithm. The selection is semi-random \u2013 the more crypto you stake, the more likely you'll be chosen as a validator.\n\nThe lock-up of your funds serves as a sort of collateral that can be destroyed if you as a validator act dishonestly or insincerely.\n\nThis is true only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network like Bitcoin uses a different process to confirm transactions.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nIn most cases, investors won't be staking themselves \u2013 the process of validating network transactions is just impractical on both the retail and institutional levels.\n\nThat's where crypto service providers like Coinbase, and formerly Kraken, come in. Investors can give their crypto to the staking service and the service does the staking on the investors' behalf. When using a staking service, the lock-up period is determined by the networks (like Ethereum or Solana), and not the third party (like Coinbase or Kraken).\n\nIt's also where it gets a little murky with the SEC, which said Thursday that Kraken should have registered the offer and sale of the crypto asset staking-as-a-service program with the securities regulator.\n\nWhile the SEC hasn't given formal guidance on what crypto assets it deems securities, it generally sees a red flag if someone makes an investment with a reasonable expectation of profits that would be derived from the work or effort of others.\n\nCoinbase has about 15% of the market share of Ethereum assets, according to Oppenheimer. The industry's current retail staking participation rate is 13.7% and growing.\n\nProof-of-stake vs. proof-of-work\n\nStaking works only for proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and Cardano. A proof-of-work network, like Bitcoin, uses a different process to confirm transactions.\n\nThe two are simply the protocols used to secure cryptocurrency networks.\n\nProof-of-work requires specialized computing equipment, like high-end graphics cards to validate transactions by solving highly complex math problems. Validators gets rewards for each transaction they confirm. This process requires a ton of energy to complete.\n\nEthereum's big migration to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work improved its energy efficiency almost 100%.\n\nRisks involved\n\nThe source of return in staking is different from traditional markets. There aren't humans on the other side promising returns, but rather the protocol itself paying investors to run the computational network.\n\nDespite how far crypto has come, it's still a young industry filled with technological risks, and potential bugs in the code is a big one. If the system doesn't work as expected, it's possible investors could lose some of their staked coins.\n\nVolatility is and has always been a somewhat attractive feature in crypto but it comes with risks, too. One of the biggest risks investors face in staking is simply a drop in the price. Sometimes a big decline can lead smaller projects to hike their rates to make a potential opportunity more attractive."

If you look at the list of applications that were in the Ethereum Whitepaper, and you look at the applications that are popular today, the big thing that\u2019s in the second list and not the first is NFTs.\u201d\n\nInstead, Vitalik had foreseen smart contracts shaping finance, resulting in the current spark in decentralized finance, and other fortes.\n\nAt the moment, decentralized finance protocols, including Lido Finance, MakerDAO, and Uniswap, are among the top dApps with billions in total value locked (TVL).\n\nUniswap, for example, has dominated the decentralized swapping of tokens, recently introducing the support of NFTs. During the interview, Vitalik said the launch of Uniswap in late 2018 ushered in the era of DeFi. By early 2020, DeFi TVL rose to above $1b for the first time.\n\nOther noteworthy applications in DeFi include MakerDAO, which was reported to be one of the most active DAOs, together with Optimism DAO. The protocol has impacted how users can lend and borrow digital assets without including the services of a third party.\n\nAs an industry, DeFi protocols control over $48b of different assets in protocols launched in several blockchains, including in Ethereum, the BNB Chain, Cardano, Polygon, and others.\n\nNFTs are core to crypto\n\nAmid the expansion of DeFi, gaming, metaverse, and other applications in Ethereum and smart contracting platforms is the rise of NFTs. NFTs allow users to create unique assets which, like fungible tokens, can be transferred in public chains. In Ethereum, NFTs mostly comply with the ERC-721 standard. However, depending on what its creators want, it can be designed to adopt other NFT standards, including ERC 1155.\n\nNFTs have found application in various spheres, including DeFi. For instance, Uniswap v3 uses liquidity NFTs, while gaming and metaverse platforms integrate NFTs to reward players.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The latter has been in early access beta access mode since June 2022 and was previously only available to a select number of merchants.\n\nWith tokengating, all applicable Shopify merchants can now set up their stores to dictate which tokenholders can and cannot gain access to exclusive products, nonfungible token (NFT) drops and benefits.\n\nThe tool verifies user eligibility via their connected wallet and is being touted as a handy way for NFT Merchants to reward certain users or add exclusivity to specific products.\n\nTokengating example. Source: Shopify\n\nIn terms of expanded crypto wallet support, Shopify has integrated with the sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) protocol led by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSIWE essentially enables secure user sign-ins and authentication of Ethereum accounts and ENS domains without giving away private identifiers to third parties, such as names, phone numbers and residential addresses.\n\nThe topic of private user information has been a sour spot for Shopify in the past. In April 2022, a group of disgruntled users filed a class-action lawsuit against the firm and hardware wallet provider Ledger concerning a hefty leak of user data in 2020.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Shapella transition is \u2018on the horizon\u2019\n\nENS Labs community advocate @sadaf.eth highlighted the SIWE integration with Shopify via Twitter on Feb. 9 and linked to developer documents explaining how to build the tool into Shopify stores, much to the delight of some from the Ethereum community.\n\n\u201cThe statementGenerator prop allows you to customize the statement displayed in a Sign-In with Ethereum message. The function receives the address of the wallet that has connected, allowing you to expand and customize your message statements to better suit your brand,\u201d the document reads.\n\nAt this stage, once a merchant hooks up the SIWE feature on Shopify wallet connect, it appears that users will be able to click a \u201csign-in with Ethereum\u201d button to connect their addresses via SIWE\u2019s partnered intermediaries such as Coinbase, Fortmatic, WalletConnect, Portis and Torus."

        "content": "Decrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nThe integration of real-world assets, or RWAs, into the world of DeFi has been one of the hottest narratives so far in 2023. And emerging just in time to meet that red-hot trend head on is a crypto startup looking to soak up the interest.\n\nThis week, Switzerland-based Backed Finance launched a tokenized version of a BlackRock ETF (CSPX) that includes tons of big names like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and 496 other large American companies.\n\nThe token is called bCSPX, and runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. The token is backed 1:1 by shares of those stocks, and the shares are held by a licensed custodian, according to Backed.\n\nAnd insofar as it runs on Ethereum, that means it can hypothetically interact with a whole host of DeFi applications, leading to some pretty innovative ideas like, for example, minting MakerDAO\u2019s decentralized stablecoin DAI using a stock index as collateral.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the S&P 500, either. Based on the project\u2019s marketing materials, the expectation is to onboard additional public securities under a regulatory framework that takes a page from Switzerland\u2019s Distributed Ledger Technology act.\n\nIn terms of who can get a hold of these tokens, it looks like there\u2019s three kinds of users. The first is professional investors and exchange platforms that may want to offer the token to clients; the second is KYC\u2019d token owners who are also interested in redeeming the underlying asset (a key feature should the token depeg from the price of the underlying asset like Grayscale\u2019s GBTC product); and the third is everyone else on the market.\n\nWell, almost everyone. You can't get the token in the United States\u2014likely a decision by Backed Finance to avoid having to navigate the SEC's choppy regulatory waters right now.\n\nThe United States has put itself in strange company. (Source: Backed Finance)\n\nThere\u2019s another hurdle to overcome, too.\n\nWhen the product was initially launched, a Uniswap pool was seeded with enough liquidity for folks to get started trading bCSPX. But now, Uniswap\u2019s interface indicates that the Backed\u2019s new token is \u201cunsupported\u201d because it \u201cmay not work well with the smart contracts or we [Uniswap] are unable to allow trading for legal reasons.\u201d Tokens that fall under this list, and dont\u2019t have \u201ccaution\u201d or \u201cwarning\u201d next to them, are \u201cmanually curated by Uniswap Labs.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, this may not be the biggest issue. If you\u2019re an American citizen living in the United States, you likely won\u2019t need a product like this. You can just head over to Fidelity or another broker and scoop up your fill there.\n\nUnfortunately, it means that American traders won\u2019t get to enjoy speedy swaps between, say, Apple stock and Circle\u2019s USDC. They may also get left behind should assets like bCSPX become deeply integrated in other DeFi apps.\n\nStill, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink doesn't sound concerned about that. In December, the finance exec declared that \u201cthe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.\u201d\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

The daily Ordinal NFT mints soared by 300 times in the same time period.\n\n1/ If we told you #Bitcoin NFTs were making waves in the sector would you believe us? The New #Ordinals NFT project on Bitcoin is attempting to challenge the longstanding debate that the blockchain should primarily be used for simple financial transactions. ? pic.twitter.com/2O0jHjzRLZ \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) February 9, 2023\n\nAdditional data from Messari\u2019s Twitter thread pointed towards a 25% growth in network fees and an increased share of the available block space.\n\nWhile Ordinals has presented an exciting new use case, it has also triggered debates around the ultimate purpose of the Bitcoin chain.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction 2023-2024\n\nHow do NFTs on Bitcoin work?\n\nIn simple terms, Ordinals are NFTs that can be minted directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to NFTs on Ethereum [ETH] which point to off-chain data and rely on token standards like ERC 721 to create a collection of tokens. Since Ordinals are minted on the blockchain, all content stored is permanent and immutable while Ethereum NFTs can be altered using metadata.\n\nOrdinals focus on BTC\u2018s smallest units, satoshis. According to NFTNow, the protocol allows users to inscribe each satoshi with data. This data can include smart contracts which are then used to enable NFTs.\n\nAnother potential advantage of Bitcoin NFTs over Ethereum NFTs could be the low transaction fee due to the Taproot upgrade which was intended to make Bitcoin transactions more efficient.\n\nHowever, Ordinals has divided opinions in the crypto community with the naysayers objecting to its non-financial use case which would congest the network and drive up transaction fees on the chain.\n\nOn-chain activity picks up decisively\n\nThe growth of the Ordinals platform seemed to have heightened the network activity on Bitcoin, data from Santiment showed.\n\nThe transaction volumes proliferated over the last week, increasing by more than four times. The velocity indicator revealed a sharp spike as well, implying that BTC moved frequently between wallets.\n\nWhile BTC purists may be spooked by the idea of more network congestion, miners got a chance to rejoice. As per data from Glassnode, the miner revenue witnessed considerable growth after sustained periods of downturn.\n\nWith increased rewards for their efforts, BTC mining could become more profitable which is coming from the lows of the 2022 bear market.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nWith BTC wilting under pressure due to the SEC\u2019s increased regulations on the crypto market, Bitcoin-native NFTs could provide it with the much-needed impetus in the short run.\n\nWith a new target audience in place, it can put the chain in direct competition with market leaders in NFT trading such as Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL]."

        "content": "It\u2019s always a tough call to make. What will be the next top crypto? No one could\u2019ve predicted that Dogecoin (DOGE) would see the astronomical gains it has, to ascend to the top of the meme coin ladder. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, but by looking at cryptocurrencies\u2019 fundamentals, we can find out if any have what it takes to make it the next top crypto.\n\nIn this article, we will look at Uniswap (UNI), Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) to see which one has the potential to become the next top crypto! Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nUniswap: No FTX? No Problem!\n\nWhile the rest of the cryptocurrency market was floundering in the red last year, Uniswap (UNI) is somehow in the green. How is this possible?\n\nWhen FTX imploded and destroyed many people\u2019s assets and money, Uniswap seemed to come out unscathed. This incident foreshadowed the increase of suspicion of centralised cryptocurrency exchanges and increased scrutiny of other exchanges, including Crypto.com, Binance, and Coinbase. This is due to the proven danger that a collapse or some unanticipated catastrophe may occur, preventing the withdrawal of a person\u2019s hard-earned money.\n\nIn this madness, DeFi is beginning to gain ground, particularly Uniswap, which is the most often used DeFi token. As more and more crypto fans who are weary of centralised exchanges turn to DeFi as an alternate method of participating in the crypto sector, Uniswap is expected to continue on its upward trajectory. It is one of the leading DeFi cryptocurrencies, and may well be the next top crypto.\n\nEthereum: The Top Crypto After Bitcoin\n\nEthereum (ETH) is becoming a more popular option for investors as a legitimate investment. with justification, too! A safe, decentralised platform for creating blockchain applications is provided by Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is an open-source distributed blockchain network that supports smart contracts. Given that it offers a variety of benefits and features, it is a popular option for investors trying to diversify their portfolios.\n\nDue to its cheap transaction fees, quick transaction times, and exceptional scalability, Ethereum is expected to continue to be one of the top cryptocurrencies. Investing in Ethereum has a variety of advantages for investors, in addition to greater security, higher returns on investment, and enhanced liquidity.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: The Top Crypto For Memes\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is now among the market\u2019s most promising meme coins. Big Eyes Coin is one of the most pre-eminent pre-sale tokens in the previous three years, having raised $25 million and counting.\n\nDue to the coin\u2019s enormous potential, investors are grabbing as many Big Eyes Coin tokens as they can. As a cryptocurrency, Big Eyes Coin\u2019s main goal is to transfer as much cash as possible into the DeFi community.\n\nAdditionally, Big Eyes Coin is a coin that further aims to help environmental causes! Regular funding is provided to The Orca Network and The Sea Shepherd, two organisations working to safeguard marine life. No wonder so many people are backing the coin.\n\nWe can easily see Big Eyes Coin potentially becoming the top crypto in the meme coin space.\n\nFinding the next top crypto can be a difficult task. We hope that our examination of these different cryptocurrencies has helped you on your journey to find the next top crypto. As always, ensure you conduct your research before investing in any asset.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The 2023 Ethereum price outlook is optimistic, as the market anticipates substantial price growth for the ETH token in the long term. Although the 2023 Ethereum price is promising, it may not be the top investment opportunity currently available.\n\nIn contrast, the impressive interest generated by the RenQ Finance (RENQ) presale suggests that it could deliver massive returns in the years ahead, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2023 and beyond.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is, without a doubt, the best crypto to invest in\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum in 2023 is positive, with predictions that the token will experience growth in the long-term after its recent merger in September 2022. Despite the current bear market, the Ethereum price forecast for 2023 suggests a potential reversal in trend. But the top crypto to invest in this year may be RenQ Finance (RENQ). The RENQ presale has generated significant interest, raising over $300k in just three days after its announcement. RenQ Finance is poised to make a big impact in the DeFi space and has the potential for significant future price growth, making it a highly promising investment opportunity.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is a foundational blockchain and the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 world. It was created using a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, but the recent update to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol during the merge in 2022 has made Ethereum\u2019s blockchain more economical and environmentally friendly. The PoS protocol assigns the mining process to trusted participants, who are incentivized to act in a trustworthy manner, instead of having nodes compete for block mining using their computing power, which was the case with the PoW mechanism.\n\nDespite the upgrade, Ethereum continues to be a prime crypto investment opportunity due to its status as the first Turing complete blockchain. This has resulted in Ethereum hosting over 2,000 independent projects and a growing number of use cases being discovered for blockchain technology, largely due to Ethereum\u2019s innovative solution.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2023: Will ETH reach $2500?\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction 2023 is more bullish than in 2022, when Ethereum suffered an 80% price fall. The ETH token is expected to reverse this trend and could begin to climb back toward its previous all-time high at $4865.\n\nETH faces strong resistance at $1780. However, if the token can break through this price level, the next target is $2500 for the Ethereum price prediction 2023.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhat is RenQ Finance (RENQ)?\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized financial platform that offers a seamless trading experience without compromising on decentralization. It provides users with full control over their assets, which are stored on the blockchain and accessed through the private key to their wallet, unlike centralized exchanges that hold full control and put users at risk of losing their funds. To enhance security, RenQ Finance employs Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to protect users\u2019 seed phrases and private keys.\n\nThe platform integrates isolated blockchain networks in the DeFi space, creating a multi-chain network for the exchange of value and assets. This makes it easier for users to access and transact value without having to create multiple accounts on different blockchain networks. The native token of RenQ Finance, RENQ, serves as the network\u2019s utility and governance token.\n\nHow RenQ Finance (RENQ) works?\n\nRenQ offers users anonymity, security, and transparency in trading. While other decentralized exchanges are strong in these areas, they still face challenges such as failed trades, slow order execution, front-running, high slippage, and limited features compared to centralized exchanges. As a result, many traders prefer to use centralized exchanges over decentralized ones, but this means giving up control of their assets. RenQ Exchange offers a solution to this problem, providing users with a direct trading experience through their wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, RenQ elevates decentralized trading by eliminating these drawbacks and providing a secure and user-friendly platform.\n\nWill RENQ reach $10?\n\nForecasts predict that the token could increase by as much as 500 times its value, reaching around $10 in 2025. RenQ Finance is deemed the top crypto to invest in during 2023, attracting a surge of investment following the launch of its presale. The platform is poised to play a significant role in the DeFi industry and has demonstrated promising growth prospects. The presale of RENQ is considered a rare investment opportunity with high potential, providing investors the chance to acquire RENQ at a discounted price. Long-term predictions place RENQ among the leading DeFi projects, with a target of $10 in 2025. In 2023, it is expected to reach $1 as its growth accelerates. Currently, RenQ Finance is considered the best crypto investment at its current price level.\n\nIs RENQ worth buying?\n\nYes, RENQ is considered a good buy as it is currently in its first stage of presale at a low price of $0.02. The RENQ project has the potential to gain a lot of attention and users in the upcoming months, which could lead to significant growth for the token by the end of the year and potentially make it one of the top altcoins of the year. Based on the expected increase in demand for RENQ and the possibility of being listed on major exchanges, the price predictions for 2023 are between $0.9 to $1.1. These estimates are based on the expectation of higher interest and trading activity for the RENQ token.\n\nRight now, RenQ Finance (RENQ) is in the first stage of its presale which is priced at $0.02, this will increase to $0.055 by the end of the presale which itself is a 175% gain. User\u2019s can take advantage of these low prices on RENQ and buy presale here."

        "title": "Sapolia Testnet of Ethereum to Experience Shanghai Upgrade This Month - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has disclosed in a blog post that a mainnet upgrade Shapella (including Shanghai+Capella) is going through its conclusive stages. The platform mentioned that the respective upgrade is going through its pre-launch sequence. This phase is related to the public testnets.\n\nSapolia Testnet to Witness a Shanghai Upgrade in February\n\nThe platform disclosed that the Zhejiang testnet is presently functional and the users as well as stakers can utilize it for the testing of Shapella at present. In addition to this, the Ethereum Foundation asserted that Sepolia (the initial of the established public testnets) is planned to experience the respective upgrade on the 28th of this month. As per the platform, the Shapella upgrade comprises several features. Nonetheless, the most significant thing is that the consensus layer and the stakers will be permitted to carry out withdrawals.\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the exited validators will have complete withdrawals. On the other hand, the dynamic validator balances exceeding 32 ETH will have partial withdrawals. It added that to take part in withdrawals, the validators must possess a 0x01 credential for execution-layer withdrawal. On the contrary, if 0x00 is a validator\u2019s credential for BLS withdrawals at present, they are required to have a change operation. In this way, withdrawals will be enabled for them.\n\nThe platform added that the Shapella upgrade will be beneficial for infrastructure providers, node operators, the Ethereum stakers, and so on. The relevant parties are advised by the Ethereum Foundation to be focused on the latest upgrade as well as test their software. The platform disclosed that it will upgrade every public testnet.\n\nAcademic Grants Round of Ethereum Goes Live\n\nApart from that, if everything moves according to the schedule, the next stage is the mainnet launch which will shortly take place, in the words of the Ethereum Foundation. Along with this, the platform made another announcement. This is related to Academic Grants Round. The platform brought to the front that the facility is presently live.\n\nIn the previous year, it added, the platform remained successful in grasping the attention of academics around the world to operate on the projects existing within the span of the Ethereum network. At present, the respective project has been renovated with a remarkable exclusive wishlist to cope with the zones related to cryptography and protocol design. 27th of February is scheduled for Academic Grant applications."

        "title": "What Ethereum Staking Means After the Kraken Crackdown - Inside Bitcoins",
        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nThe outcome of Kraken\u2019s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission will have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC stated on Thursday afternoon that cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has agreed to pay a $30 million punishment for failing to register the offering and sale of its program for staking digital assets. The SEC reportedly wants to end cryptocurrency staking for retail customers in the United States, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said just the day prior.\n\nOn the surface, it appears that this should have been bad news for all cryptocurrency staking providers. But the news didn\u2019t exactly land like that. According to CoinGecko, the governance tokens for Lido and Rocket Pool, two of the biggest pooled staking platforms, increased by as much as 11% in the previous day.\n\nIt\u2019s an indication that the market believes Kraken, Coinbase, and other centralized exchanges that act as staking intermediates should be concerned, but not the rest of the sector. According to GeckoTerminal, selling volume of Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) has exceeded buying volume by a ratio of over 3:1 during the past day.\n\nOn proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum, staked assets support network operation. They demonstrate the stakes validators have in the game because their hardware processes new transactions and saves data. Validators are rewarded for their participation in networks, but they risk losing some of their staked assets if they become inactive or do other crimes.\n\nProfits that can be made through staking on Ethereum\n\nFor the majority of retail-level investors, it is difficult to become an independent Ethereum validator, which is currently the largest proof of stake network. To do it, a user would require 32 ETH, or about $48,000 at the time of writing. Users who have smaller amounts of ETH to stake instead employ pooled staking services and staking-as-a-service providers.\n\nThese are offered in two flavors: plain and liquid staking. With the latter, customers are intended to receive the best of both worlds. For their ETH deposits, they receive a portion of the validator incentives in addition to a token that can be exchanged or used as collateral and is redeemable for the staked assets.\n\nOf the $47 billion in assets in the DeFi ecosystem, the 65 liquid-staking protocols tracked by DeFi Llama account for $12 billion, or 26% of the total. This places them in third place, behind lending ($13 billion) and decentralized exchanges ($19 billion), or DEXes.\n\nEthereum makes up more than $11 billion of the assets in liquid-staking protocols. And Lido is by far the most popular of the 16 protocols that offer ETH staking. Of the money deposited, it accounted for $8 billion, or 75% of the total.\n\nIt appears that oversimplifying staking to make it less daunting for retail clients was at least a portion of the issue the SEC had with Kraken\u2019s program. The fact that Kraken chose to set the returns that its customers would receive, as opposed to the variable rate of rewards decided by the protocol, is criticized in one portion of the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe commission stated:\n\nDefendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not always reliant on the actual profits that Kraken obtains through staking.\n\nStaking on other platforms\n\nAccording to Alex Mogul, senior director of staking and infrastructure at Republic Crypto, Kraken turned into too much of an intermediary as a result. She remarked that:\n\nDepositing to Kraken and letting it handle the arithmetic is by far easier than trying to switch networks and then pressing the transact button to delegate stake. It is quite difficult.\n\nCoinbase has asserted that its staking scheme differs from Kraken\u2019s. According to Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase:\n\nStaking on Coinbase is still possible, and staked assets are still eligible for protocol awards. The fact that Kraken was basically offering a yield product is evident from today\u2019s announcement. The staking services offered by Coinbase are fundamentally different and are not securities. For instance, the rewards for our customers are determined by the awards provided by the protocol and the commissions we publish.\n\nMogul, who oversees Republic Crypto\u2019s Runtime staking-as-a-service division, expressed her optimism that software, such as better designed wallets, would eventually replace any staking options gaps left by centralized exchanges.\n\nShe added that:\n\nI still believe that complexity can be abstracted in software solutions without compromising asset custody.\n\nThe Kraken settlement will drive companies toward decentralized alternatives, according to Jaydeep Korde, co-founder and CEO of Launchnodes, who represents the other end of the investment spectrum.\n\nFor organizations or wealthy people who have the 32 ETH necessary to run their own node but don\u2019t want to handle the technology themselves, his company offers non-custodial staking alternatives. The infrastructure needed to run a validator is owned by the user, but Launchnodes takes care of all maintenance.\n\nHe explained:\n\nBy operating your staking operations on equipment you own, it avoids needing to trust compliant, regulated or non-regulated crypto enterprises that are seemingly growing larger governance and operational flaws.\n\nRelated"

        "title": "Ethereum's Next Upgrade: Shanghai, Is It Time to Sell or HODL? - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Discover the exciting news of the upcoming Ethereum next upgrade, Shanghai. What could be in store for investors in this upcoming milestone?\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is about to undergo its next major upgrade, known as the \u201cShanghai upgrade\u201d.\n\nThe upgrade is highly anticipated, and for good reason: it will allow for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum. This means that Ethereum holders will soon be able to take their assets off the Ethereum blockchain and do with them as they please.\n\nBut what does this mean for the Ethereum market? Will the ability to withdraw Ethereum cause a massive sell-off, or will holders continue to HODL their assets, confident in Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential?\n\nLet\u2019s explore it in this article.\n\nThe Merge Upgrade\n\nThe last time Ethereum underwent a significant upgrade was September\u2019s \u201cThe Merge\u201d, when Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. This upgrade hit all major news sites \u2013 and for good reason. The Merge signified a massive accomplishment with Ethereum\u2019s roadmap.\n\nThe Merge source: Cryptonewz\n\nThis upgrade was a massive technical achievement, but one important functionality needed to be included: withdrawals. This has left many Ethereum holders with staked assets that they cannot access. But the Shanghai upgrade will change all of that, finally allowing for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum. The exact date for the upgrade has not been set yet, but it is expected to take place next month with speculated massive implications for the currency\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nAlthough the Shanghai upgrade is not as technically challenging as The Merge, it is still highly impactful.\n\nNot only is it an important milestone in the development of Ethereum, but its ramifications will be felt across the entire cryptocurrency market. Some people predict that the ability to withdraw Ethereum will lead to a massive sell-off, as people cash in on their staked assets.\n\nNext year the Shanghai Hardfork for #Ethereum is slated to take place on March. 15,3 Mio #ETH will be unlocked. So can this cause a MASS SELL-OFF event for Ethereum, the leading Smart contract platform????????? pic.twitter.com/vCAOaUSN8l \u2014 CryptoMo (@CryptoMo) December 19, 2022\n\nHowever, the argument holds for price increases as well. Staking will become attractive for investors due to its increased liquidity. This can potentially improve its demand, driving up Ethereum prices.\n\nSo, what should Ethereum holders do? The answer to this question is definitely not an easy one.\n\nMore importantly, this event should be seen as a giant win for the entire crypto industry. The Shanghai upgrade enables ETH investors to react accordingly to market demands and reduces artificial factors that affect Ethereum. The choice is ultimately up to each individual, and it is important to do your own research and make an informed decision.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade is sure to have a significant impact on the Ethereum market and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Regardless of your decision, it\u2019s important to keep your eyes peeled on the future developments of this significant moment in cryptocurrency history.\n\nStay tuned for more crypto news."
