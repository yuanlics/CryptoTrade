        "title": "Chainlink Vs. Ethereum \u2013 What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Understanding the differences between Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH) is less about evaluating competitors and more about learning how these networks have the potential to leverage each other's technologies. Ethereum has been a pioneering force in the market and has helped to usher in higher adoption. Chainlink is a concept that has the potential to improve Dapps across all networks. Here's everything you need to know about Chainlink and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Chainlink?\n\nMany traders are surprised to learn that Chainlink has been in the market since 2014. At that time, the protocol went under another name, SmartContract.com. In 2017, the network changed its name to align with its new goals. The team launched an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) that secured $32 million for the project. This maneuver was then followed by a partnership with Google, which further expanded the network's validity and positioning.\n\nChainlink differs from its competitors and Ethereum in many ways. For one, Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles. Oracles are off-chain sensors that are crucial to the operations of today's Dapps. Oracles can transfer data to and from the blockchain.\n\nFor example, you could have an oracle that transfers the title for a car to an owner automatically when payments are complete. Some oracles monitor the price of cryptocurrencies for DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) and other Dapps. The possibilities are endless. There are even oracles that monitor the weather.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is one of the most recognized blockchains in the world. The network made a name for itself after entering the market in 2014. The network ushered in upgraded blockchain capabilities via the introduction of smart contract support. This strategy launched a new era in the sector with dapps becoming the primary purpose of many networks since.\n\nEthereum is the decentralized infrastructure that supports the Ether cryptocurrency. Ethereum's early entry into the market helped it to become the juggernaut it is today. The protocol dominates the market as the most popular DeFi and Dapp protocol in operation today.\n\nWhat Problems Was Chainlink Built to Alleviate?\n\nChainlink seeks to eliminate the biggest problem facing oracles today, incorrect data. Oracles have grown to be an integral part of most major Dapps. These off-chain sensors serve a vital role in communicating timely information to protocols. Problems occur when oracles provide false or incorrect data to the blockchain. The immutable nature of these networks means that this information is not removable in many instances.\n\nChainlink created a decentralized network of oracles that can self-check and analyze data to ensure the correctness of the information. This system uses multiple oracles that cross-reference their input. The oracles that provide faulty data are penalized. Too many incorrect entries can lead to an oracle being removed from the network.\n\nInteroperability\n\nAnother major problem that Chainlink helps to solve is interoperability. Blockchain networks work great alone but when they are integrated into legacy systems, they can be a real game changer for businesses and creators. The system provides a reliable oracle infrastructure that is open to anyone to use.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was built to improve blockchains' usability. It wasn't designed to compete against Bitcoin. It was created to provide a way for developers to leverage the security and reliability of the blockchain system. The network also improved on earlier blockchain's scalability. The network supports 15 tps compared to Bitcoin's 7 tps.\n\nEthereum helped to fight the growing centralization in the market. At the time, the Bitcoin mining sector was very centralized with large mining pools controlling the majority of the network's hash rate. Ethereum introduced a new PoW consensus mechanism that did away with the SHA-256 protocol and leveraged Scrypt. This change gave the network better performance and a lower carbon footprint.\n\nETH 2.0\n\nEthereum seeks to improve its sustainability with the ETH 2.0 upgrade. The change would transfer the network to a PoS protocol. This maneuver would eliminate miners. In a PoS network, stakers secure returns by staking their tokens in network wallets or pools. This approach is more inclusive, removes technical barriers, and costs less.\n\nHow Does Chainlink Work?\n\nChainlink leverages a host of proprietary technologies to provide users with a secure oracle experience. The Chainlink Reputation Contract is used to verify the authenticity of oracles. This system ranks each oracle based on its reliability, uptime, and participation level.\n\nThe Chainlink Order-Matching Contract is a critical component of the ecosystem. This protocol sends the Requesting Contract to the nodes. The system automatically includes how many nodes will be required and the type of nodes as part of this report. Next, nodes bid on the requests. Then, the Chainlink Aggregation Contract checks all the data gathered from the oracles. Incorrect information is reconciled and oracles are ranked based on their performance.\n\nLINK\n\nLINK is the main utility token used by the network. The system requires users to use LINK to pay for services and interact with the network. It\u2019s also required to execute smart contracts. There are in total, 1,000,000,000 LINK set for issuance over the total life of the project.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum leverages a decentralized network of nodes that handle tasks such as transaction validations and smart contract execution. Ethereum miners validate blocks of transactions and add them to the ledger. For their efforts, they receive payment in the form of Ether (ETH).\n\nDevelopers can leverage Ethereum tools to create immersive Dapps. Ethereum has been on the cutting edge of DeFi technology since day one. The protocol was also the first to introduce token standards to the market and DEXs. The ERC-20 token standard is used by hundreds of thousands of projects today.\n\nHow to Buy Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Chainlink (LINK) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nChainlink Vs. Ethereum \u2013 Legends in the Market\n\nEthereum continues to improve its strategy and remains an innovative force in the market today. In comparison, Chainlink serves a vital niche that could improve the performance of all networks. As such, both of these protocols can work together to improve the entire market. In terms of the best to trade, both are worth considering as long-term holds.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Chainlink and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "content": "Visa Introduces New Way To Pay For Ethereum Gas Fees Directly Using Visa Cards\n\nVisa Has Been Actively Exploring The Crypto Sector\n\nVisa has finished testing a system to make it easier to pay transaction fees, or \"gas fees,\" on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccording to the firm, the majority of users find the present gas payment methods to be unnecessarily complicated. Visa noted in a blog post that although blockchain technology has gained a lot of traction recently, people still find it difficult to understand the nuances of on-chain transactions.\n\nEvery transaction on Ethereum needs the payment of a gas fee, which often means ensuring one has a balance of Ether (ETH) in their wallet. The ERC-4337 Ethereum standard, which enables smart contracts to operate as wallets by utilizing account abstraction, is what Visa advises using in conjunction with a paymaster contract. This paymaster agreement might support users' gas fees, enabling users to pay for gas directly with a Visa card.\n\nThe testing for this process was conducted on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.\n\nVisa hopes that merchants or decentralized applications will use their existing wallets or paymaster systems to speed up transactions. By allowing customers to pay gas fees with a Visa card, this system aims to increase the use and accessibility of blockchain-based transactions.\n\nVisa has been actively exploring the crypto sector, including looking into accepting settlement payments using USDC on Ethereum."

        "content": "Amid the rising FUD in the crypto market, the Ethereum price showed a slow yet steady downfall in the daily time frame chart. Within a month, this altcoin dropped from its July 14th peak of $2028 to its current price of $1850, registering a loss of 8.5%. However, a keen look at the bigger picture shows this correction is part of a long-term rally carried by a rising channel pattern.\n\nAlso Read: Picking Ethereum for PayPal Stablecoin Was an \u2018Easy Choice\u2019- PayPal Exec\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Chart: Key Points\n\nA bullish reversal from the lower support trendline could set the ETH price at 12% to hit $2020\n\nThe coin price above 200-days EMA indicates the overall trend bullish\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $3.36 Billion, indicating a 29.6% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nEarlier this week, the Ethereum price showed several higher price rejection candles near the $1875 mark. The high wicks candle signifies that traders are adhering to the prevailing bearish sentiment of engaging in selling when the price rallies.\n\nTherefore, if the overhead supply persists, the ETH price is likely to fall another 2% and retest the long-coming support trendline of the channel pattern. In the last nine months, the price has already rebounded five times from this dynamic support indicating a high accumulation zone for buyers.\n\nA potential fall to a lower trendline will likely recuperate buying pressure and kickstart a new bull cycle within the pattern.

        "title": "Ethereum MEV incentives limit decentralization new report shows - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "On blockchain networks like Ethereum, decentralized validation underpins the entire ecosystem. Yet paradoxically, the highly-technical process of constructing the blocks that store transactions may be quietly accruing influence in the hands of just a few.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Ethereum researcher Thomas Thiery, block building has evolved into a high-stakes strategic arena. Specialized builders now utilize proprietary algorithms, privileged partnerships, and micro-optimized arbitrage strategies to maximize profits and the probability of block rights.\n\nBy quantifying bid timing, latency optimization, order flow sources, and transaction bundles, Thiery\u2019s work exposes the competitive dynamics eroding Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ethos.\n\nThe data proves that economic incentives drive builders toward consolidation, cooperation, and specialization in the relentless quest for profits.\n\nAccording to Thiery, left unchecked, these trends stand to undermine Ethereum\u2019s core value proposition \u2013 a world computer operated by a distributed web of stakeholders, not an oligarchy of elites.\n\nThiery\u2019s research illuminates the reality of block building today, setting the stage for informed dialogue on potential solutions. The coming sections distill vital insights from his analysis into an accessible synopsis for the crypto community.\n\nThe lucrative world of block creation\n\nCreating new blocks on blockchain networks like Ethereum is carried out by builders who compete to package transactions into blocks and earn profits in two primary ways:\n\nCollecting Transaction Fees\n\nThe first source of revenue stems from packaging transactions into a block and collecting the associated fees. When users submit transactions to the network, they can optionally specify a \u201cgas price,\u201d which compensates the builder for executing their transaction. The total fees collected from all transactions in a block represent one revenue stream for builders.\n\nOptimizing this requires efficiently packing in as many valuable transactions as possible from the public mempool queue. Builders develop algorithms and strategies to maximize the cumulative fee revenue from each block they construct.\n\nProfiting from Arbitrage Bundles\n\nThe second, more lucrative revenue source involves arbitrage opportunities that exploit market inefficiencies. Specialized \u201csearchers\u201d identify arbitrages like price discrepancies between exchanges, then bundle the transactions required to capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nThese exclusive bundles, often involving a centralized exchange, are transmitted directly to the builder rather than the public mempool. Builders can collect a portion of the profitable spread by including arbitrage bundles in a block.\n\nSome builders form exclusive partnerships with searchers to gain access to these private bundles, which studies indicate provide approximately 80% of total builder revenue. The most common and profitable arbitrage identified involves exchanges between centralized and decentralized platforms.\n\nStrategies for Block Building Supremacy\n\nBy leveraging technical expertise and strategic partnerships, blockchain builders employ complex strategies to optimize profits from block construction.\n\nUnderstanding the incentives and competitive dynamics provides insights into centralization risks and informs mechanisms to improve system decentralization.\n\nAccording to Thiery\u2019s examination of block construction dynamics, builders utilize various approaches to maximize their profits and probability of winning block rights. Thiery\u2019s work elucidates builder behavior and its implications by analyzing bid timing, efficiency optimizations, order flow sources, and profitable arbitrage strategies.\n\nBuilders increase their bids as Ethereum\u2019s 12-second slot progresses to incorporate additional transactions and extractable value. However, most winning bids occur toward the end of the slot, consistent with consensus protocols.\n\nBuilders optimize latency and efficiency differently \u2013 some entities submit bids frequently to beat competitors, while others focus on seamless block assembly. Occasional bid cancellations also appear to serve as a tactic for concealing or adjusting value.\n\nQuantifying Centralization Risk\n\nExclusive transaction bundles from searcher partners account for around 80% of builder revenue, outweighing public mempool transactions. Specifically, Thiery wrote,\n\n\u201cExclusive transactions represent 30% of the transaction count, but account for 80% of the total value paid to builders. This supports the hypothesis that the majority of valuable transactions generating MEV are packaged into bundles and transferred exclusively from searchers to builders.\u201d\n\nThis highlights the importance of strategic partnerships and vertical integration in attaining proprietary order flow.\n\nArbitrages between centralized and decentralized exchanges proved the most profitable among the transaction types analyzed. One specialized builder won over 60% of these transactions, exemplifying the maximization and centralization risks of over-optimization.\n\nThiery concludes that quantifying the strategies and behaviors of builders can inform the construction of profiles that evaluate and address centralization tendencies.\n\nThe data proves that incentives lead builders toward consolidation, cooperation, and specialization \u2013 limiting decentralization. Mechanisms that encourage diversity of techniques and providers may counteract these forces.\n\nOverall, the trends identified by Thiery highlight that prospering in this high-stakes environment necessitates exploiting latency, partnerships, exclusivity, and focus \u2013 with implications for global network structure. Understanding these issues can enlighten solutions.\n\nBuilders\u2019 Behavioral Profiles (BBPs)\n\nBy peering behind the curtain of Ethereum\u2019s block-building ecosystem, Thiery\u2019s work sounds an alarm for the community.\n\nEconomic forces and incentives usher this domain toward greater centralization, cooperation, and consolidation amongst profitable entities. Left unaddressed, the drift contradicts the guiding vision of a decentralized world computer.\n\nYet hope remains \u2013 armed with data-driven insights into builder behavior, Ethereum developers and researchers can illuminate the way forward. Thiery posits a Builders\u2019 Behavioral Profiles (BBPs) model with many metrics. These encapsulate bid timing, advancements in latency, bid withdrawal, access to order flow, and MEV strategies and extend to aspects like on-chain and CEX-DEX arbitrages, sandwiches, and liquidation.\n\nThiery also expressed his hope that the community will amplify the utility of BBPs by integrating new metrics and characteristics to shed light on the function of builders in their interactions with searchers, relays, and validators. According to him, this is a crucial move towards developing sturdy mechanisms that curb tendencies towards centralization and foster an equitable and proficient supply network."

The revelation comes as a surprise to many, as the former president has previously expressed his disdain for digital assets.\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is most likely connected to Trump\u2019s NFT (non-fungible token) collection, which was launched in December 2022. The limited collection has a total of 44,000 Trump-themed trading cards. The entire collection sold out in just one day, netting over $8.9 million in sales. The former president earned about $298,000 in licensing fees. Moreover, the earnings were collected in the same wallet that received the licensing fees.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump\u2019s Bitcoin Rejection Followed 155% Profit Opportunity\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Ethereum holdings are surprising, given that the former U.S. President has previously said that he is \u201cnot a big fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d However, given that the ETH has come from his NFT collection sales, it might not reflect any change in his views about crypto in general. Nonetheless, a former president holding Ethereum (ETH) is still a positive development for the industry.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nThe U.S. Presidential election is just around the corner. On the Republican front, Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have both been very vocal about their support for crypto. Ron Desantis, the Florida governor, has vowed to end the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cwar on Bitcoin\u201d if elected.\n\nOn the democratic front, candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been very open about his support for cryptocurrencies. He has revealed that he and his family own about 14 Bitcoins (BTC), which are currently worth about $411,432, similar to Donald Trump\u2019s Ethereum value.\n\nAlso Read: X Fined $350,000 For Not Allowing Access to Trump Records\n\nTherefore, it seems that both Democrats and Republicans have crypto on their agendas for the 2025 Presidential elections, which is no surprise considering that Americans are the largest investors in crypto, by number, in the world."

        "content": "Understanding the differences between Polkadot (DOT) vs Ethereum (ETH) is a smart way to improve your overall trading skills. Anyone who has traded crypto for a significant period of time can tell you that Polkadot and Ethereum are two projects with significant followings in the market. Both of these blockchains provide secure smart contract programmability with full support for DeFi (decentralized finance) Dapps.\n\nWhile these networks serve similar roles, they operate in a very different manner. Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts to the market successfully. This network remains a pioneering force in the industry. However, it does lack in terms of scalability and functionality compared to today's latest networks. Here\u2019s some insight into the Polkadot (DOT) vs Ethereum (ETH) debate.\n\nShared History\n\nThe first thing to understand is that Ethereum and Polkadot share a history. If Ethereum never succeeded, it is very likely that Polkadot would have never been an idea. This assumption can be made because Polkadot was founded by Ethereum co-developer, Gavin Wood.\n\nWood, who operated as the CTO and core developer on the protocol is one of the most recognizable and respected developers in the market. He invented the Solidity programming language which remains a core component of Ethereum. In early 2016, Wood decided to leave Ethereum to create a blockchain suited to the direction he saw the market heading. Polkadot was born out of this desire.\n\nWhat is Polkadot?\n\nPolkadot is a flexible decentralized network designed to connect blockchains securely. Developers can connect networks using Polkadot as a secure connectivity layer. The network enables developers to decide how much integration to leverage. This technical structure makes it easier to build Dapps. It introduces some new concepts to the crypto market which enables the network to offer lower fees and easier programmability.\n\nParity Technologies is the official company behind the project. This group originally operated as EthCore. In October 2017, the network hosted an ICO (initial coin offering) that secured $245 million. The ICO made headlines as one of the largest to date.\n\nIn 2018, Polkadot launched its testnet successfully and secured additional funding from the Web3 Foundation to further the network. Later in the year ChainSafe and Soramitsu received grants to implement the Polkadot Runtime Environment in Go and C++. Today, Polkadot encompasses a large ecosystem with new developers and users joining the network daily.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum launched in 2013 as an early comer to the market. Vitalik Buterin is Ethereum\u2019s founder and lead developer. He launched the protocol with the goal to streamline Dapp development and drive blockchain adoption. Like Polkadot, Ethereum hosted one of the largest ICOs of its time. The network raised $18 million from 11,000 international investors. This funding helped the network become what it is today.\n\nEthereum changed the market forever, as it switched the focus of cryptocurrencies from acting as money to supporting Dapps. Decentralized applications are a key component of the blockchain sector. Interestingly, Ethereum is often confused with its utility token ETHER (ETH). Ether is the token that enables smart contracts to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum is the world's largest Dapp ecosystem and the second-largest PoW (Proof-of-Work) in the world. Ethereum has seen considerable growth as the DeFi movement has leveraged its proven security. Today, Ethereum is the largest DeFi network in operation. The protocol remains a top choice for developers. However, there are some technical restrictions the network suffers from.\n\nWhat Problems was Polkadot (DOT) Built to Alleviate?\n\nPolkadot was built to provide an alternative to Ethereum that offered lower fees and more scalability. Polkadot integrates a sharded infrastructure to accomplish this task. Additionally, It enables developers to leverage multiple blockchains securely to build next-gen applications. To achieve this task, the network introduces the concept of parachains and parathreads.\n\nWhat Problems was Ethereum (ETH) Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was built to simplify Dapp development. It was the first protocol to introduce smart contract scripting functionality to decentralized networks. The developers wanted to make it easy for people to enter the ecosystem. As such, they made Ethereum flexible in terms of programming languages. Ethereum developers may use C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.\n\nHow Does Polkadot Work?\n\nPolkadots uses parachains and apartheids to improve interoperability in the blockchain sector. Parachains are sovereign blockchains. They may have their own features, services, consensus, and tokens. These networks may also create their own governance systems. Parachains are best suited for specific use case scenarios.\n\nParathreads are networks that are designed to service Dapps that only require minimum blockchain integration. These networks operate on a pay-as-you-go model. This approach lowers the overall cost of integrating blockchain networks into most applications. Polkadot also integrates special bridges to communicate data between private and public networks.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network that relies on miners to approve transactions and validate the state of the network. Developers create programs called smart contracts that execute within the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The cost of executing these programs is called gas. The more complex the smart contract and the higher the gas fees.\n\nEthereum is in the middle of a significant upgrade. The network will shift to Ethereum V2 in the coming months. This switch will include a change to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This maneuver will lower the operating costs and validation costs for the network. Currently, Ethereum has record-high gas fees.\n\nScalability\n\nPolkadot is a high-performance blockchain that can handle over 1000 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum supports 13-30 transactions per second in its current state. It\u2019s also far cheaper to send DOT compared to ETH at the moment.\n\nTokens\n\nPolkadot uses the DOT Token as part of its electronic payments system and decentralized smart contract environment. The token is flexible in that it can be staked to secure passive returns. You can also use it to participate in the Polkadot DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). This feature enables users to put forth proposals and upgrades to the network. The community votes on the changes, with approved measures funded from the community chest.\n\nEthereum relies on ETH as its main utility token. This successful coin is one of the most widely accepted cryptos in the world. Users can stake and farm ETH to secure ROIs. ETH token holders can put significant updates to a vote between miners. The protocol will also leverage off-chain communications and support methods to get changes introduced.\n\nHow to Buy Polkadot (DOT) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Polkadot (DOT) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nPolkadot (DOT) vs Ethereum (ETH)\n\nLike an epic tale of titans in Greek mythology, Polkadot vs Ethereum pits two close relatives against each other. Both of these networks can provide you with the services needed to create powerful Dapps to serve clientele. Additionally, both have proven to be long-term projects to watch. For these reasons, it\u2019s smart to hold both of these tokens in your portfolio.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Polkadot (DOT) and Investing in Ethereum (ETH) guides."

        "title": "Dogecoin Vs. Ethereum \u2013 What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Savvy traders take the time to learn the differences between Dogecoin and Ethereum. These projects are both titans in the market, with each having changed the crypto-sphere considerably since being introduced. Here is everything you need to know about Dogecoin Vs. Ethereum\n\nWhat is Dogecoin?\n\nDogecoin entered the market in 2013 and is widely credited as the first meme coin to gain mainstream popularity. The history of this unique project is filled with twists and turns. Many people are surprised to learn that Dogecoin began as a joke. The token was made by a group of creditors to poke fun at the seriousness of die-hard Bitcoiners.\n\nLike most first-generation cryptocurrencies, the token borrows most of its technical features from Bitcoin. Dogecoin's developers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus have stated that it only took a couple of hours to make the token. They reportedly started by taking Bitcoin\u2019s coding and switching out all references from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.\n\nChanges\n\nOf course, the project isn't a direct copy. The developers added some interesting upgrades to the consensus mechanism to improve Dogecoin's scalability. This strategy also helped to drive decentralization in the ecosystem. Dogecoin has had an interesting history with celebrities driving more attention to the projects as of late.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum entered the market one year after year after Dogecoin in 2014. Unlike Dogecoin, the network marked a huge upgrade in the capabilities of blockchain networks. The network ushered in the age of smart contract programmability. Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nSecond Generation Blockchain\n\nEthereum can be regarded as the first second-generation blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, its primary purpose was not to serve as electronic cash, but rather, as a programmable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). This strategy forever changed the crypto market, with nearly every blockchain today having some form of smart contract programmability.\n\nEthereum is arguably the most innovative cryptocurrency in terms of pioneering market-altering maneuvers. For example, the network is the largest Dapp and DeFi ecosystem in the world. Ethereum deserves recognition for driving the 2017 breakout of crypto with the release of \u2018ERC20' \u2013 a token standard that provides users with an affordable way to create tokens for the first time.\n\nICO Rush\n\nThis development resulted in a rush of new tokens entering the market. For example, there are over 300,000 ERC-20 tokens in circulation today. Ethereum remains the most popular Dapp and DeFi network.\n\nThe protocol is still the reigning king even though it's slower, less capable, and more expensive than newer protocols. The simple fact that Ethereum remains secure and has so much liquidity makes it a smart choice for many applications despite its shortcomings.\n\nWhat Problems Was Dogecoin Built to Alleviate?\n\nDogecoin was designed to tackle a serious issue in the crypto market \u2013 a lack of fun. It's too easy to drown new users out about blockchain assets and their security and efficiency, but that doesn\u2019t spark interest or entertain people. Dogecoin leveraged the adorableness of one of the world's most popular memes to connect with people on a personal level.\n\nDogecoin provided a faster alternative to Bitcoin when it was released. The developers altered the consensus mechanism from the SHA-256 version to a script-based option. This maneuver improved the protocol's speed and responsiveness. It also ensured that miners couldn\u2019t use ASIC miners to mine the network at first, which led to sustained decentralization.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was meant to create more usability within the blockchain sector. The team behind the project wanted to leverage the computing power of blockchains further. They quickly realized that the market needed a reliable and easy-to-use infrastructure. Ethereum provided this to the market and has been the go-to blockchain for developers ever since.\n\nEthereum was made to be more scalable than the competition at the time. The network can handle 15 transactions per second. This tps rate may seem slow compared to today's high-performance networks but it was faster than competitors when it launched. Currently, the network is in the middle of a major conversion from PoW to PoS.\n\nHow Does Dogecoin Work?\n\nDogecoin operates as a layer 1 blockchain. The protocol leverages a network of nodes that secure the network and validate transactions. The system enables users to send value internationally in a permissionless manner.\n\nDOGE is the cryptocurrency for the network. Uniquely, DOGE has seen serious support from some of the most famous people in the world. For example, one of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk, has Tweeted multiple times in support of the token. The token has also seen support from famous musicians including Kiss singer Gene Simmons and rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum currently uses a PoW system that relies on miners to validate the state of the blockchain. Developers can leverage various Ethereum standards and tools to streamline their creative efforts. For example, the ERC-20 tokens standard is the most popular in the world. There are also specific standards for token types such as security tokens, stablecoins, and NFTs (nonfungible tokens).\n\nTrader Confusion\n\nMany people get the crypto Ether (ETH) and its blockchain Ethereum confused. Ethereum is the network that supports the utility token ETH. This confusion is forgivable as it has now become common to refer to Ether as Ethereum for most traders. Interestingly, the planned Ethereum 2.0 update will improve the network's scalability considerably.\n\nThis maneuver is considered necessary by many as Ethereum has high gas fees at the moment. These fees have made it expensive for users to participate in the network. It has also driven developers to seek out lower-cost alternatives in the market.\n\nHow to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

(Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nDogecoin Vs. Ethereum \u2013 Old School Cryptos Keeping it Fresh\n\nNow that you know the differences between Dogecoin (DOGE) vs Ethereum (ETH), you can easily see is how each of these projects fits into your trading strategy. Both tokens have proven to be resilient. As such, there is potential for long-term profitability.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Dogecoin and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "Cosmos Vs. Ethereum - What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "After the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, developers from all over the world started getting interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. For years, they were trying to make new projects on their own blockchains, sometimes as a fork of Bitcoin\u2019s own chain, and sometimes building a new chain from scratch.\n\nHowever, since these were literally the earliest days of crypto and blockchain, most of those chains were very similar to the original ones. Some were a bit faster than Bitcoin\u2019s, or more scalable, but in the end, the differences were minimal. This changed in 2015 with the launch of Ethereum, which revolutionized the blockchain sector by pointing out its other use cases, such as the ability to store code.\n\nThis led to the creation of smart contracts, and through them, to the creation of numerous new blockchain products, countless projects, and a new era of unique use cases and experimentation with this technology, whose potential suddenly seemed limitless.\n\nOver time, Ethereum\u2019s own network started seeing issues, particularly when it comes to scalability and processing speed, with countless projects and trends launching on top of it, and little to no improvements in its performance. The end result was a rise in fees, as everyone wanted their transaction to be processed first, so they started offering more and more money to the validators in hopes that their transaction will be the most attractive. This led to such high fees that many started leaving Ethereum because they simply couldn\u2019t afford to pay the fees anymore.\n\nOf course, they were still not interested in abandoning the crypto/blockchain industry, which is why they started seeking other, more affordable chains with high functionalities, and Cosmos (ATOM) emerged as an interesting solution. Over time, there have been multiple comparisons of the two chains, which led many to ask whether these are similar blockchains. The simple answer is that they are not. However, to understand the long version, we should first look into what Ethereum and Cosmos are, and how they work.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that runs its own native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). However, it also works as a platform for countless other cryptocurrencies and projects thanks to the fact that it introduced token models, such as ERC-20. This is a utility token model, and it allowed developers to quickly and easily create their own token without having to build it from scratch, unlike the devs from the early days.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts and its platform was the first-ever blockchain smart contract platform. These are self-executed, immutable computer programs that can serve as a way for two or more parties to reach agreements, but their more complex use cases include running decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and more.\n\nEthereum\u2019s principal innovation lies in its platform\u2019s design, which allows the execution of smart contracts using blockchain technology. There is no need for expensive intermediaries, just a contract with specified terms that is triggered on its own once the terms have been met.\n\nIn addition to smart contracts, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain also hosts other cryptocurrencies, which are called tokens. Each token is a separate protocol, but they all use Ethereum\u2019s network, and they can be tied to other products, such as DeFi protocols, metaverse projects, and more. Apart from the mentioned utility tokens, Ethereum has other token models, such as the ERC-721 model which is used for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAbout Cosmos\n\nOn the other hand, we have Cosmos (ATOM), which is a project that aims to solve some of the problems that projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin have been facing. Specifically, these involve performance-affecting issues, such as the lack of scalability, low transaction throughput, long waiting periods, high fees, and the eco-harmful impact that these networks have due to their reliance on Proof-Of-Work algorithm, which requires massive amounts of electricity and processing power.\n\nCosmos has a series of goals, but it primarily focuses on making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers, and it can achieve this through a modular framework, that demystifies dApps. It also features an Interblockchain Communication protocol, which allows blockchain networks to communicate with each other. At the same time, the Cosmos ecosystem is a rather complex network itself.\n\nThere is a lot going on in its ecosystem, but its advanced technology allows it all to function without hiccups, and its architecture allows for high amounts of activity without burdening the network so much to affect it in the way Ethereum was affected.\n\nThe main question now is how do they compare, and can they be compared in the first place?\n\nCosmos vs Ethereum\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the Cosmos blockchain is not Ethereum\u2019s competitor, unlike other major chains, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Cosmos does not wish to replace Ethereum, nor is its technology designed in a way that would encourage the pursuit of this.\n\nInstead, it provides complimentary blockchain development frameworks that were created for the devs on the network, and they allow the developers to launch their own blockchains. This is a completely different kind of service that the Ethereum blockchain does not offer at this time.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there are blockchains launched in Cosmos\u2019 ecosystem that do aim to replace Ethereum, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Cosmos itself has this goal.\n\nThe best way to explain what they are and what the relationship between the two is like would be the following:\n\nEthereum is a general-use blockchain where the devs can build side chains that use smart contracts to make changes to Ethereum's blockchain. However, the problem with this is that the smart contracts are all general purpose, which makes them limited in functionality. So, more complex projects have to resort to combining multiple basic contracts to achieve the desired functionality for their project.\n\nThis, however, severely increases gas prices, due to the fact that it creates more work for the network, and clogs it, so transaction times get slower. Furthermore, these projects also compete amongst themselves to have their transactions be the next in the first upcoming block, which is why they offer higher fees, which is why the average transaction fee gets extremely high.\n\nThen, there are all other ERC-20 token-based projects that are also governed by Ethereum. Not to mention the proposals that get passed and are expected to make network changes often impact the usage of some other project, which leads to an entire series of other problems. All of this makes Ethereum very slow, very impractical, overly complex, and simply put, it all results in a real mess.\n\nCosmos has invented a different structure for its own projects, which makes things look a lot cleaner, and run a lot smoother.\n\nThe Cosmos Network is an ecosystem that was designed for projects to build their own, native blockchains which are custom-tailored for the project\u2019s needs. The projects also keep the ability to make transactions to other connected blockchains that belong to the Cosmos ecosystem. With all projects running on separate chains that are, generally speaking, almost independent, and still connected, there is a lot less confusion about what is going on, and who will be affected by any potential changes. This also reduces gas costs overall and doesn't throttle transactional throughput.\n\nAs for the matters of governance, each blockchain is free to govern itself with the help of its own community. That way, any proposals that are passed through the voting process will only affect that single blockchain, instead of Cosmos\u2019 entire ecosystem, and potentially disrupt other projects in some way. This also makes it easier and faster to reach a consensus regarding the proposals, as projects don\u2019t have to wait for every other project to get on board and give the green light before the updates are made.\n\nThe Cosmos project itself is completely separate from this concept, and it exists as a blockchain that controls the Cosmos Hub, which is the most widely used structure in the network and connects all of these separate chains into one big network.\n\nHow to Buy Cosmos (ATOM) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Cosmos (ATOM) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nConclusion\n\nWith everything said and done, we can say that Cosmos and Ethereum are not really comparable in a traditional sense. Cosmos does things in a completely different way and with different goals in mind. It has become an internet of blockchains on a small scale, where multiple blockchain projects exist.\n\nEthereum is a network that relies on sidechains that are still depending on its main blockchain, which is where all this traffic that is clogging its network comes from. In the end, we can say that Cosmos is a more efficient and cleaner solution, although Ethereum could still be effective if it were more scalable. Scalability lies at the heart of most of its problems, and solving that issue would bring the project back to glory.\n\nEthereum has been working hard on achieving that, and for a long time now, too. However, the update that is supposed to make it happen, the so-called Ethereum 2.0, is still being implemented, and it will take time for it to fully arrive and make a difference.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Cosmos and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "Fantom Vs. Ethereum \u2013 What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "Learning the differences between Fantom (FTM) and Ethereum (ETH) can be an important step to becoming a more informed trader. Both of these platforms were built to provide a new level of programmability to blockchain developers. However, since these protocols were launched at different times, they are meant to tackle inefficiencies in different networks. Here's everything you need to know about Fantom vs Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Fantom?\n\nFantom (FTM) is a third-generation advanced blockchain. The protocol differs from its predecessors due to the use of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based smart-contracts. The main advantage of this approach is top-notch performance. The goal of the Fantom project was to improve the programmability and flexibility provided to Dapp developers at the time.\n\nThe protocol specifically targets Ethereum developers who suffer from high gas fees and programmability restrictions due to the early nature of the network. Notably, Fantom's developers envision the protocol operating like a central nervous system for smart cities and other web 3.o applications in the future.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the first second-generation blockchain to enter the market. The protocol changed the game with the introduction of smart-contract programmability. Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin. It improves on its predecessors by enhancing scalability and functionality. The main difference is that Ethereum was designed to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s shortcomings whereas Fantom focuses on Ethereum\u2019s issues.\n\nEthereum was one of the first cryptocurrencies to hit the market. The protocol revolutionized the sector as the first smart contract programmable platform available. Ethereum has remained a pioneer in the sector. In 2017, they made the ERC-20 token standard which ushered in the 2017 crypto revolution and ICO (Initial Coin Offering) movement.\n\nEthereum has endured SEC investigations and a constant bombardment of competitors. Despite its technical limitations, the Ethereum ecosystem operates as the largest Dapp and DeFi environment in the world. As such, nearly all new blockchains include smart contract programmability.\n\nWhat Problems Was Fantom Built to Alleviate?\n\nFantom seeks to transform the market through its technical advantages. The system provides users access to an all-in-one DeFi ecosystem. This approach makes it easier for new users to enter the market. In this way, Fantom seeks to improve adoption rates. Fantom reduces gas fees for both developers and users. Gas fees are the cost of paying network nodes to conduct transactions and execute smart contracts. Comparingly, Fantom users pay much lower fees than Ethereum due to the network's consensus mechanisms and structure.\n\nThe protocol has near-zero fees for transactions making it an ideal selection for Dapps users. Additionally, Fantom is more energy efficient than Ethereum. The developers took great care to make Fantom sustainable. As part of this strategy, it does away with power-hungry miners. Eliminating miners makes the network have a much smaller carbon footprint compared to PoW (proof-of-Work) networks.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum tackled many of the biggest problems of 2013-2014. At that time, cryptocurrencies were just that \u2013 currencies that served little other purpose. Buterin saw a need to provide programmability to these powerful computer networks. Ethereum introduced the first affordable blockchain infrastructure solution to the market.\n\nEthereum was ahead of its time. When it launched, Bitcoin had set the benchmark at 7 transactions per second. Ethereum doubled that at around 14 tps. The network was also much cheaper to transact on because Bitcoin suffered from crushing congestion prior to its SegWit upgrade and the introduction of the Lightning Network.\n\nOne of the biggest issues that Ethereum conquered was the anxiety of developers converting from centralized systems to decentralized networks. Ethereum showed that these protocols could be hosted securely and create revenue. As the demand for Ethereum Dapps grew, so did the developer community. Today, Ethereum users enjoy more options and functionalities than the competition.\n\nHow Does Fantom Work?\n\nFantom was designed utilizing a multi-layered approach. This strategy is common in third-generation and newer blockchains. The system leverages a layer called the Opera Core to remain valid. This layer is where the nodes validate transactions and add them to the ledger. The next layer is the Opera Ware Layer.\n\nThe Opera Ware Layer serves a vital role as the execution protocol. This layer is where rewards and payment data go. The layer's Story Data system improves the performance of the network by reducing the number of nodes needed to verify transactions. It streamlines tracking the past actions of the network as well. The Application Layer is where most users will interact with the network. This layer enables access to the rest of the network. It is also responsible for interactions such as APIs and Dapps.\n\nfMint\n\nOne of the coolest features of Fantom is fMint. This system makes it easy to create new digital assets. Additionally, Fantom leverages a multi-token environment. The network uses FTM as its utility token. There are also sFTMs that operate as synthetic assets. Lastly, fUSD is the network's stablecoin. Together these assets enable users to enjoy full DeFi capabilities when using the protocol.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum is currently a PoW protocol. The network relies on miners to approve transactions and the overall state of the blockchain. Miners receive rewards for their efforts in the form of Ether (EHT), the network's utility token. Ethereum is in the midst of its largest update yet, ETH 2.0.\n\nETH 2.0\n\nThe upgrade would convert the network to a PoS (Proof-of-Stake) protocol. This maneuver would eliminate the need to use miners and improve the scalability of the network. Notably, you need to stake 32 ETH to become a validation node. Those who want to participate, but hold less ETH, can use staking pools to still gain exposure to the profits.\n\nEthereum developers can create using a variety of token standards. The ERC-20 token standard is by far the most popular. There are hundreds of thousands of ERC-20 tokens in circulation currently. The network also supports NFTs, security tokens, and more. One of the things that make Ethereum so successful is its sheer selection. The size of the network is unmatched.\n\nHow to Buy Fantom (FTM) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Fantom (FTM) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "For the last 13 and a half years, since the launch of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has been captivating the minds of developers from all over the world. Even more so after 2015, with the launch of Ethereum. While Bitcoin did introduce the blockchain, for the next six years of its existence, it was only used for recording transactions.\n\nOnly after Ethereum\u2019s launch and the discovery that blockchain can also record code did its development truly start. This led to the creation of smart contracts, and through them \u2014 every other product that blockchain has to offer today, including token models, dApps, DeFi, metaverse, and more.\n\nOf course, this still did not perfect blockchain technology. Instead, some of the most pressing issues remained, such as the lack of scalability. Even Ethereum suffers from this problem. In fact, many would say that Ethereum is the prime example of this problem, with such a busy network and the inability to scale.\n\nHowever, the blockchain industry could not survive with this issue troubling its blockchains, which is why developers started working on finding the solution, which led to the launch of projects such as Hedera Hashgraph. Today, we wanted to see what Hedera has to offer, and to compare it with Ethereum and see just how different the two projects really are.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nTo start off, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum first. Launched in 2015 as the crypto industry\u2019s first development platform, rather than a simple digital ledger, Ethereum has introduced smart contracts which led to the creation of the crypto world\u2019s largest ecosystem to date. With the introduction of the ability to build on it, the Ethereum network soon started attracting developers from all corners of the world.\n\nThe developers would use its technology to create new cryptocurrencies, develop decentralized applications, and over time, more complex products emerged. All of this made Ethereum\u2019s network extremely rich, and extremely busy, which is why it definitely deserves to be the world\u2019s largest altcoin, and the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin is, without a doubt, the slowest blockchain where scalability virtually doesn\u2019t exist due to its 7 TPS, Ethereum is not much better with 15 TPS. In the early days while it only had a handful of users, everything was perfectly fine, as the network could handle their transactions. These days, however, with thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of users from all over the world, Ethereum simply can\u2019t cope with demand.\n\nNow, in the crypto industry, users need to pay a transaction fee when conducting transactions. But, they also get to choose how much they wish to pay. However, as they discovered after a while, the transactions with the largest fees tend to be processed first, so everyone who was in a hurry to have their payment verified would pay a high fee. This led to people increasing the fee that they were paying, so those who were in a hurry had to start paying even more, only for the rest of the community to follow.\n\nThis is how the average fee grew to the levels where it no longer makes sense to pay it, as it often exceeded the value of the transaction itself. In other words, users could no longer afford to even use Ethereum, which is why alternative chains started being created. Among them, we have Hedera Hashgraph.\n\nAbout Hedera Hashgraph\n\nHedera Hashgrapsh was founded through an ICO in mid-2018, emerging as a sustainable, enterprise-grade public network meant to drive the decentralized economy that allows individuals and businesses alike to create powerful decentralized applications.\n\nHowever, seeing the issues on Ethereum and Bitcoin, the project\u2019s developers designed it to be a more efficient system that would eliminate the limitations of these older platforms, including instability and slow performance.\n\nOriginally, Hedera launched open access to its mainnet only a year after its ICO, in September 2019. Meanwhile, its native token, HBAR, is used for powering the network and its services, including smart contracts, file storage, regular transactions, and alike. HBAR is also used for securing the network through staking.\n\nEthereum vs Hedera Hashgraph\n\nSo, how do these two very similar, and yet very different chains compare?\n\nTo start with Ethereum \u2014 this blockchain has been the inception of modern blockchain technology. It emerged as a decentralized public ledger with two main components \u2014 a native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and its own programming language called Solidity.\n\nEthereum introduced a variety of concepts that did not exist before, which makes it the first of its kind. Meanwhile, the project\u2019s users from all over the world could access it, create, publish, monetize, and use dApps, and in doing so, enrich its entire ecosystem. Before long, Ethereum became a haven for creating and sharing applications, financial services, business, and more. In this sense, Hedera is not much different from Ethereum\u2019s network. However, it does have several basic technical differences that make a huge difference in the long run.\n\nThe first major difference to note is that Hedera Hashgraph operates across the hashgraph consensus algorithm. It functions as a public distributed ledger, with a governing body created to support new and existing dApps at large scale.\n\nAnother major difference between the two projects is the hashgraph consensus algorithm. Hashgraph basically changes the concept of pruning in blockchain, and replaces it with weaving in the DLT sector. It controls the branches of the blocks and puts them back into the ledger\u2019s body, ensuring that everything across the blockchain functions in perfect order.\n\nThis is already a significant improvement over Ethereum\u2019s PoW algorithm that selects one single miner who will choose the next block. Hedera has significantly changed this entire concept with the hashgraph algorithm, as the project believes that the community of nodes needs to agree on which transactions should be allowed.\n\nHow to Buy Hedera (HBAR) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Hedera (HBAR) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is, without a doubt, the second most important crypto project that was ever invented, immediately after Bitcoin. Bitcoin started the crypto industry, but Ethereum and its products are responsible for the crypto/blockchain world that we have today, with all the different trends and products available to us today.\n\nWithout it, we would simply have a bunch of copies of BTC, and nothing else \u2014 no DeFi, no metaverse, no NFTs, or even dApps. However, even with that said, Ethereum has its flaws, and while it is working towards resolving them, it is still questionable how much success it can have.\n\nHedera and other chains that offer greater scalability have already eliminated all of these issues permanently, and we know for a fact that they have adequate levels of scalability. In other words, while we have a lot to be thankful for when it comes to Ethereum, its role in the future of crypto has yet to be decided."

        "title": "Shiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0 - What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "The discussion of Shiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0 compares the largest DeFi ecosystem against a popular meme coin with DeFi features. Both networks offer scalability and advanced services. Here are the differences between Shiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0.\n\nWhat is Shiba Inu?\n\nShiba Inu launched in 2020 to much publicity. The token takes inspiration from the meme coin movements leader Dogecoin and introduces a lot of other features that make it more advanced than its predecessors.\n\nShiba Inu isn't a knockoff of Dogecoin and was launched as a Dogecoin killer. It's a complete DeFi ecosystem that offers users a variety of features like staking. The Shiba Inu project took the unique approach of pricing tokens for fractions of a cent.\n\nThe goal of this approach was to enable anyone to purchase and hold millions of tokens. The goal is that the ecosystem will grow to push the token's value to $1. At that point, all the holders would see significant windfalls.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum 2.0 is the latest upgrade made to the hugely popular Ethereum blockchain. This was the largest upgrade to date. It converted the PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus mechanism to a PoS (Proof-of-Stake) network.\n\nThe upgrade placed Ethereum in line with fourth-generation competitors by expanding scalability and lowering energy consumption. Ethereum today is the largest DeFi ecosystem and remains a pioneer in the market.\n\nWhat Problems Was Shiba Inu Built to Alleviate?\n\nShiba Inu was designed to solve a couple of main issues in the market. The token takes cues from Dogecoin in that it leverages the popular Shiba Inu meme to help make the project more relatable. Meme coins combine society's moments with humor.\n\nShiba Inu brings DeFi functionality to the meme coin sector. For the longest time, meme coins were only seen as a comical way to conduct crypto transactions. Today's advanced meme coins combine DeFi features to produce ROIs.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum 2.0 Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum 2.0 was designed to alleviate the congestion issues of the original Ethereum network. Additionally, it was the first network to introduce smart contract support. However, the network was designed as a PoW network which required a lot of energy to secure.\n\nEthereum 2.0 eliminates high energy consumption. There are no more miners needed to validate the network. Instead, users can stake their tokens which can be more democratic while providing rewards.\n\nHow Does Shiba Inu Work?\n\nShiba Inu is an ERC-20-compliant network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages a non-custodial design, a high-performance DEX, multiple DeFi services, and tokens to provide a unique combination of passive income options.\n\nThe ShibSwap exchange is where users can trade their SHIB for other tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem. This non-custodial exchange provides near real-time transactions and scalability. Users can leverage the platform using an ERC-20 compatible wallet which makes it easy to onboard.\n\nSHIB\n\nSHIB serves multiple roles in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It's the utility token that is tasked with fees and rewards. The token can be staked to secure passive returns and may be used as a cryptocurrency.\n\nLeash\n\nLEASH is a secondary token that Shiba Inu users can hold to leverage the price of DOGE on the ETH blockchain. The LEASH token operates as a store of value assets with a limited supply. The token re-bases every day at 6:30 AM UTC to 1000/1 the price of DOGE.\n\nHow Does Ethereum 2.0 Work?\n\nEthereum 2.0 adds Sharding technology to the ecosystem. Sharding is a method of storing data that improves performance. Sharded blockchains can scale much faster than non-sharded options.\n\nEthereum 2.0 improves programmability in a variety of ways. The network is now able to be programmed in languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more. These options improve Dapp creation and enable more developers to participate.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Serenity\n\nThe upgraded version of Ethereum has more sustainability compared to its previous version. Ethereum 2.0 does away with power-hungry miners. These nodes can drive up the energy requirements of the network to new heights. Ethereum 2.0 is all about reducing the carbon footprint.\n\nThe network upgrade increases bandwidth as a way to improve scalability further. This expansion was needed to support the massive amount of new DeFi and GameFi protocols launching on the blockchain.\n\nEthereum Validator Nodes\n\nAnyone can qualify to be a validator node with the new Ethereum setup. They simply need to meet the minimum staking requirements. These requirements are set at 32 ETH at this time. Those who don't have that much ETH can still stake using staking pools.\n\nETH\n\nETH (Ether) is the utility token for the network. This token is required to execute smart contracts and transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. It's common for people to confuse Ethereum the blockchain with Ether the utility token.\n\nETH is one of the top-performing blockchain assets and is the utility token for the most popular DeFi network in the world. Ethereum also leads the world in token launches, NFTs, and a variety of other crucial stats. As such, it remains a staple in the crypto community.\n\nHow to Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nShiba Inu vs. Ethereum 2.0 \u2013 Son vs Father\n\nIt's difficult to compare Shiba Inu to Ethereum as the network is built atop Ethereum. Shiba Inu adds a fun twist to the DeFi movement which helps to bring new users into the fold. On the other hand, the latest version of Ethereum 2.0 can take on the tasks required by advanced DeFi protocols.\n\nWhen comparing the two, Ethereum can be seen as a far better store of value in the long term. However, Shiba Inu's continued network expansion and community growth means that the project is here to stay for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the rise of meme coins again in the market has placed renewed light on the project.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Shiba Inu and Investing in Ethereum guides."

        "title": "VeChain Vs. Ethereum 2.0 - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "VeChain Vs. Ethereum 2.0 is a popular discussion that crypto traders have when attempting to delve deeper into smart contract-capable blockchains. Both of these networks offer fast performance, passive income staking opportunities, and smart contract programmability.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between Ethereum 2.0 Vs. VeChain can help you to improve your effectiveness in the market.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum began as the first smart contract programmable blockchain. This feature changed the market forever as it enabled decentralized networks to run protocols and systems more effectively. The original structure of the Ethereum network leveraged a PoW (Proof of Work) consensus like Bitcoin.\n\nDuring a massive hack during the Ethereum DAO launch, the network founders decided to hardfork the blockchain to prevent the loss of millions in crypto. The decisions led to the creation of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. The latter of which recently converted over to a PoS (Proof of Stake) network as a way to reduce congestion and improve efficiency, which we are calling Ethereum 2.0.\n\nWhat is VeChain\n\nVeChain (VET) seeks to function as a valuable bridge between Defi and Cefi networks. This enterprise-grade blockchain was specifically built to help ease some of the pain points of the logistics sector. The protocol integrates advanced sensors and real-time blockchain consensus to create a new level of logical awareness and planning.\n\nVeChain was created by Sunny Lu and launched on the Ethereum blockchain at first. After raising funds, the network launched its blockchain and tokens.\n\nToday, VeChain offers a way for major corporations to save millions in shipping and logistics. It also supports programming and Dapps.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum 2.0 Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum 2.0 was a major upgrade that was specifically designed to help reduce network congestion and alter consensus. The original structure of Ethereum was designed with a function that increased network fees alongside congestion. This system worked at first because the added fees reduced spam on the blockchain.\n\nWhen Ethereum released the ERC-20 token standard, everything changed. The network became the clear network pioneer in terms of DeFi and token issuance. This added congestion caused the network to lose capabilities due to lag and high fees. The results were that people began to migrate to other competing networks. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade was meant to eliminate these issues and bring the network in line with today's most advanced networks.\n\nEthereum 2.0 does away with the high energy demands of PoW networks. The system uses less energy and is faster. Additionally, anyone can stake their tokens and secure returns if they meet the minimum requirements.\n\nWhat Problems Was VeChain Built to Alleviate?\n\nVeChain helps to resolve several issues that have long hurt the logistics sector. The integration of sensors and the capabilities of the network to provide large-scale real-time tracking of these massive systems helps to alleviate the lack of transparency that occurs in the sector.\n\nUnlike centralized networks, decentralized networks become more responsive as more members join. Consequently, these protocols are great for reducing last-mile issues such as data degradation and delays. VeChain removes centralized choke points from the logistics sector which improves efficiency.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with logistics is the fact that the network is so large and expands the entire globe. When you have such a large network, even processing all the data can cause delays. VeChain integrates multiple steps to enable the tracking of a massive amount of data including quality, authenticity, storage temperature, and geo-location.\n\nHow Does Ethereum 2.0 Work?\n\nThe upgraded version of Ethereum relies on network nodes called validators to remain secure. Anyone can become a validator but they must meet certain criteria. You will need to have reliable internet connections. Secondly, you have to meet the deposit requirements of 32 ETH. Those who can't meet this deposit can leverage staking pools to still secure rewards.\n\nUnlike the previous consensus that required miners to consume massive amounts of electricity, the upgraded model is viewed as being more sustainable. Additionally, some perceive it as more democratic because users do not need to purchase a mining rig or learn new technical skills. These upgrades help to improve Ethereum DeFi capabilities by reducing costs.\n\nToken \u2013 ETH\n\nEther (ETH) is the main utility token for the network. This token can be used as a cryptocurrency but its primary purpose is to function as the main token on the Ethereum blockchain. Developers use ETH to pay for smart contract executions. Regular users pay fees using ETH.\n\nNotably, ETH is one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nHow Does VeChain Work?\n\nVeChain can provide immense upgrades to the logistic sector thanks to the integration of sensors and RFID technology. The use of smart sensors improves all aspects of the logistics sector when coupled with the monitoring capabilities of blockchain tech. VeChain employs smart chips in the form of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags.\n\nThese sensors can monitor and send vital data regarding shipments. Since the data is broadcast in real time, it enables the logistics firm to improve efficiency. VeChain users can see crucial info on shipments including authenticity and its current condition. The network is one of the largest to support IoT (Internet of Things) tech. There are currently billions of IoT devices in the world.\n\nToken \u2013 VET\n\nVET is the main utility token for the VeChain ecosystem. This token is used to send value internationally in a permissionless manner but its primary purpose is to pay for transactions and smart contract executions on the network. VET is a flexible asset and can be found on multiple top CEXs (centralized exchanges).\n\nHow to Buy VeChain (VET) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) and VeChain (VET) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nVeChain Vs. Ethereum 2.0 \u2013 Smart Networks Geared at Different Clientele\n\nWhen you delve deep into the Ethereum 2.0 Vs. VeChain discussion, it becomes obvious that Ethereum is a broad network while Vechain has a niche focus. Both networks can support the Dapp programmability. However, Ethereum has a massive community making it ideal for the average user. In comparison, VeCahain is best suited for enterprise logistic operations.\n\nTo learn more about each of these projects, make sure to visit our Investing in Ethereum 2.0 and Investing in VeChain guides."

        "title": "Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "As an educated crypto investor, it\u2019s crucial you understand the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both of these coins are titans in the market, albeit for different reasons. Both coins are vital for the market's development at this point. Here's what makes these coins so different but, yet so important in the market.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was the world's first successful cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto changed the world when he introduced his revolutionary protocol. His goal was to create a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d that was both censorship-resistant and decentralized.\n\nHe succeeded in his mission when he officially launched Bitcoin in 2009. Since that time, Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth both financially and technologically. However, at its core, it still remains accessible to anyone. Bitcoin changed the world forever and inspired a new industry. For these reasons, you can consider Bitcoin the first generation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin is not stagnant and the protocol continually develops. However, it was built to serve its particular purpose. Consequently, it\u2019s not the best option for features such as smart contracts or other next-gen blockchain functionalities. Notably, the introduction of second-layer protocols such as the Lightning Network expands Bitcoins functionality considerably.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a distributed, public blockchain. This decentralized network introduced the world to smart contract scripting functionality. These protocols allowed anyone to build decentralized applications and expand the use cases for cryptocurrencies. Today, there are thousands of different cryptos and blockchain projects. However, most utilize some forms of smart contracts to streamline network activities.\n\nNot Exactly A Cryptocurrency\n\nIt\u2019s important you understand that Ethereum isn't a cryptocurrency. Ethereum is the platform that the cryptocurrency Ether functions within. This network functions as a programmable decentralized network for Dapp developers primarily. Additionally, Ether's primary role is to compensate miners for performing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) computations.\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency network built specifically to support Dapp development. Dapps are applications designed to run on decentralized networks. The first Dapps ran on decentralized networks such as Tor networks. These networks are censorship-resistant due to their decentralized nature.\n\nDapps that run on blockchain networks are at the core of the blockchain revolution. In this way, Ethereum represented a fundamental shift in the development and functionality of cryptocurrencies moving forward. For these reasons, Ethereum is considered a second-generation cryptocurrency\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nTo execute smart contracts, Ethereum introduces a unique protocol known as the EVM \u2013 the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each full Ethereum node runs an instant of these virtual stacks. The main advantage of EVMs is that they improve the process of building decentralized applications by improving the programmability and efficiency that the network executes contract byte code.\n\nHistory of Ethereum\n\nOne of Bitcoin's early followers was a computer developer by the name of Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, this advantageous individual decided to build a new cryptocurrency. This new project would share many technical characteristics with Bitcoin. For example, both coins utilize a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm to validate the state of the network.\n\nConsensus\n\nBitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 algorithm. This mathematical equation requires miners to prove their work through advanced calculations. The network automatically adjusts its difficulty to ensure that blocks of transactions only get approved in ten-minute intervals. This approach ensures a predictive monetary issuance strategy until the last Bitcoin gets mined sometime in 2140.\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, currently uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol. However, Ethereum uses the Ethash algorithm. Buterin decided on this mechanism to help reduce the advantage of specialized ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) mining rigs. ASIC mining rigs are built from the ground up to solve the SHA-256 algorithm Bitcoin uses. Critics of ASIC miners argue that these high-priced rigs cause centralization in the Bitcoin network.\n\nBlock Times\n\nWhen comparing the transaction thru put of the networks, Ethereum comes out far ahead of Bitcoin. Bitcoin approves blocks every 10 minutes. These blocks hold no more than 1MB of data. Consequently, Bitcoin is only capable of around 7 transactions per second. This low data rate was built into Bitcoin's core coding to ensure that anyone could use the network.\n\nThe Ethereum network is capable of approximately 15 transactions per second. These capabilities are set to improve significantly following the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 update. This upgrade would push Ethereum's capabilities closer to 100,000 transactions per second according to developers.\n\nMining Rewards\n\nThere are different mining rewards paid out to nodes on each network. Bitcoin miners receive a reward of 6.5 BTC if they are the node that completes the SHA-256 equation first and adds the next block to the blockchain. Comparingly, Ethereum miners receive a reward of 2 ETH for their participation in validating blocks of transactions.\n\nTotal Supply \u2013 Bitcoin vs Ethereum\n\nBitcoin caps its supply of 21,000,000 coins. This strategy ensures that Bitcoin retains scarcity in the market. Reversely, there is no cap on the amount of Ether (ETH). The network must continue to produce ETH indefinitely to cover gas fees created by developers executing EVMs. Currently, there are 114,467,625.91 ETH in circulation today.\n\nEthereum to go PoS\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum is set to do a major upgrade this year to Ethereum 2.0. This hard fork would place ETH on a new blockchain that runs on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. PoS networks remove miners and rely on coin holders staking their tokens to validate the network's state.\n\nPoS networks are far more energy-efficient and cheaper to maintain. They also provide faster transaction times compared to PoW networks. Best of all, there is no need to purchase expensive mining equipment because all you need is a network wallet to stake your coins on a PoS system.\n\nThe ETH ICO vs Bitcoin's Launch\n\nBitcoin had a quiet launch that was celebrated by only a select few in the cypherpunk and development community taking any notice of this monumental invention. Interestingly, Bitcoin's journey officially began with the genesis block. This is the first block of Bitcoin's blockchain. While no one knows for sure how many Bitcoins Nakamoto mined, estimates put his rewards at 1 million Bitcoin.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum entered the market with much more fanfare. The Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering) raised $18 million. Ethereum continued this momentum into the launch of the first DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This event took place in April 2016. The launch of the DAO boosted Ethereum's status and helped the network to secure $150 million in its public ICO. At the time, the DAO was the largest crowdfunding event to take place in the blockchain industry.\n\nApples vs Oranges\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of the differences between Bitcoin vs Ethereum, it\u2019s easy to see why both projects have longevity in the sector. As such, most crypto investors hold both of these coins in their portfolios.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Bitcoin and Investing in Ethereum guides.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets."

        "title": "Ethereum Vs. Cardano (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "As the blockchain Dapp battle continues to expand, there has been a lot of debate regarding Ethereum (ETH) vs Cardano (ADA). Both of these platforms were built to support the expansion of Dapps by simplifying programming processes. Notably, Ethereum is the pioneer in the sector as it was the world's first successful programable public blockchain.\n\nRecently, this gen-two blockchain has run into scalability issues. These concerns have fueled interest in alternatives in the market. Consequently, a lot of developers have started to migrate from Ethereum to Cardano in an attempt to avoid congestion and high fees.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a distributed, public blockchain. However, people often use the term to describe Ether, the project's utility token. Ethereum has been pivotal to the overall development of the crypto market in many ways. Aside from introducing the market to smart contract functionalities, it is also the leading network for ICOs, DeFi, and token issuances in the world. Ether is currently the second most popular cryptocurrency according to CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nWhat is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano is a third-generation public blockchain and Dapp development infrastructure. The network was built to rectify some of the limitations and shortcomings of Ethereum. Uniquely, Cardano integrated a number of scientific methodologies to ensure the blockchain was secure and efficient. As such, the network has strong ties to the academic sector. Currently, Cardano's utility token, ADA, is one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nScalability\n\nIn terms of scalability, Ethereum lags behind Cardano. Ethereum's blockchain can handle around 15 transactions per second (tps) in its current state. However, the network is in the middle of a major upgrade that would significantly improve these capabilities. The Ethereum 2.0 update would provide users with 100,000 transactions per second according to company documentation.\n\nIn comparison, Cardano can support around 257 tps. While this is much faster than Ethereum, it still lags behind major payment processors like VISA that support +30,000 tps. Recently, the development team behind Cardano released a paper describing the network's next scaling solution. Hydra is a Layer 2 scaling solution that would enable Cardona to process over one million tps.\n\nConsensus\n\nEthereum relies on an early Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol to validate the state of the network. The protocol integrates the Ethash algorithm. At the time of launch, this was a huge deal because it provided more scalability than Bitcoin and reduced the use of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining rigs.\n\nIn the coming months, Ethereum will complete its migration from a PoW network over to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) project. The migration will improve Ethereum's scalability and reduce its carbon footprint. Additionally, it will enable users to stake their ETH and earn rewards.\n\nOuroboros\n\nCardano introduces a new consensus mechanism known as Ouroboros. Ouroboros is a chain-based PoS protocol that provides lightning-fast transactions. To accomplish this task, the system relies on randomly chosen leaders to approve blocks. The network will select these nodes at the start of each epoch.\n\nEpochs function as a snapshot of the blockchain from a previous date. Using Epochs eliminates the need for nodes to search the entire transaction chain when approving the state of the network. The key to this strategy is to ensure that the epoch originates from a block sufficiently deep in the chain of transactions.\n\nMining\n\nAs a PoW network, Ethereum is reliant on miners to validate blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain. Ethereum miners receive a reward of 2 ETH for their participation in validating blocks of transactions. These rewards are set to half over time like Bitcoin. Additionally, the mining difficulty of the network increases in conjunction with the network's congestion.\n\nAs a PoS, Cardano doesn\u2019t rely on miners to secure the network. PoS networks enable regular users to validate the state of the blockchain by staking their tokens in network wallets. In this way, PoS networks provide a more democratic system to decentralized networks.\n\nProgrammability\n\nEthereum remains the top Dapp development platform for many reasons. One of these reasons is its flexibility in terms of programmability. Ethereum can support smart contracts written in multiple languages. By allowing developers to leverage multiple coding languages, the network enables more participation from the development community. Interestingly, you can program Ethereum smart contracts using C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.\n\nCardano improves on Ethereum's development process with the creation of a full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading functional programming language in the market. Developers can code directly in the Plutus Playground interface. This feature is a lightweight, web-based environment for exploratory ADA smart contract development. Notably, both off-chain and on-chain code for Cardano is written in Haskell.\n\nICOs\n\nEthereum entered the market in a different era. In 2013, the concept of an ICO was still in its fledgling state. The firm secured $18 million from thousands of international participants. Ethereum went on to raise $150 million during its DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) ICO. At that time, this was the largest ICO to date.\n\nIn comparison, Cardano's ICO secured $62 million in 2017 during the height of the first crypto craze. The network received immediate attention due to the fact it was developed by Ethereum co-founders and academic professionals. Cardano entered the market officially on September 29, 2017.\n\nEther (ETH)\n\nEther is the main utility token of the Ethereum networks. The token serves multiple roles within the ecosystem. Notably, Ether's primary role is to compensate miners for performing EVM computations. The more complex the equation, the higher the fee. Additionally, Ether can serve as a cryptocurrency. The coin has a circulating supply of 115,951,040.94 ETH. As the coin is vital for Ethereum's functionality and smart contract capabilities, there is no issuance cap on ETH at this time.\n\nADA Token\n\nADA is Cardano's utility token. Interestingly, the ADA token gets its name from the 19th-century mathematician, Ada Lovelace. Lovelace was the world's first computer programmer. Unlike Ethereum, Cardano has capped the issuance of ADA at 45 coins. There are currently 31.95 billion ADA in circulation.\n\nFounders\n\nEthereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin revolutionized the crypto sphere when he published the project's whitepaper in 2013. In the document, he explains how the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) would function and provide programmability to the sector. He believed his new crypto would be a game-changer because it enabled the programming and use of smart contracts.\n\nIn comparison, Cardona entered service after the crypto market was in full swing. Specifically, Cardano launched during one of its most memorable bull markets in September 2017. Interestingly, Cardano Founders, Jeremy Wood and Charles Hoskinson were both veterans of the Ethereum project. The two had left the network after disagreements emerged surrounding the overall direction of the project.\n\nAdditionally, the developers wanted to avoid some of the issues that Ethereum developers had started to experience due to congestion and the network's overall structure. To accomplish this task, the pair helped develop a number of innovations in language and VM design. These changes are what drive ADA's popularity within the development community today.\n\nDevelopment Teams\n\nEthereum's development is coordinated and implemented by a group of programmers. Specifically, the Ethereum development community includes the Ethereum Foundation, Hyperledger, Nethermind, OpenEthereum, and EthereumJS. Together, this team succeeded in creating the world's largest and most robust Dapp ecosystem of all time.\n\nCardano also relies on a group of developers to remain stable and introduce improvements to the network. Cardano leverages a decentralized team of developers that all work in tandem on projects. To ensure that all the new developments remain compatible, the groups have agreed to utilize set standards.\n\nNon-Profits\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Ethereum protocol. The group helps to cultivate more interest and the expansion of the platform. Notably, the Ethereum Foundation doesn\u2019t provide financial assistance to projects directly.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation serves a very similar role within its respective ecosystem. The foundation is tasked with preserving and protecting the technology that powers the platform. As such, the group is responsible for vital tasks such as promoting standardization in the sector to further interoperability.\n\nWhat's a Better Investment?\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of the differences between Ethereum (ETH) vs Cardano (ADA), you are ready to start your crypto adventure. Both of these projects have thriving development communities and are regarded as premier projects in the market. Of course, Ethereum dominates the sector at this time. However, Cardano offers a combination of features and lower fees that have helped it to cut into Ethereum's market share as of late.\n\nMoving forward, both of these projects have potential upside. Ethereum is set to remain a dominant force moving forward, especially following the completion of its Ethereum 2.0 update. Also, Cardano is set to see rapid expansion as more Ethereum developers expand their horizons into other blockchains in an attempt to avoid high fees and congestion issues. As such, it makes sense to hold both of these projects in your portfolio moving forward.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "Investing In Ethereum Name Service (ENS) - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) provides users with the unique opportunity to create a .eth domain name. The protocol leverages NFT (non-fungible token) technology to create secure credentials on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of the project is to simplify cryptocurrency payments and drive adoption.\n\nWhat Problem Does Ethereum Name Service Solve?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) seeks to alleviate many of the shortcomings of the Internet's Domain Name Service (DNS). For one, the Ethereum name service provides a more efficient and responsive alternative to centralized web options. The use of blockchain technology improves security as well. All transactions are visible via a blockchain explorer.\n\nLack of Privacy\n\nAnother major concern that Ethereum Name Service users avoid is the current lack of privacy in the blockchain sector. As of late, a flood of tracking services and forensic firms has reduced user privacy to its lowest levels since the crypto market began 11-years ago. The Ethereum Name Service helps to restore some of this lost privacy through the use of its proprietary technologies.\n\nCensorship\n\nEthereum Name Service users also eliminate censorship concerns. The centralized web has become increasingly politicized. As such, there has been a strong push to censor more and more data. This unchecked censorship is billed as a form of consumer protection or as a way to reduce misinformation. The reality is that anyone who speaks out against the tech companies\u2019 narratives can find their accounts on the wrong side of this censorship.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Name Service\n\nThere's a multitude of benefits that Ethereum Name Service users enjoy. For one, the protocol offers users the ability to launch and host decentralized domain names. These names can be anything that you prefer just like a regular website. This domain is then linked to your crypto wallet address or other information stored on a Web3 infrastructure.\n\nEasier Payments\n\nSince your new domain provides a human-readable crypto address, it makes sending payments a lot easier. For example, you could set up a .eth domain such as Payme.eth. Whenever you request a payment all you need to do is send this address over to the payee. They can place it into their web browser and it will forward their payments directly to your crypto wallet. It\u2019s simple and much faster than attempting to enter a traditional long crypto wallet address.\n\nReduced Errors\n\nAlong the same line of thought, the Ethereum Name Service reduces human error. Anyone who has sent cryptocurrency to the wrong address can attest to the uneasy feeling you get in your gut. For one, there are no refunds on public blockchains. As such, once you send your payment, those funds are gone forever, unless the other party feels kind enough to send your funds back. However, it should be noted that this rarely occurs.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service helps to prevent human errors and streamlines the entire crypto payment process. You can set up your domain to be your name or company to further improve the recognizability of your wallet. This approach helps to drive new crypto adoption because new users are more likely to feel comfortable making a payment in this way versus using the ETH address feature.\n\nPromotions\n\nThe Ethereum Naming Service has a variety of exciting promotions going on at the moment. The network recently began its airdrop campaign. This portal sends users the network's governance token, ENS, directly to their wallet. Airdrops are one of the most popular ways for developers to provide rewards in an efficient way.\n\nOpen\n\nENS Users enjoy an open and permissionless payment experience when they join the platform. The team behind the project continues to promote and support further third-party development. Developers can find helpful resources, support, and guidance from the community.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Name Service Work\n\nThe Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) leverages the security and programmability of the Ethereum mainnet to bring users a better alternative to the status quo. The network empowers users to buy secure, private, censorship-resistant domains that leverage the full smart contract programmability of the system. Specifically, users can create and issue non-fungible tokens (NFT) that can represent Ethereum addresses as well as web domains.\n\nENS App\n\nThe main way for users to interact with the network is via the ENS App. This Dapp is available as a free download for Smartphone users. Users can pay for an ENS name using the dashboard in seconds. If the name you prefer is already taken, you can buy it on secondary markets like OpenSea. This strategy creates a new .eth domain market for users to profit using.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) Controller\n\nThe ENS Controller is the only person who has the authority to edit an ENS account. The ENS controller can be found in the ENS registry's owner field. As the controller, you gain the ability to transfer ownership, set a resolver or TTL, and reassign subdomains.\n\nENS Token\n\nENS is the main governance token for the system. Users who hold ENS tokens gain voting rights via the network's DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Additionally, you can use ENS tokens to pay fees and send value. Notably, ENS holders also receive airdrop rewards.\n\nCommunity Governance\n\nOne of the best aspects of the Ethereum Naming Service is its DAO. These systems replace personnel with smart contracts that users interact with to guide the development of a platform. The more ENS tokens a holder holds and the more weight their vote will carry. Community governance systems are very popular in the DeFi realm because they provide a unified way for projects to move forward.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Naming Service (ENS)\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) is available on the following exchanges:\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nWazirX \u2013 This exchange is part of the Binance Group, which ensures a high standard of quality. It is the best exchange for residents of India.\n\nThe Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) \u2013 A Better Way to Crypto\n\nProjects like ENS demonstrate innovative ways that developers seek to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. The removal of long Ethereum addresses reduces the technical boundaries for these users. As such, more people feel comfortable making crypt payments. In the end, these developers understand that usability is what determines the success of a cryptocurrency. As such, The Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) plays a vital role in the market at this time."

        "title": "Ethereum Vs. Ethereum Classic (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "Understanding the differences between Ethereum and Ethereum classic is a vital step in furthering your crypto investment strategy. Anyone delving deep into the crypto market will soon notice that there are two versions of Ethereum available. What is lesser-known to new traders nowadays is exactly why, and how, the market ended up in this scenario, and what are the main differences between these projects.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum Classic\n\nThe splitting of Ethereum (ETH) into two different coins was a major controversy that rocked the market in 2016. Unlike some other well-known hard fork debates, The Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic (ETC) saga didn\u2019t revolve around correcting scalability issues or adding new features to the platform. Instead, it was done to prevent the loss of millions of ETH to hackers.\n\nHow the Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic Saga Begins\n\nEthereum Classic entered the market in 2013. At that time it was simply known as Ether. The protocols founder and creator Vitalik Buterin introduced the world to his smart contract programmable blockchain via a whitepaper. This document explained how just such a network could benefit the market considerably and simplify Dapp development in multiple ways.\n\nOn paper, the technical design and capabilities of the Ethereum concept were immediately evident. The project caught the attention of other well-known investors and developers. By 2014, the project's development was well underway. The creation of the project was sped up thanks to a successful ICO and support from the Swiss development firm, GmbH.\n\nThe ETH ICO\n\nThe ETH ICO was a success and the group secured $18 million to further the development of Ethereum's ecosystem. These funds helped to create and expand the first network of ETH miners and shareholders. The funds also helped the firm launch its mainnet in under a year. The first version of Ethereum was known as Frontier.\n\nIn 2016, Ethereum again broke the mold when it proposed the integration of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). DAOs are powerful community governance mechanisms. Their goal is to convert all aspects of a corporation\u2019s management into smart contracts.\n\nBy codifying the rules and decision-making processes of an organization, developers can remove the need for any human intervention. Consequently, DAOs operate as community-led efforts that automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions across the network.\n\nEthereum DAO\n\nEthereum's DAO launched on April 30, 2016. The launch was a huge success with the ICO breaking all previous records to become the largest ICO in history at that time. Specifically, the DAO raised +$150M in funds from +11,000 international investors. Everything looked as if the DAO was a significant success for the ETH community. However, the celebration was short-lived.\n\nDOA Hack\n\nWhile Ethereum's developers were celebrating their record-breaking achievement, others in the community were plotting on their funds. Sadly, the team hadn't expected such a robust response to their event. The flood of funding caught the team slightly off guard.\n\nAs a result, they mismanaged the level of security required. Specifically, they had chosen to keep all the ICO funding in a single hot wallet. At the time, the DAO wallet held 15% of the total circulating supply of ETH. This bounty was just too much for hackers to let go untouched.\n\nDAO Hack Details\n\nSoon, hackers were probing the network for attack vectors to exploit. Within days, both hackers and developers identified a potential programming error. Sadly, while the developers were already working on the patch, a hacker struck with great efficiency.\n\nThe shady individual utilized a duplicated DOA system to trick the protocol and slowly drain the funds. The near replica of the DAO included the main protocols initially programmed into the original DAO, making it impossible for the system to detect. However, it also included a withdrawal stipulation that placed a 28-day lock on funds. This revelation provided Ethereum's development team with some time to counterattack.\n\nThe situation was dire as the hacker had successfully tricked the DAO into depositing 3.6 million ETH from the ICO into their wallet address in just days. News of the attack dropped the value of ETH from $20 to just under $13 and sent ripples throughout the market. It also put the spotlight on Ethereum and how they intended to stop the siphoning of these funds.\n\nDAO Hack Response\n\nEthereum's development team worked tirelessly to think of some way to save the approximately $40M in ETH that the hacker had stolen. They knew where the funds were and that the hacker couldn\u2019t access these funds for 28 days. From there, they began to think of ways to prevent the thief from accomplishing his mission.\n\nThe first concept involved doing a soft fork upgrade to ETH. This upgrade would provide developers with the ability to blacklist certain wallets on demand. In essence, this would prevent the hacker from withdrawing these funds forever. The coins founder, Vitalik Buterin, took to social media to get a community response to the concept.\n\nHacker Responds\n\nThe same day, the hacker took to social media and responded to Buterin's suggestion. He told the crypto community that he had done nothing wrong. He said that if one was to have faith in the DAO, one needed to allow smart contracts to validate transactions.\n\nHe went on to explain that the DAO was programmed loosely and that's why the losses occurred. He further lamented the idea of altering any coding on Ethereum's blockchain because it was an error in the DAO and not ETH that caused the issue.\n\nHacker Raises Some Good Points\n\nDespite his shady origins, the hacker did land a couple of solid points during his posts. The entire concept of a DAO was to eliminate the need for human intervention. If developers can just alter the core features of Ethereum as they see fit, is it really an immutable decentralized blockchain?\n\nAs time passed, Buterin and his team began to get desperate to prevent the loss of $40M in ETH. Even worse was the fact that the community lacked the time to vote on the matter. This stress led to a growing call to conduct a Hard Fork. A hard fork differs from a soft fork in that it\u2019s a major protocol upgrade that requires miners to change their blockchain.\n\nRollBack\n\nEthereum's developers now had a new plan. they intended to roll back the blockchain right before the hack. This would prevent losses. However, the strategy was met with fierce opposition for many reasons. Primarily, users and developers felt that it would completely go against the core beliefs of the decentralized economy as blockchains are to be unalterable in nature.\n\nHacker Offers Miners Not to Upgrade\n\nOnce the news of the potential hard fork broke, the ETH community was split. This decision was further exasperated by the fact that the hacker began to offer huge rewards to miners who would switch to the new blockchain. In one instance, he offered 1 million ETH and 100 BTC to each node that refused the update.\n\nEthereum Classic is Here\n\nAs part of the hard fork, a new cryptocurrency would be formed. The new crypto would adopt the ETH name and the original coin would go by Ethereum Classic moving forward. Notably, the new version of the Ethereum mainnet entered the market on July 20, 2016. The upgrade rolled back the DAO theft via an irregular state change.\n\nTech Differences\n\nEthereum Classic maintains the original, unchanged Ethereum blockchain in its original state. Technically speaking, the coin has remained relatively the same since that date. In comparison, the new version of ETH has had the full support of the core development team. As such, it has had some major upgrades occur.\n\nETC Adds Scarcity\n\nNotably, one of the main differences between ETC and ETH is the total coin supply. ETC is hard-capped at 210M coins, whereas, ETH has no limit on its total supply. Specifically, On 11 December 2017, Ethereum Classic was hard capped via the Gotham hard fork upgrade. This upgrade added a Bitcoin-inspired deflationary emission schedule to the network. It\u2019s this difference in scarcity that has helped ETC remain a popular project over the years.\n\nFuture Upgrades\n\nIn the coming months, ETH plans to complete a major technical upgrade. ETH is in the middle of changing its consensus mechanism from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system over to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This upgrade will further drive a wedge between the capabilities and communities of these coins as ETC classic will remain a PoW blockchain.\n\nLong Term Effects\n\nThe decision to hard fork Ethereum was controversial for multiple reasons. For one, it demonstrated that decentralized networks are only as censorship-resistant as their developers allow. It also led to ETH-based platforms being shunned within the security token space as major financial institutions can't risk having settled securities transactions reversed.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets.\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, and Europe, and is our most recommended exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nEthereum Classic \u2013 A Controversial Coin that Remains Active\n\nThe fact that Ethereum Classic is still a popular project in the market says a lot about investors' feelings on the hard fork. When the hard fork first occurred, Ethereum's prices plummeted. However, the platform has since rebounded and even achieved new all-time highs brought on by the expansion of the DeFi, NFT, and ICO sectors. Today, you can get your ETH exactly how you like it, classic or with extra DeFi."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDonald Trump holds up to half a million in cryptocurrency, according to a recently released financial disclosure form submitted to a federal ethics agency.\n\nA filing submitted to the Office of Government Ethics included a listing of assets and other sources of income belonging to the former president. In one line on the second to last entry of the 82-page form, it lists a \u201ccryptocurrency wallet (Ethereum)\u201d with a value between $250,000 and $500,000.\n\nThe wallet appears to be connected to a line of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that his campaign launched as part of his bid to return to the White House in 2024 after his previous defeat to President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NFTs, a collection of virtual trading cards that feature illustrations of Trump in myriad poses as a superhero, cowboy, or astronaut, launched for $99 each in December 2022.\n\nSales of the tokens took off in the following months, including after his first indictment by a state court in New York, before dropping off after the candidate launched a second batch in April that crashed the first set\u2019s value.\n\nTrump\u2019s ownership of a crypto wallet comes against a backdrop of historically critical comments he has made about cryptocurrencies, as he questioned their value in ways more akin to his Democratic Party rivals than his Republican peers.\n\nWhen he was in office, Trump tweeted only once about crypto. In July 2019, he said that he was \"not a big fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\" Anthony Scaramucci, Trump's former communications director at the White House, later told Decrypt that he suspects Trump himself did not author the now-deleted tweet.\n\nAfter losing his re-election bid in 2020, Trump went on to tell Fox Business in June 2021 that Bitcoin\u2014the first and most widely traded cryptocurrency\u2014\u201cjust feels like a scam,\u201d and made it clear that he prefers fiat currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, because it\u2019s another currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always said,\" Trump told Fox's Stuart Varney.\n\nTrump\u2019s aversion to crypto comes in stark contrast to the warm embrace extended to the technology by others in his party. Since taking control of Congress, Republicans in the House and Senate have worked to advance new bills providing regulations for crypto that have been cheered on by the industry\u2014albeit with some misgivings.\n\nAmong his GOP rivals for the White House, there have been a few who have staked out pro-crypto stances.\n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have been publicly supportive of cryptocurrency adoption. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also promised to end what he says is the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cwar on Bitcoin\u201d if elected. All of these candidates remain far behind Trump in opinion polling.\n\nOn the Democratic side, long-shot Democratic Party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been publicly vocal about his support for cryptocurrencies. He revealed that he and his family own about 14 Bitcoin after previously saying he was not an investor."

        "title": "Which project will steal the show from Ethereum, the Layer 1 king? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 14 Aug 2023 \u25aa 8 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nSince its launch in 2015, Ethereum has enjoyed a remarkable rise. The platform has established itself as the crypto ecosystem\u2019s benchmark for Layer 1 infrastructure. The company\u2019s leadership is nevertheless significantly contested. Indeed, with the increased dynamism of the technology market globally, new Layer 1 projects are regularly emerging. Their ambition is to rival or even dethrone Ethereum in this sector. To achieve this, these initiatives propose technological improvements. They also provide enhanced scaling capabilities. Operational advances that generally translate into lower transaction fees for users. In short, they want to do better than Ethereum. But can they? The truth is, it\u2019s extremely difficult to predict with any certainty which project(s) will be able to supplant Ethereum. Admittedly, many of these crypto initiatives are not lacking in relevance. However, this is without taking into account the vast operational network that Ethereum has built to establish its market dominance. With that in mind, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Layer 1 blockchain technology and the particularities of the one developed by Ethereum. We\u2019ll then compare some of the crypto industry\u2019s most popular Layer 1 projects with Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nA look back at the Layer 1 concept\n\nTo assess whether Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 could be surpassed by other projects, it\u2019s vital to understand its meaning and role within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLayer 1, often abbreviated to L1, is the very foundation of blockchain. It is the main blockchain that functions autonomously, without depending on other systems for its operation. It is this independence that distinguishes it from Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and performance without modifying the underlying blockchain.\n\nLayer 0, on the other hand, is the underlying infrastructure layer that facilitates communication between different blockchains. It is a network of networks that enables Layer 1 blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nLayer 1 blockchains have their own network of validator nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks. They also use specific consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), to guarantee network security and integrity.\n\nIconic blockchains such as Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum all operate as Layer 1, each with its own token, which serves as the fuel for transactions and interactions within its ecosystem.\n\nSo what distinguishes Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 from other first-layer blockchains?\n\nSingularity of Ethereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum, as a Layer 1 project, occupies a prominent place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and for good reason. Its platform is distinguished by unique features that have redefined the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s major innovations is the introduction of smart contracts. These autonomous programs run automatically as soon as predefined conditions are met, without the need for human intervention.\n\nThanks to smart contracts, Ethereum has facilitated the development of decentralized applications (dApps). This has reduced dependence on traditional intermediaries, broadening the range of services available in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, Ethereum has played a crucial role in promoting interoperability between different blockchain platforms.\n\nWhile remaining true to its principles of decentralization, Ethereum is constantly seeking solutions to scale-up challenges, in order to satisfy a rapidly growing and demanding community.\n\nHowever, despite its leading status, Ethereum faces major challenges, particularly with regard to network scaling and high transaction costs. These challenges underline the importance of constant evolution of the platform. Other Layer 1 projects are emerging with innovative proposals, seeking to fill Ethereum\u2019s gaps while offering new functionalities.\n\nLayer 1 projects competing with Ethereum\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is full of Layer 1 blockchain projects. Given the multitude of offerings available, it would be tedious to cover them all here. However, by observing current trends in the sector, several of them seem to be gaining credibility and could potentially rival the current leaders.\n\nTake Cardano, founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. He often describes his project as an \u201cenhanced version of Ethereum\u201d. Focused on innovation, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain based on proof-of-stake (PoS). It offers developers the possibility of creating smart contracts, while guaranteeing fast, low-cost transactions. One of Cardano\u2019s notable achievements is the Ouroboros protocol, the first peer-verified blockchain protocol, ensuring decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Ripple is not a Layer 1 blockchain per se, its network, RippleNet, was designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers between banks and other financial institutions. Despite recent legal disputes that could influence the price of XRP, its native asset, Ripple continues to stand out. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP is not mined, but uses a unique distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions.\n\nSolana is also a major player among Layer 1 projects. As a public, open source blockchain, it encourages the development of smart contracts, NFTs and dApps. Solana stands out for its hybrid consensus model combining proof-of-history (PoH) and a PoS synchronization engine. This combination enables Solana to achieve an impressive transaction rate of 65,000 TPS, well above Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. It\u2019s worth noting that technology giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft are backing the project.\n\nOther Layer 1 projects such as Polkadot, Everscale, Stellar, Avalanche, Algorand, Solar Network, Kadena and Cronos are also gaining in popularity. Each of them has unique features that attract the attention of investors. But can they overtake Ethereum? It\u2019s not impossible. Competition in the crypto industry is fierce. In this context, only continued innovation and sustained adoption will determine the future market leader. For the time being, we have to acknowledge Ethereum\u2019s hegemony. It is supported by a vast ecosystem of developers, users and existing projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, as the pioneer of smart contracts and dApps, has long dominated the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, but the emergence of innovative projects such as Cardano, Solana and others shows that there is real competition for this leadership position. Each of these projects brings unique solutions to today\u2019s blockchain challenges, whether in terms of scalability, security or energy efficiency. So, who will be the next king of the Layer 1 protocol? Only time will tell. What is certain is that competition stimulates innovation, and this can only be good for the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Burn Rate Plummets Dramatically, No Longer Deflationary? - U.Today",
        "content": "Ethereum's celebrated burn mechanism has recently shown signs of cooling down, prompting some to question if the world's second largest blockchain by market cap is not currently deflationary. Recent data raises eyebrows, illustrating a sharp decline in the Ethereum burn rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Aug. 12, the single-day burn rate for Ethereum dropped to merely 570.54 ETH. This low figure is not far from the previous bottom recorded on Oct. 2, 2022, when only 498.16 ETH were burned. Such figures can be troubling for investors and Ethereum enthusiasts who look at the burning mechanism as a way to counteract the inflationary tendencies of cryptocurrency, ultimately enhancing ETH's scarcity and value.\n\nA closer look at the data and underlying activity reveals a significant shift from Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) to Layer 2 (L2) solutions. L2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Base, aim to scale Ethereum by handling transactions off the main chain and then settling them in a condensed form. This migration from L1 to L2 reduces the load on Ethereum's mainnet and, consequently, the number of transactions that contribute to the burn rate.\n\nMoreover, the current decline in activity on Ethereum's mainnet is not solely due to technical shifts. An equally crucial factor is the waning interest of institutional investors in the Ethereum space. Institutions, with their significant purchasing power, play a pivotal role in driving transaction volume and, by extension, the burn rate of Ethereum. Without consistent institutional participation, especially in large-scale transactions, Ethereum's mainnet activity may remain subdued, impacting the burn rate.\n\nAs for institutional investors, the flow of interest from them into the crypto space is not uncommon and can be influenced by a myriad of factors, ranging from global economic conditions to regulatory shifts."

        "title": "Coinbase's Base: A New Ethereum L2 - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Coinbase\u2019s Base Chain hit the crypto space like an iceberg hitting the Titanic. One day, things seem relatively calm in the blockchain world; the next, a new Ethereum (ETH) Layer-2 emerges with its own minefield of explosive opportunity and catastrophic rugpulls.\n\nIn a bid to keep up with a rapidly evolving industry, Brian Armstrong and the team at Coinbase have successfully launched Base Chain. Designed to introduce millions of Coinbase users to the world of on-chain DeFi, Base has certainly made its presence felt in a competitive niche.\n\nBut what exactly sets Base Chain apart from dozens of other Layer-2 networks? Why should crypto enthusiasts, developers, and investors pay attention to the newest kid on the block?\n\nIntroducing Base Chain, Coinbase\u2019s response to the growing demand for blockchain-based products and services.\n\nWhat Is Base?\n\nBase is a Layer-2 blockchain designed to enhance the capabilities of the Ethereum mainnet by improving transaction speed, reducing costs, and expanding functionality. Incubated by the team of pioneers at Coinbase, Base aims to make it easier, more secure, and more cost-effective for users to create a unique crypto economy of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBut Base isn\u2019t just any Layer 2 blockchain. Built using Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, Base will join the Optimism Superchain to create a thriving interoperable ecosystem with other popular Layer 2s.\n\nThis collaboration brings together Coinbase\u2019s decade-long experience in building crypto products with Optimism\u2019s cutting-edge technology, giving us an Ethereum L2 that\u2019s powerful and efficient but also developer-friendly and secure.\n\nFollowing the release of the Base testnet in February 2023, the Base mainnet launch was completed ahead of schedule in the waning days of July.\n\nHow Does Coinbase\u2019s Base Chain Work?\n\nBase leverages the underlying security of Ethereum, along with Coinbase\u2019s best practices, to provide a secure environment for dApps like decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and NFT marketplaces.\n\nAs is standard amongst Layer-2s, Coinbase\u2019s Base offers full EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility at a fraction of the cost. The beauty of the EVM means that all existing Ethereum-based smart contracts and infrastructure work seamlessly with Base, making it easier for developers to build and deploy their dApps.\n\nOn top of that, Base\u2019s rollup architecture significantly reduces costs for users. By \u2018rolling up\u2019 Base transactions into one neat pile off-chain and securing it on the Ethereum mainnet, gas fees on the Base chain cost little more than a few cents. Like other Layer-2s, such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Polygon zkEVM, Base helps to resolve Ethereum\u2019s infamous scalability concerns.\n\nHow Is Base Different from Other Layer-2s?\n\nUnderneath the hood, there isn\u2019t much that separates Base from other optimistic rollups and Ethereum Layer-2s. Thanks to the OP Stack, a standardized set of open-source tools and software for Layer-2 development, Base\u2019s network architecture closely resembles Optimism (OP).\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker. Coinbase is one of the most trusted and respected names in the space. The Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange boasts over 11 million verified users, many of whom haven\u2019t ventured outside of top cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether.\n\nBase represents a trusted path for these fringe crypto enthusiasts to make the leap and explore the world of decentralized Web3 apps from the safety of a familiar company. To give you an idea, the release of the Binance Smart Chain guided millions of users through their first blockchain transactions.\n\nWhat Does Coinbase\u2019s Base Chain Mean for the Crypto Space?\n\nBy introducing Base Chain, Coinbase gives its users practical first-hand knowledge about blockchain technology and provides a low-cost environment for DeFi users and on-chain traders to access financial services.\n\nMoreover, Base Chain could bring liquidity to the on-chain environment. If Coinbase users decide to leave the comfort of their favorite crypto exchange, that would mean that more people are embracing self-custody and decentralized services.\n\nWhat Can I Do on Base Chain?\n\nBase Chain will be very familiar if you\u2019ve ever used another Layer-2 blockchain like Arbitrum or Optimism. By design, Base essentially offers the same utility and use cases as the Ethereum mainnet with the added benefit of faster transactions and lower fees.\n\nBase DeFi\n\nJust days after Base\u2019s mainnet launch, dozens of native decentralized exchanges have already been deployed by eager community developers, with LeetSwap and RocketSwap taking the lion\u2019s share of TVL (Total Value Locked). Amongst the newcomers, classic DeFi apps like SushiSwap have already added support for the Base network, while AAVE has pledged to deploy lending services on Coinbase\u2019s blockchain.\n\nNFTs and Gaming on Base\n\nAccording to the Base website, iconic Web3 gaming like Animoca Brands and NFT platforms like Magic Eden are part of the community of builders on Base.\n\nGiven the immense number of crypto projects supported by Coinbase Ventures, the crypto exchange\u2019s venture capital arm, more emerging businesses are likely to integrate Base chain into their platform.\n\nGet Rugged?\n\nIronically, the big unifying story of Base\u2019s first week of operation is the terrible tale of a classic meme coin rug pull. $BALD, a meme coin that was no doubt named after Coinbase\u2019s founder, exploded overnight, running over 300,000% in a mere 13 hours. The hype was palpable, with almost every trader on the network having some exposure.\n\nIn a flash, the coin deployer pulled liquidity on the coin, leaving investors and traders scrambling to salvage what was left of their holdings. As a result, BALD\u2019s price plummeted over 90% in value, with the deployer securing over $5 million USD in profit.\n\nRumors amongst the crypto community suggest that the scam artist behind BALD is none other the Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and CEO of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. It is speculated that SBF orchestrated the rugpull to prove the fraudulence of the crypto market and discredit Coinbase, which is currently in the grips of a legal battle with the SEC.\n\nWill There Be a BASE Token?\n\nCoinbase has declared that they have no intention of creating a network token for Base Chain. Instead, ETH will serve as the native gas token for transactions on the network. This decision aligns with Base Chain\u2019s design as an Ethereum Layer-2 solution, leveraging the security and functionality of the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s important to note that the crypto landscape is dynamic, and plans can change over time. When Arbitrum first launched, the Arbitrum Foundation claimed there would never be an ARB token. Where are we now?\n\nIt should go without saying but don\u2019t take any unofficial announcements about BASE tokens seriously. Anyone sliding into your DMs saying you qualify for a BASE crypto airdrop is trying to scam you.\n\nBase Chain Pros and Cons\n\nLike any technology, Base Chain comes with its own set of advantages and potential drawbacks. Understanding these can help users and developers make informed decisions about using Base Chain.\n\nPros\n\nAccessible \u2013 Base Chain is EVM-compatible, making it easy for users and developers to port over to the network.\n\n\u2013 Base Chain is EVM-compatible, making it easy for users and developers to port over to the network.

Centralization \u2013 Although Base Chain is committed to progressive decentralization, the fact that it\u2019s the brainchild of Coinbase raises concerns about centralization.\n\nOn The Flipside\n\nAlmost every crypto exchange now has its own dedicated blockchain network. Binance has BNB Chain, KuCoin has KCC, and even OKX has OKC. Apart from BNB Chain, none of these networks have sustained high usage. Why should Coinbase\u2019s Base be any different?\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCoinbase has over 11 million verified users, but many of these accounts have never taken their funds off the crypto exchange or used dApps due to the risks involved with self-custody. Base chain might be the network that gives these users the confidence and peace of mind to take this key step into the crypto world.\n\nFAQs"

The utilization of multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets, while enhancing security, adds a layer of complexity.\n\nWith Buterin's considerable wealth, estimated between $1.46-$1.5 billion, the challenge of managing and ensuring the safety of multiple wallets becomes evident. Despite these concerns, Buterin's \"small bit\" in staking could still represent a substantial sum, considering his estimated wealth.\n\nHoskinson's jab at Ethereum is not an isolated event; it adds to a history of critiques aimed at the platform. Previously, he labeled Ethereum as \"a dumpster fire\" and even predicted its potential decline, likening it to the eventual obsolescence of earlier internet platforms.\n\nIn a bolder prediction, Hoskinson hinted at the possibility of Ethereum transitioning to the Cardano platform in the future, emphasizing Cardano's promise of enhanced speed, cost-efficiency and user volume."

        "content": "You might be aware that any discussion around cryptocurrencies always revolves around the two largest cryptos by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). It is obvious that Bitcoin is a favorite amongst those looking for a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic payment system and is preferred as a digital store of value, overshadowing Ethereum, but ETH still has a lot to offer.\n\nEthereum advocates usually look at it as more than just a crypto and believe that it has a wide variety of use cases, huge intrinsic value and provides unique earning opportunities to its investors.\n\nAs such, the large altcoin remains bullish in the long term. It is up more than 746% over the last three years and 58% above the January 1 opening. At the time of writing, Ether\u2019s market cap stands at $227.12 billion, reinforcing its 2nd position on the CoinMarketCap ranking with a market dominance of 19%, against Bitcoin\u2019s 49.8%.\n\nOn the other hand, the long-awaited September 15, 2022 Merge event that saw Ethereum transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) crypto to a proof-of-stake (PoS) token turned out to be a non-event as the price did not rally as many expected. Similarly, the Shanghai and Capella upgrade that was successfully completed on April 12, saw Ether\u2019s rise for a few days before turning down again.\n\nCrypto investors, however, still remain hopeful that 2023 will be a bull market for the industry with Ethereum recording a sustained recovery to hit the $10,000 mark before the end of the year. Is this possible? Well, let\u2019s dig in to find out.\n\nEthereum: A Brief Overview\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s largest altcoin and second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It was created in 2015 by a number of developers including Vitalik Buterin who initially published a whitepaper explaining the concept of Ethereum in November 2013.\n\nFollowing Buterin\u2019s initial work, other developers jumped on the bandwagon in different capacities to help bring the project to fruition. Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin and Mihai Alisie are all considered co-founders of the largest Layer 1 blockchain network.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has since undergone a lengthy development process spanning a number of years to bring it to what is it is today \u2013 a decentralized, open-source, and public service blockchain network that uses smart contracts for decentralized application (dApps) development and cryptocurrency trading without the involvement of a middle men.\n\nMore than just a digital token, Ethereum is more like a network, maintained and updated by validators who earn Ether in exchange for their work and contribution.\n\nThe native currency of the network, Ether (ETH), serves as the blockchain\u2019s cryptocurrency for powering the dApps built on the platform. The blockchain, therefore, provides powerful tools for developers to create and deploy their own interoperable, decentralized assets and services.\n\nA core concept behind Ethereum and its various applications is that there are no central authorities to enforce the network. This means the network users themselves control decisions made for the group.\n\nEthereum has played a major role in expanding the Web3.0 industry, offering blockchain projects, enhanced efficiency, faster transactions, and dApps to industries across the world. As such, it has a number of use cases including in areas of decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Decentralized apps (dApps).\n\nIn a nutshell, Ethereum is offering utility and creating value in numerous sectors including entertainment, real estate, healthcare, logistics and finance.\n\nTo understand where Ethereum will go next and to gain a better understanding of Ethereum\u2019s forecast, one needs to understand its price history.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nTo understand Ethereum\u2019s journey, it is important to look at the network\u2019s development timeline and how that has affected its price.\n\nDuring the presale, an initial coin offering (ICO) that took place in 2014 to finance the development of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether\u2019s price was $0.31. In 2015, the year that Ethereum first launched, the price started at around $0.74 and the lowest closing price for ETH was $0.42 while the highest price was $1.24.\n\nEthereum Development Journey\n\nIn 2016 with ETH at $12.24, the DAO attack in which 3.6 million ETH worth $60 million was lost (equivalent to one-third of the funds contributed by would-be DAO participants) led to a controversial revision of the Ethereum blockchain in what was referred to as an \u201c\u201cirregular state change\u201d\u201dresulting in the Ethereum Classic (ETC) hard fork. This was a factor in the ICO boom that started in 2017.\n\nThe 2017 bull market saw Ether\u2019s price rise more than 750% from $8.1 on January 1 recording a series of higher highs to reach a record high of $727 in December that year. This bull run was marked by the Byzantium hard fork in late 2017 reducing the rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH.\n\nThe reduction in ETH rewards was in the effort to reduce the inflation of Ether in basic supply and demand economics. The supply and demand forced after that propelled the Ethereum price to another record high of $1,151 in January 2018.\n\nThe price then turned down, dropping as much as 88% to lows of $135 in December that year, marking the 2018 bear market, known as the \u2018Crypto Winter,\u2019 which remains infamous in the industry\u2019s history. This crypto crash was driven by regulatory changes and security incidents, particularly in South Korea and China.\n\nThe downturn which was sustained throughout the year demonstrated the risk associated with market speculation and the effect of regulatory developments on market stability.\n\nETH/USD All-time Chart\n\nThe bear market persisted throughout 2019 with the price rising 110% during the first half of the year from $173 in January to reach a high of $350 in June, before falling back to $128 by the close of the year.\n\nOn the development front, 2019 was marked by two major upgrades, the Constantinople and the Istanbul hard forks. The Constantinople upgrade reduced block reward issuance from 3 to 2 ETH. The Istanbul hard fork which took place in December 2019 included six Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), specific code changes to the ethereum protocol that lowered the gas costs. This increased the bandwidth on the blockchain and fostered zero-knowledge privacy technologies such as zk-SNARKs.\n\nIn 2020, the market began to recover slowly at first and then with rapid momentum in 2020. Powered by the growth of DeFi, institutional interest, and increased retail participation, the crypto market saw a significant bull run. The London hard form which occurred in August 2021 at a time when Ether was going for $2,533, was aimed at making preparations for the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and a shift to the PoS consensus mechanism..\n\nBy the end of 2021, Ethereum had hit new all-time highs close to $5,000, marking a 558% increase during that year.\n\nWhat followed was the 2022 bear market, whose effects are still being felt at the moment. The bear market was characterized by sharp pullbacks, with Ether;s price falling 81.66% from it\u2019s all-time high to a low of $880 in June 2022.\n\nThis bear market was influenced by several factors including environmental and financial stability concerns, while prominent figures such as Elon Musk, put a strain on the market. Simultaneously, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the depegging of its stablecoin, Tether (USDT), contributed further to the market\u2019s downturn.\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain upgrade, christened the Merge, which saw the blockchain translation from a PoW to a PoS protocol turned out to be a non-event as investors turned it into a sell-the news occasion. The downturn was accelerated by the collapse of one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX in November 2022. This frustrated all the efforts the bulls had put in in the run up to The Merge, as Ethereum closed the year at $1,194.\n\n2023 has been fairly bullish for the largest altcoin by market capitalization. The price action has painted six green candlesticks as seen on the all-time chart above, reaching the year\u2019s high at $2,140 on April 14. The year-to-date lows lie at $1,27, reached after traders reacted to the US SEC suedBinance and Coinbase in early June.\n\nThe crypto is 64% above its January opening and has been recording higher lows since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis has left many analysts optimistic that Ethereum will continue the bullish momentum, eventually reaching $10,000 before the year ends.\n\nWhy Ethereum is going to $10,000 very soon\u2026 RT \ud83c\udfb6 pic.twitter.com/P38niJDzVW \u2014 Ivan on Tech \u2013 Moralis Money for altcoin discovery (@IvanOnTech) June 5, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether is hovering at $1,890.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nAfter turning away from its all-time high around $5,000, Ether declined a whooping 83% to set a swing low at $883 in June 2022. Since then, the price action has recorded a series of higher lows and relatively equal highs around the $2,000 level. This had led to the appearance of an ascending triangle on the weekly chart as shown on the chart below.\n\nBulls are trying to push the price above the triangle\u2019s horizontal line (x-axis) at $2,000. Such a move would confirm a bullish breakout for ETH price with the first barrier emerging from the 100-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,290.\n\nOther levels to watch on the upside include the $2,500 psychological level which the bulls have to flip into support before reaching the technical target of the governing chart pattern at $2,893. This would represent a 54% ascent from the current price.\n\nETH/USD Weekly Chart\n\nThis positive outlook was supported by the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above the midline in the positive region. The price strength at 54 suggests that the bulls are currently controlling the price.\n\nIn addition, ETH currently trades above key support levels including the $1,600 support level, where both the 50 and the 200 SMAs appear to merge. Other areas of support include the $1,500 psychological level and the major support level at $1,200.\n\nAny attempts to pull the price below these levels would be met by immense buying from this cohort of investors who may wish to increase their profits.\n\nConversely, things go awry for the bulls if Ethereum turns down from the current price, breaching the 50 and 200 SMAs at $1,600, dropping below the triangle. Ether\u2019s price may continue trading between this level and the $1,500 for a few weeks, but a breach of the latter would be detrimental for ETH. If this happens, a drop below $1,200 to revisit 2022 lows around the $880 demand zone would be inevitable.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction \u2013 Will ETH Hit $10,000 In 2023?\n\nEthereum holds a promising future because it is more than just a transactional crypto. The altcoin had slowly been establishing itself as a \u201cstore of value\u201d for those entities which are looking to optimize their wealth, positioning itself as the most favorite alternative to Bitcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s functionality goes very well with NFTs, DApps, DeFi, smart contracts and the list keeps growing each year.\n\nWe have already established that ETH\u2019s price growth largely depends on the milestones recorded on the blockchain\u2019s development. Therefore, as long as the Ethereum network keeps growing stronger and the development team continues to develop innovative features, ETH is likely to continue to grow in value, attracting more and more investors.\n\nNote that several factors have influenced Ethereum\u2019s past price rallies and in the current state, cryptocurrency sector dynamics differ from what was observed during the DeFitoken\u2019s previous skyrocketing periods.\n\nSeveral analysts have mulled over the possibility of Ethereum hitting the coveted $10,000 market before the end of the year. One of these is Patric @Finaconda, a DeFi, Crypto, and Metaverse who said in a May 18 tweet that \u201cETH could print a potential 5x increase to $10,000-$12,000 per coin in the next bull market.\u201d\n\n2/ With the finalization of Ethereum 2.0 on the horizon, investors can expect a faster, environmentally friendly, and efficient network. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nThis makes #Ethereum a promising long-term investment opportunity for the next crypto #BullMarket. \u2014 Patric @Finaconda (@finaconda) May 18, 2023\n\nHe, however, gave a number of conditions that must be met for this to happen, mentioning that \u201cthe finalization of Ethereum 2.0\u201d will make the network \u201cfaster, environmentally friendly, and efficient,\u201d attracting more investors to ETH.\n\nHe also mentioned that Ethereum would need support from the wider market as high Inflation rates, high interest rates, and low confidence in financial markets remain major challenges.\n\nTherefore, there has been continued restoration of investors\u2019 trust in the crypto market, which needs to be widespread to establish a conducive atmosphere for Ethereum\u2019s substantial and sustained growth.\n\nNote that for Ehereum to really touch $10,000, it has climbed close to 430% from the current price. This would mean an 32% increase month-on-month.\n\nBased on this figure, we carried out an analysis using the Binance price prediction calculator to get the short term price prediction for ETH. According to the analysis, the price prediction for July is $2,488, surpassing the 2023 high around $2,140.\n\nMonth Average ETH Price July 2023 2488.2 August 2023 3284.42 September 2023 4335.43 October 2023 5722.78 November 2023 7554.07 December 2023 9971.37\n\nFurther according to our analysis, the crypto is likely to cross the November 2021 high around $5,000 somewhere between September and October.\n\nThe ETH price prediction for December 2023 shows the average price of BTC at $9,971, given that it continues to rise by as much as 32% every month.\n\nHowever, to hit $10,000, Ethereum still has several price levels to clear, with $5,000 as a critical resistance position considering it is close to Ether\u2019s all-time high.\n\nNote that ETH has remained bullish in 2023 as the wider crypto market aims to exit the bear market from last year. In this case, the market rally is led by assets like Bitcoin. Historically, when Bitcoin records gains, it tends to pull the rest of the market along, with Ethereum in line to benefit.\n\nTherefore, there is no doubt that the Ether\u2019s price may touch $10,000, but it remains to be seen when that will be.\n\nEthereum Long-term Price Prediction \u2013 Is ETH at $100K Possible?\n\nAt the moment, there is not enough data to determine whether Ethereum can reach $100,00o and when.\n\nHowever, for Ethereum to rise to $100,00, it is not just the Use Cases but also the economic environment that must be friendly. Ethereum price has been highly influenced by the liquidity and wealth of individual and institutional investors.\n\nFor example, whenever the Fed tightens rates or reduces its balance sheet, Ethereum tends to lose value due to lower demand. But then economic cycles are a part and parcel of human history.\n\nEthereum at $100,000 will have a market cap of $12 Trillion, given the current amount of Ether in circulation. This is possible, in theory.\n\nFor example, if ETH were to rise at 10% per annum, it would take ETH 44 years (2067) to reach the $10,000 level.Note that it took Bitcoin 4 years to rise from $1700 to $50,000. The $12 Trillion market cap for Ethereum may sound quite huge today but more than 40 years down the line, may not be that huge.\n\nAlso, given that Ethereum has become deflationary and also that it may rise faster than 15%, Ethereum is likely to reach $100K much faster than 2067. For example, if Ethereum rises by 30% year-on-year, it will reach the $100,000 level by the year 2038.\n\nYear Average ETH Price 2023 1885.00 2024 2450.50 2025 3185.65 2026 4141.35 2027 5383.75 2028 6998.87 2029 9098.53 2030 11828.10 2031 15376.52 2032 19989.48 2033 25986.33 2034 33782.22 2035 43916.89 2036 57091.96 2037 74219.54 2038 96485.41 2039 125431.03\n\nEthereum is unlikely to rise consistently given economic uncertainties. The above are just hypothetical scenarios.\n\nWhile growth is unlikely to follow these exact patterns, it is not unusual to see a new category grow this way, with high growth in the initial years before easing to lower levels over time.\n\nWill Ethereum ever Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is unlikely to overtake Bitcoin ever but it has the potential to overtake BTC in terms of market cap since it has an uncapped supply.\n\nHowever, nothing is impossible in the world of cryptocurrencies. If we take the example of the 2021 bull market, ETH outperformed Bitcoin and gained nearly 400% compared to 66% for Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, experts believe that due to its unique blockchain and several use cases, Ethereum has a stable future and might even perform better than Bitcoin in future but is unlikely to overtake the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s past performance and development milestones since its inception in 2014 and launch in 2015 reveals that the token is here to stay. The network has unprecedented capabilities with solid fundamentals making it grow from time to time.\n\nIts continued growth and constant developmental upgrades makes many analysts and market experts predict that 2023 and the years ahead will be good for the largest smart contracts token. With rising confidence in the technology and blockchain solutions as well as new innovations around DeFi applications, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse, ETH will surely continue to grow in value and those HODLing the crypto will not waver.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

After hitting a crescendo in March, monthly ETH trading volumes have fizzled out.\n\nIn fact, August started on a much weaker note, recording volumes of just $66 billion as of this writing. If no substantial bullish or bearish event emerges, August could finish up with the dubious distinction of clocking the lowest monthly ETH volumes in 2023.\n\nDiamond hands stay put\n\nLong-term holders (LTH) have shown less willingness to let go of their ETH stashes.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGaming-centric Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM has launched its testnet, crypto tech firm Immutable announced Monday, letting dozens of blockchain game studios start experimenting with the scaling solution ahead of the eventual mainnet rollout.\n\nIn simple terms, zkEVM networks can increase the number of processed transactions and provide additional privacy and security features compared to the main Ethereum network. The main Ethereum network doesn\u2019t finalize transactions as quickly or cheaply as a zkEVM network, which bundles or \u201crolls up\u201d multiple transactions into one without data being revealed.\n\nUnlike the firm\u2019s current Immutable X network, Immutable zkEVM is built on top of Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology via a partnership with Polygon Labs. Here\u2019s a look at the biggest games that have announced plans to use the new Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMetalCore\n\nMetalCore is a sci-fi shooter game that\u2019s part first-person shooter (FPS) and part player-versus-environment (PVE) mech-fighting game, letting players go from being a ground troop to operating a massive robotic mech in seconds. The game is still in development, but will leverage the Immutable zkEVM network for its crypto transactions beginning with its closed beta kickoff event on September 15.\n\nShardbound\n\nImmutable Games and game studio Bazooka Tango are resurrecting the fantasy player-versus-player (PVP) card auto battler title Shardbound as an NFT game. Years ago, Sharbound\u2019s original indie developers at Spiritwalk Games encountered what Bazooka Tango\u2019s CEO Bo Daly previously told Decrypt was \u201ca little bit of a business problem.\u201d\n\nIn March 2023, Immutable and Bazooka Tango announced that Shardbound would be brought back to life as a blockchain game, adding NFTs to an experience in which gamers use cards to strategically place characters on a map with hexagonal tiles. The game is still in development.\n\nMedieval Empires\n\nMedieval Empires is a strategy game whose developers announced earlier this month that the project will use Immutable\u2019s zkEVM network, but have not specified exactly how just yet. The game plans to take a \u201cplay-and-own\u201d approach to NFTs, where players are able to own the in-game items they find as they play.\n\nThe game is currently playable on MacOS and Windows PCs, and the game studio has already released a token called MEE and virtual land Polygon NFTs, with no announcements yet made regarding a potential migration. The studio is also selling \u201csilver bundles,\u201d which are quantities of a synthetic in-game currency that can be purchased with USDC stablecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEF Defense\n\nEF Defense is a mobile strategy game, and developer Weracle announced its plans to use the Immutable zkEVM network in July 2023. The play-to-earn tower defense game challenges players to stop dark forces from taking over the fantasy world called the Land of Abundance on the Akaros continent.\n\nThe Android and iOS game offers 70 different playable characters, and has already released Polygon NFTs of playable characters. Neither Weracle nor Immutable have yet specified how the game will use the zkEVM network.\n\nGalaxy Commanders\n\nGalaxy Commanders is an upcoming PVP mobile and PC sci-fi game that announced plans to use the Immutable zkEVM network in July 2023. In the game, players will be able to own in-game battleships as NFTs, fight in an epic space opera setting, and complete various quests. The game will use its own cryptocurrency, Dimensium."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nProminent casual and mobile game publisher Zynga announced today that its first blockchain game is called Sugartown, which will utilize Ethereum NFTs.\n\nIn Sugartown, three farm animals have opened a wormhole from another dimension. Creatures called Oras have crossed through this wormhole and turned Sugartown into a fun, gamified world. The game will be released at \u201ca later date\u201d and will be playable via web browsers only, a Zynga representative told Decrypt via email.\n\nZynga will release 10,000 Ora NFTs sometime later this year, and they will be required for players to enter the game. The Ora NFTs will give players access to the experience and the free-to-play minigames within Sugartown. Players will also be able to lock up or \u201cstake\u201d their Ora NFTs to accumulate Sugar, a non-crypto, in-game currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to empower players through a sustainable Web3 platform full of fun and enduring games,\u201d Zynga Vice President of Web3 Gaming Matt Wolf said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe created Sugartown to appeal to a native Web3 market,\u201d he added, \u201cbut with the ambition of scaling much wider over time while we build a passionate and engaged community of holders we hope will enjoy this experience as much as we loved bringing it to life.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2007, Zynga first made a splash in the gaming industry when it released massively popular casual games like FarmVille and Words With Friends in 2009.\n\nThe publisher first revealed plans to make blockchain-based games in late 2021, but hasn\u2019t shared many details on the endeavor since early 2022. Last year, Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive acquired Zynga for $12.7 billion, and signaled plans to work together on future blockchain games.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Wanchain has launched decentralized bridges for Cardano, allowing users to transfer assets between Cardano and major blockchain networks.\n\nWanchain has announced the launch of decentralized bridges for the Cardano network. According to an announcement yesterday, the initiative will enable Cardano to be connected to 11 major blockchain networks.\n\nThe supported networks include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Astar Network, Avalanche, BNB Chain, OKT Chain, Optimism, Polygon, Tron, and Wanchain.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the development comes over a year after Wanchain disclosed plans to deploy cross-chain bridges on Cardano.\n\nUsers Can Now Transfer Value Between Cardano & Other Blockchains\n\nWith the launch of Wanchain\u2019s Cardano Bridges, transferring value between Cardano and selected networks has become easier. Interestingly, users can quickly move and transfer Cardano-based assets to the supported blockchains and vice versa.\n\n\u201cWanchain\u2019s Cardano Bridges advance interoperability, enabling numerous assets including ADA, other native Cardano tokens, all ERC-20 tokens, and several other notable assets to move seamlessly between Cardano, any EVM-based network, and select non-EVM networks,\u201d Wanchain noted in a recent announcement.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is worth noting that the recently-launched bridge will only allow users to transfer a handful of assets. The supported assets for each blockchain include the following:\n\nBitcoin (BTC);\n\nEthereum (ADA, BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT);\n\nArbitrum (USDC, USDT);\n\nAstar (USDT);\n\nAvalanche (BTC, USDC, USDT);\n\nBNB Chain (BTC, USDC, USDT);\n\nOKT Network (USDT);\n\nOptimism (USDC, USDT);\n\nPolygon (USDC, USDT);\n\nTron (USDC, USDT);\n\nWanchain (ADA, BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, WAN).\n\nInterestingly, the above-mentioned assets have been brought to the Cardano network via the Wanchain bridges.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that fiat-backed stablecoins, in the form of USDT and USDC, are available on the Cardano mainnet,\u201d Wanchain said.\n\nRoles Played by Developers\n\nCommenting on the development, the Wanchain team said the Cardano Bridges project is a milestone initiative it has been working on for years. Wanchain developers implemented a series of technical features to enable interoperability between Cardano and other heterogeneous blockchain networks.\n\nIt added Haskell smart contracts to Cardano- a feature that supports cross-chain transactions. In addition, the Wanchain team also upgraded its bridge nodes, allowing UTXO-type transactions to interact with Cardano smart contracts.\n\nFurthermore, Wanchain enlisted Cardano\u2019s research and development company Input Output Global (IOG), to make the necessary changes to the network. Following the partnership, IOG added native support for a Schnorr signature and Secp256k1 curve on Cardano."

        "title": "Ethereum- Calm Before The Storm? ETH Price Eyes $2400 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum although vulnerable to the selling pressure that continues to build up across the crypto market, holds strongly onto levels above $1,800.\n\nThe largest smart contracts token has not flinched in the last 24 hours, trading at $1,847 with $5.2 billion in trading volume coming in and backed by $222 billion in market capitalization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price Moves Closer to Bullish Pattern Breakout\n\nAn analysis of the Eth price daily chart reveals the formation of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. If validated, investors can acclimatize to a bullish outcome, where Ether climbs to $2,424.\n\nThis is a bullish reversal pattern that signals a change in the direction of a downtrend. It consists of three consecutive lows, with the middle one being the lowest and the other two being roughly equal.\n\nTraders can capitalize on this pattern by buying when the price closes above the neckline and setting a stop-loss below the right shoulder. The target price is calculated by adding the height of the pattern to the breakout point, roughly 24% to $2,424.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is dealing with low volatility, which according to data from IntoTheBlock, has dropped by 21.2% in a week. This coincided with a massive drop in network fees to $34.8 million, marking a two-month low.\n\nEthereum fees have dropped significantly this week by 21.2%, reaching a two-month low. This decline coincides with a period of stagnating volatility.#ETH pic.twitter.com/jgk23bbv1v \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) August 11, 2023\n\nLow volatility refers to how much Eth price moves up and down in a specified period. Extended periods of low volatility, according to IntoTheBlock, often point to potential volatile fluctuations in the short term.\n\nFrom the technical outlook, Ethereum is calm but a bullish breakout is in the offing, especially if the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes a buy signal.\n\nTraders seeking exposure to new long positions in Ethereum would be required to hold on until the MACD line in blue crosses above the signal line in red.\n\nSuch a signal implores investors to fill their bags, booking their positions ahead of an impending ETH price rally.\n\nThat said, ETH needs to close the day above the immediate resistance highlighted by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $1,858 to reinforce the uptrend eyeing the inverse head and shoulders breakout.\n\nIn the event Ethereum abandons the push for gains above $1,960 (neckline), overhead pressure will likely surge, pushing prices lower below support at $1,800. If declines sustain below this support area, it would be difficult to rule out further losses likely to retest the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,790, June\u2019s low at $1,620, and the lows in May at 1,405.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Comprehensive guide to Base: The new Ethereum layer 2 challenger - OKX",
        "content": "Layer 2 (L2) solutions help to enhance Ethereum's scalability, making it more accessible to a larger audience. Two notable L2 options are Optimistic Rollups (OP) and Plasma (POL). OP allows fast off-chain transactions by assuming their validity unless challenged.\n\nAt the same time, Plasma boosts scalability via child chains (which are smaller copies of the Ethereum mainnet) linked to the main Ethereum chain, batching transactions off-chain and committing them periodically to the primary chain. Both aim to augment Ethereum's capacity while maintaining its inherent security.\n\nThe latest buzz is around Base, an advanced new L2 solution designed to provide a secure, economical, and developer-centric platform for on-chain construction. It's been developed in collaboration with Optimism on the OP Stack framework.\n\nWhat's Base?\n\nImagine a bustling city that only has a single main highway. As more people move to the city and buy cars, this highway becomes congested. That's Ethereum layer 1 (L1) \u2013 the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo deal with the traffic, the city constructs overhead express lanes that are faster and can accommodate more cars, but they're still part of the city's road network. These express lanes are what we refer to as Ethereum L2.\n\nWhat is Ethereum layer 2?\n\nEthereum L2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol built on the existing Ethereum blockchain (L1). The purpose of this layer is to increase the network's capacity, thereby allowing for more transactions per second, reducing fees, and alleviating congestion on the primary layer.\n\nHow does Base fit into this?\n\nUsing our highway analogy, Base is like a newly constructed express lane. It's built to be fast, secure, and efficient. Since Base is built as an Ethereum L2, it operates on top of the main Ethereum network, benefiting from its underlying security while providing multiple advantages:\n\nIncreased transaction throughput\n\nIncreased scalability\n\nLower gas fees\n\nImproved privacy and security\n\nBase launched its testnet back in February of this year, and with the 'on-chain summer' event in full swing, the mainnet has recently launched. There are currently over 100+ decentralized applications (DApps) and service providers in the Base ecosystem.\n\nHowever, be aware of potential scammers. Base does not have its own network token and there are no intentions to release one in the future. While some L2s have their own tokens, Base stands out with its tokenless design, made possible largely due to backing from Coinbase. Always stay vigilant and avoid falling for fraudulent claims or schemes related to a so called Base token.\n\nWhat are Base's main features?\n\nNow we've explored Base's role in the L2 ecosystem, here's a breakdown of the advantages Base brings.\n\nLeveraging Ethereum's robustness\n\nBase is meticulously engineered to align seamlessly with Ethereum's primary network. This allows developers to deploy any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) codebase onto Base, paving the way for existing DApps to transition or work in tandem without hitches.\n\nCollaborative spirit\n\nWith its open-source DNA, Base is not just a platform \u2014 it's a collaborative endeavor. Its partnership with Optimism underscores its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in DApps.\n\nEconomical and efficient\n\nJust like express lanes designed for rapid cross-city commuting, Base offers the extensive capabilities of Ethereum but without the hefty price tag. It serves as a haven for DApps, delivering a full EVM experience at a fraction of the customary Ethereum fees.\n\nPioneering additions\n\nBase doesn't just emulate Ethereum's capabilities \u2014 it elevates them. Developers are equipped with new and inventive Ethereum tools such as Account Abstraction (ERC4337), gasless transaction APIs, and sophisticated smart contract wallets.\n\nSolidifying ties with Coinbase\n\nBase is uniquely positioned to streamline the transition of users and assets from traditional finance to Ethereum's decentralized realm. This integration offers unparalleled access to Coinbase's products, user base, and tools.\n\nA commitment to decentralization\n\nTrue to the core values of the crypto sphere, Base champions the cause of decentralization. While tied to Coinbase, Base is charting a course towards a progressively decentralized architecture, underscoring its dedication to trust, transparency, and inclusivity.\n\nSecurity as a priority\n\nDrawing strength from Ethereum's impeccable security features, coupled with the tried and tested best practices of Coinbase, Base stands as a fortress in decentralized applications.\n\nCost-effective evolution\n\nBy achieving full EVM equivalence, Base offers the richness of Ethereum's environment but in a more cost-effective manner \u2014 a testament to its commitment to accessibility and affordability.\n\nWhy Base?\n\nFor some, the crypto and blockchain ecosystems can be daunting, hindering the widespread adoption of DApps for daily use. With Base, as an L2 solution, DApps can become both user-friendly and economical. It makes sure of lower transaction fees, especially compared to the high fees seen during peak periods on their L1 counterparts.\n\nUsers can start their journey into the cryptoeconomy through Base, which acts as a bridge to various blockchain ecosystems. The platform offers a default on-chain experience and the ability to interact with multiple chains' products. For broad accessibility, Base emphasizes interoperability with different chains and, aligned to this, Coinbase aims to support multiple chains across its product range.\n\nCollaborative efforts often bolster decentralization. In conjunction with OP Labs, the Base is pooling its engineering expertise to devise features that potentially enhance decentralization. It's anticipated that external contributions will play a pivotal role in augmenting the decentralization of the broader cryptoeconomic platform.\n\nWorking collaboratively has profound implications for decentralization. Institutions such as Coinbase, Base, OP Labs, and the Optimism Collective actively pursue avenues to decentralize decision-making and control within the OP Stack and the Superchain. By jointly establishing key governance structures, the intention is to integrate decentralization into vital segments of the OP Stack architecture, which could influence the decentralization level of associated rollups.\n\nWhat's the Base ecosystem?\n\nThe Base Ecosystem Fund, with financial backing from Coinbase, can help secure a growing commitment towards advancing the DeFi ecosystem. This fund is specifically designed to propel early-stage innovations aiming to blossom on the Base platform.\n\nWhile there's no shortage of promising ideas in the crypto space, Base has strategically positioned itself as an incubator for those crypto-native visionaries who are in the nascent stages of their project development, particularly those focusing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending, NFTs, and more.\n\nBase is keenly exploring an interesting niche \u2014 flatcoins, which is a type of stablecoin tethered to inflation rates. These digital assets aim to provide users with both stability in purchasing power and resilience against economic fluctuations. This need has become ever more crucial in light of the current global banking challenges. Base recognizes the importance of forging trust in an on-chain environment. The fund encourages projects working on decentralized identity and reputation and those crafting advanced decentralized exchanges with the potential for high throughput.\n\nAs DeFi continues to scale, ensuring the security and reliability of platforms and protocols becomes crucial. The Base Ecosystem Fund, therefore, also champions builders crafting tools and systems to make DeFi more secure, aiming to make on-chain storage safer for everyone.\n\nThe road ahead for Base\n\nIn February 2023, Base took a significant step forward by launching its testnet. This innovative platform has attracted praise from developers across the industry, characterizing it as a secure, economic, and developer-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nBase's mainnet is accessible to all users. Over 100 DApps, protocols, and brands, such as Coca-Cola, OpenSea, and Aave, have been integrated into the network. To mark its launch, Base is initiating an \"Onchain Summer\" campaign that includes daily NFT distributions and incentives for users engaging with the network's DeFi platform. If you're a developer looking to build on Base, here are some helpful tools to get you started.\n\nThe final word\n\nBase, an L2 solution, makes the crypto and blockchain realms more approachable, paving the way for the mainstream adoption of DApps. Addressing the sometimes high transaction costs of L1s, Base offers lower fees and acts as a bridge to multiple blockchains.\n\nIt prioritizes chain interoperability, mirroring Coinbase's multi-chain support ambitions. Collaborating with OP Labs, Base augments decentralization features, with external input deemed crucial for the platform's holistic decentralization.\n\nInstitutions like Coinbase, Base, OP Labs, and the Optimism Collective emphasize decentralization in decision-making processes. Together, they aim to embed decentralization deeply within the OP Stack framework and related rollups.\n\nBase is now live on the OKX wallet.

        "title": "Op-ed: Is Trump's $500k crypto wallet just his own NFT trading card collection? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump, well-known for his skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, has been revealed to hold between $250,001 and $500,000 in an Ethereum (ETH) wallet, according to his financial disclosure form filed in April 2023.\n\nThe wallet\u2019s contents remain undisclosed, leaving the potential for it to encompass Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, or potentially NFTs.\n\nThe news has been widely reported; however, there are two glaring questions:\n\nIs Trump no longer anti-crypto? Why is no Polygon wallet disclosed?\n\nTrump\u2019s crypto and NFT position.\n\nThis report is a surprising revelation considering Trump\u2019s public stance on cryptocurrencies. In 2019, Trump expressed his disapproval of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Twitter, dismissing them as volatile assets \u201cbased on thin air\u201d that could potentially facilitate illegal activities.\n\nDespite his skepticism, Trump introduced his first NFT collection in Dec. 2022, three years after his criticism of cryptocurrencies. As Soumen Datta reported, the former president launched the \u2018Collect Trump Cards\u2019 series, with each NFT costing $99 and minted on the Polygon blockchain in a bold move into the crypto space. The collection, managed by NFT International LLC, released 45,000 NFTs available for minting during the sweepstakes entry period.\n\nHowever, it was not all smooth sailing for the Trump-branded NFTs. CryptoSlate reported in Dec. 2022 that the collection\u2019s floor price plummeted by 80% in 10 days from 0.84 ETH to 0.16 ETH. Further, OpenSea data indicated a unique owner rate of only 34%, with 15,115 owners holding the 45,000 NFTs.\n\nThe launch of Trump\u2019s \u2018Series 2\u2019 NFT collection in April 2023 saw its floor price tumble more than 10% below the purchase price. While the first collection\u2019s sales surged up almost 500%, the floor price of both collections fell in tandem with a drop in the Bitcoin (BTC) price to $27,300.\n\nCurrently, the floor price of Trump\u2019s initial run of trading cards is 0.1065 ETH, while Series 2 is at 0.018 ETH, according to OpenSea.\n\nTrump Polygon wallet identified?\n\nSo, even though Trump\u2019s disclosed Ethereum wallet might raise eyebrows, it\u2019s important to remember that his NFTs were minted on Polygon, a layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, not on Ethereum itself. This distinction is crucial to understanding the reach and impact of his crypto ventures.\n\nAnalyzing on-chain data gives further insight into the distribution of Trump\u2019s NFTs on Polygon. Two primary wallet holders were allocated large amounts of Trump\u2019s NFTs in bulk \u2014 one identified as 0x72f8 received 500 in June 2023, while another identified as 0x6D65 was given 602 in several batches between April and May 2023.\n\nGiven that the floor price of the NFTs during this period hovered around 0.17 ETH, it can be deduced that each of the wallets, as mentioned earlier, contained between $153,000 to $184,000 worth of NFTs, roughly 1% of the supply each.\n\nInterestingly, these accounts also received substantial amounts of Trump\u2019s Series 2 cards, valued between $20,000 and $40,000 at the time.\n\nThese amounts align roughly with Trump\u2019s disclosure statement concerning crypto wallet holdings. Given the volatile nature of NFT trading and pricing, a $250,001 \u2013 $500,000 valuation of either of these wallets may not be unreasonable. Therefore, one of these wallets may belong to Trump.\n\nMoreover, the two wallets\u2019 acquisition methods for these NFTs also differ. The 0x6D65 account received its NFTs via the smart contract\u2019s \u2018fulfill available advanced orders\u2019 function, while 0x72f8 received theirs in standard bulk transactions.\n\nFurthermore, wallet 0x72f8\u2019s transaction history appears to contain only token deposits that seem to be spam. At the same time, 0x6D65 has approximately $40k in wrapped ETH (wETH), three transactions with the NFT trading platform Seaport, and numerous smaller transactions.\n\nEthereum Wallet Addresses.\n\nGiven that Trump\u2019s disclosure listed an Ethereum wallet, CryptoSlate reviewed the Polygon addresses on the native Ethereum chain.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, the 0x6D65 address holds around $16,000 in ETH.\n\nIts activity indicates that it belongs to an entity with experience trading NFTs, something unlikely for the former U.S. President.\n\nOnchain data suggests that the NFT collection has performed similar actions in the past, with analysts asserting, in Dec. 2022, that a number of NFTs with high rarity were minted internally prior to launch, with some aligning it with a group Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet.\n\nThe address identified? 0xfb65.\n\nHowever, the 0x72f8 address, mirroring its activity on the Polygon network, shows no transactions on Ethereum. The wallet has remained inactive throughout.\n\nGiven the nature of the addresses\u2019 activities on both networks, one might speculate if the 0x72f8 could indeed be Trump\u2019s address, given that it is reasonable that several NFTs would be held back for their creator. Further, the lack of activity might suggest it is a cold storage wallet designated to have Trump\u2019s NFT quota.\n\nIf this speculation holds, it would be more accurate for the filing to read \u2018Polygon wallet\u2019 instead of \u2018Ethereum wallet.\u2019\n\nIt is important to stress that without official confirmation from Trump or his associates, it remains impossible to identify the 0x72f8 address as his definitively.\n\nThe addresses identified are likely related to entities involved in the project\u2019s creation or a whale with access to a bulk transaction function.\n\nStill, while the information sparks intriguing possibilities, it should be cautiously approached until further clarification is available.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The people\u2019s crypto is up 2%, which is not a mean achievement considering how close-knit the price was moving along the equilibrium level at $29,399 over the weekend.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin price is $29,657 after breaking above the equilibrium level. Volatility seems to have been restored, and now BTC is on a course north and will potentially tag $30,476 if bulls nurture their current buying appetite.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) pointing upwards, some growing momentum could see Bitcoin price continue north. After flipping the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from a resistance level to support, upwards is the path with the least resistance. An increase in buying pressure could see BTC complete the rally to the forecasted $30,400 range.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could shatter past this hurdle to record a new range high around the $31,804 level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, a rejection from the $30,476 level could see Bitcoin price move back below the 50-day EMA and lower to break below the $28,806 support level before tagging the 100-day EMA at $28,690. If this support level fails to hold, BTC could continue south to tag the 200-day EMA at $27,265 or, in the dire case, extend to the June 19 low at around $26,344.\n\nSuch a move would constitute a 10% drop from the current level. Notably, the position of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms in negative territory points to the presence of bears in the market, which could threaten the current uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF potential approval could come close to BTC halving\n\nEthereum price waits for BTC confirmation\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains in a bind, tucked between the 50- and 100-day EMAs at $1,859 and $1,843, respectively. If BTC makes a strong move north, ETH could shatter past the 50-day EMA to forge north, potentially breaching the next roadblock at $1,891.\n\nThis assumption stands considering Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to Ethereum has proven strong of late, with the two giants painting the same price action during the weekend on the four-hour timeframe.\n\nIn a highly ambitious case, the largest altcoin by market capitalization could extend into the $2,000 zone to tag $2,005, a level last tested in mid-July.\n\nThe RSI, like in the case of BTC, is edging north to show rising momentum. If this is nurtured, Ethereum price could complete the 10% climb to $2,005.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if current bullish momentum fades and bears take charge, Ethereum price could slide below the 100-day EMA at $1,843 and tag the $1,813 support level. Increased selling pressure below this level could push ETH to the 200-day EMA at $1,789.\n\nIn the dire case, Ethereum price could approach or dip into the demand zone marked in pink. This would be the likely turnaround point, considering it represents an order block where bulls are likely to buy aggressively.\n\nIt is worth considering the possibility of the demand zone failing to hold as support, in which case it could transform into a bearish breaker, clearing the path for further losses.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price hovers around equilibrium as ETH future-based ETF filings await October verdict\n\nRipple price readies for a 20% slump\n\nRipple (XRP) price is trading within a narrow range, a move that has led to doji candlesticks forming. This repetitive pattern could see XRP continue the downtrend, going down 20% to tag the $0.5048 support level.\n\nThe position of the RSI below 50 and the AO histograms in the negative zone show that bears have the advantage, increasing the odds for a downtrend. Moreover, the Ichimoku Cloud hovering above the Ripple price action adds credence to the bearish momentum.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a break above the conversion line of the Ichimoku (blue) at $0.6315 could clear the path for Ripple price to head north, possibly reaching the cloud itself. However, Ripple price remains in murky waters unless XRP breaks about the baseline of the Ichimoku (red) at $0.6937.\n\nRipple price must decisively break past the $0.8193 for a confirmed uptrend. Such a move would constitute a 30% ascent from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP holder community confident that the altcoin is not a contract, confirmation from Attorney Jeremy Hogan"

        "content": "On-chain data confirms that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) outperforms prominent competitors like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano in major blockchain metrics.\n\nThe XRP Ledger (XRPL) has consistently taken center stage as one of the most scalable blockchains. While its impressive capabilities have not made headlines of late, recently-surfaced data confirms the XRPL\u2019s superiority to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.\n\nThe data, sourced from on-chain metrics, compares XRP to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) in terms of blockchain speed, cost of transaction, and scalability (transaction per second).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSpeed\n\nRegarding speed, data shows the XRPL boasts 3.6 seconds per transaction, representing the fastest among the four networks. Bitcoin can take anything from a few minutes to an hour to process a transaction.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum boasts a better speed of 15 seconds to five minutes per transaction. However, this is still considerably slower than the XRP Ledger.\n\nNotably, speculations surfaced among investors that the Merge would bring a significant reduction in transaction speed for Ethereum. Nonetheless, the Ethereum development team debunked these claims, noting that The Merge only slightly improved speed.\n\nMoreover, at an average of 20 seconds per transaction, Cardano\u2019s transaction speed beats Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, it is still slower than the XRP Ledger.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTransaction Cost\n\nThe XRP Ledger also boasts an attractive transaction cost, with an average of $0.0004.\n\nBitcoin has the highest fee among the four blockchains at $0.8073 per transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s transaction cost stood at a few cents. While this figure saw a slight reduction following the Merge, it remained significantly higher than the XRPL\u2019s cost. Currently, the ETH cost per transaction has increased to an average of $0.47.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano\u2019s transaction fee is usually contingent on the size of the transaction and protocol parameters. Fees on the Cardano network can range from $0.15 to $0.19. While this is lower than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is still much higher than the XRPL.\n\nScalability\n\nRegarding scalability, the XRP Ledger outperforms the other networks on the list. While data shows 1,500 Transactions per second (TPS), Ripple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz, recently noted that the network has never handled 1,500 TPS. He confirmed that the XRPL currently handles only 300 to 500 TPS.\n\nNonetheless, this figure is still higher than observed with the rest of the networks on the list. Bitcoin currently processes seven transactions per second, which is comparably lower than the XRPL.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s founder, claimed Ethereum could handle 100,000 TPS after The Merge. However, this has not materialized, as the network averages 29 TPS as of press time.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano averages 250 TPS at the time of reporting, significantly higher than all the networks on the list besides the XRPL. Claims surfaced that the Hydra upgrade could boost Cardano\u2019s TPS to 1 million, but these have been debunked."

        "title": "Cosmos Vs. Avalanche (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "No one can deny the importance of Ethereum for the crypto/blockchain history, given that the project revolutionized everything about it. It changed the way people looked at both cryptocurrencies and blockchain, by revealing that blockchain can do more than just record transactions. Ethereum represents a massive turn in the industry, and as such, it is likely the second-most important project that was ever created, with Bitcoin itself being the only one in front of it, thanks to the fact that it started the crypto industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s problems, such as the lack of scalability, low throughput, and alike, have led to massive waiting periods. Those in a hurry to have their transactions processed had no choice but to pay higher fees, which led to a rise in the average fee. As a result, many have started abandoning Ethereum and looking for Ethereum alternatives. While there is no lack of such alternative blockchains, two rise above the rest for their speed, technology, number of projects, features, additional community content, and more.\n\nWe are, of course, talking about Cosmos and Avalanche. So, if you wish to find a new chain to switch to, these two are definitely among the top recommendations. As for what they have to offer and how they differ from one another \u2014 let\u2019s check it out now.\n\nCosmos Benefits\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is a project that emerged with the intention of solving some of the hardest problems that the crypto industry has to face. It sees itself as an antidote to slow, unscalable, expensive, and environmentally harmful Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols, including Bitcoin and, for the time being, Ethereum, among others.\n\nOther than that, Cosmos also aims to simplify blockchain technology and make it less complex and difficult for developers and users alike. It does this with its modular framework, which demystifies dApps. Finally, Cosmos has another goal which is to help different blockchains in the industry in regard to communication. It does this with the Interblockchain Communication protocol, which prevents fragmentation in the industry.\n\nThe project\u2019s token, ATOM, was launched in 2017, although Cosmos\u2019 origins can be dated back to 2014, when the network\u2019s core contributor, Tendermint, was originally founded. As for the token itself, it is earned through a hybrid PoS algorithm.\n\nCosmos\u2019 most valuable feature is its Interblockchain Communication protocol mentioned above, as it aims to establish communication between different chains. Interoperability, which is the capability to send money and information from one chain to the next, is one of the biggest goals of the blockchain industry. With it, Web3 will finally be able to be established, and without it, blockchains would simply continue their isolated existence, with hundreds of ecosystems out there, but each locked in its own little bubble. Cosmos aims to change this, and while it is not the only one \u2014 its contribution to the establishment of interoperability is likely going to be very valuable.\n\nAvalanche Benefits\n\nOn the other side, we have Avalanche (AVAX), which sees itself as the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain world, as measured by time-to-finality. This is another major problem of the crypto industry that the project intends to solve by offering blazingly fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly services.\n\nEco-friendliness has been particularly important in the crypto industry for a long time, especially last year. Crypto mining, as many likely know, is very demanding in terms of computing power and electricity, which makes it leaves a major carbon footprint. This has been something that was harshly criticized for years. However, after Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin because of this problem about a year ago, in early May 2021 \u2014 the issue has received more attention than ever.\n\nAs an eco-friendly blockchain, Avalanche definitely has an advantage against numerous competitors. Other than that, the project was launched in 2020 specifically to host dApps, and since then, its ecosystem has grown quite a lot, offering a great Ethereum alternative. The project also has a burning mechanism that reduces its circulating supply, which ensures that the AVAX token\u2019s price will grow in time.\n\nAs of April 2022, the project has burned nearly 1.2 million tokens, worth approximately $112 million at the time. Also, its network is fast enough to handle around 4,500 TPS, as opposed to Ethereum\u2019s 15.\n\nAs a young blockchain, Avalanche still has a lot of growth and development ahead of it. However, the success it has seen in the last 2 years, and the amount of attention that it has attracted is extremely encouraging for the project\u2019s future.\n\nCosmos vs Avalanche\n\nWith all that said, what are the similarities between these two projects? What are the differences?\n\nSo far, both Cosmos and Avalanche have seen rather high rates of adoption. Cosmos is very easy to use, and Avalanche has excellent technology. Furthermore, both have well-developed decentralized finance, with a TVL that outperforms other Ethereum alternatives, such as Solana, and Cardano.\n\nOf course, they are both dedicated to different things. Avalanche\u2019s focus is on smart contracts, while Cosmos\u2019 is on adoption and achieving interoperability. With that said, some community members have complained that Avalanche failed to cure the problems that it set out to cure, especially when it comes to transaction fees.\n\nOthers have also commented that Cosmos seeks to simplify things for people, but it has an abundance of events and projects which can be confusing for newcomers, especially when it comes to airdrops, where not all of them are legit, and users have a hard time discovering which ones are and which ones are not.\n\nHowever, the situation is not as bad for the two as these criticisms make it seem. The two are still so far ahead in comparison to their other competitors that many would say that the two don\u2019t have any real competitors, other than Ethereum, that is. Ethereum still has a chance to come back from where it is now if it completes the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in time, and if the update ends up being truly good enough to match the expectations and the hype.\n\nOtherwise, it will just be another failure, and Ethereum might actually lose to one of these projects.\n\nConclusion\n\nAvalanche and Cosmos are two very capable projects that have their own goals, but overall, are becoming the two leading development platforms in the crypto industry. They are both technologically superior to most other Ethereum alternatives and of course, Ethereum itself. They still do not have the brand awareness that Ethereum has, but if they continue to evolve while Ethereum continues to stagnate and lose users and developers because of its flaws, it might someday end up being overtaken.\n\nCompared to one another, it is true that both projects are similar in many ways, but they are also different in terms of their goals and technology. They are not perfect, but they are also both relatively young and have many more years of development ahead of them to remove their issues and improve their services.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Cosmos and Investing in Avalanche guides.\n\nHow to Buy Cosmos (ATOM) or Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nCurrently, Cosmos (ATOM) and Avalanche (AVAX) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "Cardano Vs. Avalanche \u2013 What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "As you delve deeper into trading cryptocurrencies, there is a good chance you will come across the Cardano (ADA) vs. Avalanche (AVAX) debate. Understanding the differences between these advanced DeFi Networks is crucial in helping you to decide which one is best suited to meet your needs. Here is some valuable insight into Cardano vs. Avalanche.\n\nWhat is Cardano?\n\nCardano is often called the \u201csmart blockchain\u201d due to its close relationship with the academic sector. The project began as an experiment to see how incorporating scientific methods into blockchain creation could improve security and functionality. It launched to heavy support, securing over $62M during its ICO.\n\nToday, Cardano is a popular third-generation blockchain that hosts a variety of dApps. Notably, the network got its name from the Italian physician, Girolamo Cardano who is best known for the introduction of the systematic computation of probabilities theory.\n\nCardano entered the market during the crypto rush of September 2017. Its team consists of former Ethereum developers and founder Jeremy Wood and Charles Hoskinson. The two helped to create Cardano after deciding that Ethereum was limited in its capabilities.\n\nWhat is Avalanche?\n\nAvalanche is an advanced third-generation DeFi ecosystem that continues to see growth in the market. The network provides programmability and scalability with low-cost transactions to drive adoption. Notably, Avalanche is one of the first networks to introduce multiple blockchains as part of its ecosystem.\n\nAvalanche is designed to support the issuance of complaint Dapps and a wide variety of digital assets and even other blockchains. Its token, AVAX, enables developers to bake regulatory requirements directly into the token\u2019s coding. This approach ensures compliance throughout the life of the asset.\n\nWhat Problems Was Cardano Built to Alleviate?\n\nCardano was built to help create an academic-centric blockchain. The network provides decentralized computing services to the academic market as well as commercial users. The entire project was focused on leveraging academic theory and peer review to improve the creation and support of decentralized networks.\n\nSustainability Concerns\n\nWhen Cardano launched Ethereum was still using a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism \u2013 an approach often derided due to its potential for energy consumption. As such, Cardano wanted to create a more energy-efficient and sustainable alternative.\n\nThe network accomplishes this goal by integrating a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus algorithm that eliminates the use of power-hungry miners. In the Ourobororos consensus system, users stake their tokens to secure the network. In return, they receive rewards in the form of ADA tokens.\n\nWhat Problems Was Avalanche Built to Alleviate?\n\nAvalanche was designed to help reduce a variety of issues plaguing the market. For one, the system helps to alleviate congestion issues that Ethereum developers were suffering from at the time. It accomplished this task by using a blockchain designed to operate exactly like Ethereum for transitioning Dapps.\n\nEthereum Dapps can launch on this chain and often enjoy lower rates and faster performance. Avalanche is very fast, with the network clocked at 6,500 transactions per second (tps) and sub-second finality. This performance puts it far ahead of Cardano in terms of its tps rate. Notably, the developers claim that Avalanche can scale vertically to support millions of transactions per second one day.\n\nInflation\n\nAnother major issue that AVAX was designed to help reduce is token inflation. Inflation is a major problem for fiat currencies today and has been an issue in the past for DeFi networks. The main reason inflation occurs in a DeFi system is over the issuance of tokens.\n\nTo combat this issue, Avalanche introduced an integrated deflationary system. This mechanism automatically burns all network fees. Burning tokens refer to removing them from circulation forever. By reducing the number of tokens in circulation, you drive up the demand. The goal is for these actions to help bolster long-term price stability.\n\nHow Does Cardano Work?\n\nCardano uses a multi-layered approach to improve the reliability and uptime of the network. The system introduces the \u2018Ourobororos' consensus mechanisms as part of this strategy. This system is a PoS variety that leverages snapshots of the network called epochs. Epochs streamline validation because they provide faster reference points.\n\nCardano introduces ADA as its principal utility token. This digital asset can be sent in a peer-to-peer manner internationally. Interestingly, it is also named after another famous mathematician and programmer Ada Lovelace. She was the first computer programmer. Today, Cardano plays a vital role in a variety of academic projects.\n\nHow Does Avalanche Work?\n\nAvalanche leverages three separate blockchains working together to provide its services. The network's first chain provides support for Dapps and smart contracts. This chain is where developers can launch assets and more. It\u2019s supported by another inner-network blockchain that handles validation services.\n\nThere is also a blockchain that was designed to support Ethereum migrations. This blockchain replicates the EVM scenario so that developers can easily move their projects to Avalanche and start saving on fees. This structure has proven to be a success as Avalanche is one of the fastest-growing Ethereum competitors currently.\n\nUsers can stake their AVAX to gain rewards. The system has minimal requirements including 2 CPU cores, 4GB of memory, and only a 40 gig HD. Anyone can become a validator and secure returns. Staking is one of the easiest ways for new DeFi users to secure consistent returns without risking the loss of their original assets.\n\nHow to Buy Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nCurrently, Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges:\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

        "content": "Bankman-Fried was transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Monday, per Reuters.\n\nAuthorities moved the former FTX CEO after U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his $250 million bail bond.\n\nThe crypto founder was previously living at his parents\u2019 house in Palo Alto where he allegedly tampered with witnesses and leaked a private diary.\n\nSBF will remain in a federal jail cell pending his trial for fraud charges.\n\nAuthorities transferred former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to a federal jail in Brooklyn after a U.S. revoked SBF\u2019s $250 million bail bond.\n\nBankman-Fried was moved to Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) ahead of his trial starting in October. SBF\u2019s previously lived at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto, California until last week.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan ruled to cancel SBF\u2019s bail conditions after reviewing arguments on his alleged witness tampering. Prosecutors raised complaints after Bankman-Fried leaked Caroline Ellison\u2019s private diary to the New York Times. His lawyers subsequently asked the court to seal the dairy, a move that puzzled observers while the Justice Department argued for jail time.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers appealed Judge Kaplan\u2019s decision to revoke bail shortly after his arrest. However, SBF will likely prepare his defense from a federal prison cell.\n\nInmates of Brooklyn\u2019s MDC like former president of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez and exiled Asian businessman Guo Wengui both described the prison as dangerous. This is the second prison Bankman-Fried has checked into since FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nSBF was previously held at the Fox Hill Prison in the Bahamas, another prison notorious for its poor conditions.\n\nCharges Against Bankman-Fried\n\nProsecutors charged SBF on 12 counts including fraud following the crash of FTX last November. Authorities dialed back on campaign finance violation charges due to an issue with Sam\u2019s extradition papers from the Bahamas. This particular charge was not included in the agreement, per reports.\n\nSBF\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin on October 2 in what experts say is the biggest fraud case in America\u2019s history."

        "title": "Investing In Chromia (CHR) - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "Chromia (CHR) is a multi-layered public blockchain that leverages relational database features. The protocol was designed to provide developers with more programmability and gamers with more scalability. Uniquely, Chromia can operate as a standalone layer 1 blockchain or a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Consequently, it is seen by some as a reliable and easy-to-implement solution for Ethereum's current congestion issues.\n\nWhat Problems Does Chromia (CHR) Attempt to Fix?\n\nChromia brings some much-needed solutions to a variety of problems found in both the enterprise and blockchain sectors. Primarily, Chromia helps with developer onboarding. The entire protocol was built to make it easy for anyone to create and deploy Dapps. As part of this strategy, the developers created the Rell blockchain language that improves Dapp development by reducing the amount of code required.\n\nEthereum Restrictions\n\nEthereum set the pace for the crypto revolution but in terms of technical capabilities and functionality, it's limited. Chromia was designed to also function as a layer-2 protocol which expands the capabilities of the Ethereum network considerably. For example, it\u2019s much cheaper to complete basic transactions and smart contract computations using Chromia as a layer 2 versus Ethereum's mainnet.\n\nBenefits of Chromia (CHR)\n\nChromia is an open-source blockchain. Anyone can join the network and build on the user experience. The network operates as a publicly hosted application infrastructure with a focus on developers and end-users. By enabling developers to create Dapps faster, the protocol helps drive adoption through usability and functionality.\n\nRelational Database\n\nAnother unique aspect of Chromia is the use of relational database programming. This style of database coding is among the most popular in the world. For example, the top four databases in the world are relational. As such, these systems have decades of proven success. Today, rational database language is more popular than Java, Python, PHP, C#, C., and all other blockchain languages.\n\nFlexible\n\nChromia is a flexible platform that pushes the boundaries of blockchain integration. It provides developers with the ability to create protocols that require private, public, or hybrid blockchains. Providing developers with the ability to create applications that can access private and public blockchains opens the door for more use case scenarios.\n\nYou can also create these networks directly using the Layer 1 features. These sub-chains can have unique tokens, consensus mechanisms, and community governance systems. This flexibility makes Chromia a popular choice for developers seeking more advanced programmability in a blockchain.\n\nEasy Sign In\n\nAs part of the developer's desire to reduce the technical barriers for users, the network introduces the Chromia Vault Single Sign On (SSO) feature. Users can save time logging in or verifying actions using the SSO protocol. The goal of the feature is to enable users to frequently utilize Chromia without the hassle of retyping in long passwords every session.\n\nPassive Income\n\nChromia supports CHR staking. Staking is a DeFi feature that enables you to secure low-risk rewards. To participate in staking protocols you need to lock your crypto into a network smart contract. The great thing about staking protocols is that your rewards are predetermined based on your stake. You can improve your payout by simply staking more tokens. In this way, staking provides users access to passive income.\n\nHow Does Chromia (CHR) Work\n\nChromia's multi-layered approach is loosely based on a previous concept called Postchain. In the Chromia version, the layer one blockchain operates as a standalone and fully programmable blockchain. Developers can launch tokens or create other networks using this protocol. Chromia was designed to support the latest DeFi and enterprise-level applications from day one.\n\nWhen Chromia is used as a Layer 2-solution, it expands Ethereum's scalability. In this form, Chromia operates as a light software layer that handles computations that would normally be done on the Ethereum mainnet. It can also be used to speed up voting and consensus.\n\nRell\n\nChromia leverages the custom-built Rell programming language. This advanced developer-centric code is based on the SQL programming language. The creators of the coding tout its simplicity versus other protocols. It provides more efficiency and was built specifically for decentralized blockchain networks. Notably, Chromia offers a Rell workshop for developers eager to learn more about its benefits.\n\nChromia Explorer\n\nThe Chromia Explorer provides users with more transparency. This multi-chain explorer can be used to monitor Chromia, its sub-chains, and Ethereum's mainnet. This strategy provides you with the ability to verify the state of the blockchain or transactions in seconds at no charge.\n\nChromia Vault\n\nYou can monitor all of your digital assets using the portfolio management systems provided by the Chromia Vault. The vault serves multiple roles for users. It keeps you informed on your holdings and simplifies Dapp interactions.\n\nCHR\n\nCHR is the utility token for Chromia. This token can be used to pay fees or traded on any ERC-20 compatible DEXs (decentralized exchanges). Developers can create applications that utilize CHR as tokens as well. Notably, anyone can use CHR as a means to collateralize the issuance of new tokens on the Chromia blockchain.\n\nHistory of Chromia (CHR)\n\nChromia is the work of the Swedish blockchain firm, Chromaway AB. The Chromia project officially launched in May 2019 and was immediately seen as a project of interest for multiple reasons. For one, the network's developers include some well-known crypto stars. For example, Alex Mizrahi, the project's CTO invented the colored coins concept way back in 2012.\n\nOr Perelman, another co-founder on the project has been involved with Bitcoin for over a decade. He worked on one of the first Bitcoin wallets and is mentioned directly in one of the first articles published on Bitcoin. The article was featured in TechCrunch.\n\nHow to Buy Chromia (CHR)\n\nChromia (CHR) is available on the following exchanges:\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is our most recommend exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nWazirX \u2013 This exchange is part of the Binance Group, which ensures a high standard of quality. It is the best exchange for residents of India.\n\nChromia (CHR) \u2013 A New Concept and Great Timing\n\nChromia provides Ethereum users with multiple options to help relieve their woes. It\u2019s also a standalone advanced public blockchain that supports the latest functionalities people desire. These factors, plus the network's unique multi-layer technical structure, make it a project to watch in 2022."

        "content": "Moonbeam (GLMR) operates as a layer-1 blockchain solution that seeks to improve Ethereum interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem. The network is a pioneer in the market as the first full functionally parachain live on Polkadot. The goal of Moonbeam is to provide a seamless transition for developers seeking to escape the congestion and high gas fees of Ethereum and to operate as the main smart contract programmable blockchain within the Parachain system.\n\nWhat Problems Does Moonbeam (GLMR) Solve?\n\nThere are multiple problems that Moonbeam helps to reduce. Primarily, it was designed to provide a smart contract programmable layer to the Polkadot Parachain ecosystem. This system provides Ethereum developers with a way to escape the current congestion issues that have led to record-high gas fees as of late.\n\nMoonbeam is based on the Substrate programming language which enables it to provide a framework for blockchains to interact with Ethereum in a seamless manner. The platform was built from the ground up to be compatible with the Ethereum developer toolchain and network. As such, the protocol supports a variety of popular coding languages. You can create using any protocol that is accepted by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode, making it flexible for developers.\n\nDeveloper Limitations\n\nEthereum's positioning as an early entry into the market has meant that its developers are limited in their capabilities versus modern-day fourth-generation blockchains. The system employs a multi-chain approach which empowers developers to create more helpful and advanced Dapps. Moonbeam provides Ethereum developers with more features, fewer fees, and more scalability without the need to recode. It also saves developers a ton of time in regard to the creation process. The network has built-in integrations for infrastructure services like Chainlink and The Graph. It also supports assets like DOT and the huge selection of ERC-20s in the market today.\n\nBenefits of Moonbeam (GLMR)\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that Moonbeam brings to the market. For one, it operates as the main Polkadot onramp. The network's developer-oriented approach makes expanding Ethereum platforms into the Polkadot ecosystem easier than ever. The system provides a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on Polkadot.\n\nMoonbeam was set up to mirror the Ethereum network\u2019s ecosystem. It shares the same Web3 RPC, accounts, keys, subscriptions, logs, EVM implementation systems, and Web3-compatible AP. Users can also leverage Ethereum-based tools like MetaMask, Remix, Hardhat, Waffle, and Truffle. The system is so accurate that you can interact with the protocol using your existing Ethereum accounts and keys.\n\nMore than Ethereum\n\nMoonbeam supports the integration and token transfers from other chains including Bitcoin as well. It also supports the use of off-chain sensors called Oracles. Oracles can communicate data to and from blockchains. As such, they enable developers to make more robust Dapps.\n\nHow Does Moonbeam (GLMR) Work\n\nParachains are decentralized networks that leverage the Polkadot and Kusama blockchains. These networks leverage Polkadot's security and scalability but possess their own individual tokens, governance mechanisms, and more. Polkadot operates as a sort of highway for decentralized networks. It enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset. The blockchain integrates a sharded design to provide unmatched scalability.\n\nNotably, Parachains can communicate data and value directly and can be customized to meet any need. All Parachains connect via the Relay Chain. This technical structure provides developers with the ability to leverage other networks\u2019 features and services securely.\n\nConsensus\n\nMoonbeam utilizes portions of Polkadot's consensus system and introduces its own DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) multi-layered approach for network smart contract executions. This strategy improves scalability and enables it to scale vertically. According to company documentation, Moonbeam can handle +10,000 tps (transactions per second). In comparison, Ethereum supports only 15 tps.\n\nThe first layer in the Moonbeam consensus system includes the parachain staking filter. This system is tasked with selecting Validators, called collators on the Parachain level. The system utilizes staked-based ranking to accomplish this task. This strategy ensures that all Validators have an economic incentive to perform their duties correctly. From there, the second layer further filters out collators until achieving a subset for each slot.\n\nStaking\n\nUsers can stake their GLMR and secure low-risk rewards. In Moonbeam you can delegate your tokens to collators. These nodes then gain rewards for their participation in securing the network. These rewards are split between those who delegated based on their contribution to the total amount staked.\n\nMoonriver\n\nMoonriver is a test network for those seeking to get a head start on their Moonbeam applications. This network provides developers with the ability to test and verify their Dapps under real economic conditions. This strategy improves security and ensures that only market-ready networks ship to Moonbeam on Polkadot.\n\nGovernance\n\nMoonbeam integrates a community governance mechanism to ensure the system progresses according to its users\u2019 specifications. The weighted voting system enables users to stake their tokens. The more tokens they stake and the more say their votes hold. This style of community governance ensures that a project's community stays cohesive.\n\nGLMR \u2013 Glimmer\n\nMoonbeam users need to hold GLMR to utilize the network's services and features. GLMR functions as the primary utility token for the ecosystem. It\u2019s used for gas fees when executing smart contracts, paying fees, sending value, and staking. GLMR is compatible with other services within the Polkadot ecosystem. It\u2019s also the main governance token for the network.\n\nHow to Buy Moonbeam (GLMR)\n\nMoonbeam (GLMR) is currently available on the following exchanges:\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nWazirX \u2013 This exchange is part of the Binance Group, which ensures a high standard of quality. It is the best exchange for residents of India.\n\nMoonbeam (GLMR) \u2013 A Great Way for Ethereum Developers to Expand\n\nMoonbeam has entered the market at the perfect time. There are now more Ethereum developers than ever. These teams are eager to find ways to avoid the current gas fees and improve their user experience. Moonbeam provides valuable relief to these problems while also expanding the developer\u2019s capabilities. As such, it\u2019s a vital component in the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystem. You can expect to hear more from this development team as the protocol expands its market penetration in the coming months."

The incident allegedly happened when BALD tried to develop a new cryptocurrency that would have let users earn interest on their holdings. However, a coding mistake resulted in the creation of a token that was much more valuable than intended.\n\nBALD swiftly acknowledged the error and made an effort to make things right by giving the tokens back to their rightful owners. However, given that the tokens had already been sold on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges, this proved to be a challenging undertaking. In an effort to get the tokens back, BALD offered to buy them back at a higher price, but this was declined.\n\nBALD was able to recover the majority of the tokens and give them back to their rightful owners after several days of talks. The incident serves as a reminder of the dangers associated with cryptocurrencies and the necessity of thoroughly testing code before putting it into use on the blockchain.\n\nThe tragedy also serves as a reminder that the cryptocurrency sector needs more regulation in order to safeguard investors and stop similar situations from happening in the future. Even though blockchain technology has the potential to transform many industries, it is still in its early phases of development, and occurrences like this show why cryptocurrency investors should exercise caution.\n\nThe risks and difficulties present in the cryptocurrency market are highlighted by the BALD developer\u2019s $12 million worth of Ethereum that was returned following a dramatic mishap. Even though situations like this can harm cryptocurrencies\u2019 reputations, they also teach both investors and developers important lessons.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Arbitrum (ARB) is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution that has caught the attention of traders and investors. As a result, the platform continues to see growing adoption which has made the off-chain protocol one of the most popular scaling solutions for ETH transactions. Here's everything you need to know about Arbitrum (ARB).\n\nArbitrum's numbers don't lie. The network currently has +$7.04B in locked assets according to a company report. Additionally, 4.8M+ users are leveraging the platform to improve performance and security. Impressively, these users have saved a collective $1.1B in Ethereum gas fees since the launch of the network.\n\nWhat Problems Does Arbitrum (ARB) Attempt to Fix?\n\nArbitrum fills the role of a layer-2 protocol. It provides a reliable, affordable, and secure way for Ethereum developers and users to save on costs. The network accomplishes this task by reducing the amount of data on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum was set at only 14 transactions per second before its ETH2.0 upgrade, while Arbitrum clocks in at +40,000 tps.\n\nHigh Fees\n\nEthereum users suffered from record-high fees for many years until the most recent upgrade. Arbitrum and many other platforms targeted this pain point. Arbitrum users can send Ethereum transactions for a fraction of the cost of using the mainnet. The lower costs make it possible to create more in-depth and elaborate Dapps.\n\nStorage Issues\n\nWhen you have a network as large as Ethereum it becomes difficult to store all the data associated with the growing number of dapps in operation. Arbitrum enables network users to store computation and data off of Ethereum's main blockchain. The system also makes it faster to pull this data when needed, which makes the network more responsive.\n\nBenefits of Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nArbitrum brings many benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem. The entire project helps to keep Ethereum's performance on par with other top-performing networks. The protocol leverages Optimistic Rollup technology to provide added scalability. Optimistic roll-up tech is used by blockchains to improve data storage and transfer.\n\nThis advanced data compression technique works by collecting data on transaction batches before they are on the blockchain. From there, the system settles the batch on the rollup chain before sending the finalized data to the mainnet. This structure provides 7x more throughput compared to traditional systems.\n\nEVM Compatible \u2013 Arbitrum\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Arbitrum is the easy onboarding process. The network was designed from day one to be fully compatible with the complete Ethereum developer tooling kit. As such, developers don\u2019t have to reprogram anything to start using Web3 applications, deploy smart contracts, and save on fees.\n\nEthereum Security\n\nOne of the coolest aspects of Arbitrum's approach was the decision not to use a network token directly. The use of ETH means that the network shares Ethereum's security as the largest Dapp network in the world. Ethereum has a proven track record. Developers can use this protocol to add Ethereum as an interface to other systems adding security.\n\nHow Does Arbitrum (ARB) Work?\n\nArbitrum functions similarly to other layer-2 protocols in that it handles some of the functions of the mainnet off-chain. To utilize Arbitrum, you just send the transaction to EthBridge's Inbox contracts. The system will use this as a cue to collect transaction data and computations on the Arbitrum chain. The final data gets sent directly to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nStylus\n\nStylus is a new programming application for Arbitrum. It enables developers to use more coding options when creating Dapps on the network. The system enables the use of Rust, C, C++, and other popular coding protocols. This approach makes the Ethereum ecosystem more flexible and opens the door for traditional programmers to start creating decentralized applications.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Nitro\n\nArbitrum leveraged a proprietary tech stack called Nitro. This full stack can execute instances of virtual machines in real time. As such, it's seen as a powerful tool for game programmers and other high-intensity use case scenarios.\n\nArbitrum One ecosystem\n\nThe Arbitrum One ecosystem is home to the communities' dapps and offerings. There are a lot of cool Dapps that provide users with a mix of helpful services from gaming to converting and storing crypto. There are also developer tools here that make it easier to migrate or create new Dapps.\n\nToken\n\nArbitrum recently released a governance token called ARB. This governance token was officially launched on March 23, 2023. The token enables Arbitrum users to gain a say in the future actions of the network. Governance systems like this work by enabling users to stake their tokens to gain voting rights.\n\nAnyone can stake their ARB tokens and put forth a proposal or vote on others. This structure is more transparent and has proven to be a great way to keep DeFi communities more in sync. Notably, there is a circulating supply of 10B ARB currently.\n\nHistory\n\nArbitrum is the brainchild of Offchain Labs which was founded by Ed Felten. Felton is best known for his time served at the White House under President Obama's administration. In April 2021, the group secured USD $20M to further the platform's development. A few months later, the group secured $100M in funding during a series B round.\n\nArbitrum After ETH2.0\n\nThe recent ETH2.0 upgrade has taken the network to the next level in terms of scalability and sustainability. This upgrade didn\u2019t make Arbitrum obsolete as the network also completed its Nitro upgrade recently. As such, it can still provide valuable services to the ecosystem regarding lowering congestion and improving transaction speeds.\n\nHow to Buy Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nCurrently, Arbitrum (ARB) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a recommend exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nArbitrum (ARB) \u2013 Improving Ethereum\n\nArbitrum helps Ethereum reach new performance levels with its use of roll-up technology. Ethereum developers and users can appreciate the added flexibility provided by the network. When you consider its offerings, backing, leadership, and current spot as the top 2cd layer option, it's safe to expect further adoption moving forward."

        "title": "ZKSync: Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Scalability Solution - INDODAX",
        "content": "Ethereum is a popular blockchain platform for running smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). However, along with its popularity came scalability issues that needed to be addressed. Scalability itself refers to the network\u2019s ability to efficiently handle a large number of transactions or activities.\n\nTo note, Ethereum faces challenges in terms of scalability because its original design, known as \u201cEthereum 1.0,\u201d has limitations in terms of throughput (number of transactions per second) and high transaction fees.\n\nIn order to overcome the scalability problem on the Ethereum network, ZKSync, a scaling protocol that uses a zero-knowledge rollup approach, is the solution.\n\nThe zero-knowledge rollup approach allows many transactions to be carried out at the off-chain layer (outside the main Ethereum network), while only a transaction validity summary is announced on the main network.\n\nSo, to better understand what ZKSync is, its history, uniqueness, founder, how it works, and its benefits, see the full review below.\n\nWhat is ZKSync?\n\nBasically, ZKSync is an L2 or layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum by leveraging ZK-rollup, or zero-knowledge rollup, technology. This technology makes transactions happen faster and cheaper while providing the security of the Ethereum network for users.\n\nIn fact, this scaling solution is designed for Ether (ETH) and ERC20 tokens. ZKSync itself implements a zero-knowledge rollup approach that combines an off-chain layer (announcement layer) and an on-chain layer (verification layer) to improve the performance of the Ethereum network.\n\nBy moving most transaction activity to the off-chain layer, ZKSync can increase network throughput. That means that more transactions can be processed at once.\n\nTransaction fees can also be lower because users don\u2019t have to pay high gas fees like on the main Ethereum network. This makes the platform more cost-friendly and accessible to a wide range of people.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that ZKSync is designed to integrate with existing applications on the Ethereum network. ZKSync can also be applied in various use cases, such as non-fungible token (NFT) markets, digital asset exchanges, and decentralized games.\n\nA Brief History of ZKSync\n\nHistorically, the development of ZKSync started as an attempt to address scalability issues on the Ethereum network. As for Ethereum, at first it experienced problems in terms of throughput and high transaction costs, so many development teams and companies started efforts to find solutions that could improve network performance while maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nZKSync itself is a project from Matter Labs that focuses on providing real-world use cases for its users. The team behind this project believes that transaction throughput is really not just about scalability but also the general readiness of the blockchain network to serve multiple users.\n\nThe first version of zkSync was released on the Ethereum mainnet around June 2020. They are currently using PLONK as their zero-knowledge method to validate transactions. The project team also announced their plans to roll out the second version of ZKSync, 2.0, to the Ethereum mainnet. The project will reportedly also release a number of new updates to further improve overall network performance.\n\nFor your information, some of the key figures behind the development of ZKSync, among others, are Alex Gluchowski, who is a co-founder of Matter Labs and the technical lead of the ZKSync project. Then there is Denis Bogdanov, who is also the founder of Matter Labs and a cryptography researcher.\n\nIn addition to the key figures above, the team at Matter Labs is known to also consist of talented engineers, researchers, and developers in various technical fields, including cryptography, computer science, and blockchain development.\n\nWhy is ZKSync unique?\n\nPlease note that ZKSync is unique in that it is one of the scaling protocols that takes an innovative approach using the Zero-Knowledge Rollup concept to address scalability issues on the Ethereum network. In addition, ZKSync also offers many unique features that prove to be more attractive to users, including:\n\nDefault Account Abstraction\n\nThe built-in account abstraction feature in ZKSync is known to turn externally owned accounts (EOA) like MetaMask users into contract accounts (CA). This opens up endless possibilities; for example, there is no need for a seed phrase, multiple transactions can be combined together, and payments are automated.\n\nPrivacy and speed\n\nZK-rollup technology is the foundation of ZKSync. In this case, ZK-Rollup combines a privacy-protecting network with fast transaction processing.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe base layer on ZK-Rollup layer 2 is Ethereum. Therefore, ZKSync relies on Ethereum for security against hacks and attacks on all networks.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe main value of ZKSync is its compatibility with EVM. Please note that zkEVM makes ZK-based smart contracts compatible with EVM. In this case, developers can easily build ZKSync using Ethereum\u2019s native programming languages, such as Solidity.\n\nWho is the founder of ZKSync?\n\nAs previously mentioned, Alex Gluchowski is the founder of Matter Labs, the team behind ZKSync. ZKSync itself is one of the first crypto companies to make a ZK rollup prototype in 2019.\n\nSince then, the company has received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. Most recently, they secured a $200 million Series C funding round led by Blockchain Capital and Dragonfly Capital, bringing ZKSync\u2019s total financing to over $458 million.\n\nHow does ZKSync work?\n\nIn terms of how it works, ZKSync is known to take advantage of the zero-knowledge rollup approach to move most transaction activity to a more efficient off-chain layer while maintaining security and integrity using zero-knowledge proofs. This results in increased throughput, lower fees, and a better experience for users on the Ethereum network. The following is a mechanism or how it works that you need to know, including:\n\nRollups\n\nRollup tasks, namely executing transactions outside layer 1 and sending (posting) data to layer 1 or where the transaction data is validated. Rollups are generally able to minimize gas fees while increasing transaction throughput.\n\nHowever, in order for Ethereum to be able to validate transactions, each rollup will place a set of smart contracts at layer 1 that process deposits and withdrawals and then verify proofs. It\u2019s just that, until now, there have been two different rollups used on the Ethereum network. These are the ZK rollup and the optimistic rollup.\n\nIn this regard, ZKSync is known to use ZK rollup, which is a scaling solution with funds stored on the main chain. Meanwhile, transaction processing and storage are carried out off-chain. In addition, this one rollup implements validity proof, is calculated on-chain, and will ensure that transactions that take place in the rollup have been verified.\n\nZk Rollup\n\nThe ZK rollup, or Zero Knowledge Rollup, handles many transactions from the main Ethereum chain and creates SNARK, which is cryptographic proof that helps users prove that they own certain data without showing details. The solution offers proof of validity that is sent to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe task of the smart contract for ZK rollup is to store information from all transactions available at layer 2. Not only that, this information can only be changed with validity proof, which means that ZK rollup will only need this validity proof as a substitute for the amount of data, which is generally very extensive.\n\nPlease note that validating transactions using SNARK will be far more efficient than having to validate each transaction individually. Basically, saving status in an off-chain way is much cheaper than storing it in an EVM. As a result, scalability can be optimized to more than 150 times the reach of the mainnet.\n\nZKSync advantages\n\nAs a blockchain scalability protocol, ZKSync also offers several important advantages. The main advantage that can be felt by its users is the low transaction fees for ETH and ERC20 tokens. In fact, gas fees on ZkSync can be 100 times cheaper than on Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, the transfer fee is only $0.02, the withdrawal fee is $1.59, the activation fee is $0.44, and the NFT minting fee is $0.05. In addition, the transaction process on ZKSync is known to be 142 times faster than Ethereum.\n\nThis is because the number of transactions processed is indeed higher, from 14 transactions per second on Ethereum to 2,000 transactions per second on zkSync. Another advantage is that even crypto assets can be transferred instantly from zkSync to Ethereum. Most importantly, ZKSync\u2019s security is guaranteed, just like the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, ZKSync is a scaling protocol that uses the zero-knowledge rollup concept to address scalability issues in the Ethereum network. At ZKSync, most transactions are executed at the off-chain layer and then accumulated into a summary of transaction state, which is verified periodically on the main Ethereum network. This results in increasing network capacity in an efficient and secure way.\n\nZKSync is also important in increasing the efficiency and performance of blockchain networks because ZKSync is able to increase the throughput of the Ethereum network by processing many transactions at the off-chain layer, which ultimately overcomes the problem of throughput limitations.\n\nFurthermore, ZKSync reduces transaction costs by moving most activities to the off-chain layer, making it more affordable for a wide range of audiences.\n\nWith transactions processed at the off-chain layer and verified regularly, transaction confirmation on ZKSync is even faster. Apart from that, ZKSync also helps the Ethereum network remain sustainable in the face of increased adoption and activity."

        "content": "Donald Trump is likely to run for the post of US President in the upcoming election for the White House. Elections are set to happen in 2024, exactly the next year and 4 years after Donald Trump lost his seat to Joe Biden. There are many political aspects to the 2024 elections, but the one in focus at the moment is the holdings of Donald Trump in Ethereum.\n\nPer reports that have surfaced, it is being said that Donal Trump, the former US President, holds over $500k in Ethereum. That translates to half a million in the crypto market. It is linked to this NFT collection which was launched in December 2022 in a bid to announce his run for the elections. The figures came to light after he submitted a filing to the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nThe form included a list of assets and sources of income belonging to Trump. One section showed a cryptocurrency wallet Ethereum with a value ranging from $250k and $500k.\n\nThe NFT collection features Trump himself as a cowboy, superhero, and astronaut in different poses. The collection was initially priced at $99. The sales have pitched up in the following months.\n\nTrump\u2019s holding in the crypto market, in any form, is critical because he has been dubious about the crypto industry since the very beginning. As a matter of fact, he even tweeted that he was not a big fan of Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies. The tweet has been deleted, and his former Communications Director has claimed that the tweet was never authored by him. Meaning the tweet was published from his account, but Trump was never the one to put that up.\n\nTrump\u2019s old tweet has been deleted, but the former US President is still in the limelight with the recent revelation.\n\nOne reason why he was in the news again is because he had stated that cryptocurrency felt just like another scam. This statement was made by him while interacting with the media. Trump even clarified that he prefers fiat currency over cryptocurrency and does not like cryptos a bit. He has explained his preference by saying that cryptocurrency is another currency that is attempting to compete with the US Dollar, adding that he does not like that.\n\nDonal Trump\u2019s previous statements are not just in contrast to his recent filings but also in contrast to what some of his party members are saying. Most of them have openly come out as an advocate for the crypto market. Republicans in the House and Senate have worked extensively to draft the bills and get them cleared so that the crypto industry gets cheers.\n\nMiami Mayor Francis Suarez and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, are some examples. Robert F Kennedy Jr, a candidate hailing from the Democratic Party, has also come out in support of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Shimmering in the Shadows: Can IOTA\u2019s Shimmer EVM Compete with Crypto Giants like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple (XRP)? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "IOTA shimmer EVM will compete directly with other industry peers such as Binance Smart Chain and Arbitrum in the DeFi space.\n\nAnalyzing the security, accessibility, and integration aspects, Shimmer\u2019s innovative validation process and decentralized governance stand out.\n\nThe IOTA Foundation unveiled its Layer-1 staging network Shimmer last year in September 2022. Shimmer is a fee-free, parallelized DAG ledger designed to safeguard and establish fully customizable smart contract chains. IOTA introduced it as a testing network to rigorously assess all forthcoming advancements for the IOTA protocol. The native token of the shimmer network is SMR.\n\nThe IOTA developers have been working on Shimmer Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with its testnet version already live in the market. The ShimmerEVM testnet chain represents the inaugural EVM-compatible smart contract chain within the Shimmer network. This chain facilitates scalable, rapid, secure, and parallel handling of smart contracts.\n\nWith ShimmerEVM back in the market, it will be interesting to see whether it can compete with peer alt-chains in the market. In order to understand this, it is crucial to know how would Shimmer EVM fare across three major verticals of security, accessibility, and integrations.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum, Binancesmart Chain, Tron, and Arbitrum cater to 85% of the total value locked in the industry. Let\u2019s see how each of these platform fare across these three verticals.\n\n1. Security\n\nArbitrum exhibits strong performance in this aspect, utilizing Ethereum\u2019s robust validator network and employing zk-rollup technology for secure communication between the two. Ethereum\u2019s proven history adds credibility to its security claims.\n\nYet, Arbitrum does have a security vulnerability, its DAO. The Arbitrum DAO faced criticism over its initial proposal that self-allocated tokens, disregarding its own vote outcome. Such actions raise concerns about decentralization in a project.\n\nOn the other hand, BSC employs a \u2018Proof of Authority\u2019 system for security. Validators need to meet specific criteria and undergo an election based on BNB delegated to them. This protects them against malicious validators. However, Binance holds 71% of total BNB, effectively controlling validators. Given Binance\u2019s legal issues, trust is questioned.\n\nShimmer stands apart from Arbitrum and BSC. Shimmer EVM functions as a platform for others to build chains, with validators chosen by chain creators. This introduces variability in security. Shimmer\u2019s validation process presents risks, not stress-tested in the open market.\n\nShimmer boasts a fairly decentralized DAO. SMR voting tokens were airdropped to IOTA stakers, aligning with committed chain development. However, a third of tokens are concentrated in 26 addresses, potentially limiting governance influence. Still, this surpasses BNB\u2019s lack of DAO. Shimmer\u2019s live governance respects community votes, unlike Arbitrum\u2019s Foundation overruling.\n\n2. Accessibility\n\nArbitrum is reasonably accessible, with Ethereum bridging to it seamlessly, making it user-friendly for DeFi users. Bridge aggregators also enable access from various alt chains. It excels in efficiency, settling transactions faster and at a lower gas cost than Ethereum. It can process 40,000 transactions per second compared to BNB\u2019s 2,200. BNB chain offers straightforward access through Binance, benefiting from bridge connections. Although slower than Arbitrum, BNB remains faster than Ethereum and has lower gas fees. Shimmer EVM access is a bit complex. Its token is available on limited exchanges, requiring direct transfer to Shimmer\u2019s wallet or conversion from Iota on Binance. The process may simplify upon EVM launch. However, Shimmer\u2019s unique DAG structure ensures speed. During testing, it achieved 1.83M daily transactions with a block time of 0.7-0.8 seconds, aligning well with Arbitrum\u2019s speed but with a slightly longer block time. 3. Integrations Arbitrum and BSC are well involved in the crypto world. Arbitrum is popular for its derivatives platform and speedy DeFi projects, while BSC has many integrated projects, though some may not be trustworthy. Shimmer\u2019s integration potential is uncertain since it\u2019s not yet live. The Touchpoint program plans various projects for its EVM launch, with an existing community of around 200k wallets, eager for its success.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

The iconic design of the Coca-Cola bottle serves as the unifying element that binds them all together, resulting in an alluring and attractive onchain collectible. Notably, this collection was influenced by the recent \u201cMasterpiece\u201d Coca-Cola commercial, which clearly shows the influence of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe NFTs are being produced using the mint.fun platform, and as of Wednesday, almost 50,000 NFTs have already been produced. These collectibles are priced between 0.0011 and 0.014 ETH, but intriguingly, some are currently on sale on the NFT marketplace OpenSea for less than it costs to mint them.\n\nCoca-Cola has previously ventured into the world of NFTs. The beverage juggernaut organized an auction for four unique NFTs in July 2021, raising more than $575,000 for charitable causes. Additionally, Coca-Cola released 136 collectibles in July 2022 to commemorate Pride Month, illustrating its dedication to investigating the versatile potential of digital art and tokenization.\n\nThe Coca-Cola NFT collection is now a part of the \u201cOnchain Summer\u201d initiative, which highlights a number of noteworthy projects, including the \u201cFriends With Benefits\u201d partnership, which introduces \u201cNew Era ETH\u201d and \u201cNew Era BTC\u201d NFTs in collaboration with the enigmatic crypto figure Cozomo de\u2019 Medici. Famous brands like Optimism, Atari, and now Coca-Cola are among the other participants.\n\nAugust 9 marked the start of the multi-week event, which will end on August 30. Coinbase is providing grants to initiatives that are actively enhancing and expanding the Base network in addition to these creative endeavors, encouraging innovation and expansion within the Layer 2 chain ecosystem.\n\nRecent events have highlighted the Base network\u2019s increasing importance. The social network integration with friend.tech is partially responsible for the daily active user count surpassing the milestone of 100,000 for the first time. According to data from The Block\u2019s extensive data dashboard, the volume of Ethereum Layer 2 transactions is also quickly approaching that of other popular scaling solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum. The effectiveness and scalability that Layer 2 solutions like Base bring to the blockchain industry are highlighted by this performance.\n\nThe merging of Coca-Cola and the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market reveals remarkable progress for both the business and digital art world, showing the combination of technology, creativity, and economics that makes up today\u2019s time. As the \u201cOnchain Summer\u201d initiative continues to grow, it gives us an exciting glimpse into what blockchain innovations may bring in the coming years."

        "title": "ETH Hits All Time High And So Do Ethereum Gas Fees - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The price with ETH has ripped through it\u2019s all-time high. However, the crises around Ethereum gas fees has yet to be solved. And today, gas fees are the highest that they\u2019ve been in a long time if ever.\n\nAn unfair position for beginners\n\nOne simple trade of less than $1000 has a gas fee of nearly $200. That\u2019s 20% of the entire trade. For traders with small capital this can cost them a lot of opportunity. Say, someone has only $2000 in crypto. Are they going to want to make a transaction which charges them a fee that is 10% of their entire portfolio? I would hope not.\n\nThis creates an environment that only people with large amounts of capital can afford to do any trading at all.\n\nWhy Ethereum 2.0 will lower gas fees\n\nEthereum 2.0 is set to be released later this year. This will change Ethereum from a proof of work network to a proof of stake network. In POW networks, miners are paid gas fees for running transactions which cost a high amount of electricity and require very expensive equipment. In a proof of stake network, instead of a few concentrated individuals working as validators, anyone who holds Ethereum can become a validator. So, with Ethereum 2.0, there will be thousands if not millions of people in time who will be running their own nodes.\n\nHow Ethereum 2.0 will cause price to explode\n\nWe will over time see an increase in the price of Ethereum as more people come to use the network. Ethereum 2.0 will cause more scalability through lower transaction fees, bringing in more people instead of deterring them from fees that for some make it impossible to trade.\n\nIf Ethereum price can soar to above $4,000 considering how awful the user experience can be, imagine how high the price could become once Ethereum 2.0 is released.\n\nHow will ethereum 2.0 affect price?https://t.co/LiVgvKeP2V\n\n\n\nIncreasing the number of transactions per second can push many traders to hold the coin and transfer it around exchanges for very low fees instantly.\n\n\n\nhttps:// #Defi#MustHaveCrypto pic.twitter.com/W4w7lXIvBw \u2014 #We Teach Crypto @MustHaveCrypto Token (@MustHaveCrypto) May 8, 2021\n\nAdditionally, as seen in the tweet above, Ethereum 2.0 will cause validators to hold their Ethereum instead of dumping it through staking incentives. Without major holders dumping their Ethereum, the value of the network will also continue to increase.\n\nWhen will Ethereum 2.0 be released?\n\nThis is actually a question with more than one answer. This is because Ethereum 2.0 is a release of several different upgrades with their own release. The Beacon Chain is one Eth 2.0 upgrade that already went live December 2020. And according to Ethereum.org these other updates will come later in 2021 and 2022. An excerpt of information from Ethereum.org reads,\n\nThe merge is when mainnet begins using the Beacon Chain for consensus, and proof-of-work is turned off. What\u2019s mainnet? Shard chains should follow the merge, some time in 2022.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhile gas fees are higher than ever before, it\u2019s good to see that the price of Ethereum is still doing well. If it can do this under these circumstances, it\u2019s speaks volumes of how Ethereum will continue to grow and be valued as one of the top networks in all of crypto.\n\nFind more information on the Ethereum price predictions in following article: Ethereum Will Explode Says Lark Davis \u2013 Bigger Than Bitcoin?"
