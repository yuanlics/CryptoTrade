        "content": "A new research paper co-authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delves into the ways in which blockchains can remain both private and compliant with government regulations.\n\nThe paper comes during a notable period of friction between the use of permissionless networks and government agencies wishing to expand their oversight of such activities. Last month, two co-founders of the EVM-compatible transaction mixing service Tornado Cash were charged by the US government.\n\nThe paper\u2019s authors \u2014 Buterin, as well as Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, University of Basel professor Fabian Sch\u00e4r, doctoral candidate Matthias Nadler of the University of Basel, and Spankchain co-founder Ameen Soleimani \u2014 contend that good and bad actors could be distinguished through the use of a \u201csmart contract-based privacy enhancing protocol\u201d dubbed Privacy Pools.\n\nPrivacy Pools uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and enables users to generate a new withdrawal address that can\u2019t be linked to previous transactions.\n\nIt also lets users choose their own privacy settings \u2014 meaning they can exclude any suspicious users from their transactions. This can be achieved through Merkle roots.\n\nThe authors note that their intention is to find cooperative solutions between lawmakers, regulators and practitioners across various fields to ensure that privacy-enhanced infrastructure can thrive in an otherwise regulated environment.\n\n\u201cWe argue that the proposal is quite flexible and can be adapted to potentially satisfy a\n\nlarge variety of regulatory requirements,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe paper should be seen as a humble contribution towards a potential future in which financial privacy and regulation can co-exist.\u201d\n\nInside Privacy Pools\n\nAny crypto asset created and spent on a blockchain possesses a coin ID (or hash) associated with it. This information is stored using a Merkle tree, a data structure through which each hash is linked to another hash in a tree-like structure.\n\nNumerous transaction hashes are stored in a block, and each block is also hashed, creating a Merkle root.\n\nIn tandem with zero-knowledge tech \u2014 which enable blockchains to prove that data is accurate without revealing the information itself \u2014 users can prove that their withdrawals are made through a previous deposit. At the same time, they\u2019d only reveal information from a limited data set of their choosing.\n\nThis means that honest users can prove that the origins of their funds are not directly tied to criminal activity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the bear market continues to tighten its grip, Ethereum has witnessed a decline in price mirroring the downward trajectory of Bitcoin.\n\nThis downturn has instilled apprehension among investors, resulting in a surge in selling activity surrounding this digital asset. Nonetheless, as retail takes fright, Ethereum whales are now taking advantage of the prevailing bearish sentiment, as they have commenced purchasing substantial quantities of ETH at current discounted prices.\n\nLate Tuesday, Ethereum whales made a substantial move by purchasing approximately 260,000 Ether (ETH) in just 24 hours. Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, revealed this significant acquisition, amounting to nearly $425 million, on Twitter. The pundit shared a compelling chart from Santiment, showcasing the remarkable influx of capital into Ethereum despite prevailing market conditions.\n\nThis development unfolds against the backdrop of crypto prices remaining under pressure recently. Many have attributed Ether\u2019s weakness to dumping by big investors over the past four months, as well as prevailing regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry, particularly in the U.S.\n\nRecently, Brian Quinlivan, Santiment\u2019s marketing director, noted that large Ethereum (ETH) holders had exhibited bearish behaviour since around April, contrasting with their bullish stance observed in late 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere has been about a 4-month long dump in supply from addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH. They really were accumulating significantly at the end of last year, but profit taking from these key tiers happened hard and quickly right as the price was hitting around a 1-year high of approximately $2,120.\u201d Quinlivan wrote.\n\nJust yesterday, Santiment highlighted two whales who sent 300,000 Ether to Coinbase, raising fears of an imminent dump among traders.\n\nOn the other hand, an analyst known by the pseudonym \u201cgreatest trader\u201d from Cryptoquant linked Ether\u2019s continued weakness to future traders who have been actively selling.\n\nIn a post earlier this week, the analyst noted Ethereum\u2019s ongoing bearish trend, illustrated by a declining 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio, signals dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders. In reading this metric, values above one signify bullish sentiment, while values below one indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pundit shared a chart which depicts the continuous decline in the taker buy-sell ratio over the past few months, consistently remaining below the pivotal one mark and reaching a yearly low.\n\n\u201cThis consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum\u2019s market.\u201d He wrote.\n\nThe analyst noted that for Ethereum\u2019s price to embark on a new bullish trajectory, it would require a shift in behaviour among futures traders, characterized by a more aggressive buying stance, as indicated by a metric rising above the critical one threshold.\n\nEther was trading at $1,636 at press time, barely up a percentage point over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor with high institutional interest has massive upside potential.\n\nThe anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana (SOL) has key advantages over ETH that could send its price soaring.\n\n\u201cBut the real difference is how much better by what magnitude is Solana. And if you look here, red is Solana and the deltas, and then blue is ETH. You can see it smashes it. These things are on a log scale on the left. And that is the big difference. Looking at all of the key factors, they have 10 wins each, but in reality, where Solana wins, it wins by a lot more. Where Ethereum wins, it only wins by a fraction.\u201d\n\nHis chart shows 19 different categories comparing Solana to ETH. Solana beats ETH in such categories as block time, average fee and the maximum number of transactions that a blockchain can carry out in a second, also known as transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe trader says that ETH is considered more established than Solana and a safer bet for investors.\n\nHowever, he notes that more institutional money has flowed into Solana so far in 2023.\n\n\u201cEthereum is safe. It\u2019s established. It has been around for a long time. The risk is very low. When big money comes in, they\u2019ll go into ETH first, although we have seen so far this year in 2023 institutional money is going into Solana more so than Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAccording to the trader, since Solana\u2019s market cap is much smaller than Ethereum\u2019s, SOL has a greater opportunity for a larger price increase than ETH.\n\nSolana is the 10th-ranked digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $8.2 billion. Ethereum is the second top digital asset by market cap with a market cap of $196 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is the magic question though. When you break it all down is Ethereum 20 times better than Solana? And the answer in my opinion is no. But there is risk with Solana, therefore you allocate accordingly. My Solana bag is about a third the size of my ETH bag but it will grow and I think it\u2019ll grow faster.\n\nBut that little skinny green sliver on the right is the market cap of Solana versus the market cap of ETH. And the ETH market cap is 20 times higher, which is stunning. And I look as an investor for relative value. Solana is a screaming buy at this price.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $20.28 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has outlined his vision for a more decentralized Ethereum network in which it is much easier to run validators.\n\nAt present, over half of all Ethereum nodes are run through hosting services operated by companies like Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control a huge stash of ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has criticized the present state of Ethereum nodes. Pointing out that the majority of nodes are currently run through providers like Amazon Web Services, he identified node centralization as a major problem the Ethereum community needs to deal with.\n\nIn another potential threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization, critics have speculated that Chinese firms secretly control some of the richest ETH wallets in existence.\n\nThe Problem of Ethereum Node Centralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is made up of computers that communicate with each other in order to validate transactions and record data about the status of the blockchain.\n\nEach computer in the network is known as an Ethereum node. From its inception, the Ethereum community has worked to establish nodes all around the world. In order to ensure the network\u2019s decentralization, various computers belonging to individuals, businesses, universities and other organizations all operate nodes.\n\nHowever, not all computers are up to the task. In fact, to operate a full Ethereum node, Quicknode recommends a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, a fast SSD drive with at least 1 TB of space, at least 25 MBit/s bandwidth and a fast CPU with 4 or more cores.\n\nDue to the high technical bar node operators must meet, 57.5% of all nodes are run through cloud hosting services. As a consequence, although there are currently 5882 Ethereum nodes in operation, over half of these are controlled by just 21 cloud service providers.\n\nIn fact, 1805 nodes are operated via Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone, presenting a major challenge to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization.\n\nVitalik Buterin on the Future of Ethereum Nodes\n\nSpeaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Vitalik Buterin discusses how to create a more decentralized Ethereum network by making it easier to run nodes.\n\nAddressing the problem of node centralization in Seoul on Monday, September 4, Buterin observed that reducing the amount of data each node has to store would lower technical barriers for would-be operators.\n\n\u201cToday, it takes hundreds of gigabytes of data to run a node\u2026 In the longer term, there\u2019s a plan to maintain fully verified Ethereum nodes where you could literally run it on your phone,\u201d he said .\n\nPlans to change how Ethereum nodes handle data have already been formed. For example, the Ethereum Roadmap identifies planned upgrades that will allow computers operating Ethereum nodes to delete historical data they no longer need.\n\nIn the immediate future, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on data expiry as the most achievable goal for reducing the computational burden on network participants.\n\nLooking further ahead, however, a concept known as statelessness could make it much easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnder a stateless system, not all nodes would have to access the network\u2019s full state data. But the most ambitious vision for the future of Ethereum nodes, a concept known as \u201cstrong statelessness,\u201d may not happen for a long time.\n\nAccording to Buterin, \u201cThese technical problems will have to be addressed eventually\u2014maybe a 10-year timescale, maybe a 20-year timescale.\u201d\n\nChinese Government Wallets May Hold a Huge Stash of ETH\n\nAs well as the concentration of nodes among a few operators, another threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization could come from the concentration of ETH among a small number of wallets.\n\nIn the proof of stake (PoS) era, ETH accumulation of that kind poses a major threat to Ethereum decentralization.\n\nUnder Ethereum\u2019s previous proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, what\u2019s known as a 51% attack would require a single party to control over half of all miners, thus requiring a huge amount of resources to pull off. However, with the switch from miners to stakers, to seize control of the network, attackers would need to control more than half of the circulating supply of ETH instead.\n\nFor some researchers, this prospect is especially worrying given that many of the oldest and richest Ethereum wallets remain shrouded in secrecy. Moreover, concerns have been raised recently about the role of the Chinese business conglomerate Wanxiang in Ethereum\u2019s early history.\n\nAs the Twitter sleuth TruthLabs has observed, Wanxiang has been associated with Ethereum since its inception and likely received a portion of the 72 million ETH that was distributed to early investors.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nIn fact, the Chinese company has ties to Vitalik Buterin going back to 2015, when the then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, Feng Xia, purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from the Ethereum founder.\n\nFor TruthLabs, Wanxiang\u2019s deep roots in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are a good reason to be suspicious of its ETH holdings. In fact, the crypto investigator speculates that the CCP is Ethereum\u2019s biggest whale, secretly controlling as much as 66.6% Of the ETH supply.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023"

Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain certificate touting your knowledge of Ethereum by taking Decrypt U's free course, Getting Started with Ethereum.\n\nAs of September 2023, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by total value, with a market capitalization of over $229 billion. Despite the fact that Ethereum\u2019s value is lower than that of rival Bitcoin, though, there is a good argument to be made that Ethereum is more important for the crypto and blockchain spaces overall than its larger competitor. Since its launch in 2015, the Ethereum network has been instrumental in powering the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) and, more recently, the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) more broadly.\n\nThis is thanks to Ethereum\u2019s powerful smart contracts capabilities and versatility. As of March 2023, protocols built using the Ethereum network were responsible for about 90%, or $90 billion, of the total value locked in DeFi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust as Ethereum is a critical component of the crypto world and one that has shaped the development of the industry since its launch, the network\u2019s founder Vitalik Buterin is similarly influential. The Russian-Canadian programmer and writer\u2014who is not yet 30 years old as of this writing\u2014is arguably the single most famous individual in the world of cryptocurrency today (another prime candidate for this title, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is a pseudonymous name potentially representing more than one real person). Who is Vitalik Buterin, and how did he come to create Ethereum?\n\nEarly Interests Led to Crypto\n\nButerin was born in Russia but moved to Canada at a young age, where he was quickly recognized for his strong abilities in math. His earliest experiences with programming and crypto came at home, as his father was a computer scientist. Notably, Buterin\u2019s early experience with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft may have contributed to his desire to work outside of the traditional, centralized economics space: although a devoted player, he quit the game when developers made a change to the rules that he disagreed with.\n\nThrough high school and into college, Buterin honed his programming abilities and connected with influential mentors like the cryptographer Ian Goldberg, known for his involvement with the Tor Project among other things. It was during this time that he also first learned of Bitcoin, in 2011. Buterin wrote blog articles on cryptocurrency to earn his first BTC, eventually co-founding and contributing to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nCollege Years and Ethereum Origins\n\nAs a student at the University of Waterloo, Buterin assisted Goldberg until his work in cryptocurrency began to take up a substantial portion of his time. At this stage, he left university to travel the world for several months to connect with Bitcoin developers. This experience was crucial to Buterin\u2019s development of the Ethereum model, as he felt that the developers he met were all too concerned with specific uses for cryptocurrency. Buterin came to believe that the next generation of blockchain systems should be more versatile and broader.\n\nButerin\u2019s interest in broadening Bitcoin\u2019s scope led him to pursue a Turing-complete programming language to realize his vision. The young programmer created an initial white paper for this concept, which he called Ethereum, in 2013. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel\u2019s eponymous Fellowship awarded Buterin a grant of $100,000 in 2014, allowing him to fully focus his efforts on developing the new ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetween Buterin\u2019s initial white paper in 2013 and Ethereum\u2019s eventual launch many months later, the vision developed to encompass much more than just a digital currency, adding ideas about smart contracts, decentralized applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. By early 2014, Buterin was ready to share this wider concept with the crypto community, and he formally announced the project in January. An initial coin offering followed, raising about $18 million worth of BTC and allowing Buterin and his development team to launch the Ethereum Foundation to oversee Ethereum\u2019s continued growth. In July 2015, Ethereum officially launched.\n\nActivity Since Ethereum\u2019s Launch\n\nThe story of Ethereum is one of prolonged success (although not entirely free of setbacks as well), as the platform is now responsible for settling trillions of dollars worth of transactions each year. Indeed, the number of Ethereum transactions eclipsed the number of Bitcoin transactions in 2021. It has also been instrumental as the foundational network supporting movements like non-fungible tokens, a host of altcoins, and much more.\n\nButerin has continued to play a highly active role in Ethereum\u2019s success since launch. He has also been outspoken about what he sees as the ongoing dangers of centralized banking and currency control, making him a potent advocate for the crypto world even beyond his own network and token.\n\nButerin has also spoken out against what he sees as a potential \u201cdystopian\u201d future for the cryptocurrency industry in which ultra-wealthy whales fail to capitalize on the power of crypto to fight against authoritarian governments. He has pushed for Ethereum to play a role in making voting systems more fair, in helping to provide universal basic income, in supporting urban planning initiatives and public-works projects, and more. This may be one reason why Buterin was a particularly vocal supporter of The Merge, the late-2022 seismic shift in which Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake one. The Merge is expected to dramatically reduce the Ethereum network\u2019s energy consumption and to lower costs. Additionally, Buterin is known for his philanthropy, as he donated $1.2 billion to India\u2019s Covid relief fund in 2021, to several projects supporting Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, and additional funds to a variety of research foundations."

It enables these accounts to become more versatile, efficient, and customizable, thus opening the door to a myriad of possibilities for developers and users alike.\n\nAmong the standout recipients of the ERC-4337 Account Abstraction grants is ZeroDev Kernel. Spearheaded by Derek Chiang and Taek Lee, ZeroDev Kernel has developed a smart contract account named Kernel, which is purpose-built for use in Account Abstraction wallets. What sets Kernel apart is its compatibility with ERC-4337, efficiency optimizations, and modularity. It's currently the most widely adopted AA account across major Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.\n\nEtherspot's Skandha Bundler has also been recognized for its groundbreaking contributions. This project introduces a unique mempool designated for activities performed by Account Abstraction wallets, along with an innovative concept called a \"bundler\" that streamlines user operations. Etherspot's bundler, Skandha, has already made its mark on six testnets and eleven mainnets, demonstrating the broad reach of Account Abstraction's potential impact.\n\nMynaWallet is another remarkable grant recipient, working on a Contract Account that integrates with the Japanese Government-Issued ID Card (Myna Card). This integration allows users to seamlessly make token payments, transfer NFTs, and execute various transactions without needing to have an in-depth understanding of cryptocurrencies. MynaWallet's project has the potential to make crypto accessible to millions of Japanese residents, potentially inspiring similar initiatives worldwide.\n\nBlocto is contributing to the development of ERC-4337 by sharing 4337-specific RPC methods through Web3.js, simplifying dApp development. This move supports the growth of a user-centric ecosystem while aligning with the goals of Account Abstraction.\n\nSilius, on the other hand, presents a modular and highly efficient ERC-4337 bundler implementation in Rust. Its modular approach and support for emerging features align with the broader ERC vision and contribute to the Rust Ethereum Ecosystem's development.\n\nThese grant recipients represent just a fraction of the diverse range of projects supported by the ERC-4337 Account Abstraction grant round. Each project brings its unique perspectives and solutions to the Ethereum ecosystem, promising to pave the way for a more accessible, functional, and user-friendly blockchain environment.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ark Invest and VanEck officially filed for spot Ethereum ETFs on Tuesday.\n\nVanEck made its intention known to apply for a spot Ethereum product in 2021, but now the application has officially started.\n\nThe SEC has 240 days to respond to the applications.\n\nHappy Thursday!\n\nArk Invest joined VanEck in the race for the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund on Wednesday. The fund managers\u2019 applications come weeks after a slew of Ethereum futures ETF applications were made \u2014 which are yet to be approved.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it!\n\nEthereum ETF race\n\nDespite approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs being far from a certainty, fund managers already jostle for a spot Ethereum product.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest filed an application for a spot Ethereum ETF on Wednesday alongside VanEck \u2014 who had originally filed an application in July 2021 but not its 19b\u20134, a form used by companies to inform the SEC of its plans to file for an ETF. Yesterday\u2019s filing officially starts the decision clock for the US Securities and Exchange Commission, giving them up to 240 days to respond.\n\nBoth plan to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares want to \u201cincrease access and exposure to crypto-backed assets, beyond Bitcoin,\u201d Cathie Wood and 21Shares CEO and co-founder Hany Rashwan said in a joint statement shared with DL News.\n\n\u201cAs the regulatory environment changes, we are committed to innovating, developing and launching products providing efficient and regulated ways to access Ethereum in the market,\u201d the pair concluded.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe news comes hot on the heels of several Ethereum futures ETF applications filed at the beginning of August. Futures ETFs track the value of Ethereum futures prices on the CME, as opposed to spot ETFs which track the underlying assets value in real-time.\n\nIn August it was reported that the SEC was poised to approve the sale of futures ETF for Ethereum. Some analysts expect this could ignite a brutal fee war between issuers jostling to attract investors.\n\nThe latest round of applications follow last week\u2019s courtroom win for Grayscale. The asset manager is fighting to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF and has faced numerous rejections from the SEC. Its courtroom win led many experts to say a spot Bitcoin ETF is a matter of when, not if.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin was flat over the past 24 hours, trading around $25,700. The leading asset by market capitalisation could face more downward price pressure as the US dollar strengthens. Typically Bitcoin and the US dollar have an inverse relationship, so the price of Bitcoin drops as the dollar appreciates. The dollar index is up 1.8% in the past week.\n\nEthereum slipped 0.2% in the past day, to trade at about $1,630.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading"

        "content": "The team behind nonfungible token collection OnChainMonkey is shifting its entire collection of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin, in a massive undertaking expected to take several months.\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin,\u201d Metagood co-founder and CEO Danny Yang said in a statement on Sept. 7.\n\nThe OnChainMonkeys were first launched in September 2021 on Ethereum, but Yang said the migration to Bitcoin Ordinals was due to its community seeing Bitcoin as offering a more secure platform for its users.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol is better designed for decentralization and security than the Ethereum NFT protocol. High-value NFTs will win on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe proposal to migrate to Bitcoin was passed by 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders. Yang said this means the community had a high conviction for moving to Bitcoin.\n\nThe migration would come at a hefty cost though, with Metagood expecting to fork out over $1 million to ensure the migration process runs smoothly.\n\nWhy is the Art and Collectibles market significant for Bitcoin? Why should this matter to you?\n\n\n\n1. Valuable Market.

Holders will receive the corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal once they\u2019ve burned the Ethereum NFT.\n\nHowever, Yang says the migration shouldn\u2019t be too challenging compared to what Metagood has already accomplished in the Bitcoin Ordinals space:\n\n\u201cWe were the first to inscribe 10,000 images of a collection on Bitcoin. We were the first to launch a parent-child collection with OCM Dimensions 300. We pioneered recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin, as well as inscribing Three.js and p5.js for everyone to use.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ethereum continues to dominate the NFT market, settling $236.8 million in NFTs over the last month, compared to second place Solana ($37.7 million), with Bitcoin ($11.1 million) back in sixth place, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin Ordinals transaction volumes plunged 98% between May and mid-August despite rising to popularity in early 2023.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is dead.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is dead. We heard this many many times over the years. In the case of Bitcoin Ordinals, let's actually understand what actually is dead.\n\n\n\n1. Bitcoin Ordinals is a new protocol at release 0.8.2.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum NFT ecosystems can thrive, he added.\n\nRelated: Ordinals still make up majority of Bitcoin txs despite price collapse\n\nOnChainMonkey NFTs currently trade at an average floor price of 1.10 Ether (ETH) with over 20,550 ETH in transaction volume from 9,500 items since it launched on NFT marketplace OpenSea in September 2021.\n\nOf the 2,900 owners of the OnChainMonkey NFTs, 31% are unique owners, according to OpenSea.\n\nList of OnChainMonkey NFTs currently traded on OpenSea.

The firm described the theft as probably \u201cthe largest amount ever stolen from a single victim.\u201d\n\nThe stolen funds initially landed in two addresses, namely 0x693b72 and 0x4c10a4. However, the scammers have relocated some of these assets to Fixed Float exchange, while the remainder resides in three other distinct addresses.\n\nNotably, Scam Sniffer observed that one of the addresses connected to this fraudulent activity, specifically 0x4c10a4, is associated with numerous cryptocurrency phishing websites and has maintained activity since May 21.\n\nAlthough the victim\u2019s identity remains undisclosed, their transaction history indicates a seasoned liquidity provider with substantial on-chain experience. This wallet has operated since 2017 and currently facilitates over $1.6 million in WBTC/USDT liquidity on the Uniswap V3 platform.\n\nPhishing scams rampant on X\n\nThe rise of phishing scams on X, formerly Twitter, has become a growing concern for the crypto community, which has been inundated with several verified paid bots using the social media platform to perpetrate their activities.\n\nOn-chain investigator ZachXBT specifically expressed concerns about this issue, drawing the crypto community\u2019s attention to the proliferation of fake verified organizations on the platform.\n\n\u201cVerified orgs were intended to make it harder for scammers, but it has just created a new black market for accounts with no way for us to report and take down these accounts easily,\u201d he said.\n\nThis underscores the persistent threat of phishing scams in cryptocurrency, even amid a bear market. According to cybersecurity experts at Kaspersky, crypto-related phishing scams have increased by 40% year-on-year."

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Explores Privacy Protocol Amid Tornado Cash Concerns\n\nSource: ShutterStock\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has collaborated on a research paper that explores the development of a privacy protocol called Privacy Pools.\n\nThe paper aims to address concerns surrounding existing privacy platforms such as Tornado Cash while advocating for the coexistence of financial privacy and regulation, according to its abstract.\n\nAside from Buterin, a number of other crypto veterans also collaborated on the paper, including core developer Ameen Soleimani, Chainalysis researcher Jacob Illum, and academics Matthias Nadler and Fabian Schar.\n\nDescribed as a \u201csmart contract-based privacy-enhancing protocol,\u201d Privacy Pools utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to assess the legitimacy of user funds without revealing the complete transaction history.\n\nThe main objective is to establish a \u201cseparating equilibrium\u201d that filters out funds associated with criminal activities while striking a balance between privacy and regulatory requirements.\n\nPrivacy Pools to Increase Privacy While Filtering Out Unlawful Transactions\n\nThe proposed approach allows users to publish zero-knowledge proofs that demonstrate the origin of their funds without disclosing the entire transaction graph.\n\nThis offers a potential solution for verifying the legality of funds while preserving transactional privacy.\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources, without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph,\u201d the paper said.\n\nThe authors acknowledged the utility of platforms like Tornado Cash as privacy tools. However, they also highlighted the susceptibility of such platforms to misuse by illicit actors.\n\nTornado Cash faced legal challenges last year when it was accused of facilitating transactions for the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus.\n\nIn response, the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control blacklisted Tornado Cash in August 2022 due to its alleged involvement in illicit activities.\n\nBy exploring the development of Privacy Pools, Buterin and his collaborators aim to address the concerns raised by Tornado Cash\u2019s legal troubles while advocating for a privacy protocol that aligns with regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, privacy and regulatory compliance are perceived as incompatible,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cThis paper suggests that this does not necessarily have to be the case, if the privacy-enhancing protocol enables its users to prove certain properties regarding the origin of their funds.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin has recently admitted that centralization of nodes is one of the Ethereum network\u2019s biggest challenges, given the fact that the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum full nodes are run on centralized platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind said that he hopes in the future fully verified Ethereum nodes can \u201cliterally\u201d run on a phone.\n\nHe claimed that solving the issue with centralization of full nodes is a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to making Ethereum more decentralized."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nAlex Gluchowski, the co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, has unveiled a groundbreaking concept that could reshape blockchain governance and security. He proposed the creation of an \"Ethereum Supreme Court\" within the Ethereum network, a unique idea aimed at offering a final recourse for parties involved in disputes related to smart contracts.The Ethereum Supreme Court concept represents a comprehensive strategy designed to enhance the robustness of governance and security mechanisms operating within the Ethereum ecosystem. At its core, this proposal aims to provide a structured framework for addressing conflicts and challenges that may arise in the realm of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.Gluchowski's motivation behind this ambitious idea is to create a robust barrier against malicious players and external political interference while elevating Ethereum's status as a secure and dependable network. By establishing a system akin to real-world legal structures, the Ethereum Supreme Court concept seeks to instil confidence in the Ethereum network's ability to uphold contractual agreements and resolve disputes fairly and effectively.The heart of this innovative proposal lies in forming a network of on-chain courts, each equipped with its own governance structure reminiscent of the hierarchical nature of traditional legal systems. These courts would handle disputes and manage critical upgrades within the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal introduces a layered approach, culminating in the \"Court of Final Appeal\" at the Ethereum Layer-1 level, which would serve as the highest authority.Protocols would designate unique contracts capable of triggering an appeal process to facilitate the resolution of disputes and initiating emergency upgrades. An appeal period would be instituted, allowing Ethereum users to submit challenges during this window. Submitting a challenge would necessitate a predefined bail deposit, ensuring that only substantial and legitimate disputes advance.Alex Gluchowski's proposal for the \"Ethereum Supreme Court\" can potentially revolutionise how blockchain networks handle disputes and governance. This concept seeks to fortify Ethereum's security and autonomy and aims to enhance its reputation as a dependable network. However, navigating the path to implementation will require overcoming challenges, including garnering broad community support and addressing cost-related considerations. The Ethereum community now stands at a crossroads, contemplating the possibility of a transformational shift in its governance and security mechanisms."

        "content": "Ark Investment Management and 21Shares have filed to offer a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg reported on Sept. 6.\n\nThe two companies submitted their application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the day of that report.\n\nIf the fund is approved, it will trade under the ticker ARKE. The fund would provide traditional investors with a way to invest in a fund that is physically backed by Ethereum (ETH) without the need to purchase or hold cryptocurrency itself directly. Furthermore, Ark\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF would be the first of its type if it is successful.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, commented on the ambitious nature of the plan in light of the fact that no equivalent Bitcoin fund exists. She told Bloomberg:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much regulatory controversy about a Bitcoin spot ETF that I guess many people thought it was a step too far \u2014 but we don\u2019t \u2026 And it\u2019s always nice to be first.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ophelia Snyder, co-founder and president of 21Shares, suggested that Grayscale\u2019s victory against the SEC \u2014 which will see Grayscale press the agency to approve its GBTC ETF conversion \u2014 influenced the timing of its own application. Snyder added that Ethereum market fundamentals also spurred its application.\n\nETH application follows BTC attempts\n\nArk is additionally pursuing a Bitcoin spot ETF alongside its latest Ethereum application. Following an application from BlackRock in June, Ark and many other asset managers filed similar applications to offer a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nThose applications are seen as promising due to BlackRock\u2019s role as a financial giant and due to each filing\u2019s inclusion of a Coinbase surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nWood commented on the current situation in August. She correctly predicted that the SEC would delay a decision around the latest spot Bitcoin ETF applications; however, she said that she believes the SEC will eventually approve multiple applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF due to the fact that most current applications are similar.\n\nDespite widespread optimism, no spot Bitcoin or spot Ethereum ETF has been approved to date. In fact, Ark\u2019s own Bitcoin ETF applications are among those previously declined by the SEC. The firm faced its latest rejection in January 2023.\n\nArk also has other ETF applications underway, including one fund tied to Bitcoin and Ether futures. The SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs."

        "content": "Ace hedge fund manager Cathie Woods\u2019 Ark Invest has filed for the listing of the first-ever spot Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ARK and cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares are seeking to list a fund that will directly hold ether, which is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The fund\u2019s proposed name is Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, and it will be listed only in the American markets. The fund will custody the assets with crypto exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector and asset managers worldwide have been trying for years to list a Bitcoin ETF. This is the first attempt by a fund to list an Ether ETF. Ark Invest\u2019s application for launching a Bitcoin ETF is still awaiting regulatory approval. Ark and 21Shares had applied to list the Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe BZX exchange.\n\nAll earlier attempts to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF have been rejected on grounds of inadequate surveillance. The SEC worries that spot cryptocurrency ETFs are vulnerable to fraud and manipulation owing to the absence of a proper regulatory framework and surveillance procedures. However, last month, the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale Investment\u2019s application to list a bitcoin tracking ETF was incorrect. This major win has prompted several funds to list other bitcoin-tracking ETFs. Notably, the SEC is set to approve the first ETF based on Ether Futures by mid-October.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This proves its dominance and high trading ability in the crypto market. Currently, the price of ETH-USD is hovering around $1,636, representing a 66.7% discount from its all-time high. On November 10, 2021, ETH touched $4,865.94 thanks to the crypto boom. Even so, year-to-date, ETH has gained 35.6%.\n\nDisclosure"

Discover SCENE\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest moved to establish America\u2019s first spot Ethereum ETF on Wednesday, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nDubbed the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the application resembles those for spot Bitcoin ETFs that were recently delayed by the SEC. The regulator said last week that it needs more time to decide on several following Grayscale\u2019s recent courtroom victory.\n\nArk Invest named Coinbase as a custodian in its application, meaning the crypto exchange would hold onto Ethereum that backing the shares of Ark Invest\u2019s ETF. The ETF itself would be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC has received multiple applications for futures-based Ethereum ETFs, but Ark Invest\u2019s bid resembles a step beyond that, considering futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have traded in the U.S. since ProShares' launched on the New York Stock Exchange 2021.\n\nTwo years later, futures-based ETFs seem like a logical place for Ethereum to make its Wall Street debut. Anticipation has grown the SEC could approve a wave of Ethereum futures ETFs, which track the price of derivatives traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), as soon as October.\n\nWeeks before the SEC\u2019s recent spat of Bitcoin-related delays, Ark Invest\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was drawn out by the regulator too. ARK Invest first filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2021.\n\nIn terms of futures-based Ethereum ETFs, the SEC has told hopefuls to pull applications around a week after they\u2019re filed, according the Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst Eric Baclhunas. But this time around, they\u2019ve stayed on the SEC\u2019s desk.\n\nOn Wednesday, Baclhunas said in a Tweet that other companies are likely to follow in Ark Invest\u2019s footsteps quite quickly. He said there are probably more applications coming if they aren\u2019t already imminent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EricBalchunas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nWhen the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

        "content": "REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Metagood, the creators of OnChainMonkey (OCM), are the first to move a 10,000 NFT collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum, the nominal home of smart contracts, to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the most decentralized and secure blockchain. The OCM DAO voted to financially subsidize some of the substantial cost of the large migration from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nOn 30 August 2023, the OCM team proposed subsidizing the cost of this migration and making it free for all OCM Genesis NFT holders with a Bitcoin Badge. The Bitcoin Badge was rewarded to OCM holders who participated in missions that took about a year to complete.\n\nThe DAO proposal will award a subsidy of 350 ETH (approximately USD $570,787 currently) for the migration to Genesis, and reached a quorum of 2,000 votes within 24 hours and finished with over 4,700 votes cast in favor of the proposal. This is the highest number of votes any DAO proposal has received within 24 hours since OCM\u2019s DAO was founded in 2021. The proposal had nearly unanimous support, with 99% of voters supporting the migration to Bitcoin.\n\nThe vote was not assured and involved an education campaign on Bitcoin Ordinals and the new technical development of Recursive Inscriptions led by the Metagood leadership team, who proposed the migration idea and wrote the DAO proposal.\n\nImportantly, the OCM community subsidy doesn't cover all of the costs of migration, which amount to around $1M. Metagood is covering the rest of the cost for their community of holders.\n\n\u201cOur OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin,\" said Metagood CEO and co-founder and OCM Genesis Collection creator Danny Yang. \"We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Inscribed in early February in inscription #20219, Genesis represents our firm belief in the promising future that awaits digital artifacts on Bitcoin,\u201d said Metagood co-founder and COO Amanda Terry. \u201cIt is remarkable that the DAO almost unanimously voted for the Ordinals technology that only emerged in February this year.\u201d\n\nIn truth, part of the vote likely reflects the faith in Metagood and OCM co-founder Danny Yang, who has been building on Bitcoin since founding Maicoin, his first Bitcoin company, in 2013 (the largest cryptocurrency company in Taiwan today), and early in building on Ordinals. Yang helped pioneer recursive inscriptions, creating 3D generative art on Bitcoin with the OCM Dimensions collection. The recursive inscription technology gives Bitcoin new powers, previously thought impossible without changing Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol. Now, complex programs can be stored and run from the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRecursion and other features of Ordinals allow for an on-chain kind of NFTs referred to as Digital Artifacts. These are more secure and decentralized NFTs.\n\n\u201cA migration of this order of magnitude is a monumental milestone for our OCM Community and a first-of-its-kind migration and upgrade for a 10K collection,\" mentioned Danny Yang. \"The Genesis collection will have a ton of innovative features to its name and be on Block 9 Satoshis (sats), the first sats in circulation. They will be in sequential order, matching the sats, and have clear collection provenance on Bitcoin, and provenance going back to their origin on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYang said further: \u201cIn the past, other projects have been paid a substantial amount of money to move to another blockchain. We are doing the opposite. We are so convinced in our move that we are spending more than $1M of our own resources to make the move to Bitcoin and in an important and innovative way.\u201d\n\nClearly, OCM DAO members believe in this truly decentralized future for digital assets on Bitcoin. OnChainMonkey will celebrate its 2 year anniversary of the launch of its Genesis collection on Ethereum this Monday, September 11.\n\nAbout OnChainMonkey\n\nOnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, is a pioneering digital art collection. It is the first NFT profile pic collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum in 2021. In 2023, OnChainMonkey made history again, becoming the first 10k collection inscribed on Bitcoin in inscription 20219. The collection of 10,000 generative art NFTs is led by an experienced team, including Danny Yang, who founded Taiwan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Maicoin; Amanda Terry, who served as a digital media business development executive at Twitter and NBC; and Bill Tai, a legendary VC who was the first investor in Zoom and early investor in Canva, Dapper Labs as well as over 20 companies that have become publicly listed.

Even under challenging market\n\nExtreme cryptocurrency market fluctuations may be beneficial and harmful for investors and traders. Volatility creates opportunities for profits, but it may also result in losses. However, might use passive income strategies to mitigate these losses. During periods of market volatility, passive income opportunities allow Ethereum investors and traders to reduce losses.\n\nEven under challenging market conditions, such as bear markets, passive income schemes allow investors and traders to produce revenue. For investors in Ether (ETH $1,620) or any other cryptocurrency, passive crypto income is a way to weather market drops and collapses. In the past, owning crypto assets was the primary income source. Due to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, there are presently several ways to promote interest in Ether and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This article is a guide for both novices and seasoned pros on how to create income using Ethereum.\n\nHow does Ethereum function? What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain-based network that performs intelligent contracts. Ether, Ethereum\u2019s primary currency, allows users to undertake a wide range of functions on the web, including transactions, Staking, trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs), playing games, and more. There is no possibility of fraud or meddling by a third party since these applications run as intended. Ethereum is also used to construct open-source blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps). On Ethereum\u2019s network, anybody with the required skills and experience may build decentralized applications, making it one of the most popular platforms for developers. Historically, Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism was based on proof-of-work (PoW), which paid miners for verifying transaction blocks. At 1:42:42 a.m. EST on September 15, 2022, Ethereum switched to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, referred to the historic transfer as The Merge and defined it as the first phase of a multi-year scaling strategy. The switch to PoS is intended to make Ethereum more scalable and energy-efficient by eliminating the need for miners, who use a great deal of energy to defend the network.\n\nHow can you use Ethereum to generate passive income?\n\nHere are some of the most popular passive income ideas for Ethereum:\n\nStaking\n\nIt locks funds on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain (such as Ethereum) to validate transactions and earn rewards. Speculators are compensated for their work with ETH or other coins. When users stake their ETH, they contribute to the network\u2019s security by putting their money where their mouth is.\n\nStaking Ethereum is a popular technique for generating passive income from cryptocurrencies, but it may be prohibitively expensive for new investors. To run a validator node and participate in Staking, the new PoS version of Ethereum requires a minimum of 32 ETH, or around $55,000. In addition to direct wagering, you may use service providers such as StakeWise and Lido. These decentralized apps (DApps) provide Ethereum staking services without needing network participants to maintain a full node, allowing them to stake with less capital. These companies often charge a 10% fee on incentives, which may diminish one\u2019s revenue, but initially, they are optional to deposit 32 ETH.\n\nAlso read: How Will Ethereum Merge Effect The Crypto Market?\n\nHodl\n\nHodl, a derivative of \u201chold\u201d that means \u201chang on for dear life,\u201d is crypto slang, meaning holding bitcoin for long-term financial objectives. When investors hodl Ether, they bet its price will increase in the future, letting them sell it for a profit. It is one of the most straightforward and prevalent ways to get passive income from cryptocurrencies. This strategy does not provide quick or assured gains, but it may be profitable in the long run if the price of Ether rises. Given that Ethereum has had tremendous growth since its inception and is now one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world, it is probable that its price will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to keep in mind that the prices of cryptocurrencies are volatile and vulnerable to rapid swings. Consequently, investors should only spend as much as they are ready to lose.\n\nElectronic trading\n\nUsing a bot for automated Ether trading is a different method for generating passive income from Ethereum investments. Automated trading bots are computer programs that employ pre-programmed algorithms to buy and sell bitcoin 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on cryptocurrency exchanges. May configure these bots to execute trades automatically in response to market conditions such as price or volume swings. Coinrule and Bitsgap are examples of automated trading software allowing users to construct trading rules using established templates or modifying them based on risk choices.\n\nIf successful, automated trading may offer a steady revenue stream, but inherent risks are involved. Bots can make mistakes, such as selling or acquiring too early or too late. In addition, the bitcoin market is volatile and vulnerable to sudden movements that a bot may need help anticipating. Consequently, investors must routinely monitor their automated trading activity to avoid incurring substantial losses.\n\nLending\n\nLending is another frequent way for investors to get passive income from their ETH holdings. Typically, investors profit by lending borrowers cryptocurrencies at a high-interest rate which may be accomplished using either centralized or decentralized lending networks. Users often do not need to worry about technical issues such as centralized systems\u2019 security, data storage, bandwidth utilization, and authentication. The platform handles all technological factors and maximizes customer return on investment. Typically, centralized systems have higher interest rates than decentralized ones. Nevertheless, centralized systems are more susceptible to hacking and data breaches.\n\nDecentralized lending systems, on the other hand, offer clients a higher level of security, transparency, and customization, allowing skilled investors to improve their profit margins by modifying parameters. Frequently, these systems are more complicated to run and need a higher level of technical expertise. Moreover, loan rates are often lower under decentralized systems.\n\nLiquidity mining\n\nCreating passive income from Ethereum is also possible via liquidity mining or yield farming. By lending Ether or other assets to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges such as Yearn.finance, SushiSwap, and Uniswap users receive rewards. In several yield farming systems, exchanging one token for another is possible inside a liquidity pool. Traders of cryptocurrencies pay a charge, which is then allocated to the farmers who have contributed to the liquidity pool. The size of the prize depends on the farmer\u2019s contribution to the liquidity of the whole collection. Yield farming is a relatively young profession, and it is adaptable. Furthermore, it may be a risky investment since the underlying assets\u2019 values may fluctuate rapidly, resulting in losses."

Ethereum investors entered the market in December 2017, when the price of the cryptocurrency, along with most others, reached an all-time high. Today, we\u2019ll highlight the top seven. One reason Ethereum has been a darling among investors is\n\nEthereum, the second-most valued cryptocurrency in the world, is currently beginning to draw greater interest from investors. Ethereum investors entered the market in December 2017, when the price of the cryptocurrency, along with most others, reached an all-time high. Today, we\u2019ll highlight the top seven.\n\nOne reason Ethereum has been a darling among investors is that it\u2019s truly so much more than just a cryptocurrency project. Given that its platform supports dApps, smart contracts, and new blockchain projects, one could claim that Ethereum is the most significant blockchain project in the world and actively helps the widespread use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen investing in Ethereum as a platform, numerous dangers are involved, as there are with all cryptocurrencies. This hasn\u2019t stopped a lot of individuals from doing it, though, including many famous people and notable figures in the cryptosphere.\n\nListed below are some well-known Ethereum investors:\n\nJonathan Lubin\n\nJoseph Lubin is one of the most well-known figures connected to the Ethereum investors and has extensive experience in software engineering, robotics, machine vision, and neural networks. One of the largest Ethereum investors may very well be the co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based software business specializing in creating decentralized applications (dApps) based on the Ethereum platform.\n\nAccording to numerous rumors, Joseph Lubin reportedly was one of the top purchasers during the Ethereum crowd sale event that took place a few years ago. According to numerous business sources, Joseph Lubin is one of the most significant Ethereum holders, with a market cap that might reach $10 billion.\n\nMr. Lubin founded the Swiss-based organization EthSuisse, which has simultaneously made significant investments in Ethereum. With ConsenSys and EthSuisse, they invest in solutions that will be able to provide users with greater services in addition to the network\u2019s future.\n\nAdditionally, Lubin has participated in numerous industry-spanning groups that have advanced solutions for problems with governance in the blockchain area. Thus, when you buy Ethereum, it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply cash directly to developers. Still, it may also be through establishing new services, gathering efforts to create new solutions, and increasing the overall ecosystem.\n\nRichard Sherman\n\nAnother well-known person who loves cryptocurrency and is a big Ethereum investor is cornerback Richard Sherman, the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL (National Football League). As soon as people began inquiring if they could buy goods and merchandise from his official website using different digital tokens, Sherman began investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRichard revealed on many occasions that he has a few BTC, ETH, and LTC but is not interested in the diversity of other smaller coins. When Bitcoin was worth roughly $1,000, he bought some, and when the price soared to $19,000, he was able to sell it. In any case, he said he regretted not retaining the Bitcoins exactly as they were.\n\nRichard Sherman has been voted All-Pro four times as well as four times for the Pro Bowl. Between 2011 and 2017, he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks, and as of 2018, he is a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Mr. Sherman is a spokesperson for the trivia app FleetWit in addition to having an interest in cryptocurrency. He also has investments in other tech stocks, demonstrating that his portfolio is well-diversified.\n\nThe Winklevoss Brothers, in Ethereum investors, are Cameron and Tyler.\n\nBecause of their involvement in the cryptocurrency industry, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have frequently made headlines. Even though the Winklevoss brothers gained notoriety after suing Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg because he appropriated their idea for a social network, they are now recognized as some of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 settlement for an astounding $65 million in Facebook stock and cash was made possible by the lawsuit. They chose to invest in Bitcoin after recognizing the potential in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. In the end, the brothers purchased 120,000 Bitcoins in 2012 at less than $10. They re-invested after achieving financial success and amassed almost $350 million from various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The siblings are also well-known for founding the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, which is situated in New York.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers held Ethereum in addition to their investments in Bitcoin (BTC), their primary focus. According to Tyler Winklevoss, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are tokens on top of tokens and do not adhere to securities regulations. Mr. Winkleovss stated that the Ethereum network and its tokens have more value in the network than in other digital tokens.\n\nWhether they have chosen to sell a portion of their stake or how much ETH they now retain is unclear at this time. Regardless of their virtual currency, they will play a significant part in the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nVitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum\n\nFor those familiar with the cryptocurrency industry, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s name scarcely has to be introduced. Without Vitalik, the brains behind the entire Ethereum project and perhaps the most significant figure in the cryptocurrency world after Satoshi Nakamoto, our list wouldn\u2019t be complete.\n\nIt is commonly known that Vitalik Buterin has one of the highest net worths in the cryptocurrency industry. The creator has never revealed how much Ethereum he has; however, rumors are that he transferred 30,000 ETH to Bitstamp, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, in December 2017. Vitalik is portrayed as the owner of around 500,000 ETH in other forums and public posts.\n\nIn the end, only Vitalik Buterin himself can provide an answer to this query. What\u2019s more amazing is that most people don\u2019t picture Buterin as a wealthy individual; rather, they picture him as the creator of one of the best blockchain platforms, someone for whom money is not a priority, and someone who is constantly seeking solutions to real problems in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAs a participant in the cryptocurrency market, Mr. Buterin\u2019s investment in the Ethereum network goes beyond simple financial gain. As a developer and the manager of various teams devoting their time and resources to enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem, he is committed to Ethereum.\n\nTherefore, investing time and effort into the network is another approach. In addition, many businesses rely on his suggestions and counsel when deciding where to put their money to support Ethereum developers. More adoption indicates stronger Ethereum fundamentals, which eventually translates into a higher price for the digital asset known as ETH.\n\nJoseph Lubin and Buterin are both in similar circumstances. They co-founded Ethereum together and have been working to grow its projects and solutions ever since. Although they may not make significant investments in ETH, they have been attempting to increase ETH\u2019s value over time.\n\n#Ethereum CEO speaks openly about shorting ETH at the top without shame, dumping on his investors.

Only #Bitcoin is the real deal. pic.twitter.com/egXvgahaCj \u2014 Doctor Profit \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded (@DrProfitCrypto) July 28, 2022\n\nAshton Kutcher\n\nAshton Kutcher, the Hollywood actor, is recognized as a big Ethereum investor. He has made an early investment in cryptocurrencies, technology, and applications like Uber and Airbnb. He was one of the first famous people to join the cryptocurrency mania, and in 2014, almost a year before Ethereum was officially released, he tweeted about it. Although an official figure has not yet been disclosed, Kutcher is reportedly among the biggest investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ask Yourself These 5 Questions Before Making An Ethereum Investment\n\nJohn Hoskinson\n\nA further Ethereum co-founder is Charles Hoskinson. He is currently the principal developer of Ethereum Classic and Cardano (ADA) (ETC). He has been putting in the effort to provide Ethereum alternatives.\n\nDespite this, he was a pioneer in the use of digital money. He joined the area when the price of one bitcoin was $0.90. He decided to oversee other significant initiatives and begin moving forward with the expansion in the crypto field when the value of the digital currency reached $250.\n\nAs the network\u2019s co-founder, it is important to note that he was one of the first Ethereum investors. He omitted, however, to say if he eventually sold all of his coins or what percentage he had invested in the cryptocurrency initiative.\n\nHe has worked on numerous cryptocurrency projects, but he is currently concentrating on Cardano, one of the most popular ones on the market. His efforts have had a significant positive impact on the cryptocurrency sector and have raised the bar for technical advancements within the industry. To compete with other networks like Cardano, including Ethereum, developers can offer better services and goods.\n\nHoskinson invested his time towards Ethereum rather than merely money, similar to Lubin and Buterin. As a result, thanks to him and his enthusiasm for bitcoin initiatives, the network and cryptocurrency business are considerably more advanced today.

        "content": "In a groundbreaking development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, along with four co-authors, has introduced a novel concept known as \u201cprivacy pools\u201d to discern between lawful and illicit activities on the blockchain. The proposal, unveiled in a research paper titled \u201cBlockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium,\u201d published on Wednesday, aims to address the escalating concerns surrounding privacy within blockchain technology. Governments have been intensifying their efforts to combat criminal organizations employing privacy mixers to obscure and launder their ill-gotten funds.\n\nA Response to Growing Privacy Concerns\n\nThe emergence of this privacy-enhancing protocol is a direct response to the pressing need to distinguish between transactions associated with criminal activity and those conducted by honest users on the blockchain. Notably, the privacy protocol Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer, incurred sanctions from the U.S. Treasury due to its alleged use by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus for money laundering. While Tornado Cash has been effective in tackling privacy issues, it has faced limitations in disassociating itself from criminal activities on the network.\n\nAddressing the Limitations of Existing Solutions\n\nPrivacy pools hold the potential to address these limitations by providing users with transaction data privacy while concurrently separating it from any criminal activity. The core idea revolves around aggregating honest transactions, enabling users to validate that their transactions stem from the pool of honest deposits.\n\nThe research paper elaborates, \u201cAll users with \u2018good\u2019 assets have strong incentives and the ability to prove their membership in a \u2018good\u2019-only association set,\u201d making it challenging for \u201cbad actors\u201d to furnish such evidence. This mechanism ensures that transactions originating from legitimate sources are shielded by privacy, while those with nefarious intentions are exposed.\n\nA Step Towards Regulatory Compliance\n\nAs regulatory bodies worldwide intensify their efforts to combat criminal activities on the blockchain, Buterin aims to demonstrate that technological innovations like privacy pools can align with regulatory requirements. The authors assert that privacy and regulatory compliance have often been viewed as incompatible concepts. However, by enabling users to prove specific attributes regarding the source of their funds, the proposed privacy-enhancing protocol may challenge this notion.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s introduction of privacy pools represents a significant stride in blockchain technology, addressing the critical issue of privacy while complying with regulatory mandates. The concept offers a potential solution to the challenges associated with distinguishing lawful transactions from criminal ones on the blockchain. As governments continue their pursuit of greater transparency in blockchain transactions, innovations like privacy pools provide a path toward reconciling privacy and regulatory compliance in the digital age."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, finds itself perched precariously at the precipice of a substantial corrective phase, a development that has instilled palpable unease among market observers.\n\nThe situation has been further exacerbated by ARK\u2019s recent submission of an application for an Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move has injected an additional layer of ambiguity into ETH\u2019s price trajectory, especially in light of the prospective synergy with a spot Bitcoin ETF, which could potentially exert a bullish influence on the value of decentralized finance (DeFi) assets.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of heightened uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics, the astute team at Finbold has turned to the deployment of machine learning algorithms via PricePredictions, a cryptocurrency monitoring and prognostication platform, on September 7. The primary aim was to discern the plausible price projection for ETH as the curtain falls in September, taking into account the most recent developments in the crypto arena.\n\nAccording to the rigorous analysis undertaken, the prognosis for ETH suggests a potential marginal downturn to $1,611 by the concluding day of September.\n\nETH 30-day forecast. Source: PricePredicitions\n\nETH technical analysis\n\nTurning our focus to the technical aspects of ETH, we observe its current trading price at $1,627, with a steadfast support level at $1,560 and a formidable resistance level situated at $1,702.\n\nOver the course of the day, ETH has undergone a slight 0.18% decline, and it has experienced a more pronounced 4.65% dip over the past week, encapsulating a cumulative market capitalization of $195 billion.\n\nEthereum 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nA telling tweet from cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, dated September 6 and shared on X (formerly Twitter), underscores the imminent concerns surrounding Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Martinez, in his missive, underscores the significance of Ethereum breaching the $1,680 threshold, as this could potentially serve as the gateway to a substantial corrective phase, ultimately driving the price down to the $1,200 range.\n\nIn an illuminating revelation, Martinez disseminated insights from the crypto analytical powerhouse, IntoTheBlock, which illuminated the scarcity of addresses engaged in Ethereum acquisitions within the price bracket of $1,285 to $1,681. This scarcity, juxtaposed with subdued activity at these price levels, augments the plausibility of a price regression to the $1,200 mark, as posited by Martinez.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1-day technical analysis (TA) gauges over at the crypto analytics website TradingView are bearish, their summary indicating a \u2018sell\u2019 at 15, as derived from moving averages (MA) pointing at a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 14 and oscillators in the \u2018neutral\u2019 at 9.\n\nETH 1-day gauges.

Using ZK-proofs removes the need to deobfuscate the details of transactions in order to confirm that it is not associated with addresses involved in illicit activities.\n\n1/ New privacy paper with @VitalikButerin, Jacob Illum (@chainalysis), @mat_nadler, @fschaer!https://t.co/ovH1iYXXY6\n\n\n\nWe explored new compliance opportunities made possible by https://t.co/Nt4b2Tgx1D, where users can provably dissociate from illicit funds.\n\n\n\nstory below \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/Tq0zYfbwlL \u2014 Ameen Soleimani (@ameensol) September 6, 2023\n\nSuch a concept was revealed by Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin, Privacy Pools' Ameen Soleimani, Chainanalysis' Jacob Illum and Uni Basel researchers Matthias Nadler and Fabian Sch\u00e4r, in their fresh paper Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium.\n\nPer the proposal, Ethereum (ETH) users can simply publish ZK-proofs to verify that their funds did not come from knowingly unlawful sources of cryptocurrency.\n\nTo do so, through a cryptography mechanism, the user just needs to proof and encrypt the verified fact of being associated or not with the set of deposits:\n\nIt allows for membership proofs (\u201cI prove that my withdrawal comes from one of these deposits\u201d) or exclusion proofs (\u201cI prove that my withdrawal does not come from one of these deposits\u201d).\n\nHowever, in some implementations, this mechanism can reveal more information about the transactions in question, the authors added.\n\nProve your honesty without showing transactions history\n\nIn collaboration with law enforcers, the implementation of this mechanism can significantly advance the level of regulatory compliance of Ethereum-based dApps, including decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and lending protocols.\n\nAlso, this instrument would allow honest users to disassociate themselves from third-party deposits they do not agree with or might otherwise prevent them from using their funds in a regulated environment.\n\nHowever, the regulators will still be in charge of creating \"black lists\" of addresses considered illicit in this or that jurisdiction."

        "title": "Top 3 price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: ETH bullish divergence in play, but will it hold out? - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could fall soon, with the $24,995 multi-month support level barely holding.\n\nEthereum price tests the $1,621 support level with a 5% drop down in sight unless this bullish divergence pans out.\n\nRipple price must hold above $0.4800 or risk a retest of the May lows at $0.4191.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple prices are consolidating tightly along their current support levels. While BTC shows signs of a continued trend, the ETH daily chart says otherwise.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock deliberately driving down Bitcoin price in anticipation for Spot BTC ETF approval, analyst says\n\nBitcoin price readies for a fall\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is treading on dangerous grounds, exhausting the $24,995 support level after a longstanding consolidation. Unless the king of crypto finds its footing, it could soon lose the aforementioned support, and descend to the psychological $24,000 level. In the dire case, expect an extended hobble to the demand zone at $21,915, where some buying activity could finally present. This assumption comes as demand zones are often populated by buyers.\n\nNotably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is inclined south and could soon cross below the signal line (yellow band). Such a move is often interpreted as a sell signal. Also notable, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are negative, suggesting bears have the upper hand.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, with the $24,995 support level acting as a buyer congestion zone, bullish momentum above this level could send Bitcoin price north, potentially confronting the 200-, 50-, and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) at $27,085, $27,830, and $27,522 levels respectively, before the $29,692 resistance is activated.\n\nWhile overcoming this barricade would be ideal, Bitcoin price would remain in the woods until after a decisive daily candlestick close above the $31,518 level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin set to form death cross as Dollar Index teases Golden crossover.\n\nEthereum price could fall if the RSI divergence fails\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is inclined towards the downside, recording lower lows as the price tests the $1,621 support level. Meanwhile, the RSI is recording higher highs, with the disparity presenting a bullish divergence. This forecasts a possible move north, but it all depends on whether the $1,621 support level holds. If it does not, ETH could fall 5% to the $1,552 support level. The negative AO adds credence to the bearish outlook.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the bullish divergence works out, Ethereum price could pull north, past the $1,701 hurdle before confronting the 50-, 200- and 100-day EMAs at $1,741, $1,765, and $1,778, respectively. The $1,841 could be overcome in highly ambitious cases, but the bearish outlook would only be invalidated once the Proof-of-Stake token makes it above the $2,008 level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales accumulate ETH as researchers explore scaling beyond EIP-4844.\n\nRipple price bulls are not acting\n\nRipple (XRP) continues to stagnate despite swimming in a demand zone, suggesting bulls are sitting on their hands. This exposes XRP to a slump, possibly sending it below the critical support at $0.4800, which is the mean threshold of the order block. A decisive break below this level would whiplash any short-term hope of a bullish case, with the price possibly breaking below the lower base of the demand zone at $0.4600.\n\nIn a dire case, Ripple price could extend to the August 17 intraday low of $0.4191, marking a 15% drop below current levels. The RSI is also heading down, pointing to falling momentum.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, the AO histograms are edging toward the midline with consistently green bars, showing that bulls maintain a presence in the market. Increased activity from this cohort of traders could send XRP higher, flipping the 200-day EMA hurdle into support and potentially using it as a jumping-off point for more gains. In such a case, the $0.5040 mark would be the level to beat, considering it is where the 100- and 50-day EMA converge at $0.5567 and $0.5624 levels, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: XRP to power international remittance for banks in Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia through SBI Remit"

        "title": "Ethereum: Is this the right time to stake ETH? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum PoS staking surged since the Shanghai Upgrade and the Merge.\n\nStakers have had mildly realized losses in the last 365 days, but there could be a chance to stake more.\n\nThe number of Ethereum [ETH] staked reached 26.5 million on 6 September, according to Chain Afrik. Chain Afrik, which is an African-based blockchain community, coined the data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nAbout 26.5m $ETH has being staked, according to information from @intotheblock, the future is big for #ETHPOS pic.twitter.com/SeQY7kFv0a \u2014 Chain Afrik (@ChainAfrik) September 6, 2023\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThis amount of ETH staked implied that the blockchain saw an increase in staking activity. One reason behind this was the Shapella upgrade, which was activated on 12 April.\n\nBillions and counting\n\nETH staking began in December 2020, through which participants could validate transactions and earn rewards for their contribution. As of March 2023, over $28 billion worth of the altcoin has been staked.\n\nHowever, most of the staked ETH were locked until the Shapella upgrade provided the avenue to unstake and stake at any given time.\n\nWhile the Shapella upgrade may have offered withdrawals, the main rationale for the hike is largely the Merge. The Ethereum Merge occurred in 2022 when the blockchain transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nAlthough not every section of the Ethereum community felt the decision was great, the rise in ETH staked seemed to have proved that notion wrong. As such, the Ethereum PoS future could be greater than it was when it operated on the PoW like Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nSince the PoS transition laid the foundation for staking assets, the number of validators has crossed the 800,000-mark.\n\nDownsides and an opportunity\n\nWith a netflow of 6.92 million ETH since Shanghai, liquid staking activity has also increased. According to Dune Analytics, Lido Finance [LDO] boasted a 32.42% market share in the sector at press time.\n\nOther projects including Rocket Pool [RPL], Binance [BNB], and Coinbase [COIN] also increased their participation. At the time of writing, Binance\u2019s market share was 4.50% while Coinbase stood at 8.59%.\n\nBut how profitable has ETH staking been, and is this a good time to jump into the staking game? Well, two metrics could answer this question. First is the ETH stakers\u2019 realized value. The second metric to consider is the ETH stakers\u2019 Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV).\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe ETH stakers\u2019 realized value captures the average price at which the entire ETH staking supply moved on-chain. At the time of writing, the metric had increased to 27.51 billion. This means that there is a large difference between the realized price for deposits and the spot price.\n\nAdditionally, ETH stakers\u2019 365-day MVRV was down to -9.76%. The decrease in this metric implies more of a realized loss for validators. However, it also seems to present an opportunity to increase deposits in case ETH\u2019s value rallies in the future."

        "title": "Expert Says Demand Triggered Shiba Inu 46,000,000% Rise, Not Ethereum Founder 410T Burn - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Shiba Inu burn tracker asserts that SHIB\u2019s meteoric rise in 2021 was not a direct result of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s burn but a result of demand.\n\nShibburn, the community-driven Shiba Inu burn tracker, recently set the record straight regarding the influence of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s burn of 410.2 trillion SHIB on the asset\u2019s past rally.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Shibburn asserted in a post that it was the growing demand that ignited SHIB\u2019s meteoric rise in 2021 and not necessarily Vitalik\u2019s burn.\n\nJust to clarify something on Vitalik Buterin's burn. He did not spend $1.7B in $SHIB to burn on May 2021 for it to have any effect on price then. That was given to him when the token was deployed. Transferring 90% of what was given to him from one wallet to another (burn address)\u2026 pic.twitter.com/QCpRAnlIwz \u2014 Shibburn (@shibburn) September 6, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe burn tracker clarified that Vitalik did not spend $1.7 billion to incinerate SHIB tokens so that the burn could impact the price at the time. Note that the value of the 410 trillion tokens now stands at $3.1 billion as of press time.\n\nShibburn emphasized that Buterin received the SHIB tokens when the token was initially deployed, and transferring a portion of them to a burn address months later did not directly impact the token\u2019s price positively.\n\nThe community-driven burn tracker stressed that the surge in May 2021 was not solely the result of Buterin\u2019s burn but rather a reflection of the growing interest and investment in SHIB from the broader crypto community.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis substantial demand, combined with the fact that half of the token\u2019s supply was already under the custody of Vitalik Buterin, likely contributed to the asset\u2019s extraordinary price appreciation.\n\nShiba Inu Previous Rally\n\nAn accompanying CoinMarketCap chart substantiates these claims. Notably, data from the chart shows that SHIB had already increased by 29,151,160% from a low of $0.000000000119 on Jan. 1, 2021, to a high of $0.00003469 on May 11, 2021.\n\nThis remarkable growth occurred before Vitalik Buterin\u2019s burn, indicating that SHIB\u2019s rally was well underway before this event occurred.\n\nHowever, following the initial rally, Shiba Inu experienced a temporary setback, retracing from the previous high. Buterin\u2019s burn occurred on May 16 during this correction phase.\n\nThe burn did little to stop the correction, with SHIB\u2019s price declining to $0.00000621 in June 2021. Nevertheless, the asset bounced back, surging 1,324% from that point to reach an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021.\n\nShibburn pointed out that Shiba Inu is up over 46M% since 2020 but only 5x since May 6, 2021. This reality further confirms that the asset\u2019s meteoric rally occurred before the burn.\n\nShiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama previously made similar remarks on the back of calls for sustained burns. According to Kusama, burns alone cannot trigger a massive SHIB rally but utility and demand."

        "content": "A new research paper led by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin proposes \u201cPrivacy Pools,\u201d a novel approach to balance privacy protections and regulatory compliance in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe paper outlines how Privacy Pools allows users to prove their crypto withdrawals do not originate from illicit sources without revealing their complete transaction histories. Users can generate zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating their withdrawals are associated with approved \u201csets\u201d of past deposits.\n\nPrivacy pools.\n\nAccording to the paper, this voluntary disclosure system incentivizes honest users to dissociate themselves from criminals. By excluding suspicious actors from their association sets, legitimate users can signal regulatory compliance while still preserving privacy within their sets.\n\nPublic blockchains like Buterin\u2019s Ethereum are pseudonymous, meaning transactions are publicly viewable but not directly tied to real-world identities. Privacy-enhancing protocols like Tornado Cash obscure the source of funds but have enabled crime by obstructing oversight.\n\nPrivacy Pools aim to balance openness for regulators with user anonymity. The paper argues that the protocol is adaptable enough to satisfy different global regulations by letting users customize their association set disclosures.\n\nButerin has long advocated for \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d in cryptocurrencies while maintaining personal privacy. This research represents his latest effort to promote constructive dialogue between crypto developers, regulators, and policymakers.\n\nThe Ethereum founder co-authored the paper with researchers from the University of Basel and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nInclusion and exclusion sets.\n\nButerin and colleagues detail two primary strategies for constructing association sets in the paper. The \u201cinclusion\u201d method involves only low-risk deposits based on criteria like transaction screening tools or membership in trusted communities.\n\nAlternatively, the \u201cexclusion\u201d method entails leaving out known suspicious deposits but keeping all other activity as potential sources. The paper provides examples of how both approaches allow legal users to prove they are not associated with illegal funds.\n\nThe researchers argue association sets should aim to be accurate, stable over time, and large enough to provide meaningful privacy. However, satisfying all criteria may require tradeoffs.\n\nWhile supportive of the Privacy Pools concept, Buterin and co-authors caution against centralized parties overseeing access. They argue this raises governance concerns and could enable data monopolies.\n\nThe paper says additional research is needed to thoroughly analyze the privacy guarantees, incentives, and legal compliance requirements of Privacy Pools.\n\nThe Privacy Pools paper represents Buterin\u2019s latest foray into encouraging productive cooperation between the crypto industry and regulators. With thoughtful design, he argues, blockchains can meet policy goals without sacrificing user privacy."

ZK rollup, while technically more challenging, can achieve a block finality faster than optimistic rollup. Lightscale plans to upgrade Kroma to 100% ZK rollup.\n\nKroma will start minting its native token KRO mid-2024. Its Tokenomics includes mechanisms for zero-start distribution with no pre-minting or pre-mining. A new block is generated every two seconds, and a KRO is minted and distributed to users and dApps as rewards. As their level of participation is determined by the number of their transactions, dApps and users that generated more transactions will receive more tokens. This reward system will induce active ecosystem expansion activities, thus creating a virtuous circle.\n\n25% of KRO will be distributed to the WEMIX Foundation and WEMIX community, contributing to the WEMIX ecosystem.\n\nKroma will start as a chain for game-onboarding, and Night Crows will be serviced on the chain. The global blockchain version of the smash hit MMORPG, published by Wemade, is slated to be released this December.

        "title": "ETH Price Could Outperform Bitcoin In September and October - CoinGape",
        "content": "ETH price bulls are starting to get a hold of the bearish situation with clear intentions of fighting for a trend reversal. The second largest crypto is up 1.2% on Wednesday to $1,635 although the trading volume remains significantly depressed at $5.6 billion. Its market capitalization worth $196 billion has been on a persistent slope since June.\n\nCan ETH Price Clear The Barricades To $2,000?\n\nEthereum live price has since the sell-off in August remained range bound between support at $1,600 and the upper limit resistance at $1,730. After making a strong attempt to escape the range barrier late in August, fueled by the hype surrounding Grayscale Investments\u2019 win against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the appeals court, ETH price trimmed the gains, resting the support at $1,630.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe path with the least resistance appears to have flipped to the upside, bolstered by a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. As the blue MACD line crosses above the red signal line and the momentum indicator generally assumes an uptrend to the mean line and later into the positive region, traders become confident in their decisions to seek exposure to long positions in Ether.\n\nHolding onto the short-term support at $1,630 would be instrumental for the uptrend continuation. However, traders should consider the plausible bottlenecks, starting with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) at $1,645, the 100-day EMA (blue) at $1,668 and the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,715.\n\nProfit-booking can take place at any of those moving averages, which could slow down the uptrend. However, long-term holders of Ether are likely to compensate for the lost momentum as they keep their positions intact amid speculations of the SEC approving the first Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) futures this September.\n\nA break out of the range channel on the upside would affirm the bullish grip and increase investor confidence in the uptrend to $2,000.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that, the ETF futures approval could be the catalyst ETH price needs to escape the bearish shackles in the range. According to the Stochastic oscillator, bulls may struggle to close the gap to the range limit at $1,730 \u2013 a situation that could result in increased selling pressure.\n\nInvestors can hold their long positions as long as Ethereum is wobbling within the range limits. It is too early to rule out another sell-off, where Ether slides below $1,600 to seek support at $1,400 and $1,200 if push comes to shove.\n\nCan ETH Price Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nA report released by research firm K33 suggests that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in September and October if the first ETF futures receives approval for listing. According to experts in the industry, chances are high that the SEC will green-light the investment product.\n\nVetle Lunde, a senior analyst at the firm believes the futures-based ETF product would significantly boost ETH price, citing a 60% spike in Bitcoin following a similar approval a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cThe odds are stacked in favor of ETH,\u201d Lunde said, referring to it as a \u201cstrong relative buy\u201d versus bitcoin. \u201cETH/BTC trades near 2.5-year range lows, with considerable wiggle room for relative upside.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the industry continues to hope that the SEC will green-light the first spot Bitcoin ETF, which many experts expect will have an enormous impact on BTC price by attracting massive inflows. The SEC delayed the decision on seven BTC ETF applications last week.\n\nRelated Articles"

It is a win-win situation for both the developers and investors, with the former raising funds for development fees and the latter accruing returns on investments.\n\nThe Rewards Club, echoing the vibes of classic timeshares, adds another layer to Everlodge\u2019s allure. Members, based on their tiers, can savor free accommodations in selected estates, while also having the flexibility to market their reserved nights for added revenue.\n\nThe ELDG token is an entry ticket to a world of privileges. With staking incentives, unique reductions, and free hotel stays, ELDG holders transition from mere investors to a privileged echelon.\n\nWith the introductory phase of Everlodge\u2019s presale pricing ELDG at just $0.01, forward-thinkers stand on the brink of an opportune moment for optimal gains. Given the platform\u2019s inventive pricing strategies, the axiom \u201cthe early bird gets the worm\u201d has never rung truer.\n\nIndustry experts are radiating confidence, suggesting a remarkable 30x surge in ELDG \u2018s valuation in the ensuing months. Everlodge\u2019s allure is rooted in its avant-garde framework that marries tech with a community-driven approach, setting the stage to reshape the future landscape of global real estate.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Navigating the $1,920-$2,000 Resistance\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is drawing attention from Wall Street\u2019s elite and global financial powerhouses. With whispers of a potential Ethereum ETF, especially if Bitcoin\u2019s own ETF journey succeeds, the intrigue around Ethereum is palpable.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s vast ecosystem claims an impressive $22.70 billion Total Value Locked (TVL). This sizable TVL underscores the escalating appetite for DeFi services and tools anchored in Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nYet, Ethereum\u2019s price has been struggling to breach the $1,920 to $2,000 resistance range for fifteen months now. Ethereum is currently hovering around $1,684 after falling from $1,800 to $1,550 in just 24 hours last week.\n\nThe looming uncertainty and postponements concerning the Bitcoin ETF seem to cast a shadow over Ethereum\u2019s future price performance. The breach of an ascending trendline signals a further decline in Ethereum\u2019s price. Meanwhile, Everlodge offers a stark contrast with its steady, upward momentum.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Critical $32 Resistance and Shift to Everlodge (ELDG)\n\nSolana\u2019s trajectory mirrors the unpredictable nature of a rollercoaster. Its series of peaks and troughs have left even veteran investors pondering. Despite the evident capabilities of the Solana network, the erratic movements of the Solana token are cause for concern.\n\nA fleeting moment of optimism was witnessed as Solana unexpectedly broke free from a symmetrical triangle pattern, surging its value from $18 to a commendable $32 within a span of two weeks.\n\nThe winds of August have blown away Solana\u2019s gains, dragging its price down to $21.80 today. This translates to an almost 50% loss for enthusiasts who invested at July\u2019s pinnacle. With prevailing sentiments of uncertainty, the investment community remains on the sidelines, awaiting a decisive breach of the $32 resistance on the daily charts.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s technical innovations in the DeFi 2.0 sphere are indisputable, its investment story is getting clouded. Some of the earliest Solana backers are diversifying their portfolios by jumping on the Everlodge train while the ELDG token is still the lowest it will ever be."

        "content": "ETH retests support levels. Evaluating the possibilities amid mixed reactions.\n\nETH whales might sway the market as accumulation takes place.\n\nEthereum is facing the barrel of potential capitulation all over again as the bulls struggle to secure momentum. ETH managed to restest a short-term support level again. However, it might lose that support if the bears extend their dominance.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nETH\u2019s sideways price action since the start of September shared similarities with its performance in the second week of August. Capitulation followed that sideways activity, leading to an 11% downside. If a similar outcome occurred, ETH would likely push down to the next support level. This would lead to sub $1,500 price levels.\n\nCan the bears really take over once again? That might seem unlikely considering that it was oversold in August at the same level. However, we have seen past instances wherein prices continue dipping even in oversold conditions.\n\nA look at the latest on-chain performance may offer noteworthy insights. For example, the latest Glassnode data revealed that the number of ETH exchange deposits has been on the rise. It could indicate that ETH is flowing from private addresses onto exchanges. This is usually considered a sign of sell pressure or that investors are preparing to sell.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Number of Exchange Deposits (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 2,145.685 Previous 1-month high of 2,145.327 was observed on 04 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/Bar49XOvlB pic.twitter.com/Malli7yTlw \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 5, 2023\n\n\n\nTracing ETH exchange flows revealed that the supply of ETH held by top exchange addresses (denoted in green) remains close to its four-week lows. This coincides with the exchange deposits according to Glassnode.\n\nDespite these findings, the percentage of ETH held by top addresses as a percentage of total supply (denoted in blue) has been growing.\n\nAssessing the level of accumulation at the current level\n\nETH\u2019s next move will depend on which is dominant between the bulls and the whales. We can determine or attempt to predict which way it will sway by observing what whales are currently doing.\n\nAccording to the supply distribution metric, some whales have been buying the dip while others are still contributing to sell pressure.\n\nTwo of ETH\u2019s largest whale categories have been buying. These include addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 (denoted in blue) which have been accumulating in the last 2 days. They currently control 21.63 of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nRead about Ethereum\u2019s price prediction for 2024\n\nThe larger whale category contributing to bullish momentum includes addresses between 10 million and 100 million. Addresses in this category collectively control 23.47% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nThis is a potentially good sign for the bulls because continued accumulation might eventually support a rally."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has co-authored a new research paper exploring how a privacy-preserving blockchain protocol could balance the need for user anonymity with regulatory compliance.\n\nThe paper, co-authored by Buterin along with early Tornado Cash contributor Ameen Soleimani, Jacob Illum from the blockchain security firm Chainalysis, and two researchers from the University of Basel, delves into the subject of establishing a neutral infrastructure to incorporate privacy into blockchain transactions.\n\nIt builds upon the concept of the Privacy Pools protocol, introduced by Soleimani in March 2023. This protocol, a fork of Tornado Cash, aims to improve its model to include regulatory compliance.\n\nPrivacy Pool operates similarly to Tornado Cash by mixing multiple user transactions to obscure their true origins. However, when users choose to withdraw funds, they have the option to generate a zero-knowledge proof.\n\nThe zero-knowledge proof confirms that they are not utilizing a criminal blockchain address while safeguarding their identity.\n\nThe new research paper seeks to strike a balance between Privacy Pool-like protocols and compliance with various regulatory and practical considerations by covering various hypothetical use cases.\n\nSoleimani commented on the paper that they did their best to explain \u201chow Privacy Pools tech can serve as neutral infrastructure for bringing public blockchains into regulatory compliance\u2014across jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nThe researchers \u201cdescribe the infrastructure on top of, and the consequences of, this simple core mechanic,\u201d the article read.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBuilding regulatory compliant privacy\n\nA crucial topic of discussion revolves around the creation of \u201cassociation sets,\u201d representing a group of wallets connected via zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nThe researchers introduced the concept of association set providers (ASPs), tasked with generating association sets.\n\nAn excerpt from the paper states that, \"In some instances, ASPs can be entirely constructed on-chain, requiring no human (or AI) intervention. Alternatively, ASPs may independently generate association sets and subsequently publish them on-chain.\"\n\nThe researchers also address centralization concerns in pool management while striving to maintain regulatory compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the authors have sought insights from legal experts to assist in tailoring the protocol and its surrounding ecosystem to \u201censure compliance across various legal jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nTornado Cash, a coin mixer, was sanctioned by the U.S. government last year over allegations that it facilitated transactions for the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus. The Federal Court reaffirmed the sanctions in a recent ruling.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice recently charged two founders of the Ethereum-based application with money laundering charges and arrested one of the co-founders."

        "content": "The project\u2019s founder explained how a reduction in node costs could help its goals.\n\nDevelopers\u2019 contributions decreased, and validator activity fell.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin, while admitting that node centralization was one of the blockchain\u2019s biggest challenges, said that it could take 20 years to fix. Buterin, who was speaking at the South Korean Blockchain Week, gave reasons for his opinion.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nEthereum nodes are necessary for the blockchain to function as they are responsible for validating transactions and monitoring the functional status of the blockchain.\n\nNode operation requires a reduction\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has about 6,801 nodes with most of them hosted in the United States and Germany. About 35% of these nodes rely heavily on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized entity.\n\nAccording to Buterin, it takes about 100 gigabytes of data to run a node. And for Ethereum nodes to be fully decentralized, the cost of node operation needs to be reduced while Statelessness also needs to be taken seriously.\n\nOn 31 August, the Ethereum Foundation updated its roadmap where it discussed the role of Statelessness, state, and history expiry. In the document, the foundation defined Statelessness as a bit of a misnomer for changing the way Ethereum nodes handle state data.\n\nWhile highlighting how weak Statelessness may come before the strong one, Ethereum mentioned the need for Verkle trees. For the unaccustomed, Verkle trees are small, fixed-sized \u201cwitnesses\u201d that could be used to verify blocks on the blockchain. The document explained:\n\n\u201cWeak statelessness is in an advanced state of research, but it relies upon proposer-builder separation and Verkle Trees to have been implemented so that small witnesses can be passed between peers.\u201d\n\nWith statements like the above, it is expected that a lot of development might occur on the Ethereum blockchain soon. Meanwhile, on-chain analytic platform Santiment revealed that development activity on the blockchain had slowed down.\n\nAssessing the road ahead\n\nDevelopment activity measures the public GitHub repositories connected to a project. An increasing value of the metric indicates a rise in developer contributions or code commits. On the other hand, a decrease in development activity signifies a shrinking dedication to polishing a project\u2019s network.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum\u2019s development activity implied that commitment to polishing the network was not at its peak. When it comes to staking activity following its last major upgrade\u2014 the Shapella upgrade, on-chain data revealed that it has been up and down.\n\nFrom the chart shared above, Ether deposits on the Beacon Chain have reduced. This meant the rate of validator entry into the Ethereum staking system has decreased. Regardless of the staking state, Ethereum seems to be focused on the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhile Dencun might not be as big as the Merge it aims to reduce transaction fees on the blockchain. The upgrade could also increase transactions throughout.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s throughput is currently around 13 Transactions Per Second (TPS). But with the upgrade, the throughput has the potential to have a much higher TPS."

        "content": "WisdomTree has adjusted the strategy of the WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETP, enabling the ETP to generate yield from the staking of its underlying ether tokens.\n\nEther is the second-largest cryptocurrency globally and the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, a well-established, open-ended decentralized platform and the leading venue for the deployment of smart contracts.\n\nThe WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETP is 100% backed by ether, offering institutional investors easy access to one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrencies through a liquid, regulated vehicle without the technical challenges of setting up private keys or crypto wallets.\n\nThe ETP\u2019s underlying ether tokens are custodied between Swissquote Bank and Coinbase Custody. According to WisdomTree, this multi-custodian model serves to provide greater liquidity for the underlying digital currency.\n\nStaking is a way of earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies that work on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2013 Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake mechanism in 2022 in a major upgrade aimed at making the network more secure, less energy-intensive, and better at implementing new scaling solutions.\n\nProof-of-stake mechanisms put their underlying cryptocurrency to work in verifying and securing transactions on the blockchain. Investors who choose to take part in this process \u2018stake\u2019 their cryptocurrency holdings and earn rewards for doing so.\n\nAccording to WisdomTree, the staking return attributable to ether is expected to vary between 4% and 8%.\n\nThe WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETP will remain 100% physically backed at all times as the staked ether tokens do not move from the secure custodians where they are stored.\n\nThe ETP is listed on Deutsche B\u00f6rse Xetra (Ticker: WETH GY) in euros, on Euronext Amsterdam (ETHW NA) in US dollars, and on SIX Swiss Exchange (ETHW SW) in US dollars, euros, or Swiss francs.\n\nIt comes with an expense ratio of 0.95%, making the ETP one of the cheapest in Europe for obtaining directly backed ether exposure.\n\nMirva Anttila, Director, Digital Assets Research, WisdomTree, commented: \u201cThe Shapella upgrade was a major advancement for the Ethereum network, completing Ethereum\u2019s full transition to proof-of-stake and enabling the withdrawal of staked ether and related staking rewards. There are many challenges in providing staking rewards to investors; however, these have been overcome and we are now able to deliver staking rewards to investors through a risk-managed approach.\u201d\n\nAlexis Marinof, Head of Europe, WisdomTree, added: \u201cStaking has the potential to make investing in cryptocurrencies more attractive for investors. We have made a commitment to build and enhance products that align with our investors\u2019 needs. This means continuing to innovate and evolve with the market so that we can deliver a best-in-class institutional-grade crypto product range. However, this should never be at the expense of security and risk management, and this is at the centre of our staking approach.\u201d"

        "content": "Over recent times, the market has displayed weaker signs of recovery, much to the chagrin of bullish analysts. While hopes and speculations are high, the cold hard numbers display a negative sentiment currently prevailing in the market. Today, we dive deep into the price analysis of four major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano, attempting to forecast their short to medium-term trajectories.\n\nCrypto Price Prediction as of September 9th, 2023\n\nThe crypto market has been navigating through turbulent waters. With a current market cap standing at $1.02 trillion, the volume over the past 24 hours has touched $26.1 billion. For perspective, the market cap was notably higher at $1.15 trillion just last month. A silver lining, however, emerges when we look at the past three weeks. The consolidation around the $1.05 trillion mark has been solid, signifying a resilient support price level for the entire crypto market.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction Today\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as the \u2018king of cryptos,\u2019 has been facing downward pressure. At present, the BTC price stands at $25,730, marking a decline of 5.4% over the past week. The silver lining here is the stability it has shown in the past 24 hours. The ongoing price is acting as a formidable support level. However, if a massive crypto crash were to occur, Bitcoin could potentially drop to the much-dreaded $20,000 price point.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s chart and the total market cap chart, we can notice a clear correlation in price movements. This is normal as Bitcoin has a significant 48% market dominance. Bitcoin prices also affect other altcoins.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Today\n\nEthereum is not far behind in terms of price fluctuations. Its current value is pegged at $1,630, which is a 4.2% dip since last week. Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum has shown resilience in the past 24 hours with the price holding steady. The standing price for Ethereum is critical as a support level. If the crypto world were to see a downturn, we might witness the price plummeting to $1,400 and potentially even $1,200 should the circumstances worsen.\n\nXRP Price Prediction Today\n\nXRP\u2019s ongoing scenario is quite intriguing. Currently valued at $0.49, it has seen a 4.9% decline over the last week. A concerning observation is XRP crossing below the psychological support of $0.50. If this downtrend persists, the next potential support levels could be at $0.45 and, in a worst-case scenario, $0.40.\n\nCardano Price Prediction Today\n\nLastly, Cardano, another formidable player in the crypto domain, has its current price listed at $0.25, reflecting a 3.3% dip since last week. Just like its counterparts, Cardano too has demonstrated stability over the past day. The $0.25 mark is an essential support level for ADA. However, should there be a broad crypto crash, Cardano might dip to a value as low as $0.20.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "*As of Sept. 2022, Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) has rebranded to Push Protocol (PUSH)*\n\nWeb 3.0, also called Web3, is well on its way. However, it will take some time for it to arrive, as it depends a lot on solving some crucial issues of the blockchain technology, that have been avoiding solutions for years. Fortunately, there is a constant inflow of new talents that are coming to the crypto/blockchain industry from all over the world, and some of these issues seem like they might be solved in the near future.\n\nSome have already been solved, in fact, such as the notification mechanism that was really supposed to be invented a long time ago, but for some reason, it wasn\u2019t. That is, until Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH), or EPNS for short, was invented. The project has been around only for about a year now, after launching in April 2021, and it definitely deserves a look over.\n\nWhat Problems Does Ethereum Push Notification Service Solve?\n\nEPNS is focusing on the issues of communication, in a way that can benefit the traders and investors the most. For example, it:\n\nAllows wallet addresses to receive notifications\n\nEPNS is a notification protocol that allows wallet addresses of users to get notifications by any smart contract or dApp that they are involved with. The same goes for various services, all of which can send notifications that will reach users in a platform-agnostic way. That way, users do not need to manually check for new changes and developments \u2013 they can simply be notified of them as they happen.\n\nChanges the way services communicate with users\n\nUntil now, crypto services that users interact with could only send feedback to them through social media, such as Twitter or Reddit. The clear downside of this is that users would not necessarily see the services\u2019 posts and be notified of important events in time, which could lead to missed opportunities, or failure to react to important events \u2013 whether good or bad \u2013 in time.\n\nImproves UX, communication, and engagement\n\nBy being able to communicate with users directly, services can improve the users' overall experience. What\u2019s more, by notifying them of what is going on in real-time, they can increase user engagement, which is beneficial for both, the users and services.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Push Notification Service\n\nThere are several benefits that users can expect from interacting with EPNS, some of which may be quite obvious, while others are completely unique. For example:\n\nReceive important updates\n\nAs a user, you would be able to receive important updates directly to your wallet address, which would immediately warn you of anything that is happening with the project, its coin or token, new developments and impactful events, and more. The problem is that until EPNS, something like that did not exist, and because of this, users were missing a lot of important events. Even if they were published on Twitter or Reddit or some other social network, the projects can only do so much to get the information across, and users would have to check regularly what is going on, which is neither efficient nor practical.\n\nEarn crypto for receiving notifications\n\nOne thing that may not have been so obvious from everything mentioned so far is that EPNS also contains an important DeFi aspect to the project. This DeFi portion of the deal allows users to earn cryptocurrencies simply for receiving the actual notifications. The so-called incentivized alerts rely on staking by service, which is lent out to AAVE to generate interest, which is then distributed among the service\u2019s subscribers, as the project itself explains it.\n\nDecide what services can send notifications\n\nFinally, the project is very user-centric, meaning that users can change, select, and decide most things regarding the alerts. You can always opt in or out from receiving the alerts, or choose specific services that you wish to receive alerts from, or even opt in for a type of service that will reward you first, and then send the notification that they were planning to send to their users. Essentially, all of it is your decision.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Push Notification Service Work?\n\nEthereum Push Notification Service is a notification protocol that aims to revolutionize the way the crypto world communicates with its participants. So far, there was simply no solution that would directly notify users that work with some service or project, or are affected by it in some way. Projects and companies were limited in their communication by posting updates on social networks, and hoping that the algorithms that are presenting content to users would let them see the announcement as soon as possible.\n\nAlternatively, it was the users\u2019 responsibility to check in with these projects, the markets, and alike, on regular basis and remain up to date with all new developments. This did not provide a particularly great user experience, and it led to users missing out on important events and activities at best, or resulted in losses when they failed to react in time to negative developments.\n\nEPNS introduces an advanced new notification system that is blockchain-agnostic, tied directly to the users\u2019 wallet addresses, and provides direct communication between services and users. It is a type of project that is considered a necessary part of the upcoming Web3.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH)\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nWazirX \u2013 This exchange is part of the Binance Group, which ensures a high standard of quality. It is the best exchange for residents of India.\n\nEthereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) \u2014 A project for chain-agnostic, platform-independent, incentivized notifications\n\nThe crypto/blockchain industry continues to evolve, and with each new idea such as what EPNS has come up with, it is getting closer to making Web3 a reality. There is still a long road ahead, of course, but even before Web3 becomes reality, a push notification system that can notify users of important development will be extremely useful. Especially if said system can be used by any dApp and smart contract on any blockchain.\n\nAs a result, we believe that EPNS has great potential in the blockchain world of the present, as well as future, and are interested to see its development."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a research paper diving into privacy pool systems as a tool to achieve more privacy in financial transactions, allowing users to prove dissociation from illicit funds through zero-knowledge-proof technology.\n\nThe document initially discusses one of the most popular privacy-enhancing protocols, Tornado Cash, which allows users to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies without creating an identifiable link between the two addresses. Recently, United States authorities filed criminal charges against its founders, alleging extensive use by bad actors.\n\n\"The critical issue with Tornado Cash was essentially that legitimate users had limited options to dissociate from the criminal activity the protocol attracted,\" reads the paper, co-authored by Jacob Illum, Matthias Nadler, Fabian Schar and Ameen Soleimani.\n\nThe analysis then elaborates on an extension of Tornado Cash\u2019s approach that would enable users to publicly prove the source of funds on-chain by allowing membership proofs (\u201cI prove that my withdrawal comes from one of these deposits\u201d) and exclusion proofs (\u201cI prove that my withdrawal does not come from one of these deposits\").\n\nAccording to the authors, the concept could provide a balance between honest and dishonest protocol users, potentially enabling financial compliance on-chain in the future:\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources, without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph. This is achieved by proving membership in custom association sets that satisfy certain properties, required by regulation or social consensus.\"\n\nWith privacy pools, users can exclude themselves from anonymity sets that include addresses related to illegal activities based on zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 a method of proving a statement without disclosing the statement\u2019s details.\n\nThe underlying idea presented in the document asserts that instead of simply using zero knowledge to prove that a \u201cwithdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set.\"\n\nThe association set can include all previously made deposits, only the user\u2019s own deposits, or anything in between. As a public input, the user specifies the set by providing its Merkle root. \u201cFor simplicity, we do not directly prove that the association set actually is a subset of the previously-made deposits; instead, we just require the user to zero-knowledge-prove two Merkle branches.\"\n\nTo illustrate it in a law enforcement context, the authors provide a simple example:\n\n\u201cSuppose that we have five users: Alice, Bob, Carl, David and Eve. The first four are honest, law-abiding users who nevertheless want to preserve their privacy, but Eve is a thief. Suppose also that this is publicly known.\"\n\nIn the example, when one of the users wants to withdraw funds, the individual can specify which association set to be a part of, meaning users are incentivized to make their association sets larger to safeguard privacy. However, to avoid their funds from being perceived as suspicious by merchants or exchanges, the users do not include Eve in their association set. Eve, however, cannot exclude her own deposit and will be forced to make an association set equal to the set of all five deposits.\n\nVisual representation of participants\u2019 association set selection. Source: Buterin et al., 2023\n\n\u201c[W]e assume that Alice, Bob, Carl and David include all other 'good\u2019 deposits in their respective association sets and exclude deposit 5, that originates from a known illicit source. Eve, on the other hand, cannot create a proof that disassociates her withdrawal from her own deposit.\"\n\nAccording to the authors, the example illustrates one possibility for the use of association sets in privacy pool protocols. \"Note, that the system does not rely on altruism on Alice, Bob, Carl and David\u2019s part; they have a clear incentive to prove their disassociation.\"\n\nThe paper further offers several other use cases of zero-knowledge proofs for users to demonstrate that funds are not tied to illicit sources or to prove that funds originate from a specific set of deposits without revealing any further information.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, privacy and regulatory compliance are perceived as incompatible. This paper suggests that this does not necessarily have to be the case, if the privacy-enhancing protocol enables its users to prove certain properties regarding the origin of their funds.\"\n\nProtocols working on zero-knowledge solutions are on the rise, with the Ethereum network dominating major launches, according to recent research. The findings point out that scaling ZK-proof solutions are set to experience the highest growth in the coming 12 months as global regulations evolve and users seek to protect their privacy.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and asset manager 21Shares made a significant move in the ETF space after applying for the first spot, Ethereum ETF, in the US.\n\nArk Invest, under the leadership of Cathie Wood and 21Shares, made waves this week by filing an application for the first spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, dubbed the \u201cArk 21Shares Ethereum ETF,\u201d was filed on Wednesday and named Coinbase as its custodian.\n\nFirst Spot Ethereum ETF in the US\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares applied for the first spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. The asset managers await approval from the SEC for an ETF that would directly hold ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThe application resembled the recent string of spot Bitcoin ETFs that have been delayed by the SEC. The securities agency said it needed more time to decide on the recent ETF filings after Grayscale secured a courtroom victory last week. Grayscale was victorious in its lawsuit against the SEC over the agency\u2019s reasoning for failing to approve spot ETFs. The judge ruled in favour of Grayscale as the SEC could not fully explain how futures ETFs materially differed from spot ETFs.\n\nIn its filing, Ark Invest names Coinbase Custody Trust Company as its custodian. The crypto exchange would be responsible for holding Ethereum backing the shares of Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF. If approved, the ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nSEC Receives Futures-Based Ethereum ETF Filings\n\nThe securities agency received previous filings for Ethereum futures ETFs but has yet to approve any. Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, recently commented on the state of these futures ETFs. He said:\n\n\u201cIn the past, the SEC has told Ether Futures ETF filers to withdraw 5-6 days after the first filing hit. We are now on Day 13 and no withdrawals. Not home free yet, but very good sign. As we predicted these will likely hit market in mid-October.\u201d\n\nArk Invest\u2019s application, however, goes a step further, resembling applications of recent Bitcoin spot ETFs. Futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have traded in the US since ProShares launched its futures ETF on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.\n\nArk Invest, 21Shares Apply for Futures ETH ETF\n\nLast week, it was revealed that Ark Invest and 21Shares joined forces to apply for a futures-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nPer recent SEC filings, Ark Invest and 21Shares proposed the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF (ARKZ) and the Ark 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY).\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Risks Losing $1,600 Support Amid Increasing Whale Activity - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "After rising above the $1,600 mark in March, following the bail attempts of the Silicon Valley Bank by the Federal Reserve, Ethereum price has remained above this level since then. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading 24% below the 2023 high at $2,140 with multiple metrics suggesting that it could drop below $1,600.\n\nThis is validated by the current bearish sentiment in the market and declining metrics related to the Ethereum network. Data from Alternative, a company that analyzes \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d around cryptocurrencies, shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed index is in the \u201cFear\u201d zone.\n\nThis means that investors are worried about their investments and they may continue selling to minimize losses.\n\nOn-chain Metrics Show Declining Demand for ETH\n\nIn addition to the drab price action and bearish market conditions, on-chain metrics point to decreasing demand. Notably, the value locked on Ethereum has decreased from a 2023 high of $31.5 billion in April to the current value of $21.46 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama.\n\nTotal Value Locked On Ethereum\n\nSimilarly, the number of Ethereum addresses holding a minimum of $1,000 in ETH has hit its lowest point in six months.\n\nNo. of Addresses with a Min. of $1,000 in ETH\n\nThis is worrying considering that the altcoin\u2019s price reached a peak of $2,140 in April, which was expected to have attracted more users to the network. Similarly, the amount of revenue generated on the platform has dropped by over 84% from $14.43 million in mid-April to $2.27 million on Sept.5. This points to a lack of interest among investors and developers.\n\nPart of the lack of investor interest can be attributed to the fact that the transaction fees on the Layer 1 blockchain remain notably high. Note that Ethereum\u2019s average transaction fee has remained above $4 for the past six months. This keeps investors and developers away, hence decreasing revenues.\n\nOn the upside, whales appear to be taking advantage of the low prices to accumulate more. According to Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, Ethereum Whales added 260,000 ETH with a staggering $425 million within 24 hours.\n\n#Ethereum whales appear to have purchased around 260,000 $ETH within the last 24 hours, worth nearly $425 million. pic.twitter.com/rPRMhnI6oD \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) September 5, 2023\n\nThis comes on the heels of a strong ETH whale movement in the past few days. Two whale addresses moved a total of 300,000 ETH on Coinbase earlier on Monday.\n\nWill Whale Activity Affect Ethereum\u2019s Price Action?\n\nWhile the motivations behind these transfers remain unknown, it\u2019s worth noting that they may have a significant impact on Ether\u2019s price.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,629 with bears determined to pull it below the $1,600 support lines. If they are successful, they may pull the smart contracts token lower toward the $1,545 swing low or the $1,500 psychological level. Such a move would represent a 5% drop from the current price.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nThis negative outlook was supported by the down-facing moving averages. These trend-following chart overlay indicators also presented areas of stiff resistance on the upside at $1,657, $$1,772, and $1,812 where the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) sat respectively.\n\nAlso validating the grim outlook for Ethereum was the Stochastic RSI which was facing downwards. Its position at 43 in the negative region suggested that the bears were more than buyers in the market.\n\nOn the upside, if the ETH were to stage a sustained recovery, it has to turn up from the current level rising above the areas defined by the SMAs toward the $1,900 psychological level. A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the token produces a daily candlestick close above the $2,000 psychological level and later the April swing high of $2,140. Such a move would then set the token on a sustained price recovery.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Decentralized exchange (DEX) platform dYdX plans to offer a \u201cpurely decentralized\u201d order book exchange as it migrates its ecosystem from the Ethereum network to the interchain network Cosmos.\n\nAt the Korea Blockchain Week 2023, Cointelegraph\u2019s Andrew Fenton spoke with dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d\u2019Haussy about the DEX\u2019s plans to implement decentralized order books on the exchange and how it plans to shift its ecosystem to a new blockchain network.\n\nAttendees at the Korea Blockchain Week 2023, held in Seoul, South Korea. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nIn the interview, d\u2019Haussy told Cointelegraph that one of the issues faced by DEXs is the slow performance of on-chain order books. Because of this issue, order books for DEXs had to be taken off-chain to cater to the needs of the users. He explained:\n\n\u201cIf you have like a one-second block time, you still have a one-second latency. And the market of crypto derivatives is a very high-frequency market. So, you cannot offer one-second latency.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Haussy highlighted that dYdX is taking a \u201cnew step forward\u201d in decentralization by making the order book decentralized. According to the executive, the order book will not be on the dYdX chain because it will still be slow, but it will instead be hosted within the validators.\n\n\u201cSo, the architecture choice by dYdX engineers is to decentralize the order book, without adding it on-chain because it will be too slow. The decision was made to essentially host the order book within the memory of the validators,\u201d d\u2019Haussy added.\n\nD\u2019Haussy believes this method is a \u201cnew thing within the space.\u201d The executive explained that validators usually validate blocks and create new blocks with a set of transactions. He also said the validators will still do this on the dYdX chain but will also store order books in their memory. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one solution, which we\u2019ll use to essentially offer to the market a purely decentralized order book exchange,\u201d he explained.\n\nRelated: 40% of crypto trading platforms are decentralized: World Federation of Exchanges\n\nApart from the decentralized order book, d\u2019Haussy spoke about dYdX\u2019s move to Cosmos. \u201cDYdX is not expanding, dYdX is migrating. So, the Ethereum exchange will close within a few months [...] we are migrating the full ecosystem,\u201d he explained.\n\n\ufe0f v4 Adoption & DYDX Token Migration\n\n\n\nThe dYdX community has voted in support of v4 Adoption and a potential DYDX Token Migration\u2757\n\n\n\n\u2705 ~36M DYDX from 392 addresses\n\n\u274c ~43 DYDX from 4 addresseshttps://t.co/FBLMZATURn pic.twitter.com/RwyOaDwpe4 \u2014 dYdX Foundation (@dydxfoundation) September 3, 2023\n\nAccording to d\u2019Haussy, users will barely notice the change, which will be very smooth.

        "title": "Investing In Aurora (AURORA) - Everything You Need to Know - Securities.io",
        "content": "Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem created by the NEAR protocol development team. Notably, NEAR is among the highest-performing third-generation L1 protocols available to Ethereum developers today. It provides the infrastructure which enables Aurora to improve the Dapp developer experience considerably, via turn-key solutions. Notably, the network combines a straightforward interface with dual consensus mechanisms to provide support for all the latest DeFi features and services.\n\nAurora is a popular project with more than $78M in TVL (total value locked) across +232 active projects currently. The network continues to attract more users due to its low transaction cost and full Ethereum compatibility. Additionally, the platform is one of the few programmable networks that enable users to leverage ETH to pay network fees. Here's everything you need to know about Aurora.\n\nWhat Problems Does Aurora Attempt to Fix?\n\nAurora seeks to provide another layer of performance to the Ethereum ecosystem The developers wanted to create a faster and more scalable alternative for users. They accomplished this task with the introduction of their next-generation DeFi protocols. Notably, the platform is much faster than Ethereum with 2-3 second transaction finalization times.\n\nCentralization\n\nAnother major concern for developers was to prevent centralization. When Aurora launched, Ethereum V1 was still in use. This version of Ethereum was experiencing many issues due to centralization in the ecosystem. The Aurora ecosystem provides a more democratic and transparent alternative for developers to consider. The network supports community governance as part of this strategy.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nAnother issue that the team wanted to reduce is security risks. To accomplish this goal, the platform leverages a two-tiered consensus mechanism that improves performance and security. The network integrates a Byzantine Fault Tolerant system with a Delegated Proof of stake option to enable better transaction throughput and faster finality.\n\nBenefits of Aurora\n\nThere are a lot of benefits that have helped Aurora become a popular project in the Ethereum ecosystem. For one, the platform features a straightforward approach that can help programmers build and release software with fewer steps. The entire project is geared towards elevating the Ethereum development experience.\n\nThe system is regarded as one of the top-performing programmable blockchains available today and it was built from day one to support complex smart contracts and Dapps. Developers gain the bonus of knowing that all of the most popular Ethereum tools work perfectly when programming on the network.\n\nEnergy Efficient\n\nThe platform leverages dual consensus mechanisms which help reduce its energy consumption compared to PoW networks like ETH 1.0. As such, the system eliminates miners from the consensus equation which eliminates many of the reasons why a blockchain network would need so much energy to remain valid. The new system leverages stakers which is far more efficient than miners. Users can lock up their tokens in network wallets rather than compete using high-powered miners.\n\nReduced Transaction Fees\n\nExecuting smart contracts on Ethereum 1.0 could get expensive. The network was plagued with congestion-related issues that could result in delays and higher fees. Aurora provides a smart and more cost-effective alternative to the market. The network introduces gasless meta-transactions as part of this strategy.\n\nPassive Income Options\n\nAnyone can secure returns when they participate in the network. The system enables you to stake your coins to help secure the network without any technical know-how. For your participation, you receive rewards in the form of AURORA tokens. This approach enables you to continually increase your staked assets to secure higher ROIs in the future.\n\nFees Paid in ETH\n\nAll transaction fees on the network are paid in ETH. This structure is ideal because it provides a reliable and well-recognized base asset. It also ensures that the networks tokens don\u2019t become over-saturated in the market. Lastly, using ETH as the base asset in the network helps developers streamline their creative process by eliminating the need to convert tokens over to other utility tokens to operate Dapps and execute smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Aurora Work?\n\nThe Aurora blockchain ecosystem lives on the NEAR protocol. This high-performance network enables users to enjoy a host of benefits that regular Ethereum developers could not. The network introduces a new programmable blockchain and a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency as part of this approach.\n\nAurora Engine\n\nAt the core of the network is the SputnikVM. This Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) was built on the NEAR protocol to provide better performance across the board. SputnikVM is capable of executing all Ethereum-compatible applications. Additionally, it offers lower fees and more scalability. From here, the network can be broken into a few components including the Aurora Bridge and governance token.\n\nThe Aurora Bridge\n\nThe Aurora Bridge plays a vital role in the ecosystem. The protocol enables anyone to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and the platform. Notably, the protocol operates in a fully trustless manner that enables developers to leverage multiple assets across different networks in their creations. Additionally, bridge transfers are free.\n\nToken\n\nAURORA is the primary utility token of the network. Developers need to hold the token to participate in the network DeFi features such as staking. Additionally, the asset plays a vital role in the network's community governance system. You can stake the token to gain voting rights. Notably, the asset is a limited token with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 slated for issuance over the life of the project.\n\nConsensus\n\nAurora leverages two consensus mechanisms to help improve performance. One mechanism is designed to approve transactions and validate the state of the network. The other handles smart contract executions. This multi-layered approach improves security and responsiveness.\n\nGovernance\n\nUsers can have a say in the network's future developments using the community governance system called the AuroraDAO the goal of this strategy is to keep the community decentralized well into the future. Users can stake AURORA to gain access to submitting proposals and network changes.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Aurora coin was released in November 2021. At that time, Ethereum was suffering from serious congestion. Aurora successfully provided a reliable alternative that didn\u2019t require a lot of alterations on the part of developers to use. As such, Aurora has managed to become one of the most popular EVM-boosting networks in the market today.\n\nHow to Buy Aurora (AURORA)\n\nCurrently, Aurora (AURORA) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKuCoin \u2013 This exchange currently offers cryptocurrency trading of over 300 other popular tokens. It is often the first to offer buying opportunities for new tokens. USA Residents are Prohibited.\n\nAurora \u2013 Streamlining ETH Development\n\nAurora is a great example of how developers sought to provide relief to ETH users. Even though Ethereum 2.0 has launched and provides improved performance, there is still a home for a network like Aurora that helps to keep the entire sector running smoothly. As such, you should keep an eye on AURORA in the coming months as the team has some exciting updates planned for the year."

        "content": "Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) has caught the attention of the crypto community, recently being compared to Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Mining fanatics suggest that this new Bitcoin fork outshines these established players.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin\n\nMining Bitcoin is a complex process that involves solving cryptographic puzzles to validate and record transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain through a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. To mine Bitcoin, you\u2019ll need specialized hardware known as ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) since general-purpose computers are no longer efficient for this task. Set up your mining rig and connect it to a reliable power source and the internet. Once your rig is connected, it will start running through various combinations of numbers to solve complex mathematical problems. When your mining rig successfully solves a puzzle, you are rewarded with the transaction fees for that block and a certain number of BTC. It\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin mining has become highly competitive, requiring significant investment in equipment and energy.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum\n\nEthereum moved from a Proof-of-Work system and now relies on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In this new system, individuals can no longer mine Ethereum in the conventional sense. Instead, Ethereum holders can become validators by locking up a certain amount of ETH (at least 32 ETH) as collateral and participating in the network\u2019s consensus process. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of ETH they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. Validators receive rewards in the form of interest on their staked coins. The shift to PoS aimed at reducing energy consumption, increasing scalability, and making Ethereum more environmentally friendly.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark uses a new consensus mechanism, the Proof-of-Process (PoP), which combines aspects of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake. The PoP rewards miners for confirming blocks and contributing to the processing power of their devices. The network has a massive number of nodes to ensure it can accommodate many miners. Additionally, the PoP is combined with an algorithm that exponentially reduces the rewards per additional power, ensuring a fairer distribution of rewards. Moreover, the Bitcoin Spark network is incredibly lightweight, allowing for lower-power devices to run the network. BTCS mining will be through the Bitcoin Spark application, which will become open source for third-party application development after the network\u2019s launch.\n\nTo mine BTCS, you will need to install the Bitcoin Spark application and grant it access to your device\u2019s processing unit. The app will be compatible with Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Once installed and granted access, the application will create a virtual environment isolated from the device\u2019s operating system functions to ensure security. It will also regularly adjust itself to resources it can use on the device, accounting for overheating, battery life, and simultaneous device usage needs. Nonetheless, you can manually set the amount of device resources permitted for mining use. With the simplicity of the application, you will be able to get started incredibly easily. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s method greatly reduces the work and power consumption required for mining, essentially opening it up to anyone with a smart device.\n\nThe miners\u2019 collective power will be safely \u2018rented out\u2019 to Bitcoin Spark\u2019s clients undertaking high CPU/GPU tasks, such as 3D rendering, machine learning, and running servers. Those using the network for remote computing will pay with BTCS, which will be sent to the mining pool. This means miners within the Bitcoin Spark network will be rewarded with transaction fees, new BTCS coins, and revenue from leasing their processing power. Thus, BTCS miners should be able to turn a profit regardless of energy or asset prices, which is one of the many issues facing crypto miners today.\n\nBitcoin Spark is offering investors a chance to get BTCS early and at discounted prices through its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Analysts who\u2019ve reviewed the project suggest it is a sound project with great potential for growth and adoption, which can prove extremely rewarding for early investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Spark provides a true path to decentralization, where mining is accessible to all. The network also instills a greater desire for network validation by providing multiple ways for miners to earn. As crypto miners continue to search for more sustainable and efficient alternatives, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s vision could see rank at the top.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark and its ICO:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This methodology involves bundling multiple transactions into a single transaction on Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1, effectively distributing the associated transaction fees across the participants in this consolidated transaction. The net result is a remarkable reduction in gas fees, often by a factor of 100, offering users an economical and efficient alternative for conducting transactions while ensuring the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nEnya, a trailblazing decentralized infrastructure solutions company, has been instrumental in Boba Network\u2019s development and support. Founded in 2018, Enya has earned recognition as a leading provider of multiparty computation services, serving a user base exceeding 10 million across 91 countries. The collaboration between Enya and Boba Network has birthed a promising Layer-2 solution poised to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nBoba Network\u2019s emergence on the scene signaled a significant stride in Ethereum\u2019s quest for enhanced scalability and efficiency. By lowering fees, amplifying transaction throughput, and empowering smart contracts, Boba Network has marked itself as a crucial player in Ethereum\u2019s evolving ecosystem. Its utilization of Optimistic rollup technology ensures a secure and streamlined experience for users, promising a future where Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns are alleviated.\n\nArchitecture\n\nBoba Network\u2019s architecture is a testament to its commitment to optimizing Ethereum\u2019s capabilities through the utilization of Optimistic rollup technology. This technical infrastructure has several key components that work together to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and security.\n\nOptimistic Rollup Approach\n\nAt its core, Boba Network employs Optimistic rollups, operating under the assumption that transactions are valid unless explicitly challenged. This approach significantly expedites transaction processing, as only contested transactions require verification.\n\nSequencers and Transaction Bundling\n\nTo facilitate the transfer of data between Layer-2 and Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1, Boba Network relies on sequencers. These sequencers play a pivotal role in bundling multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then submitted to Ethereum via a single transaction. However, it\u2019s important to note that, at present, fraud proofs, which would challenge the assumption of transaction validity, have not been enabled within the network.\n\nQuick Exit Mechanism\n\nOne notable feature of Boba Network is its swap-based mechanism, designed to enable rapid exits from the network back to Ethereum. This mechanism offers users the option to bypass the conventional seven-day withdrawal period associated with Optimistic rollups. While providing this convenience, the mechanism imposes a small convenience fee, which is then distributed as an incentive to liquidity providers.\n\nHybrid Compute Functionality\n\nThe introduction of the Hybrid Compute feature has significantly expanded Boba Network\u2019s capabilities. This feature empowers smart contracts within the network to interact seamlessly with external systems, effectively acting as a conduit between Boba Network\u2019s sequencer and external APIs. It allows smart contracts to execute complex algorithms, including machine learning classifiers, access real-world data, and synchronize with the latest state of external servers, further enhancing the versatility of applications built on the network.\n\nCross-Chain Messaging and Gas Pricing Logic\n\nBoba Network has implemented cross-chain messaging, a community fraud detector, and a distinct gas pricing logic. Cross-chain messaging facilitates the independent verification of transactions by any interested party, enhancing the network\u2019s transparency and security. The community fraud detector adds an extra layer of security by allowing users to identify and report potentially fraudulent transactions within the network. Furthermore, Boba Network employs a unique gas pricing logic that updates the Layer-1 security fee price every 10 minutes, ensuring smoother transitions and minimizing abrupt price fluctuations.\n\nNFT Bridge\n\nBoba Network offers an NFT bridge, facilitating the seamless movement of NFT assets between Boba Network and Ethereum. This bridge plays a crucial role in enabling interoperability between the two networks, particularly for specialized NFT contracts designed for Layer-2 solutions.\n\nBoba Network\u2019s architecture leverages Optimistic rollup technology and a range of innovative features to enhance the efficiency, security, and functionality of the Ethereum ecosystem. From its use of sequencers and quick exit mechanisms to the Hybrid Compute functionality and NFT bridge, Boba Network is poised to play a significant role in addressing Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges while offering a versatile platform for decentralized applications.\n\nBOBA Token Economics\n\nBOBA serves as the backbone of Boba Network\u2019s governance and staking ecosystem, playing a pivotal role in shaping the network\u2019s future and facilitating user interactions. With a clear focus on enhancing network governance and utility, BOBA has been strategically distributed and integrated into the Boba Network ecosystem.\n\nBOBA\u2019s inception involved a carefully planned initial distribution strategy. Notably, an airdrop was conducted, offering a 1:1 ratio to OMG token holders as of the snapshot taken in November 2021. This airdrop allowed existing OMG token holders to seamlessly transition into the BOBA ecosystem, ensuring a fair and inclusive distribution.\n\nBOBA\u2019s primary function within the Boba Network is to serve as a governance token. Holders of BOBA tokens gain voting rights within the Boba Network DAO, enabling them to actively participate in shaping the network\u2019s direction. Decisions regarding community initiatives, network upgrades, and future developments rest in the hands of BOBA token holders, emphasizing the decentralized nature of the network.\n\nBeyond its governance role, BOBA holds utility in the day-to-day transactions within Boba Network. Users have the option to use BOBA as a means to pay for gas fees, providing them with added flexibility and a cost-effective advantage. Notably, choosing BOBA as the gas token results in a notable 25% fee discount, incentivizing its use and contributing to cost savings for network participants.\n\nThe BOBA token economics are intricately woven into the fabric of Boba Network, serving as both a governance instrument and a versatile utility token for users. Its initial distribution, governance role, and gas fee discounts collectively contribute to the vibrancy and functionality of the network, further solidifying BOBA\u2019s significance within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBoba Network Ecosystem\n\nBoba Network has swiftly emerged as an enticing hub for blockchain protocols and projects, with an impressive lineup of 39 initiatives either in development or already launched. This ecosystem\u2019s growth is a testament to Boba Network\u2019s appeal as a Layer-2 scaling solution within the Ethereum landscape.\n\nNotably, OolongSwap, Boba Network\u2019s native decentralized exchange (DEX), stands at the forefront of this burgeoning ecosystem. OolongSwap has become a powerhouse, contributing to a substantial volume of $1.1 billion. This dominance underscores the popularity and utility of the platform among users, highlighting its pivotal role in the Boba Network ecosystem.\n\nTo further foster growth and engagement within the ecosystem, Boba Network has introduced the \u201cWAGMI\u201d incentive program. This unique initiative offers an alternative approach to traditional liquidity mining programs. It empowers projects deployed on Boba Network to incentivize users with \u201cWAGMI Options,\u201d often denoted as WAGMI tokens. These options are closely tied to key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect the network\u2019s performance over a specified period.\n\nThe \u201cWAGMI\u201d program introduces a user-centric rewards system, allowing individuals to earn options by actively participating in the supported protocols based on predetermined KPIs. The value of these options is intricately linked to factors such as the network\u2019s TVL during a specific period. Users have the opportunity to redeem their accumulated WAGMI Options for BOBA tokens following a one-month settlement period.\n\nThe Boba Network ecosystem is thriving, driven by a diverse array of protocols and projects. OolongSwap\u2019s commanding presence and the innovative \u201cWAGMI\u201d incentive program stand as compelling examples of the network\u2019s vibrancy and commitment to nurturing a dynamic and rewarding environment for its users and contributors.\n\nCompetition\n\nBoba Network finds itself in a competitive landscape within Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. While it offers its own set of features and advantages, it faces competition from other prominent players in this domain.\n\nBoba Network contends with established Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, each characterized by its distinct attributes. Arbitrum, for instance, introduced a multi-round fraud proof mechanism, ensuring efficient transaction processing with reduced withdrawal times. In contrast, Boba Network prioritizes security and quick exits, allowing users to transfer funds back to Ethereum swiftly. Optimism, on the other hand, employs a single-round fraud proof approach, offering instantaneous fraud verification. However, this comes at the cost of increased transaction expenses due to the need for state roots.\n\nLooking ahead, Boba Network anticipates competition from emerging ZK (Zero-Knowledge) rollups once they achieve full functionality like Starknet and zkSync. These solutions are expected to significantly impact the Layer-2 landscape by leveraging zero-knowledge proof algorithms. This technology has the potential to drastically enhance transaction processing speed while reducing costs, making ZK rollups formidable contenders in the future.\n\nThe trajectory of Layer-2 networks, including Boba Network, is also influenced by external factors. Chief among these is the success and timing of Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake, known as The Merge. The Merge\u2019s outcome will play a pivotal role in shaping the roadmap of Layer-2 solutions, potentially impacting their adoption and development.\n\nBoba Network competes actively with existing Layer-2 solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, while also keeping an eye on the evolving landscape, including potential rivals like ZK rollups. The interplay of technological innovation and external factors like The Merge will undoubtedly mold the competitive dynamics within the Layer-2 ecosystem in the coming years.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe world of Layer-2 scaling solutions is marked by rapid evolution and fierce competition. These solutions play a pivotal role in alleviating Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns and enhancing its capabilities. As they continue to evolve, competition will be a driving force behind innovation, leading to the development of more efficient and feature-rich networks.\n\nNotably, the emergence of ZK rollups presents a potential shift in the dominance of Optimistic rollups like Boba Network. Once fully functional, ZK rollups are poised to offer higher transaction throughput and lower costs, potentially challenging the position of Optimistic rollups."

        "title": "ARK Invest is asking to issue a spot Ethereum ETF - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, ARK Invest submitted an official request to the SEC to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIf it is approved, it would be the first ETF ever to be collateralized directly in ETH and approved by the U.S. agency that oversees equity markets.\n\nETFs on Ethereum: Ark Invest gives it a try\n\nIn fact, ETFs on Ethereum already exist.\n\nHowever if, for example, in Europe and Canada there are also already some that are collateralized directly in ETH, in the U.S., on the other hand, only ETFs based on Ethereum price futures contracts have been approved.\n\nThe argument is the same as for Bitcoin: the SEC has agreed to approve ETFs based on futures contracts, which are themselves CFTC-approved derivatives, but has not yet agreed to approve ETFs based directly on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe fact is that the markets are now firmly convinced that, after the ruling against the SEC in the Grayscale case, the agency no longer has the ability to refuse to approve similar applications.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that one of the applicants is the giant BlackRock, which has an approval rate of more than 99 percent for its requests to issue ETFs.\n\nSo given that it seems possible that within a few months at most the SEC will approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market as well, ARK Invest has decided that now might be a good time to get a spot ETH ETF approved as well.\n\nCrypto ETFs\n\nETFs that replicate cryptocurrency price movements have a couple of advantages, although they also have disadvantages.\n\nThe first advantage is that they do not require the investor to custody the cryptocurrencies, since custody is the responsibility of the fund manager.\n\nNote that futures contract-based ETFs also do not require the custody of cryptocurrencies by the fund manager, who instead must only \u201ccustody\u201d futures contracts.\n\nBut ETFs collateralized directly in cryptocurrencies track their market value better, and in theory could even return the underlying to their owners.\n\nBut the main advantage is another: they are fully regulated instruments that trade on traditional exchanges.\n\nThat is, in other words, they are almost identical financial products to those already in use, except for the underlying, which makes them usable by anyone trading on traditional exchanges, even institutional clients.\n\nIn contrast, this reasoning does not apply to crypto instruments, which are therefore inaccessible to some potential institutional investors who are forced by law to use only fully regulated financial products.\n\nIn addition, having a presence on traditional exchanges means that crypto ETFs will also be available for use by those who have never entered and do not want to enter crypto markets.\n\nOf course, there are drawbacks as well, first and foremost the inability to self-custody and thus having to necessarily rely on a third party that in theory could also prove unreliable.\n\nThey also force their users to use the traditional financial system, and they cannot be traded P2P.\n\nARK Invest\n\nARK Investment Management is a well-known U.S. investment management company, and it manages several actively managed ETFs.\n\nIt was founded in 2014 by Cathie Wood, who is also its CEO and CFO.\n\nThe company is famous because its Innovation ETF in 2020 became the largest actively managed ETF in the world, with $17 billion in assets under management and a 170 percent return. The following year ARK Invest became one of the top 10 ETF issuers in the world.\n\nIt is therefore a veritable behemoth in this field, so it is no coincidence that it is the first to have a real chance of having a spot ETH ETF approved by the SEC for the U.S. market.\n\nARK Invest\u2019s Ethereum ETF\n\nThe spot ETH ETF that ARK Invest wants to issue will be called Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, and it will be issued in partnership with 21Shares, a leading crypto ETF issuer.\n\n21Shares is a Swiss company, and operates mainly in Europe. It has already issued dozens of similar products, including ETFs and ETPs, including three ETPs on Ethereum.\n\nThe ETHs will be held by Coinbase Custody Trust Company."

        "title": "Ark Invest files for spot Ethereum ETF - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Sometimes the investment world receives a jolt that reminds everyone just how rapidly the financial landscape is evolving. Enter the scene: Ark Invest. Teaming up with 21Shares, the duo boldly declared their intent to debut the first-ever U.S.-based Ethereum ETF that would provide direct exposure to Ether \u2013 the crypto world\u2019s silver. The move? Undeniably audacious. The impact? Potentially colossal.\n\nA Direct Investment Strategy: Because Why Not?\n\nRecent rumblings in the finance sphere have whispered of Ether futures spot-ETFs. But Ark Invest, never one to tiptoe around the edges, took it up a notch. Their strategy to directly hold Ether isn\u2019t just gutsy\u2014it\u2019s unprecedented. And let\u2019s be clear; this is no mere attempt to offer yet another crypto product. This is about reshaping the narrative, and more crucially, raising the stakes. It\u2019s a game-changer, with a twist.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, for the uninitiated, isn\u2019t just an ordinary exchange-traded fund. Its primary intent, bold as ever, is to track the performance of Ether. And how will it do this? By focusing on the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate \u2013 a New York Variant. In layman terms, it\u2019s all about reflecting Ether\u2019s performance, valued in the good ol\u2019 U.S. dollar.\n\nAnd who\u2019s at the heart of this operation? A diverse ensemble. Ark Investment Management LLC, designated as the Sub-Adviser, isn\u2019t just sitting on the sidelines. They\u2019re in the thick of it, aiding and guiding the marketing of the Shares.\n\nAs for holding the Trust\u2019s Ether, that responsibility rests with the trusty hands of Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. And let\u2019s not even get started on the litany of other roles and intricacies, like the Authorized Participants, ensuring everything runs as smooth as butter.\n\nUnpacking the Trust\u2019s Core Objectives\n\nDiving deeper into this financial behemoth, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF has set itself some monumental tasks. Firstly, there\u2019s the objective to mirror Ether\u2019s performance as determined by the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate. Sounds straightforward? It\u2019s anything but.\n\nThe Index itself is a product of rigorous calculations by CF Benchmarks Ltd., basing its results on a comprehensive aggregation of the trade flows from major ether spot exchanges.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s core appeal to investors, however, lies elsewhere. Imagine being able to delve into the ether market without the pesky hurdles of direct Ether trading or dealing with spot market nuances. That\u2019s the promise this ETF brings. And with Coinbase Custody as its custodian, it offers a semblance of security. Although, remember, it\u2019s not FDIC-insured, but hey, they\u2019ve got private insurance. Small consolations?\n\nAs for its modus operandi, the Trust is pretty clear-cut. Barring some cataclysmic event, they aren\u2019t in the business of buying or selling Ether. Instead, their focus rests on \u201cin-kind\u201d transactions. Think of it as a barter system, where Authorized Participants bring Ether to the table, and in exchange, they\u2019re handed Shares by the Trust. And vice versa. It\u2019s a straightforward yet intricate dance of finance.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway? Ark Invest and 21Shares aren\u2019t just stepping into the future; they\u2019re dragging the rest of us with them. Their Ethereum ETF is audacious, ambitious, and just the kind of shake-up the investment world didn\u2019t know it needed. But let\u2019s not roll out the red carpet just yet. Like every pioneer, they\u2019ve got challenges ahead. Only time will tell if this bet pays off, but one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014it\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.\n\n**You can read the SEC filing here."

According to its website, the aim is to proffer a solution to the challenges of Ethereum without going through the layer-two route. Hence, the Ethereum Express solution dubs itself as the cheaper, safer, and faster alternative with the ETE as the native currency of the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum network carries out more and more applications and smart contracts. As resource usage increases, the Ethereum network becomes congested, and the GAS consumed by transfers and calling contracts has soared. In this case, similar to the Ethereum Express Network, layer 1 will be more competitive and advantageous.\n\nToday, the price of ETE is $0.074214, and about $429,058 worth of ETE moved across the market in the last 24 hours. Due to its current price and a maximum supply of 200 million tokens, ETE\u2019s fully diluted market cap amounts to $3.71M. Currently, CoinMarketCap ranks the new token at #2406 and is listed on Uniswap v2.\n\n4. MetaTrace (TRC)\n\nMetaTrace is a Polygon-based gaming platform that\u2019s out to inspire millions of people to participate in daily physical activities. According to its website, the project will help users have a newer perspective of the world around them through various games and in-game activities and interactions. Furthermore, the platform claims that it\u2019s out to invent a new utopian metaverse where the real world is enhanced rather than replaced.\n\nThe MetaTrace application is a game incorporating a variety of game mechanics aimed at combining geolocation, blockchain environments, and classic game strategies. It is based on augmented reality technology, which offers users a unique gaming experience and an easy immersion into Web3 technologies. The project\u2019s team is diligently working on creating a platform that will allow each player to realize their ideas and become the creator of their adventures.\n\nTRC has a value of $0.017833 with a 24-hour trading volume of $988,479. Its market cap at press time amounts to $467,054, giving it a #2265 ranking on CoinMarketCap. TRC reportedly has a circulating supply of 26.19 million tokens and a maximum supply of 5 billion tokens. The new coin is listed on MEXC.\n\n5. Wall Street Memes (WSM)\n\nThe Wall Street Memes project recently rounded off its presales, and its listing is only 18 days away. The project recorded over $25 million in investment from thousands of investors. It is now on its way to providing the opportunity for mutual prosperity to its community and the world.\n\nHow are they still flexing pic.twitter.com/QVDvM7dsfb \u2014 Wall Street Memes (@wallstmemes) September 7, 2023\n\nHowever, the presale is over entirely. Investors who desire to participate in the movement still have the chance to fill their bags with WSM tokens. Currently, WSM is still available at a discounted price of $0.0337.\n\nThe team is currently working towards listing the token on multiple tier 1 exchanges, meaning the token\u2019s price is bound to spike remarkably.
