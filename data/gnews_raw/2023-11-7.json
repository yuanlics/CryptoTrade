        "content": "On the Cosmos-based EVM chain Evmos, Cosmos transactions and Ethereum transactions have been operating under different standards, leading to complications as these two types of transactions struggle to decode each other effectively.\n\nEvmos plans to relieve this technical headache by only supporting Ethereum-formatted transactions by 2024 Q3, it announced in a blog post Tuesday. Despite this strategic shift, the protocol emphasized that Evmos is not exiting the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, Evmos\u2019 founder suggested that the move could help bring Ethereum developers to the IBC.\n\nEvmos functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that integrates the Cosmos IBC protocol, allowing it to operate as an EVM within the Cosmos network. Evmos raised $27 million via token sale in late 2022.\n\nRead more: Uniting the blockchain ecosystems: Q&A with Cosmos founder Ethan Buchman\n\nThe project\u2019s co-founder Federico Kunze K\u00fcllmer said that by only supporting Ethereum transactions, Evmos hopes to make it easier for Ethereum developers to start working in Cosmos.\n\n\u201cThe wallets and the tools that they are already used to on Ethereum do not work easily on Cosmos,\u201d K\u00fcllmer said. \u201cWe want to make it very easy for the developers and users that are already interacting with Ethereum wallets to interact with any Cosmos application specific blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe Interchain Foundation, a non-profit focused on Cosmos adoption, made onboarding Ethereum developers a large part of its 2024 roadmap, Blockworks previously reported.\n\nIn the lead-up to fully embracing Ethereum-formatted transactions by Q3 2024, the protocol has committed to burning all Cosmos transaction fees during this interim period. This action will effectively remove these fees from circulation, signaling a shift towards revised token economics for the EVMOS token. K\u00fcllmer indicated that further details on the new tokenomics will be unveiled next week.\n\nEvmos (EVMOS) was worth around $0.07 at the time of publication.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Study lowers Ethereum price expectation for next 7 years - crypto.news",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency experts have lowered their predictions for Ethereum (ETH), over the next few years, according to a new survey from Finder.\n\nThe survey asked 31 industry specialists for their ether price forecasts for the end of 2023, 2025 and 2030. The average predictions were down compared to a previous Finder survey conducted in July 2022.\n\nThe panel predicted Ether will be worth $1,840 on average by the end of 2023, down from a prediction of $2,451 in July. The 2025 forecast fell to $5,824 from $5,845 previously, and the 2030 prediction declined to $14,411 versus $16,414 in the earlier survey.\n\nFinder calculates the average forecasts by removing the top and bottom 10% of responses and taking the mean of the rest, a technique known as the truncated mean. This is designed to eliminate outliers and arrive at a more consistent consensus.\n\nYou might also like: Investor optimism fuels meme coins growth: predictions and market analysis\n\nWhile still bullish long term, some panelists cited near-term economic challenges and competition from other blockchains as reasons for tempered short-term expectations.\n\nETH has a huge growth potential. [\u2026] Growth is [currently] limited by high rates in TradFi. In [the] case of reaching a soft landing by US authorities, ETH[\u2018s] price will increase dramatically, but not until the middle of next year. Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler\n\nOthers pointed to historical price patterns around Bitcoin (BTC) halvings. \u201cHistorically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year,\u201d explained Pav Hundal of cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx.\n\nThe panel predicted ETH could climb as high as $2,800 but also slump to $1,200 or below by year-end 2023. Nearly half see it finishing the year between $1,751 and $2,000.\n\nMost experts said now is a good time to hold or buy Ether, though around 17% believe it is currently overvalued. Asked if and when ETH\u2019s total market value could surpass Bitcoin\u2019s, 43% of panelists said they don\u2019t expect that to ever happen. But around 20% think the \u2018flippening\u2019 \u2014 with Ethereum\u2019s market cap overtaking Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 could occur by 2030.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2 Booming: Will Gas Fees Drop Even In A Bull Market? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The adoption of Ethereum layer-2s is on the rise if Token Terminal data shared on November 6 is anything to go by. According to statistics from the blockchain analytics platform shared by Erik Smith, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of 401 Financial, the average active addresses over the past three months has exceeded 10 million, a nearly 2X expansion from early 2023.\n\nRelated Reading: Can The ADA Price Climb Above $20 In The Bull Market? Analyst Provides Answers\n\nEthereum Layer-2s Finding More Adoption\n\nLooking at the chart, Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, remains the most popular. At the same time, Arbitrum and OP Mainnet, which are common layer-2s adopting the roll-up technology, are actively being used.\n\nEven so, OP Mainnet\u2019s share is gradually dropping. Base, a layer-2 backed by Coinbase, and StarkNet are also finding adoption, expanding their share over the past three months.\n\nIn crypto, active addresses refer to the number of unique wallet addresses (sending and receiving) that have interacted with the blockchain, in this case, Ethereum, over a given period.\n\nAn uptick or contraction in the number of active addresses can be used to measure sentiment and the level of uptake. In bear markets, active addresses tend to drop, only rising when bulls flow in, pointing to a possible scramble for arising opportunities.\n\nThe recent uptrend coincides with the rapid expansion of leading crypto prices. Ethereum (ETH) prices are inching closer to the $1,870 resistance level, with a breakout above this line a potential trigger for a leg up that might see the coin retest $2,100 and even register new 2023 highs.\n\nUsually, rising crypto prices tend to revive demand as the number of active addresses and, in some instances, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.\n\nWhat Will Happen To Gas Fees?\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s most active smart contract platform, stretching its dominance mainly because of its first-mover advantage. The blockchain anchors more DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming activity. Deploying protocols, depending on their objectives, can either directly launch on the mainnet or layer-2s.\n\nThe mainnet is directly secured by validators, while layer-2 solutions depend on the mainnet for security but often re-route transactions off-chain. In this arrangement, more transactions can be processed cheaply and efficiently, relieving the mainnet.\n\nThough the Ethereum base layer is secure, its peak transaction throughput remains relatively lower at around 15 TPS. This means during peak demand, gas fees tend to be higher, impacting user demand.\n\nStill, Ethereum gas fees remain at a multi-year low at around 23 Gwei, according to trackers, as seen on the chart below. This is down from 240 Gwei recorded in February 2021 when crypto assets rapidly rose.\n\nFor now, whether gas fees will increase as the market recovers is yet to be seen. What\u2019s evident is that as users opt for layer-2s, the mainnet will likely be relieved, keeping gas fee fluctuation low.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An Estonian banker has confirmed himself to be the owner of an Ethereum address with over 250,000 ETH worth nearly half a billion dollars \u2013 but says he lost the keys.\n\nIn a new interview with Vikerraadio in Estonia, LHV Bank founder Rain L\u00f5hmus was asked about something he said years ago about getting into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum in their early days but then losing access to his wallets.\n\nAsked if he ever found his keys, L\u00f5hmus says,\n\n\u201cNo, and I haven\u2019t made much effort either. It\u2019s no secret that I have a wallet with 250,000 Ethereum units, anyone can calculate for themselves what it\u2019s worth.\n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s hundreds of millions?\n\nYeah, and I can\u2019t solve this alone; if someone thinks they can, I\u2019ll take all offers. My own best plan is to build Rain L\u00f5hmus as an AI and see if he can get his memories back.\n\nL\u00f5hmus said the dangers of handling your own keys and seed phrases was one of the weak points of crypto.\n\n\u201cI absolutely agree that this is a very weak point of this system, which makes you think that this perfect decentralization has other risks that you don\u2019t usually think about. But it\u2019s very common for me to lose passwords. I went to renew my ID card passwords today; if it were crypto, I\u2019d be in a big crisis again, but luckily the police and border police work.\u201d\n\nBased on the information shared by L\u00f5hmus, on-chain analysts have identified his Ethereum address, and according to Etherscan, it is the fourth biggest holding of ETH excluding exchanges, the Ethereum Foundation, and the Wrapped Ether (wETH) address.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Stackr Labs, an Ethereum ETH +2.14% scaling startup, has raised $5.5 million in a seed funding round.\n\nArchetype led the round, with a16z Crypto Startup School, Lemniscap, Scalar Capital and others participating, Stackr said Wednesday. Angel investors including Anurag Arjun of Avail, Sreeram Kanan of EigenLayer, Mustafa Al-Bassam of Celestia Labs and Andrew Keys of Darma Capital also joined the seed round.\n\nStackr said it was the only Indian startup in a16z CSS's 2023 batch. A16z CSS is the venture capital giant's crypto accelerator program that typically invests $500,000 in participating startups in exchange for 7% equity, according to its website.\n\nIt is unclear when Stackr started raising for the seed round and when the firm closed it; a16z Crypto first tweeted about Stackr in May. Stackr founder and CEO Kautuk Kundan declined to comment on the fundraising timeline. He also declined to comment on the structure of the seed round and valuation.\n\nWhat is Stackr?\n\nStackr is developing Ethereum scaling infrastructure focused on \"micro-rollups,\" or app-specific rollups, which are aimed at helping developers launch scalable web3 applications using web2 programming languages. Stackr said that its modular framework will let developers focus solely on their application's specific logic while it manages the underlying rollup infrastructure.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Developers will be able to use the Stackr framework to design their own state machines according to their use cases. This gives them complete freedom for designing efficient systems,\" Kautuk told The Block. \"Other Layer 2s lock the developers into their own virtual machine constraints that result in suboptimal developer experience and limit the kind of applications that are possible to be built.\"\n\nKautuk, 25, previously worked as a developer and a research and development engineer at the Ethereum Foundation. In 2022, Stackr received a Layer 2 Community Grant from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nComparing its micro-rollups with traditional or general-purpose rollups, such as optimistic and zk-rollups, Stackr said traditional rollups resemble monolithic systems, while micro-rollups are akin to microservices or a collection of small, autonomous services that help to scale applications.\n\nStackr is currently focused on scaling Ethereum but is open to integrating other chains in the future, Kautuk said.\n\nWith fresh capital in hand, Stackr plans to expand its team and launch a testnet. The startup, which wants to bring web2 developers into the web3 space, currently employs fewer than ten people, and Kautuk looks to hire more staff across engineering, research and business development functions. Stackr also plans to set up a grant program to attract developers to build on its platform."

The latter is famous on Twitter for tracking huge sums of cryptocurrencies that were once lost by their owners.\n\nRain Lohmus, the founder of LHV Bank, received 250K $ETH from the #EthereumICO.\n\n\n\nThe cost is ~$77.5K, and now worth ~$473M.\n\n\n\nBut unfortunately, he lost the keys.https://t.co/PG2vALcDmU pic.twitter.com/ZPuexmdR1t \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 7, 2023\n\n$437 million in ETH locked dead over lost wallet keys\n\nData shared by Grogan in a recent tweet shows that he had managed to identify the unknown whale who acquired approximately $77,500 worth of ETH. This crypto, Grogan comments, has been completely untouched, and there has not been a single transfer made from it since 2014.\n\nThe owner turned out to be the founder of LHV Bank based in the Baltics, Rain Lohmus. Apparently, he has lost his private keys and has been unable to move his ETH or convert in into fiat.\n\nBy now, the ETH he holds is worth roughly $437 million \u2013 that is 5,333x growth.\n\nGrogan mentioned that if anyone can help him recover these hundreds of millions, he is willing to pay a generous reward for it: \"If you can help him recover them somehow, he's willing to split them with you.\"\n\nNearly 910,000 ETH lost forever in total\n\nSumming up his recent estimations, Conor Grogan stated that the overall amount of Ethereum that has been lost for good with very low chances of recovery now constitutes 886,000 ETH \u2013 that is more than $1.63 billion in the fiat equivalent.\n\nWith a few extra addresses added, the total amount of lost Ether rises to 909,800 ETH, worth more than $1.73 billion, or over 0.75% of the whole Ethereum supply circulating on the market.\n\nAdded a few extra addresses I've been meaning to (Incl. Prime Trust lost ETH) and we are up to 909,800 ETH worth $1.73B+ that are lost forever: 0.75%+ of all circulating supply pic.twitter.com/mb2XSqsQb2 \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) November 6, 2023\n\nLargest ETH outflow from CEX observed\n\nAs reported by on-chain data vendor IntoTheBlock earlier, over the past week, a massive outflow of Ethereum was detected from centralized crypto exchanges \u2013 the largest outflow since August.\n\nIn total, more than $210,000,000 worth of Ethereum was moved to self-custody by investors. A likely reason for this is that investors plan to hold their ETH long term, which is best to do in one's own wallets rather than holding digital currencies on crypto exchanges.\n\nBetween Sunday and Monday this week, the second largest crypto, Ethereum, staged a minor growth of 3.13%, reaching the $1,914 level. However, within the last 24 hours, ETH failed to hold there or show a further rise. Instead, the crypto went down by 2.33%, now exchanging hands at $1,869 on the Bitstamp exchange."

        "title": "Ethereum's Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether's middling year pricewise: Q&A - Blockworks",
        "content": "When Ethereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d to proof-of-stake went off without a hitch last September, some felt the layer-1 was primed for a breakout. Speculation arose around a \u201cflippening\u201d and institutional investors waited in the wings.\n\nBut ether\u2019s price did not end up meeting these expectations. NFTs tested new lows, and the bear market muted DeFi engagement. Bitcoin continued to outpace ether in 2023 \u2014 recently reaching dominance levels not seen since 2021. Meanwhile, institutional inflows are largely yet to materialize.\n\nBlockworks spoke with Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, about the network\u2019s current standing and future prospects. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks\u2019 interview with Drake.\n\nBlockworks: You can see variations of this stat in different places, but the rewards paid out by Ethereum were larger than the transaction fees that were burned in both September and October. It looks like that\u2019s turned around a little bit, but how should people think about issuance versus burn and when that flips negative?\n\nDrake: The fee market is exceptionally volatile. What you really want to be doing is zooming out, because when you zoom out, you\u2019re smoothing your data over a longer period of time.\n\nIf you look at ultrasound.money, you\u2019ll notice that when it\u2019s profitable, it\u2019s like printing money. It\u2019s really, really profitable. Ethereum has about a profit margin of 50% which is outstanding for a business. Now okay, on some days, especially weekends, it won\u2019t be profitable. In some months, if you\u2019re in the absolute depth of the bear market, then it won\u2019t be profitable. But over a long period of time, it\u2019s extremely profitable.\n\nBlockworks: How important is this deflationary aspect of Ethereum and Ethereum\u2019s ability to generate fees? Because obviously Ethereum is not a company in the traditional sense where your revenues need to outweigh costs. So how should people think about revenue versus issuance? And how important is that metric as a way to gauge the success of the network?\n\nDrake: Broader than just as a company, some people think of ether, the asset, as money for the internet. And in that context, scarcity as a meme is extremely important. There\u2019s this almost obsession with the 21 million Bitcoin meme precisely because it\u2019s all about scarcity. And for the first time in history pretty much, we have money which not only has a fixed supply but actually has a decreasing supply.\n\nSo now there\u2019s what I call memetic potential. Memes are ideas that spread. The 21 million meme is one that spreads far and wide because it\u2019s kind of an attractive thing intellectually. There\u2019s an opportunity potentially for this meme to spread that ether is the scarcest money on Earth. Its supply is going down over time.\n\nBlockworks: And who benefits from this meme?\n\nDrake: Ether the asset is the basis of two very fundamental public goods in any programmable blockchain.\n\nPublic good number one is economic security. We\u2019re trying to build systems here which have a lot of longevity. We want to be in a position where it\u2019s extremely difficult even for the most powerful nation-states out there to attack Ethereum.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this second really important public good for blockchains which is called economic bandwidth, and that\u2019s the ability to be used as collateral within DeFi. Ether is especially valuable as collateral money because it\u2019s the only so-called pristine collateral. Pristine means that there\u2019s no contract risk. There\u2019s no governance risk. There\u2019s no oracle risk. It\u2019s the one risk free asset.\n\nBlockworks: It sounds like you\u2019re saying the idea of ultrasound money is a means to these larger ends that you described.\n\nDrake: Exactly. It\u2019s a Trojan Horse, but ultimately the value is utilitarian through economic security and economic bandwidth.\n\nBlockworks: Ethereum\u2019s validator queue has been in the hundreds of people waiting to stake ether (ETH), and that\u2019s down from tens of thousands over the summer and even into September. What do you make of this?\n\nDrake: The churn, which is basically the amount of validators that can be processed by the queue, is proportional to the amount of staked ETH. As the amount of staked ETH grows, the churn grows and it becomes easier and easier to clear the queue. And so in that sense, looking at the queue is kind of a totally irrelevant game. The fact that the queue is very low just means that ether is very efficient at processing deposits.\n\nThe better metric is what\u2019s called deposits. Every single day on average, there\u2019s 40,000 ETH coming in, which is a huge amount of money.\n\nBlockworks: How concerned are you about staking yields being down?\n\nDrake: I mean in a way, the lower the better, right? Because it means that we\u2019re not spending as much to secure Ethereum. Ethereum is already extremely secure.\n\nThe security ratio is the value secured by Ethereum, which is all the ETH, all the NFTs, all the ERC-20s divided by the value securing Ethereum, and it\u2019s 7.5, which is extremely healthy. If we were to have more staked ETH, this ratio would keep on going down. But there\u2019s no real need for that. And so having more staked ETH in the way is wastefully paying for security.\n\nBlockworks: Post-Merge, there was a lot of excitement about Ethereum. In 2023, ether\u2019s price has gone up, but especially compared to bitcoin, not as much as some had predicted. Why is that?\n\nRead more: The flippening: Will ether flip bitcoin in the next year?\n\nDrake: What tends to happen, generally speaking, is that during bear markets, dominance of bitcoin goes up, and then during bull markets, it drops down precipitously and then it reaches a new low, so this is all standard behavior.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll say is that bitcoin dominance hasn\u2019t grown as much as what would have been expected in the bear market. So I think expectations were unreasonable thinking that during a bear market, ether will outperform [bitcoin].\n\nThis is all speculation, but my guess is that there will be a flippening in the next bull run.\n\nInterview responses were edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has exhibited a promising technical development, igniting optimism within the crypto community.\n\nThe formation of a bullish flag pattern within the daily timeframe has captured the attention of analysts and traders, hinting at potential positive movements in the near future.\n\nA bullish flag pattern is a common technical analysis formation in financial markets, frequently visible on price charts. It involves an upward price surge (the flagpole) succeeded by a consolidation or sideways movement (the flag) within a downward or sideways channel.\n\nTypically identified within the daily timeframe, it signals recent upward movement followed by a consolidation phase. Traders and analysts keenly observe this pattern as it often implies a potential continuation of an upward trend.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the current recovery sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, as Ether managed to breach the upper trendline of the pattern earlier this week, pointing towards the possibility of a substantial upward surge.\n\nEthereum: Breakthrough Resistance\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has broken past a critical resistance level marked by the convergence of its 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). These EMAs hold paramount importance for traders and analysts, often serving as key indicators of market trends and momentum.\n\nThe successful breach of this resistance level further reinforces the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, indicating a potential shift towards a more robust upward trajectory.\n\nThe bullish flag pattern that has taken shape on Ethereum\u2019s price chart has been a long time in the making, spanning over a period of seven months. During this time, the price of ETH has fluctuated within the converging trendlines of the pattern, reflecting the market\u2019s indecision and the tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the upper boundary of the pattern has acted as a significant support level twice, underlining its influence in shaping market sentiment and price dynamics.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $1,883 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nMarket Insights And Caution\n\nAs of the latest market data provided by CoinGecko, the current price of Ethereum stands at $1,890, reflecting a modest 24-hour gain of 0.5% and a notable upward trajectory of 5.3% over the past seven days. These figures reaffirm the growing interest in Ethereum, highlighting the market\u2019s confidence in the coin\u2019s potential for further gains.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nIndustry experts and seasoned traders offer valuable insights into this recent development, emphasizing the importance of closely monitoring the price action and overall market sentiment surrounding Ethereum. With the bullish flag pattern hinting at a potential bullish continuation, market participants are advised to stay vigilant and consider the implications of this technical setup in their trading strategies.\n\nDespite the positive momentum, caution remains essential, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its inherent volatility and unpredictability. Investors and traders are advised to conduct thorough research, employ risk management strategies, and stay informed about market developments to make well-informed decisions in this dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum scaling solution builder =nil; Foundation has introduced zkSharding for Ethereum, the latest infrastructure attempt at gaining faster transaction speeds while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s economic security.\n\nSharding, unlike other popular scaling solutions, is designed to divide the Ethereum network into different sections and process transactions in a cheaper, more efficient manner.\n\nZkSharding utilizes zero-knowledge (zk) technology to generate proofs, ensuring that transactions are valid across different layer-2 shards before being submitted to Ethereum mainnet. The greater the sub-shards, the higher the maximum throughput on Ethereum.\n\nThis technique is not to be confused with Proto-Danksharding, which refers to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, and whose primary purpose is to reduce the costs of transactions for zk rollups by storing them in temporary data blobs, Misha Komarov, CEO and co-founder of =nil; Foundation told Blockworks.\n\nAll zk rollups can benefit from Proto-Danksharding, but only applications built on =nil; will be able to benefit from zkSharding on top of that, Komarov explains, noting that data-intensive environments and high-load environments will be able to benefit most from zkSharding.\n\n\u201cAs a zk rollup, =nil; benefits from Proto-Danksharding that cheapens storing transactions on Ethereum, however zkSharding as a scaling concept addresses fragmentation of liquidity and economic security,\u201d Komarov said.\n\nZkSharding represents a combination of modular and monolithic blockchain architectures and delivers an appropriate solution based on its features in a competitive layer-2 environment, he said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that zkSharding addresses the drawbacks common for other alternatives on the market that go, by design, with application-specific scaling,\u201d she said.\n\nSpecifically, Komarov notes that applications built on other zk rollups can only interact with liquidity or data that was migrated to its specific zk rollup environment, limiting market efficiency and creating additional trust assumptions and costs through bridges for interoperability.\n\n\u201czkSharding introduces separate shards as dedicated execution layers that are fully composable with each other, meaning a transaction can trigger the creation of new transactions on other shards,\u201d Komarov said.\n\nThe goals are familiar from other zk-based scaling approaches such as zkSync\u2019s, however. ZkSync terms chain connections using the ZK Stack architecture \u201chyperbridges,\u201d which are also designed to trigger transactions on other \u201chyperchains,\u201d a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cAs a rule, don\u2019t trust, verify the claims of those that promise to solve the layer-2 fragmentation of liquidity issues \u2014 even with cutting-edge zk tech, it\u2019s definitely not solvable for native assets without adding non-negligible security assumptions,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nFinding the proof in the pudding will have to wait in the case of the new =nil; layer-2, which is initially operating with a single shard on a testnet."

        "title": "Nil Foundation CEO on New Ethereum Rollup With Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Sharding - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Ethereum Research and Development Firm Mill Foundation says its new Ethereum roll up will be the first DK roll up that enables sharding. Joining us now is CEO and co-founder of Mill Foundation, Misha Komarov. Welcome to the show, Misha. Hey, it's like, thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. Now, let's talk about this. It combines zero knowledge proofs and sharding, explain what this problem solves. And just I want to put something into context here. Of course, developers watch our show, but we have a very broad audience. So talk to us about what this problem solves and how that relates to developers, but also uh other folks who are operating in this space. OK. Let's go into it. So basically, it's like what's the basic idea of the stink? The basic idea of this thing is to try to solve is to try to break the wall gardens of all the variety of different roll ups which have, which you know, which, which you know were brought up to life, which in the recent years. So basically right now we have a lot of the roll ups. They are all you know, like completely isolated from each other. And it's good if people, you know, it's good if people consider some particular one, like, you know, a good one, like a worthwhile one. And it's like, it's absolutely tremendous that there are whole ecosystems growing on top of them. But in the end of the day, there is a lot of them, they are isolated and we try to, we try to solve this issue, this modularity issue, this uh you know, World Gardens issue by basically bringing what Ethereum, you know what, what was an Ethereum? What was an Ethereum roadmap initially like, you know, long premise charting, we tried to bring it as a ZK roll of think which you know basically solves like which basically solves the modularity concept. Yeah, modulator concept. Drawbacks. That's it. All right, le le let's take it as another step further because that ee explain why that isn't why that's an issue uh for for the lay, for the lay person out there watching this. OK. Why this is an issue? So basically it's like the more the more liquidity fragmentation, the more security fragmentation you have basically what was like, OK. What what the hell is a modular concept, right? It's basically that you have one application, one roll up, that's what it is. And it's a good idea. But the problem is that how much of liquidity can the one can a single one application attract? And what if other applications can also make use of it by increasing the total, the total good of this liquidity, the total outcome of this liquidity from this liquidity. So this means that one application one roll up is might be, you know, not the best idea. OK. So we tried to, we tried to solve this issue so the liquidity and security could stay unified because for example, for lending protocols or like for swaps like different kind of swaps, it's like it's very important to keep the liquidity pools as deep as possible to keep the lending pools as large as possible because that's what defines their economic viability for the user. So that's what it is. We try to solve this issue is keeping liquidity unified. What's the difference? I guess from a developer's perspective, if we build on nil or another roll up like polygon, Zkevm or ZK sync or are they all kind of similar? Uh It's like, let's say it this way, it's like, it's like we target, it's like we target those kinds of applications, those kinds of applications which first of all, you know, very to liquidity fragmentation. So there wouldn't be a requirement for them to keep uh you know, to keep, to keep their liquidity, you know, split. That's the first thing, second thing we target those kind of applications which are, you know, high load applications, something like, you know, it's pretty obvious for everybody right now that, you know, high load applications, I don't know, autonomous worlds OK, autonomous actors. Vita likes to talk about that much or like, I don't know this kind of things, sequencers, builders, decentralized PB, all of these things are not possible to be built, you know, on Ethereum because of the way it is built. And that's the same thing. It's not possible to be. These kind of things are not possible to be built on top of traditional roll ups. So there are, there are intersections with traditional roll ups, of course, but there are parts of, you know, there are parts and segments of applications which are only possible on now. So we try to cover, we try to cover these two parts of markets. You mentioned high load and data intensive applications here. What kind of apps do you think will thrive most in this ecosystem, you mentioned autonomous worlds? But what do you envision what kind of apps living here? Well, first of all, it's like, it's like it's like the first kind of apps which first kind of apps which which I'm personally going to push forward is going to be first of all sequencers. And well, let's say it this way, I mean, obviously, obviously financial applications and things like this. But besides that, it's sequencers, it's anything related to building and minimizing the for the for the user in a decentralized and like, you know, open way. That's what I see, like, you know, right now, that's what I'm going to talk like, right now I'm going to push for it. OK? And obviously, if we're talking about like a lot more long term vision, uh I do support the vision that, you know, I will try to put shared state applications on top of this because that's what, you know, all of those autonomous worlds and autonomous actors are about. I mean, it's like that would be really fun to put up some, you know, autonomous actor to make it smarter than just, you know, trivial and then just trivial like Perron or something. So yeah, so I, you, you, you mentioned uh uh financial application. So for, for people in the financial service industry who might be watching this and, and don't quite understand exactly what this conversation is about. Can you lay it out for them? Explain to them how this, how this would affect them? OK. So basically uh how this particular architecture, how this particular approach affects uh financial applications. OK. Let's just take a look at, I don't know lending protocols or like different swaps. So let's say you have uh let's say you have some, I don't know Unis swap or something and let's say a liquidity in a particular pool on Ethereum is quite deep enough. OK? But it's expensive to use it for like in case you need to swap something often, I mean, really expensive to use it. OK. So what's the, what's the, what's the traditional solution? The traditional solution is you deploy the UNIS swap to like, you know, some roll up, you pay less for the gas fees. You can do it more often, but a little bit of a nuance. It's like the liquidity pool on the roll up is much smaller than on the Ethereum originally. And no matter how you try, it would be really hard for you to, for you to put that liquidity from Ethereum to some roll up and to make a roll up slit pool deeper than the the one. So that what the liquidity fragmentation does to you, you know, this kind of exchanges, this kind of exchange applications. So that's what it is. And obviously the deeper the liquidity pool is the it's like the smaller uh basically this, it's like the smaller um the smaller kind of OK. Well, basically the deeper the deeper liquidity pool is the more you can exchange it OK? That's like, you know, talking in basic terms. So that's what it is. It's like the less slippage is OK? So that's why this is important. This is, that's why the absence of liquidity fragmentation is important to financial applications like on the example of a unit world, for example. So basically, it's all about making a ba basically, it's all about increasing the efficiency of those. All right, Michelle, we got to leave it there, but very quickly before we go, I wanted to see if you have any comment about the news that came out on crack in this week. It said that they're seeking a partner to help build their lay two. And according to people familiar with the situation, the Mill Foundation is one of the partners. They're considering any comments on that. I knew this question would, would arise. Uh That's the first thing. Second thing I would say it's too early to say something or not to say at all. It's like, so let's, you know, let's just leave it there, let's just leave it there. I can't state anything about this currently. All right, Misha, thank you for that. It was a pleasure and congratulations on the upcoming launch. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Going To $5.8? Here\u2019re The Levels To Watch - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price is pulling back after taking a breather in the wake of the climb to $1,900 earlier this week. The prominent smart contracts token needs to sweep fresh liquidity preferably at $1,800; the immediate support. Traders may take this opportunity to lock in the gains, a move likely to trigger a larger sell-off.\n\nHowever, with a bull flag pattern validated on the weekly chart, investors do not need to panic, as the next rebound could overcome resistance at $2,000 and pave the way for gains to a new all-time high of $5,800, foreshadowed by the Finder\u2019s panel.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA higher support is anticipated above $1,800 as Ethereum collects liquidity for the next breakout above $2,000. For now, it might be prudent to let the consolidation play out before betting on either longs or shorts.\n\nEthereum Price Bullish Scenario \u2013 Bull Flag Pattern\n\nThe weekly chart highlights the formation and validation of a bull flag. This is a bullish flag pattern, formed by a couple of price rallies set apart by a consolidation period.\n\nThe flagpole represents the bullish muscle blindsiding sellers who then briefly assume control over the price (the channel), as profit-booking takes place, but eventually, the price breaks out to a higher level.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, the bull flag breakout has already been validated. However, due to the resistance at $1,900, buyers lack the momentum to complete the 49.44% breakout target of $2,678.\n\nWith Ethereum price holding above all three moving averages, including the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-week EMA, and the 200-week EMA, the uptrend has a higher chance of resuming than a correction taking place below $1,800.\n\nTraders should be on the lookout for how Ethereum price responds to the support provided by the 100-week EMA (blue) at $1,806. A retest of this support could prove highly bullish and trigger a larger breakout.\n\nHowever, trading below $1,800 might be detrimental to ETH price as it may discourage traders from booking new long positions afraid of capitulation. Below $1,800, the next key support areas are the 50-week EMA (red) at $1,757 and the 200-week EMA (purple) at $1,633.\n\nFinder Analysts Predict Ethereum Price Rise To $5.8k By 2025\n\nFinder, a platform that brings together predictions from different industry leaders, has predicted a potential surge in Ethereum price to $5,800 by 2025.\n\n\u201cOn average, our panel thinks Ether (ETH) will be worth US$1,840 by 2023 before rising to US$5,824 by 2025 and then US$14,411 by 2030,\u201d Finder\u2019s latest report states.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is expected to close the year at $1,840 based on the average prediction of the panel of 31 crypto industry specialists. The panel appears to have changed its tune toward the bearish side, following a previous optimistic prediction of $2,451 in July.\n\nMost panelists believe that \u201cETH has a huge growth potential\u201d especially with the growing interest in \u201cEthereum staking and [ETH\u2019s] exceptional low inflation rate\u201d which points to a potential short squeeze likely to culminate in a remarkable upside in the ecosystem, believes Ben Richie, the managing director at Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd.\n\nHowever, some specialists like Ryan Grace, the head of tasty tastycrypto said that like Bitcoin price, Ethereum price is bound to encounter macro headwinds which could limit its upside action in the short-term, especially with the Federal interest rates above 5%.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "The association behind Aragon (ANT), a decentralized governance platform on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, is dissolving.\n\nThe Aragon Association (AA) says in a new announcement that it will deploy 86,343 ETH worth about $163 million to offer Ethereum redemptions for ANT holders.\n\nAccording to the statement, holders of the governance token may redeem their coins at a fixed rate of 0.0025376 ETH per ANT.\n\nExplains the association,\n\n\u201cThe AA arrived at the best redemption rate it could achieve for all ANT holders by identifying the most compliant and tax-efficient path forward allowing for the continuation and protection of the project. This decision could not be put to a public vote due to legal constraints, specifically regulatory risks triggered by token speculation and market manipulation.\u201d\n\nAragon aimed to serve as a framework for building decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Its native token, ANT, allows users to vote on proposals.\n\nThe AA says tensions within the project pushed the association into a rushed effort to vest control of the treasury directly to ANT holders.\n\n\u201cHowever, too few ANT were in the hands of users, partners, and builders after years of product pivots, and a volatile gap existed between the value of the treasury and the token market cap. This put Aragon\u2019s mission in jeopardy.\n\nRather than continuing down the current path, after several months of deep introspection, we have concluded that the shaky foundations underlying the current structure cannot be fixed and have been holding back the project for too long. Neither the AA nor ANT are currently suited to govern the project.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the ETH redemptions, the AA says it will commit $11 million to cover its outstanding obligations and combat regulatory issues. The association also says it plans to \u201ccontinue the mission in a product-focused structure.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Following the slight recovery in the general crypto market, altcoins like Ethereum Classic are also rising. With the rising bullish momentum in the market,, ready for a massive rally in the coming weeks.\n\nThis analysis will provide insights into Ethereum Classic\u2019s potential price trajectory from 2023 to 2030. Furthermore, we\u2019ll give detailed information on what can affect Ethereum Classic\u2019s price soon.\n\nHowever, remember that these projections are based on actual market behavior. Let\u2019s explore the potential scenarios for Ethereum Classic\u2019s journey over the next seven years.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nBased on the daily chart, the Ethereum Classic token has breached above its bearish trendline . Currently, the token is testing support at $15 and trying to rally its price above the 20 and 50-day MA indicators.\n\nTesting the $15 support: Ethereum Classic\u2019s price recently went down , but it successfully reached the $15 level. If it can retest this level, it might surpass its average price and start going up.\n\nLimited Near-term Growth: Right now, it seems challenging for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price to increase significantly in the short term.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum: Ethereum Classic\u2019s price tends to follow Ethereum\u2019s price closely . Sometimes, it even reaches new highest values before Ethereum does.\n\nGood news in 2024: In 2024, important events are happening in the cryptocurrency world that can benefit Ethereum Classic. Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrade and Bitcoin\u2019s Halving event could positively affect Ethereum Classic\u2019s price.\n\nDecentralization Matters: If people start talking more about decentralization in the blockchain world, Ethereum Classic might become more popular because it\u2019s known for being decentralized. This could lead to more interest in Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction Summary for 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nYear Maximum Price Average Price Minimum Price 2023 $15.50 $15 $14.72 2024 $100 $48 $15 2025 $387 $210 $120 2030 $860 $690 $520\n\nEthereum Classic Price History\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is a cryptocurrency that emerged from a hard fork of the Ethereum network in July 2016. The split resulted from a disagreement within the Ethereum community following the infamous Decentralized Autonomous Organization incident.\n\nThe DAO was a smart contract-based investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain but fell victim to a critical vulnerability. This led to a massive Ether (ETH) theft in July 2016, which resulted in a drift in the community.\n\nSome community members advocated a hard fork to reverse the transactions and recover the stolen funds. In contrast, others believed in preserving the immutability of the blockchain, arguing that \u201ccode is law.\u201d\n\nThose who adhered to the latter viewpoint continued with the original Ethereum chain, which became Ethereum Classic. Following the split from Ethereum in 2016, the project needed to establish its value.\n\nThis was done by listing ETC on two cryptocurrency exchanges on July 20, 2016. CoinMarketCap started recording the price of Ethereum Classic on July 24, 2016.\n\nAt that time, one unit of Ethereum Classic traded at $0.7523. This initial price helped set the foundation for ETC\u2019s value in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSince its beginning, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price has closely followed its counterpart, Ethereum. It reached its all-time high of $176.16 in May 2021.\n\nBefore a significant upgrade on Ethereum in September 2022, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price rose from $14.20 to $41.59. However, by the end of 2022, it settled back around $15.\n\nFurthermore, in 2023, the Ethereum Classic\u2019s price has been unstable, bouncing between $15 and $23. Remember, these values can change rapidly due to the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Classic has since developed its ecosystem, community, and development teams. It shares many similarities with Ethereum, including its smart contract capabilities, but operates independently with a separate token, ETC.\n\nDespite facing various challenges and controversies, Ethereum Classic has demonstrated remarkable resilience. This is a testament to the diverse range of ideologies within the blockchain space.\n\nKey Points in Ethereum Classic Price History\n\nThe Ethereum Classic is a fork of the Ethereum chain. It split from Ethereum due to a hack in July 2016.\n\nStart Date and Initial Value (July 24, 2016): Ethereum Classic\u2019s price history began on CoinMarketCap on July 24, 2016, with an initial value of $0.7523.\n\nPrice Tracking with Ethereum: Since its inception, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price movement has closely mirrored that of Ethereum, its sibling cryptocurrency.\n\nAll-Time High and Current Status: Ethereum Classic achieved its highest price of $176.16 on May 06, 2021. As of today, it has decreased by 90.47% from this peak.\n\nThe Merge and Price Movement: Leading up to The Merge, a significant upgrade on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic experienced more considerable percentage gains than Ethereum.\n\nIts price surged nearly 193%, rising from $14.20 to $41.59. This surge was because many miners expected to shift their support to Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic shares many similarities with Ethereum, including its smart contract.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Current Price & Stat\n\nIt started the year at $15.69 and is currently at $15.21, marking a decrease of over 34%. Also, in the last 30 days, the coin has been down by 2% and around 7% in the past 14 days trading session.\n\nHowever, in the past hour, there\u2019s a sign of a favorable market as the coin is rising gradually by almost 1%.\n\nBased on its market cap of more than $2 billion, Ethereum Classic is ranked #28 amongst other crypto assets. According to CoinGecko, the trading volume is at $130,977,163, an increase of 97% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInterestingly, despite its bearish momentum, the coin is still massively above its all-time low by 2,372.71%.\n\nCurrent Market Status\n\nCurrent Price $15.22 24-Hour Price Change -0.06% 24-Hours Trading Volume $130,977,163 (97.50%) Market Cap $2,175,151,142 Current Ranking #28 Circulating Supply 140 Million tokens All-Time High $167.09 (May 06, 2021) All-Time Low $0.615038 (July 25, 2016)\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2023\n\nSince the start of 2023, the price of Ethereum Classic has ranged between $15 and $23. The price is now lower than at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, toward the end of September, there was a significant shift in its price performance. Importantly, Ethereum Classic has breached the solid bearish trend and is forming a new positive trendline.\n\nA rapid climb above key indicators marked this positive trend, the 50-day and 20-day Moving Averages (MAs). Following this positive move, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price climbed to $16.71.\n\nSubsequently, the price dipped below the Moving Averages and is now testing the $15 support level. This level may serve as a turning point, where the price could stabilize or begin to rise again.\n\nNotably, if the Ethereum Classic token could build up intense energy to stay above this support and maintain the trendline for a few days, we can likely see a bullish move.\n\nBased on this, we anticipate the price of Ethereum Classic to reach a high of $17 or an average of $15.50. However, if Ethereum Classic\u2019s price faces challenges at the MAs, it may fall back to $15 since investors are willing to buy the coin at this price.\n\nMeanwhile, if the support doesn\u2019t hold or the momentum is not strong, it could trigger further downward pressure on the coin. If both the lack of support at $15 and the MAs resistance persist, it could create a bearish market sentiment.\n\nImportantly, this could send the price of Ethereum Classic to a low of $14.72.\n\nEthereum Classic must overcome significant challenges and obstacles to record substantial price gains. Based on this, we predicted that Ethereum Classic\u2019s price will stay relatively high.\n\nInstead, it could trade within a narrow range from now to the end of 2023. The projected range is between $15.50 (the highest it might go) and $14.72 (the lowest it might reach).\n\n2023 Price Prediction Maximum Price $15.50 Minimum Price $14.72\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2024\n\nDue to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving set to occur in April 2024, there are high expectations of a crypto bull market. The Bitcoin Halving is an event that slashes the rewards miners receive for verifying transactions in half.\n\nImportantly, this event happens approximately every four years.\n\nBased on historical price moves, the price of Bitcoin tends to increase due to this event steadily. Since Bitcoin is the mother of altcoins, its price movements often have a ripple effect on the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nRecall that in the last bull run, which started around the time of the previous Bitcoin Halving, ETC reached an all-time high of $176.16.\n\nEthereum Classic needs a well-defined roadmap for its future development, making it challenging to predict (DeFi) ecosystem developments that could impact its future price. Also, the coin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because it has never had a formal roadmap.\n\nThis sets Ethereum Classic apart from crypto assets that face scrutiny when they lack a clear plan for their future. Therefore, Ethereum Classic experiences less pressure on its price due to the absence of a roadmap.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum Classic closely watches Ethereum\u2019s price. Ethereum will start testing some significant improvements related to scaling in late 2023, which they call proto-dank sharding. They plan to implement these changes in 2024.\n\nIf all goes well, this could increase Ethereum\u2019s price, and Ethereum Classic will likely increase. Ethereum Classic will apply these changes to its system about 3 to 6 months after implementing them on Ethereum.\n\nConsidering all this, our prediction for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price in 2024 is optimistic. It could reach as high as $100, with a potential year-end fee of $48. At the start of the year, it might be lower, around $15.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2025\n\nIf a strong market trend begins in 2024 due to Bitcoin Halving, it\u2019s likely to continue into 2025. During this time, many coins might reach their highest-ever prices.\n\nIn the past, Ethereum Classic has often followed a similar pattern to Ethereum, sometimes even hitting new high prices before Ethereum does.\n\nConsidering Ethereum\u2019s growing popularity and role as the second cryptocurrency, it\u2019s expected to hit a new all-time high in the next bull market.\n\nAlso, ETH could increase significantly with its rise as a preferred proof-of-stake coin and a limited supply asset in the last year.\n\nBased on our projection of Ethereum\u2019s price increasing by 120%, we anticipate Ethereum Classic could reach a top price of $387 in 2025. The lowest price might be around $120, while the average price could be about $210.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction 2030\n\nMany things can influence what might happen to Ethereum Classic\u2019s price in 2030. One major factor is whether cryptocurrencies become widely used by then.\n\nImportantly, if more people start using cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s good news for all crypto, including Ethereum Classic. Additionally, Ethereum Classic could benefit from the growing interest in decentralized solutions, leading to high demand that could drive prices higher.\n\nThe following sections will show that Ethereum Classic is the original, unchanged version of Ethereum. This means that if trust in centralized systems decreases, Ethereum\u2019s history might make people favor Ethereum Classic instead.\n\nEthereum Classic usually follows a similar path as Ethereum, adopting similar upgrades a few months later. This makes it easy for apps and services to switch to Ethereum Classic, potentially bringing more users and increasing demand.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a concern about how people view proof-of-work blockchains due to their environmental impact. This issue might not improve by 2030. This could lead Ethereum Classic to go in its own direction, separate from Ethereum.\n\nConsidering all this, our guess for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price in 2030 is that it might hit new highest prices, going as high as $860. Meanwhile, the lowest might be around $520, and the average price could be about $690.\n\nPotential Highs & Lows of the Ethereum Classic Price\n\nEthereum Classic wants to be like Ethereum, but it has its own story. Even though it\u2019s a separate coin, it follows the price of Ethereum closely.\n\nWe have to think about what\u2019s happening with Ethereum to guess what might happen to Ethereum Classic. Here\u2019s a short overview of our guesses about Ethereum Classic\u2019s price.\n\nYear Potential Low Price Average Price Potential High Price 2023 $14.72 $15 $15.50 2024 $15 $48 $100 2025 $120 $210 $387 2030 $520 $690 $860\n\nOther Analysts Prediction on Ethereum Classic\n\nDifferent sources have another prediction on Ethereum Classic\u2019s future price:\n\nFirstly, the Cryptopolitan thinks Ethereum Classic might reach $50.94 in 2025 and $317.96 in 2030. Also, by 2032, they predicted the coin to achieve a high of $705.99.\n\nAccording to Changelly, it could hit a high of $317.93 by the end of 2030, with an average price of $237.65.\n\nFurthermore, Wallet Investor has a less optimistic view, suggesting it might drop much in value to around $0.195 by October 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, Coincodex believes it could reach $33.57 in 2025 and $34.98 in 2030. They also expect $74.29 in 2024 and $100.97 in 2028 due to the Bitcoin Halving.\n\nTraders Union has more moderate predictions, estimating prices of $20.54 in 2025 and $33.14 in 2030.\n\nRemember, these predictions above are based on assessments and forecasts made by various sources. They are speculative and do not guarantee ETC\u2019s future performance.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Classic and its Uses?\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is an open-source, decentralized, and blockchain-based computing platform and cryptocurrency birthed due to a hard fork from the Ethereum blockchain in 2016.\n\nOrigin of Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic originated from the Ethereum blockchain conceived by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation and launched in 2015.\n\nEthereum Classic was created after The DAO hack in 2016, which resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether. The dispute caused a split in the Ethereum community, with the majority choosing to reverse the hack.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic is a decentralized platform that uses smart contracts embedded within a distributed ledger. Smart Contracts are self-executing autonomous digital applications, based on the principle of \u201cCode is Law,\u201d which can run on their own as programmed.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Classic Used?\n\nThe ETC or Ethereum Classic asset facilitates payments for decentralized computations on the Ethereum network. The project aims to develop a global payment network based on smart contracts that can operate with no centralized authority.\n\nEthereum Classic, like other cryptocurrencies, will aspire to be a digital store of value, meaning you can save and exchange it while maintaining its weight.\n\nWhat are the goals of Ethereum Classic?\n\nEthereum Classic aims to provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can run on a blockchain. Ethereum Classic aims to provide a secure and decentralized platform for developing smart contracts.\n\nIt aims to provide a platform for developing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nHow is Ethereum Classic Different from Ethereum?\n\nEthereum Classic and Ethereum are similar in terms of basic functionalities. Developers can use the open-source code to develop and run their apps.\n\nEthereum Classic preserves the old code of the Ethereum blockchain as it was until the DAO attack. People often regard it as the \u201coriginal\u201d Ethereum crypto. Ethereum Classic is an attempt to preserve the originality of Ethereum.\n\nFactors Influencing the Price of Ethereum Classic?\n\nDue to the relationship between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, ETC\u2019s price is influenced mainly by the cost of Ethereum. This means that when Ethereum makes any significant move, it affects the price of Ethereum Classic.\n\nSimilarly, the upcoming Bitcoin Halving could influence the price of the general crypto market. Importantly, this bullish move is estimated to continue until 2028. As a result, altcoins like ETC could record new all-time highs.\n\nFurthermore, public statements about Ethereum Classic could significantly impact the coin\u2019s price. For instance, in 2022, a significant endorsement from Vitalik Buterin led to a 20% increase in Ethereum Classic\u2019s price.\n\nHe recommended Ethereum Classic for those who prefer a system called proof-of-work. Buterin states, \u201cIf you like proof-of-work, you should use Ethereum Classic.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, as the Ethereum Classic community and its uses expand, the coin becomes more valuable and attracts more users. Note that when more people actively use it, it encourages others to join in, increasing the demand for the coin.\n\nThis growing activity and interest contribute to potential price movements.\n\nEthereum Classic has been a victim of a series of attacks. This affected its price significantly, dropping from $7.40 to $5.12 in 2020.\n\nIs Ethereum Classic a Good Token to Buy?\n\nBased on this analysis, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price might remain unchanged. The coin may likely finish this year trading around $15.\n\nHowever, in 2024, things could get interesting. With the Bitcoin Halving and upgrades on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic could reach $100.\n\nAs we head into 2025, during a period of solid growth in the crypto market, it might reach as high as $387. By 2030, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price might surge massively, hitting the $860 level.\n\nRemember, these are just projections, and many things can change. The crypto market can be very unpredictable, so prices could go down instead, leading to potential losses.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s strong connection to the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, brings positive vibes to its future predictions despite initial doubts due to its name.\n\nSticking to its current proof-of-work consensus mechanism might pose challenges ahead. Yet, if the importance of decentralization grows, Ethereum Classic could stand out as a preferred choice, mainly due to its compatibility with Ethereum.\n\nKeep in mind that the future of any cryptocurrency can be uncertain, so always approach with caution and do thorough research."

        "content": "CELESTIA POSTSCRIPT: Rarely are blockchain projects alone in the pursuit of hot new ideas. That's true of the au courant rush by various efforts to provide \"modular\" solutions for handling the various tasks of a blockchain, including the job of \"data availability,\" which involves managing growing reams of data and efficiently providing it to users or applications when requested. The data-availability network Celestia dominated the headlines last week, especially with the buzzy airdrop of TIA tokens garnering interest from crypto traders. This week, a rival project, Avail, announced a new incentive program on a test network to encourage early adopters to \"battle-test our code base.\" And Near Foundation, hosting an annual conference this week in Lisbon for the layer-1 blockchain NEAR Protocol, announced its own plans to offer a data-availability network for the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite the interest from solutions providers, early usage of Celestia appears to be modest so far. Galaxy Research's Christine Kim wrote in a newsletter on Nov. 3: \"Now that Celestia has launched, the true value of the protocol will come from the rollup ecosystem that is created over the next few months and years on top of Celestia. The adoption of the rollups built on top of Celestia will dictate the revenue and long-term success of the protocol, and ultimately, prove (or disprove) the blockchain modularity thesis. \""

        "content": "Investigations have uncovered the mysterious owner of a crypto wallet that lost the keys to a $450 million fortune in Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to Coinbase director Conor Grogan, the owner of this wallet is Rain Lohmus, co-founder of LHV Bank. The wallet contained as much as 250,000 ETH, most acquired during the coin\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014.\n\nOne mystery solved: This address (which now holds $450M of crypto) belongs to Rain Lohmus, founder of LHV Bank Unfortunately he lost his keys and can't access these 100s of millions. If you can help him recover them somehow, he's willing to split them with you https://t.co/wYLAU9gKzb pic.twitter.com/0A1nIjFSyn \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) November 6, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRain Lohmus and Recovery Strategy\n\nLosing the keys to wallet addresses is not uncommon in the crypto ecosystem. Infact, according to a computation made by Conor, a minimum of 909,800 ETH with a valuation of over $1.73 billion remains lost on-chain. This accounts for 0.73% of all circulating Ethereum supply.\n\nOne distinguishing trait of Rain Lohmus is that he has chosen not to give up on the push to recover the asset. He has a strategy to power the recovery, but according to what appears as an interview excerpt shared by Conor, he wants as much help as he can get, from anyone.\n\nWhile he said he\u2019s open to any offers from the public on how to recover the funds, he revealed his best plan is to build \u201cRain Lohmus\u201d as an AI to see if his memories can come back to remember the lost keys.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDaunting as this task is, the LHV Bank founder said he takes it easy on himself. Lohmus acknowledged the possibility of spending a decade trying to hack this challenge and achieving zero results. Based on this, he said he\u2019d rather embrace solutions where he can get visible progress daily.\n\nFor anyone who can help him recover the funds, Lohmus plans to split the funds as compensation.\n\nOnly Untouched ICO Wallet for Now\n\nRecently, we have seen some Ethereum ICO wallets coming alive, but Conor noted that in his research, the Rain Lohmus wallet remains the only address from this era that has stayed dormant.\n\nBased on previous discoveries, the wallet acquired $75,000 worth of ETH at the 2014 ICO and has never made a single transaction. The wallet, over the years, received an intriguing bonus worth $6.5 million just for HODLing, the earlier acquired ETH."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is once again the talk of crypto, and its native coin SOL is benefiting from the attention. The price of SOL is up over 9% today, hitting a 24-hour high of $44.41.\n\nOver the past 30 days, it has exploded in value by over 88%, according to CoinGecko\u2014making it the biggest winner of all the major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd despite its association with the collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its criminally convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried, experts say Solana\u2019s recent rise shouldn\u2019t come as a shock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWidely considered a competitor to Ethereum, Solana aims to be the go-to network for on-chain applications and experiences. Ethereum proponents argue that the leading smart contract network offers greater stability and security, but Solana is objectively cheaper and faster for those wanting to build or use lending protocols, games, and other applications that utilize blockchain technology.\n\nSolana gas fees right now stand at $0.000522; to make a transaction on Ethereum, it costs $6.58 on average.\n\nFor this reason, Solana has grabbed the attention of Visa, Shopify, and developers wanting to build on the network.\n\n\u201cSolana adopts a streamlined approach, emphasizing high base layer throughput while simplifying the developer experience,\u201d portfolio manager at Yield App Akash Mahendra told Decrypt, highlighting how much data can be processed by the blockchain.\n\nMahendra added that major partnerships and institutional interest are also helping drive up the price of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that Solana was getting a bad rep. FTX, once one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the crypto space, was heavily invested in Solana.\n\nEx-FTX boss and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a prominent Solana supporter, and the company invested in numerous Solana-related projects. FTX launched a marketplace for Solana NFTs, and even co-created Serum, which at one point was considered a foundation of the Solana DeFi space. At its peak in 2021, Solana commanded a market cap of $78 billion and boasted a $10 billion DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFTX then collapsed in a highly publicized bankruptcy while holding over $1 billion in SOL. The cryptocurrency plunged as a result.\n\nBut big players still see real value in the project.\n\nIn August, Solana\u2019s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain. This collaboration \u201ccapitalized on Shopify\u2019s influential 10% share in the U.S. online retail sector, which translates to an estimated $444 billion in global transactions,\u201d according to Mahendra.\n\nThen, payments giant Visa announced in September that it had chosen Solana\u2019s blockchain for its stablecoin ambitions. This, according to Solana Foundation\u2019s head of strategy Austin Federa, \u201cvalidates the importance of the network\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability.\u201d\n\nThese two moves were seen as bullish by investors who have since been plugging fresh cash into the project. And things really picked up in the last month.\n\nPatrick Felder, founder & CIO at Prismatic Capital, told Decrypt this was because when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market started rallying, SOL was the most deeply oversold asset in the space following news that FTX\u2019s new management might sell off large amounts of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this, according to Felder, was \u201cmassively overblown\u201d FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and \u201ctriggered a massive short squeeze.\u201d In the world of trading, a short squeeze is when the price of an asset shoots up unexpectedly due to short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) exiting their positions.\n\nThis happened with SOL, according to Felder, as many had bet on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX trial hurting the asset's price.\n\nThe Solana community\u2019s annual conference, Breakpoint, took place at the end of October, leading to an even bigger rally, added Felder.\n\nThe irony is that at Breakpoint last year, the price of SOL had plunged by 60% in the week following the FTX crash. Spirits were low. But now, the coin has made a stunning comeback.\n\nAs always the question is, will it last?\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Stratis Community Votes In Favour Of Move To Ethereum Blockchain - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "Stratis today announces the launch of StratisEVM \u2014 a new layer one blockchain built on Ethereum. Under the plans, Stratis will bring its expertise, products and community of developers to the Ethereum ecosystem and retire the existing Stratis blockchain.\n\nThe plan is designed to accelerate innovation by making it easier to develop blockchain solutions using more widely available tooling and the interoperability capabilities inherent to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nStratisEVM is a Web-3 ready Ethereum-based proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, featuring the native $STRAT token. StratisEVM will be a layer one blockchain, with plans to also introduce a layer two to deliver high-throughput and low finality decentralised computing. These advanced capabilities are specifically designed to support gaming and DeFi applications.\n\nCommunity voting on the proposal has just concluded following a two-week voting period. The Stratis community overwhelmingly backed the new plans with a near unanimous vote of 99.3% in favour.\n\nThe decision to launch StratisEVM is based on the following advantages it will bring to the developer, user and wider communities:\n\nIntegration\n\nChoosing an Ethereum-based framework over a bespoke platform offers immediate integration with a robust and well-established ecosystem.\n\nWorking with the Ethereum codebase means teams building on StratisEVM benefit from continuous upgrades and innovations developed by the largest decentralised developer community.\n\nThe core Stratis team will no longer need to commit such significant resources to building and maintaining developer toolkits designed for the Stratis blockchain. Instead they can focus on improving interoperability and performance in-line with the project\u2019s priority areas: gaming, DeFi, NFTs and enterprise.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe shift to an Ethereum-based framework opens doors to enhanced interoperability and compatibility with numerous existing decentralised applications (dApps) and protocols.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain hosts a multitude of dApps, ranging from decentralised exchanges to lending platforms, which StratisEVM can interact with or utilise for added functionality and value creation.\n\nEstablishing such a wide range of interactions and partnerships on the existing platform has been challenging for Stratis and required additional development of complex and bespoke protocols.\n\nFamiliarity\n\nDevelopers are more likely to build applications on a platform that offers familiar tooling. Ethereum dominates blockchain market share and moving to the ecosystem will boost developer activity.\n\nUnder the plans, existing $STRAX token holders can exchange their tokens for the new $STRAT at a rate of 1:10. For every 1 STRAX issued on the Stratis blockchain, there will be 10 STRAT tokens issued on the StratisEVM, bringing the token supply to just over 1.53B.\n\nThe original Stratis blockchain was launched in 2016 and since that time new use cases have emerged that require micro-payments. The token supply is being increased by 1:10 to make the token more useful for these new use cases, in particular gaming.\n\nStratisEVM will feature a masternode contract that will enable new and existing masternodes to lock their collateral and continue to receive rewards as they do on the current blockchain. During the StratisEVM launch, Stratis will honour reduced collateral requirements for the original masternode operators (pre-STRAX) who remain federation members.\n\nChris Trew, co-founder and CEO of Stratis, said: \u201cSince 2016 our focus has been the delivery of a Microsoft-focused blockchain platform. However, Ethereum has grown exponentially, with record-breaking usage and capitalisation. We felt it was time to retire the Stratis blockchain so we can spend less time building tooling and more time optimizing the Ethereum infrastructure for new use cases like gaming and DeFi. It\u2019s encouraging to see the community support for the new plans and we\u2019ll be bringing a lot of experience, dApps and developers across to the Ethereum community.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are continuing with our roadmap, including our NFT marketplace \u2018Stratisphere\u2019, our NFT ticketing application \u2018Ticketsphere\u2019 and plans to issue the first regulated GBP Stablecoin. We are particularly excited about the surge in mobile gaming and look forward to supporting upcoming projects via the new StratisEVM blockchain.\u201d"

        "content": "The Ethereum network has usually been criticized for the number of failed transactions that occur on it and how it leads to users losing their money as a result of this. This onslaught was recently renewed after a figure in the crypto community showed the staggering amount that has been lost from failed transactions.\n\nETH Users Lose Over 100,000 To Failed Transactions\n\nIn a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the Marketing and Communications Director of Blockstream, Fernando Nikoli\u0107, shared a screenshot that showed that Ethereum users had lost over $100,000 due to failed transactions. Interestingly, the $100,000 value happened to be only for the top 10 transactions in the screenshot, with Nikoli\u0107 noting that there were other ones.\n\nFrom the screenshot, one can see how a particular user lost over $38,000 in gas fees from a single transaction. The second user on the list lost over $17,000 in gas fees, with others on the list also losing thousands of dollars in gas fees despite the fact that the transaction failed. Usually, gas fees paid on the Ethereum network are gone forever, irrespective of whether the transactions succeed or fail.\n\nNoteworthily, eight out of the transactions from the screenshot occurred back in May during the period of the frenzy around the meme coin PEPE, which caused an unusual surge in traffic on the Ethereum network.\n\nFailed transactions are known to occur rampantly during such periods because a surge in activity on the network leads to a significant increase in gas fees, with some users falling short of the required gas fee (at the point of executing their trade) needed to process a transaction, which causes it to fail.\n\nETH price steady at $1,880 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCoordinated Attack On Ethereum?\n\nIn his post, Nikoli\u0107 referred to the failed transactions on the Ethereum network as \u201chot garbage.\u201d Although his post could just be about a concerned member of the crypto community calling out the network, it bears mentioning that he happens to be the second Bitcoin maximalist calling out the network in the space of a week.\n\nAnother Bitcoin maximalist, Bit Paine, had earlier suggested that the network was a scam.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has made serious allegations of fraud and corruption against the platform's co-founders.\n\nThe allegations are yet to be proven.\n\nAnother aspect of criticism concerns Ethereum's alleged connections to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nJust as we were emerging from the shock of the FTX verdict, an explosive revelation shook the cryptocurrency community, casting a long, dark shadow over Ethereum.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, has made serious claims of fraud and corruption against the platform\u2019s co-founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, which could be more significant than past crypto scandals.\n\nUnderstanding the Shocking Allegations\n\nNerayoff\u2019s recent claims threaten to damage Ethereum\u2019s reputation, raising questions about its integrity.\n\nHe claims that the fraudulent activities related to the Ethereum blockchain by its founders are \u201c1000x bigger\u201d than those of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no solid evidence yet, the seriousness of Nerayoff\u2019s accusations is magnified by his deep understanding of Ethereum\u2019s inner workings due to his prior advisory role. This is a reason for concern.\n\nThe FTX fraud case dealt a heavy blow to investor confidence, involving the misappropriation of $8 billion in customer funds. The guilty verdict against Sam Bankman-Fried underlines the seriousness of the incident, making a striking contrast with the unproven allegations against Ethereum\u2019s founders.\n\nRead More: Here\u2019s How Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Risky Moves Led to Million in Losses\n\nHere We Go Again!\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Nerayoff has accused the ETH founders, hinting at a possible personal vendetta as part of the ongoing narrative.\n\nEarlier slanders about character assassination plots and allegations of collusion with high-profile US officials tarnish Ethereum\u2019s reputation, regardless of the accusations\u2019 veracity.\n\nEthereum and the \u2018Hidden Centralization\u2019\n\nAnother aspect of criticism arises from Truth Labs, suggesting that Ethereum may have compromised its decentralized values by forming connections with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nEthereum's hidden Centralization problem:\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a growth mood, with Bitcoin leading the charge in a post-FTX recovery era. Investor confidence is buoyed by the prospect of central bank policy shifts and the potential introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to a market cap rebound above $1 trillion. Amidst this revival, Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC), showed marginal growth in the past month but slowed down considerably during the last week. Monero (XMR) is not doing well, despite the current market mood.At the tail end of this lineup, ScapesMania is carving out its niche. With a successful presale and a focus on integrating gaming with crypto, it\u2019s poised to capture the attention of investors looking for the next breakout star in the cryptocurrency constellation.\n\nIs there hope for Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Litecoin (LTC) to resume their rapid expansion, or will their growth rate continue to decelerate? Can we really predict the results for ScapesMania? Will Monero (XMR) have a chance to experience a similar expansion in the future? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nSummary\n\nScapesMania : With its innovative approach to gaming and crypto, ScapesMania\u2019s successful presale positions it as a potential market sensation.\n\n: With its innovative approach to gaming and crypto, ScapesMania\u2019s successful presale positions it as a potential market sensation.

Similar to Ethereum Classic (ETC), this coin did not perform too well during the past week. Monero (XMR): Despite a recent security breach, Monero (XMR) maintains its bullish undertone and privacy appeal, but there are no clear signs of growth in lieu of the market\u2019s overall trend.\n\nScapesMania (MANIA): New Crypto Innovation\n\nMany crypto experts pick ScapesMania as the best new project of 2023 and beyond. It manages to separate itself from the competition by offering holders a multitude of revenue streams and high potential ROIs during presale.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCompanies and individual crypto traders looking for fast potential gains should definitely look into ScapesMania\u2019s proposition. Once the presale finishes, the price will soar, securing possible returns in the range of 400-500%. Right now, there\u2019s an active discount of close to 85%, but it won\u2019t last forever \u2013 the clock is ticking and all interested in leveraging this offer need to act fast.\n\nWhen dissecting the tokenomics and other features of ScapesMania, it becomes clear that it\u2019s the best altcoin to hold now. The innovative gaming-related core idea, impressive presale numbers, $150,000 giveaway, undying social media hype, and other positive aspects can guarantee that ScapesMania will continue on its winning journey, so it makes sense to get involved as soon as possible.\n\nJoin Presale at a Discount on the Official Site\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC): Course for a Potential Uptrend\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is currently navigating through a high time frame range, with its price oscillating between $14.70 and $27.73. The market is witnessing a descending triangle setup on the daily chart, which traditionally bears a downward bias.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) has recently breached the descending triangle setup, indicating a potential rally. This technical pattern suggests a near 30% upswing to the $20.59 level, calculated by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily timeframe is above 50, reinforcing the likelihood of this bullish scenario.\n\nThe forecast for Ethereum Classic (ETC) is cautiously optimistic, with the technical setup favoring an uptrend. For this to materialize, Ethereum Classic (ETC) must surmount the immediate hurdles at $17.15 and $19.99 to reach the anticipated target of $20.59. From its current position, this would represent a significant gain. However, should the price fall below the $14.70 support, a bearish outcome could ensue, potentially leading to a 30% correction towards $10.36.\n\nLitecoin (LTC): Celebrating Milestones\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has recently celebrated a significant milestone, marking its 12th anniversary with a record-setting network hashrate, which is a testament to the network\u2019s security and robustness. This achievement underscores the growing adoption and usage of Litecoin (LTC), as evidenced by the network facilitating over 180 million transactions to date.\n\nDespite these achievements, the price of Litecoin (LTC) has been consolidating within a specific range since August. The bulls have faced resistance, particularly at the $72.45 level, which has been a tough nut to crack. This resistance level is crucial as it represents a barrier to the asset\u2019s upward movement, with the price recently retracting to $69.44.\n\nThe future price movement for Litecoin (LTC) is intriguing, with the coin showing both promise and resistance. The market has demonstrated a keen interest in Litecoin (LTC), with spikes in address activity and whale transactions indicating a potential for increased market movement. However, the resistance levels at $80.10 and $93.06 remain formidable challenges. Should Litecoin (LTC) overcome these, it could pave the way for further gains, aligning with its strong market fundamentals and recent network achievements.\n\nMonero (XMR): Security Concerns\n\nMonero (XMR), the cryptocurrency synonymous with privacy and security, recently faced a significant challenge. A security breach in the community crowdfunding system (CCS) wallet led to the theft of 2,675.73 Monero (XMR), valued at approximately $384,000. This incident has raised concerns among investors.\n\nThe price of Monero (XMR) has been fluctuating within the range of $153 to $183, with a 10-day moving average of $170 and a 100-day moving average of $151. These averages indicate a relatively stable market sentiment, with the price maintaining above the 100-day moving average, suggesting a bullish undertone.\n\nThe future of Monero (XMR) price is a blend of technical resilience and market confidence. The support levels at $103 and $133 provide a strong foundation for the currency, while resistance levels at $194 and $224 represent the thresholds for potential growth. The recent security breach, while concerning, has not directly impacted the privacy mechanisms of Monero (XMR), which remain intact and continue to be a key selling point for the cryptocurrency.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market\u2019s revival is setting a dynamic stage for various coins, each with unique challenges and opportunities. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is on the cusp of a potential rally, Litecoin (LTC) is at a crossroads of consolidation and breakout, and Monero (XMR) is testing the waters of investor trust after a security hiccup.\n\nMeanwhile, ScapesMania is gearing up to disrupt the market with its novel gaming-crypto fusion. The project is set to break records after its presale finishes and the 500% ROI seems to only be just the beginning.\n\nWebsite\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram"

        "content": "Tue 07 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nSteven Nerayoff, a former advisor to Ethereum, has publicly accused the founders of Ethereum of fraud. According to his allegations, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, two iconic figures in the crypto industry, were conducting fraudulent activities 1,000 times larger than SBF. The founder of FTX, now convicted, orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. But what are the reasons behind these accusations? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum founders accused of fraud\n\nSteven Nerayoff declared on X (Twitter) that the Ethereum fraud is 1,000 times greater than that of SBF. As a reminder, the FTX case is one of the biggest financial frauds in the crypto industry. Sam Bankman-Fried was implicated in numerous crimes, including the misappropriation of customer and lender funds. This led to the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX and his trading company Alameda Research.\n\nEthereum is the fraudulent elephant in the room in plain sight 1000x bigger than SBF. Joe Lubin & Vitalik Buterin have been the front with corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies such as Clayton, Gensler & many others. Cover this now. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 2, 2023 Steven Nerayoff on X (Twitter)\n\nThe FTX founder was convicted on all seven federal counts and faces a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison. He was charged with money laundering, securities fraud, wire fraud and more. Considering the frauds committed by SBF, it\u2019s hard to imagine anything worse. Yet Steven Nerayoff claims otherwise, revealing that Ethereum\u2019s founders are major fraudsters.\n\nAllegations of corruption within the SEC\n\nAccording to this former Ethereum advisor, Ethereum\u2019 s founders have allegedly bribed SEC officials. Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin provided cover for corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies. In particular, he cited Clayton, Gensler and many others. This would have given the project an unfair advantage on the crypto market. Ethereum executives gave bribes to the SEC to turn a blind eye to the network\u2019s ICO, he said. Ethereum could thus escape charges of violating securities law.\n\nHowever, Nerayoff provided no substantial evidence to support his allegations against Ethereum\u2019s founders (ETH). Moreover, his reputation for distorting the truth undermines the credibility of his information.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $2,000 Level Comes into Play \u2013 Best Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has risen to $1,885 today, marking a 1% gain in 24 hours and a 4.6% increase in the past week.\n\nETH\u2019s trajectory has been upwards for several weeks now, with the altcoin also up by 18% in the last 30 days, helped by increasing market-wide bullishness.\n\nYet as the market moves into a possible bull market next year, what\u2019s especially encouraging about ETH is that it remains 61% down from its all-time high, meaning it has plenty of space for further gains.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $2,000 Level Comes into Play \u2013 Best Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nEthererum\u2019s indicators continue to suggest that the altcoin could rise further in the coming days and weeks.\n\nMost bullishly, its 30-day average (yellow) is rising rapidly towards its 200-day average (blue), and when it overtakes the longer term average it could signal another breakout.\n\nLikewise, ETH\u2019s RSI (purple) remains at 70, which suggests that the coin is enjoying good buying pressure yet hasn\u2019t moved into overbought territory.\n\nThe coin\u2019s support level (green) provides another bullish sign, in that it has reached higher levels in the past couple of weeks, each of which have held up against dips.\n\nAs such, ETH is likely to continue rising over the short- and medium-term, and even if it wobbles a little here and there it\u2019s likely to continue climbing for the next few months.\n\nThis is partly because the entire market is due a more bullish phase, with the next Bitcoin halving likely to increase positivity when it arrives in 2024.\n\nHistorically, #Bitcoin bear & bull markets have all taken a similar amount of time. This time around though, it seems that we're ahead of the curve, breaking key levels long before the halving event. Will we top out earlier too? pic.twitter.com/edcNJ2GKma \u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) November 8, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s also because ETH itself remains one of the strongest altcoins in the market in terms of fundamentals.\n\nMost of the cryptocurrency industry and ecosystem revolves around the Ethereum blockchain, which accounts for more than half of the sector\u2019s entire total value locked in, and close to two thirds of this total if you include layer-two networks.\n\nOn top of this, it seems that big companies tend to go for Ethereum when using or trialling blockchain technology, as evidenced by the likes of Visa and PayPal.\n\nThis would imply that Ethereum is only likely to strengthen its position in the next few years, especially when it has transitioned to a proof-of-stake mechanism and is working on new scalability updates.\n\nAnd in turn, this is only likely to increase demand for ETH, which could reach $2,000 in the next few weeks.\n\nPromising New Altcoins\n\n\n\nThe only issue with ETH is that, as a well-established token, it may not experience massive surges during the next bull market.\n\nFor that, traders will probably need to look towards newer coins, with a variety of promising new presale tokens currently available.\n\nOne of the most promising of these is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a tokenized cloud mining platform that has raised more than $3.6 million in its sale.\n\nRecognising a significant accomplishment for #BitcoinMinetrix! \ud83c\udf1f Exceeding the $3,600,000 milestone! pic.twitter.com/jC0RxzqnTu \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) November 7, 2023\n\nDue for launch in the next few weeks, Bitcoin Minetrix is a stake-to-mine platform.\n\nWhat this means is that users can mine actual Bitcoin by staking the platform\u2019s native token, BTCMTX.\n\nBy staking BTCMTX, users receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can use to pay for cloud-based miners to mine BTC on their behalf.\n\nStaking more BTCMTX increases the amount of BTC users are likely to receive, and given that stakers will also receive fresh BTCMTX, Bitcoin Minetrix could be a very profitable platform.\n\nDelving into $BTC mining alongside #BitcoinMinetrix! \ud83d\udd0d#Cloudmining opens the door to the world of #Crypto: \ud83d\udca1 Simple start for novices.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Economical without hardware costs.\n\n\ud83c\udf03 No concerns about space, noise, or overheating.\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Hassle-free upgrades. pic.twitter.com/N3zwTDRYjq \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) November 7, 2023\n\nThis possibility largely explains why its presale is doing so well, with new investors able to join proceedings by going to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\n1 BTCMTX currently costs $0.01150, yet this will rise to $0.01190 by the sale\u2019s final stage.\n\nOf course, once the token lists on exchanges, it could rise much higher than this, making its early investors a good profit.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Breakthrough Heralds Massive Reversal: Bull Market Start? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) showcases a breakthrough that could signify the beginning of a bullish reversal. A close examination of the ETH price chart reveals a decisive move above a crucial resistance level, potentially marking the onset of a wider market recovery.\n\nEthereum's price has recently surged past the resistance highlighted by the convergence of its 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), represented by blue and red lines, respectively. This technical event is significant; such crossovers are keenly watched by traders and typically interpreted as strong bullish signals, especially when accompanied by increased trading volume.\n\nThe positive sentiment around Ethereum is not an isolated phenomenon. Historically, ETH's market movements have had a consequential impact on the altcoin sector, with its rallies often igniting uptrends across various alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis correlation can be attributed to investor psychology, where confidence gained from Ethereum's gains spills over to other crypto assets, coupled with Ethereum's foundational role in supporting numerous projects and decentralized applications.\n\nThe potential for a bull market in the wider cryptocurrency space is underpinned by Ethereum's role as a market leader. As ETH breaks through key resistance levels, it could set a precedent for other digital assets to follow.\n\nShiba Inu needs more\n\nDespite its cult-like following and fervent social media activity, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has yet to breach the elusive $0.000009 mark. A closer look at SHIB's price action and external market conditions reveals the triad of resistance the meme coin faces on its upward journey.\n\nFirst, the inability of SHIB to break through the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands as a stark testament to the strength of this technical resistance level. The 200 EMA, represented by the black line on the daily chart, is a critical indicator that traders monitor to gauge long-term market sentiment. In SHIB's case, this line has acted as a formidable barrier, rebuffing the asset's attempts to establish higher ground. Each approach toward this moving average has been met with rejection, indicating bearish sentiment among investors and traders alike.\n\nAdding to this technical hurdle is the robust performance of alternative digital assets. Investors, driven by a risk-reward calculus, are often lured away by cryptocurrencies that offer not only greater stability but also promise higher returns.\n\nLastly, the lack of significant movement by whales has resulted in a scarcity of market-moving events for the token. Whales have the power to sway market dynamics drastically by either injecting optimism through large purchases or triggering sell-offs. The absence of such activity creates a stagnant market environment where the price lingers in a narrow range.\n\nTurning to the daily chart, the price of SHIB has recently made a bullish crossing over of the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, shown in blue and red, respectively. This crossing can typically be interpreted as a bullish signal. However, the price encounters resistance every time it tries to advance further, aligning with the 200 EMA. The recent trading volumes show sporadic spikes but lack consistent growth, echoing the hesitation on the market.\n\nCardano finally meets resistance\n\nAs Cardano (ADA) enthusiasts witness a dramatic ascent in the coin's value, the market speculates about where this momentum might finally meet resistance. Based on the current price chart, there appears to be a significant level that could halt Cardano's impressive rally.\n\nThe critical resistance level that stands out on the daily chart is at the intersection with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), shown as the bold black line. This level has historically been a turning point for many assets, acting as a steadfast barrier to bullish runs. For ADA, this line suggests that while the coin's momentum is robust, there may be a forthcoming struggle to push through this line.\n\nRecent movements have been notably bullish for Cardano. The price has surged upward in a steep incline, which is evidenced by the sharp angle of the green candlesticks against the backdrop of previous price action. This sort of price movement is emblematic of strong buying pressure and surging interest from investors. The volume bars, which have seen a substantial increase, support the intensity of the current run."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their bullish momentum on Thursday as the oldest crypto asset hit a 17-month high after the Fed's dovish tone. Crypto tokens posted big gains following the completion of one year of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire- FTX exchange.\n\nBitcoin was trading in red as the largest crypto token edged marginally lower, less than half-a-per cent but remained below 35,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in green, slightly up and hovered around $1,900-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with decent gains.\n\nBitcoin kept on trading in a very narrow range of less than 2 per cent movement in the last 24 hours. It has now been close to two weeks. Although this means volumes in Bitcoin worldwide have started to slightly drop, any movement in its prices should mean the volumes are back in, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\"While BTC has been rising for a few weeks now, the ETH/BTC pair has seemed to find a little support around the 0.05 BTC per ETH mark. The little bounce back has helped other prominent altcoins as well to show some momentum on the upside price action,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, altcoin BLUR (+18.1%) has seen a positive price action in the last 24 hours. This could be as investors speculate it to be the world\u2019s biggest NFT marketplace by trading volumes, especially after Opensea downsized by letting go of 50% of its staff recently\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Tuesday. Chainlink was up 6 per cent, while Toncoin surged more than 5 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon rose 4 per cent each, while Cardano and BNB added over 3 per cent each. Among the laggards, Tron was down a per cent.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading modestly higher, rising up to $1.33 trillion-mark, as it rose marginally in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes increased more than 6 per cent to $40.46 billion.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, both BTC and ETH remained steady, while altcoins saw a rise of 5-10 per cent. This was accompanied by a decline in BTC dominance. Bitcoin is currently positioned between important support at $34,000 and resistance at $36,000, while Ethereum still has to clear a significant resistance level around $2,000, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\"The market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, reached nearly $400 billion, marking a positive sign for the crypto space. It's worth noting that tomorrow, on November 8, 2023, Fed Chair Powell will deliver a speech, which could potentially introduce some market volatility,\" he said.\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe Graph(GRT) is an indexing protocol, catering to data querying needs in networks such as Ethereum and IPFS. It plays a pivotal role in numerous applications within the DeFi sector and the larger Web3 ecosystem. Currently, GRT extends its support to the indexing of data from Ethereum, IPFS, and POA, with plans to include additional networks in the near future.\n\nImage: Chart-Graph\n\nOn the weekly time-frame, the GRT/USDT chart had been traversing within an ascending triangle pattern. The trend has bounced back from the bottom and is fast approaching the upper trendline with twice its average trading volumes. We could expect the momentum to continue into the coming weeks. The next resistance is expected at 0.17 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 0.12 USDT.\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Failed Transactions Result in Major User Losses \u2014 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nEthereum\u2019s network of decentralized applications and smart contracts frequently faces criticism for its high rate of failed transactions, which result in substantial losses for users. According to November 7 data shared by Fernando Nikoli\u0107, the Marketing and Communications Director at Blockstream, Ethereum users have lost over $100,000 in just the top 10 failed transactions on the network.\n\nThe High Costs of Failed Transactions on Ethereum\n\n\n\nThe staggering losses were revealed in a post on Nikoli\u0107\u2019s X (formerly Twitter), where he referred to the failed Ethereum transactions as \u201chot garbage.\u201d The top failed transaction resulted in a loss of more than $38,000 in gas fees for a single user. The second-highest failed transaction led to a loss of over $17,000 in gas fees. The remaining failures in the top 10 list also showed users losing thousands in gas fees.\n\nThroughout this year, Ethereum has seen upwards of $100,000 lost due to failed transactions, with a single failed transaction costing a user $38,000+ What kind of hot garbage is this? pic.twitter.com/i8fA7IPOf9 \u2014 Fernando Nikoli\u0107 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83d\udfe0 (@basedlayer) November 7, 2023\n\nUnder Ethereum\u2019s structure, gas fees paid for transactions are non-refundable regardless of whether the transactions succeed or fail. This means that when transactions fail on Ethereum\u2019s network, any gas fees paid are lost permanently.\n\nNikoli\u0107\u2019s data draws attention to the losses from transaction failures at a time when traffic on Ethereum spiked in May during a surge in activity around the meme coin PEPE. Increased congestion on the network tends to correlate with a dramatic increase in gas fees. Some users can fall short of having enough gas to process their attempted transactions, leading to rampant failures.\n\nThe Ethereum Criticism Continues\n\n\n\nNikoli\u0107\u2019s harsh criticism of Ethereum follows similar condemnation by other Bitcoin proponents recently. Bit Paine, another Bitcoin advocate, referred to Ethereum as a scam just last week. He argued that the network had facilitated the creation of numerous \u201cdigital penny stocks\u201d in the form of tokens he deems unregistered securities.\n\nA brief history of the rise and fall of ethereum: Guy tries to scam people with \u201cquantum computer emulator.\u201d Rightly fails. Moves on to next scam: \u201cworld computer\u201d \u2013 would have failed except\u2026 It turns out to have one *very potent* use case: a platform for easily creating and\u2026 \u2014 Bit Paine \u26a1\ufe0f (@BitPaine) November 4, 2023\n\nWhile the two critics come from a similar maximalist perspective favoring Bitcoin, their scrutiny spotlights some of Ethereum\u2019s main struggles \u2013 failed transactions and questions around proper token registration. Despite the drawbacks, Ethereum is still the second-largest blockchain network behind Bitcoin, valued at over $226 billion as of writing.\n\nNonetheless, the users losing thousands due to the network\u2019s structural limitations present a pain point the Ethereum community cannot ignore. As activity spikes again, similar to last May\u2019s meme coin mania, the losses from failed transactions will likely plague the network again soon. The developers and researchers behind Ethereum\u2019s roadmap may need to prioritize solutions to the transaction failure rate to avoid preventable losses."

        "content": "Compared to gold, investing in Ethereum (ETH) has proven more lucrative in 2023. That is according to a recent BanklessTimes.com data presentation. The news site reports that ETH returns outperformed gold by nearly 40%. This finding has caught the attention of industry players, including the outlet\u2019s crypto expert, Alice Leetham.\n\nLeetham emphasized shifts in investor sentiment and the pull of blockchain technology as crucial factors behind ETH outperforming gold. She further pointed out its growing adoption in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as a catalyst for its growth.\n\nShe said:\n\nEthereum's outperformance of gold this year is a clear demonstration of the changing investment landscape. Digital assets like ETH are becoming increasingly attractive to investors seeking high returns as the world embraces blockchain technology and DeFi\n\nAlice explained that the surge in DeFi projects running on the Ethereum network has attracted vast sums of capital and users. These, in turn, have contributed to its growth as a financial hub.\n\nOther Factors Behind ETH's Stellar Performance\n\nFurthermore, Alice suggested that Ethereum's blockchain remains the go-to platform for minting and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). From digital art to collectibles and virtual real estate, NFTs have ushered in a new tokenization era. The blockchain\u2019s NFT ecosystem has attracted artists and investors, further driving ETH\u2019s value.\n\nMoreover, the network\u2019s upgrades, including its transition to Ethereum 2.0, have enhanced scalability, reduced energy consumption, and improved security. These upgrades have instilled confidence in developers and investors, bolstering the platform's long-term viability.\n\nAgain, global economic trends have favored digital assets in 2023. Uncertainty in traditional financial markets and concerns about inflation have driven many to seek alternative investments. Thus, cryptocurrencies like ETH are becoming increasingly attractive as a hedge against economic instability.\n\nImplications of Ethereum's Rise\n\nIn Alice\u2019s view, Ethereum's outperformance of gold has far-reaching implications. On the face of it, It underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investments, potentially threatening traditional assets.\n\nShe held that Investors are increasingly turning to digital assets as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty\u2014one significant factor explaining that shift is their versatility over the rigidity of precious metals.\n\nPrized for its scarcity and time-tested worth, gold has traditionally been considered the ultimate store of value. However, ETH and other cryptocurrencies are beginning to challenge this age-old belief. As a decentralized digital asset, ETH has shown it can serve as a store of value not limited by physical constraints.\n\nMoreover, ETH\u2019s liquidity and portability make it a more flexible asset for cross-border exchanges. Besides, its network's security, transparency, and robust infrastructure boost its credibility as a store of value."

        "content": "Ethereum has seen a tremendous uptrend as prices soared high from $1,577.81 to $1,892.37 in the past 2 weeks. With a performance of 2.31% in 7 days, it might be a good idea to know whether the price of Ethereum will continue to go up or adjust lower. Will Ethereum price go higher? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction article.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Why is Ethereum UP?\n\nLast week, rumors surfaced regarding the Bitcoin ETF approval, and Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory has benefited from the speculative buzz. Despite the lack of confirmation, Ethereum\u2019s prices have maintained a higher threshold, signaling renewed hope in the crypto market. The buying power alone was sufficient to propel prices upward. In the past month, Ethereum has seen a price increase of approximately 19.94%, with its market cap now standing at a robust $227.35 billion. Over the last 7 days, Ethereum has slight growth, with a 2.31% increase.\n\nIs Ethereum Coin a Good Buy Today?\n\nEthereum lagged for quite a while, with prices consolidating for more than two months. The market witnessed a hard crash, with Ethereum reaching its lowest price of the year at $1,523.24. However, with the current market trend pointing upwards, it could be a strategic move to invest in Ethereum. The support price of $1,800 seems to be a strong foundation for ETH, suggesting that now might be an opportune time to buy.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ethereum reach $2,000?\n\nWhile it might be a bit too late for Ethereum\u2019s prices to reach the all-time high price of $4,800 within the remaining two months of the year, positioning oneself around the support areas could be wise. With a potential target of $2,000 on the horizon, buying at current levels could be beneficial and bring in a hefty 5% return before 2024.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum?\n\nBitget stands out as a viable platform to purchase Ethereum. Known for its security and user-friendly interface, Bitget makes starting your cryptocurrency investment journey straightforward. To buy Ethereum on Bitget, simply create an account, complete the necessary KYC procedures, deposit funds, and execute your purchase.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Coin?\n\nEthereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a platform for decentralized applications (DApps). It aims to create a decentralized suite of financial products that anyone in the world can freely access, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or faith. This aspect makes the implications for those in some countries more compelling because those without state infrastructure and state identifications can get access to bank accounts, loans, insurance, or a variety of other financial products.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "In a stunning revelation, Rain L\u00f5hmus, the founder of Estonia-based LHV Bank, has been unveiled as the owner of an Ethereum wallet holding a colossal $470 million worth of Ethereum. The intriguing twist to this story is that L\u00f5hmus has lost access to his crypto fortune, leaving him unable to recover or manage his holdings, a director at Coinbase, Conor Grogan said on the X platform.\n\nA Closer Look Into The Incident\n\nBack in February 2023, Conor Grogan brought attention to an Ethereum wallet that had remained dormant since the cryptocurrency\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Notably, this wallet had accumulated a staggering $470 million worth of ETH, despite never being used for a single transaction.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, in his latest post on November 7, Conor Grogan took to X to share a crucial piece of information. In a recent interview with ERR News, L\u00f5hmus publicly acknowledged that he is the owner of the aforementioned Ethereum wallet. Unfortunately, he disclosed that he had lost the keys required to access this vast fortune.\n\nL\u00f5hmus is now faced with an extraordinary predicament on how to regain access to hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. In his interview, he expressed his openness to collaborating with anyone capable of helping him recover his locked holdings, even offering to share the recovered funds.\n\nAlso Read: Bitget Announces Plans to Invest Strategically In India-Based Start-Ups\n\nA Costly Oversight\n\nThe LHV Bank founder\u2019s story is a testament to the unpredictable nature of the blockchain world. Having originally purchased 250,000 ETH during the Ethereum ICO for just $75,000, he now faces the consequence of losing the keys to a wallet that, at its peak, was worth a staggering over $1.2 billion.\n\nNotably, in the ever-evolving crypto landscape, this situation serves as a stark reminder of the need for secure and accessible storage solutions for digital assets.\n\nWith a remarkable 628,757% gain on his investment and a previous mention of $6.5 million worth of airdrops in Grogan\u2019s earlier post, L\u00f5hmus\u2019s Ethereum wallet remains a testament to the immense potential and challenges faced by early cryptocurrency adopters.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency community will watch closely to see if anyone can assist him in reclaiming his digital fortune, showcasing the interconnected and community-driven ethos of the blockchain space.\n\nAlso Read: Avalanche Parent Cuts Staff By 12%, Shifts Focus to Core Activities"

        "content": "\"While it cannot be ruled out that another bug or unintended consequence of an upgrade may happen, we do think the probability of such an event is much lower as the network has become more resilient, and more developers continue to work on it over time. We think the probability is also lessened as the Bitcoin code is completely open source, so anyone from large companies to independent software engineers can view and test it. We also note that if another bug is discovered, it is likely that those with vested interest and large holdings of bitcoin and equipment (miners, etc.) will be incentivized to work together to quickly fix it. Nevertheless, we do think this is a criticism that is worthy of consideration and investors should assign a non-zero chance to the possibility of a severe enough bug in the core Bitcoin network that could cause its value to decline, possibly precipitously.\""

During ETH\u2019s ICO, the asset sold for a mere $0.31 per coin. L\u00f5hmus paid around $75,000 for the 250k ETH. Fast forward to 2023, the value of the holding is a whopping $470 million, a growth of around 628,757%.\n\nHowever, things did not end well for L\u00f5hmus\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) holdings. Unfortunately, the banker lost access to his private keys. The development was shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) by Coinbase director Conor Grogan. Grogan had previously highlighted the whale wallet in February 2023. Grogan noted that the wallet had not made a single transaction, and its value had grown 5333X. Moreover, it received $6.5 million via airdrops alone.\n\nWhen ETH reached its all-time high of $$4,878.26 on Nov. 10, 2021, L\u00f5hmus\u2019s holdings were worth an eye-watering $1.22 billion.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) Set for 55% Surge After Key Technical Breakout, as Supply Turns Deflationary, Says This Well-Known Analyst\n\nFamous crypto data analytics firm Matrixport\u2019s head of research Markus Thielen argued in a recent report that Ether (ETH) could be set for a more than 55% surge to $3,000.\n\nEther is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization after Bitcoin (BTC) and powers the Ethereum layer-1 smart-contract-enabled blockchain, which remains the most widely used blockchain in the DeFi, NFT and broader web3 industry.\n\nIn a recently published note on defiontarget.com, Thielen pointed out that Ether appears to have now broken to the north of its downtrend from the yearly highs, and also pointed out that Ethereum network activity has improved in recent weeks, leading to the Ether supply turning deflationary once again.\n\nThielen\u2019s analysis included a chart showing that Ether appears to have broken to the north of a pennant structure that it had been in the throws of forming since late 2022.\n\nMoreover, he argued that \u201crevenues for the Ethereum ecosystem are bottoming out from depressed levels\u2026 (which) this could signal a tradeable bottom for ETH\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile revenues have only climbed back into the summer 2023 range of $30 million in weekly fees, the shocking number of just $12.1 million during the week of October 9 might be behind us\u201d.\n\n\u201cA tactical bullish trade could have merit for as long as weekly Ethereum fees stay above $30 million,\u201d he added.\n\nAs per TokenTerminal, the Ethereum network generated fees of around $36 million last week.\n\nThis recovery in network fees means a higher ETH burn rate (the majority of Ethereum network fees are burnt).\n\nIndeed, as per Glassnode, the Ether inflation rate recently hit its lowest level since August of -1.2%, having recently been as high as 0.3% in early October.\n\nThat should boost optimism that, assuming network activity remains healthy, Ether should remain a deflationary asset, boosting its long-term value proposition to investors.\n\nIf Ether was to hit Thielen\u2019s target of $3,000 per token, that would mark a surge of more than 55% from the current price just below $1,900.\n\nEther (ETH) to Outperform Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\n\n\nBitcoin has increased its market dominance over Ether in the last few weeks amid optimism about potential near-term approvals of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the US, which are anticipated to attract substantial capital inflows from the traditional finance industry.\n\nAfter trending lower for most of 2023, with Bitcoin also benefiting from safe-haven demand given its status as crypto\u2019s oldest, most trusted and (arguably) most decentralized cryptocurrency, the ETH/BTC exchange rate fell rapidly in October to hit its lowest levels since June 2022.\n\nBut this exchange rate recently rallied back to the north of its 21DMA, a sign of a potential turn around.\n\nThielen argued in his latest note that Ether trading volumes are also catching up to Bitcoin, which potentially \u201csupports the view that altcoins could outperform\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin traded as much as 3x the volume of ETH in mid-October, this ratio has also dropped to just 2x\u201d.\n\nIf Thielen is right about a possible near-term surge in the ETH price to $3,000, then ETH/BTC could very well rise back towards resistance in 0.058 area in the near future.\n\nBut if Bitcoin continues to lead the broader market rally amid optimism about upcoming spot Bitcoin ETFs, and Ethereum network activity once again falls back, then a retest of the 2022 lows under 0.05. remains on the cards."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has witnessed a remarkable surge of 7.4% in the past 24 hours, reaching $2,023 since April 2023.\n\nThis surge in Ethereum\u2019s value closely mirrors the recent upward movement of Bitcoin (BTC). It coincides with reports indicating that BlackRock, a renowned asset manager overseeing $9 trillion in assets, has registered an Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\nBlackrock Ethereum ETF On The Horizon?\n\nBlackRock made significant waves earlier this year when it submitted a filing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSubsequently, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust successfully obtained registration, solidifying the firm\u2019s presence in the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\n\nNevertheless, the possibility of BlackRock filing for a spot Ether ETF has been a subject of discussion among industry experts for some time.\n\nThe registration of the Ether Trust by BlackRock reinforces the firm\u2019s confidence in the long-term potential and impact of Ethereum, further strengthening its position within the digital asset industry and, as already seen, can significantly boost the price of ETH.\n\nETH Prepares To Break Key Price Range\n\nIn recent weeks, ETH had been consolidating between $1,800 to $1,890, as observed between October 24 and November 8.\n\nHowever, according to crypto expert Scott Melker, once Ethereum fully breaks and consolidates above the $2,000 to $2,100 range, a significant surge in price can be expected, indicating positive market sentiment.\n\nAs BlackRock continues to explore digital asset services and the potential for an Ether ETF, market participants will closely monitor the developments in the regulatory landscape.\n\nApproving an Ether ETF in the United States would provide investors with a regulated and accessible investment vehicle, potentially expanding the reach of Ethereum and validating its long-term growth potential.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Rain L\u00f5hmus, the founder of Estonia\u2019s LHV Bank, has reportedly lost access to a digital fortune. The banker\u2019s crypto holdings, a staggering 250,000 units of Ethereum (ETH), are currently out of reach due to a misplaced private key. The value of this digital cache stands at an estimated $470 million, a sizeable asset that has remained untapped since the early days of Ethereum\u2019s introduction to the market.\n\nConor Grogan, a notable figure at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, shed light on this digital enigma through a recent social media update. Grogan pointed out that the ETH trove, belonging to L\u00f5hmus, has been dormant since Ethereum\u2019s inception. The news swiftly captured the attention of the crypto community, with many highlighting the potential and pitfalls of blockchain technology\u2019s security features.\n\nDespite the vastness of his digital wealth, L\u00f5hmus openly admitted in a conversation with ERR that the access codes to his wallet elude him. He has not invested substantial effort into their recovery. Yet, he extends an open invitation to those skilled enough to unlock his digital vault, offering a share in the bounty as a reward for their services.\n\nL\u00f5hmus\u2019 current predicament underscores a recurring challenge he faces: the misplacement of passwords. This incident casts a spotlight on the inherent vulnerabilities that can accompany the use of blockchain technology. Despite this, it\u2019s clear that L\u00f5hmus\u2019 initial foray into cryptocurrency, with an investment of just $75,000, has seen an astronomical return, rising in value by over 628,000% since Ethereum\u2019s early days.\n\nMoreover, at Ethereum\u2019s peak market price in November 2021, L\u00f5hmus\u2019 holdings would have scaled the heights of $1.22 billion. Even with the market\u2019s fluctuations, the current valuation remains impressive. Additionally, Grogan\u2019s previous insights revealed that L\u00f5hmus\u2019 wallet had also accrued $6.5 million from airdrops, further adding to the untouched wealth.\n\nThe narrative around lost or inaccessible crypto assets is not unique to L\u00f5hmus. Ledger\u2019s recent introduction of a cloud-based key recovery service called Ledger Recover speaks to a broader issue within the cryptocurrency community. Developed in response to criticism and demand, the service, supported by blockchain protection platform Coincover, offers a subscription-based seed phrase recovery solution. This move by Ledger aims to mitigate the risk of loss in an industry where billions in value lie dormant due to misplaced access credentials.\n\nIndeed, research from Glassnode suggests that nearly 10% of the entire Bitcoin supply might be irretrievable, with other sources suggesting figures as high as 25%. This represents a significant portion of digital assets that potentially reduce the circulating supply of these currencies."

With a hoard of 250,000 ETH, now valued at a colossal $474 million, Lohmus\u2019s misfortune becomes a matter of public intrigue, as noted in a tweet:\n\nOne mystery solved: This address (which now holds $450M of crypto) belongs to Rain Lohmus, founder of LHV Bank Unfortunately he lost his keys and can't access these 100s of millions.

Yet, despite the stunning value appreciation, these digital funds remain out of reach\u2014a locked safe without a key.\n\nCompounding the awe surrounding this untouched Ethereum wallet is the fact that it has accumulated more than $6 million in airdrops. These bonuses, awarded simply for holding ETH, have further swelled the already bulging crypto vault.

In a world where cryptocurrency and technology merge in unforeseen ways, Lohmus\u2019s challenge underscores the dramatic narrative of loss and potential recovery within the digital age.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, the plight of Rain Lohmus serves as a stark reminder of the importance of safeguarding digital assets. In an era where the line between the physical and virtual continues to blur, Lohmus\u2019s story is not just a lesson in asset security but also a beacon of hope for those who believe in the power of technology to overcome even the most daunting of hurdles.\n\n."
