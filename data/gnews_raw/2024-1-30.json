        "content": "Ethereum developers have successfully deployed the Dencun update to the Sepolia testnet.\n\nThe hard fork includes several tools that are designed to reduce fees on the Ethereum blockchain, while additionally providing new opportunities for bridges and stabilization funds.\n\nThis was not the first attempt to deploy the update to the test network, however, as developers did not provide launch details, but noted that Sepolia has been updated to Dencun.\n\nSepolia has finalized! \ud83c\udf89\n\nSorry for an uneventful upgrade\ud83d\ude04 https://t.co/86HXWRGO7a \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) January 30, 2024\n\nDencun is also implementing proposal EIP-4844, known as \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d It is designed to scale the network by creating a new transaction type to store more data. The developers expect that the update will reduce transaction fees in second-level (L2) networks based on roll-up technology.\n\nYou might also like: Speed vs decentralization: could L2 solutions undermine cryptocurrency core ethos?\n\nTo further reduce fees and increase transparency, proposals EIP-1153 and EIP-4788 are provided, which are also included in the upcoming hard fork.\n\nHowever, the previous launch attempt was unsuccessful. On Jan. 17, ETH developers launched the Dencun hard fork on the Goerli testnet. However, the update could not be completed due to the synchronization of validators, with approximately one fifth of operators not having updated software.\n\nInitially, on Dec. 22, 2023 the Ethereum team announced that they were going to update Dencun on the Goerli testnet.\n\nThe update was initially launched on the Goerli test network, then deployed to Sepolia and Holesky within two weeks. If all stages are successful, Dencun will appear on the mainnet in February 2024.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Coming Ethereum Upgrade - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH-USD) dominance as the leading smart contract and Web 3.0 platform is facing its most significant test yet. The upcoming Deneb/Cancun upgrade could once again revolutionize interest in this token. However, it\u2019s also an upgrade that comes with some element of risk. Thus, it\u2019s wise to align your portfolio to benefit from any potential impact of this upgrade, and do so in a way that limits your downside exposure.\n\nThe main feature of this upgrade is called proto-danksharding. In plain English, this scaling solution should make Ethereum layer 2 rollups much faster and cheaper to use. For those unaware, rollups move computation and data storage off the main Ethereum chain. However, these computations still retain the underlying security and decentralization Ethereum provides.\n\nProto-danksharding allows large blobs of transaction data to be stored briefly on the main chain, just long enough for validation, before getting passed along to rollups. This eliminates the need for expensive calldata that has previously congested the Ethereum network.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the upgrade could be a huge boost for many Web 3.0 projects built on smart contracts or reliant on transaction speeds, Web 3.0 assets remain highly speculative. As such, I only recommend allocating a small portion of your crypto portfolio to chase the upside in these tokens.\n\nWith that said, here are three cryptos to buy ahead of this major upgrade.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the dominant smart contract and Web 3.0 ecosystem, Ethereum has the most to gain from its ambitious Deneb/Cancun upgrade. While the upgrade aims to solve Ethereum\u2019s nagging fee issues, Vitalik Buterin has hinted that base gas costs may still rise, keeping prices high for end users. However, developers could have a field day with greatly-improved layer-2 efficiency. This might just be enough to retain developers into Ethereum\u2019s orbit, rather than losing talent to rival chains like Solana (SOL-USD) or Avalanche (AVAX-USD).\n\nStory continues\n\nI remain adamantly bullish on Ethereum heading into the upgrade event. As a deflationary cryptocurrency, growing demand for Ethereum tokens fueled by Web3 apps should drive prices higher. And with Ethereum hosting most smart contract-based platforms, demand is likely to increase over time. Deneb/Cancun will be a definitive test of Ethereum\u2019s technical prowess and its ability to meet user needs.\n\nBeyond the upgrade, there are some promising emergent use cases that could propel Ethereum adoption. Decentralized finance (DeFi) retains strong activity, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are on the rise, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming digital ownership and asset provenance, and even central banks are experimenting with the prospect of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on Ethereum. As both a crypto asset and a decentralized network powering Web3, Ethereum remains a top long-term buy.\n\nOptimism (OP-USD)\n\nCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. Cryptos to Buy Before the Market Swing. rising meme cryptos. altcoins\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock\n\nAs a leading layer-2 scaling solution utilizing optimistic rollups for Ethereum, Optimism (OP-USD) checks all the boxes as a top Deneb/Cancun speculative buy. The project aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum dApps like decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and social networks.\n\nImportantly, Optimism is EVM-compatible, meaning developers can deploy existing smart contracts on Optimism with minimal effort. While the network is currently live, supporting prominent apps like Uniswap (UNI-USD), Synthetix (SNX-USD), and Chainlink (LINK-USD), wider usage has been hampered by throughput constraints. This could change in a big way once Optimism leverages proto-danksharding and blobs to enhance its rollups.\n\nOptimism offers an encouraging early sign of its upgrade readiness. Its team recently implemented the Ecotone hard fork on the Optimism Goerli test network. This hard fork trial enabled batch submission via EIP-4844 blobs, verifying that Optimism will hit the ground running with blob support on mainnet post-upgrade.\n\nWith strong fundamentals and a 25% market share of total value locked in layer-2 platforms at over $5.4 billion, Optimism looks poised to capitalize on the greater efficiency unlocked by Deneb/Cancun. As rollup activity expands, Optimism could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Ethereum\u2019s push to scale.\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD)\n\nA close-up shot of the concept for a cryptocurrency exchange page. Cryptos to Sell Before a Recession\n\nSource: PixieMe / Shutterstock.com\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD) is a Web 3.0 project focused squarely on expanding Ethereum\u2019s addressable market by eliminating gas fees. It\u2019s a great choice for investors seeking outsized upside from higher Ethereum transaction volumes after the upgrade.\n\nAt the core of 0xGasless\u2019 offering is support for ERC-4337 and account abstraction. This is a standard that replaces traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) with smart contract wallets. These wallets feature built-in logic for transaction validation, authorization, and, crucially \u2013 gas payment. This shields users from managing seed phrases, paying volatile gas fees directly and losing funds to theft or mistakes.\n\n0xGasless also offers intriguing functionality that could hasten mainstream adoption. For example, users can deploy ERC-4337 smart contract wallets on the user-friendly Telegram platform. Additionally, a custom paymaster service enables gas fee payment using any ERC-20 token.\n\nProjects like 0xGasless building on account abstraction and user experience have asymmetric upside. The road to mass adoption starts by allowing users to easily access Ethereum applications without crypto\u2019s usual harsh learning curve.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization less than $100 million or trade with volume less than $100,000 each day.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to follow the strategy employed in approving spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds for spot Ethereum ETH +0.86% ETFs, starting with rejections and ultimately granting approval on the initial final deadline on May 23, according to Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\"We expect pending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs,\" Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank's forex and digital assets research, wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"If ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\"\n\nKendrick foresees the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs primarily on the grounds that the SEC has not categorized ether as a security in its legal actions against crypto companies, and the listing of ETH as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange adds weight to this expectation.\n\n\"Grayscale also has an ETH trust that it wants to turn into an ETF, so a denial of that application would likely lead to another appeal by Grayscale,\" he said, adding that \"we see no fundamental reason for the SEC to view ETH differently than the CME already does.\"\n\nConsistently optimistic\n\nKendrick generally holds an optimistic outlook on crypto, especially regarding price trends. Earlier this month, before spot bitcoin ETFs were approved, he said those funds are expected to attract inflows of $50-100 billion this year, and as a result, the bitcoin price could rise to $100,000 by the end of the year and $200000 by the end of 2025.\n\nThe $100,000 price prediction \"still looks achievable,\" Kendrick said in today's report, adding that expected steady inflows in spot bitcoin ETFs will gradually raise the bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin price declined after spot bitcoin ETF approvals, mainly due to outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but has since bounced back and is currently trading at around $43,540.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nKendrick said ether is less susceptible to the post-approval selling that bitcoin saw. \"The key reason for this is that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust has a smaller share of total ETH market cap than GBTC did before approval of BTC ETFs; and within that, FTX holdings are even lower,\" he noted.\n\nEthereum ETFs that include staking yields to be approved later\n\nOn May 23, Kendrick only expects simple Ethereum ETFs that replicate ether price movements to get approved, while ETFs that include staking yield rewards may be introduced later, he said.\n\n\"Both types exist in Europe; AETH [21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP] is the largest ETF that includes staking yield rewards. However, given that AETH has higher fees than ETH, staking rewards are offset by fees,\" he said.\n\nKendrick also commented on Ethereum's upcoming Dencun or Proto-Danksharding upgrade and said it would benefit the ether price. \"Overall, this upgrade should see more value captured within the ETH ecosystem as lower Layer 2 fees make ETH more competitive, and slower staking should keep staking rewards higher for longer. Both of these are positive for ETH prices,\" he concluded.\n\nAs a whole, crypto experts have been both optimistic and pessimistic that a spot ether ETF approval is on the horizon."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nStandard Chartered has forecasted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ethereum in May, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThis anticipated approval is expected to significantly impact Ethereum's market value, with predictions suggesting a surge to $4,000 by May 23, the final deadline for ETF applications from VanEck and Ark 21Shares.\n\nNot so fast?\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook from Standard Chartered, the SEC's impending decision on Ethereum ETFs is met with varying opinions from analysts.\n\nLegal experts Jake Chervinsky and Scott Johnsson have voiced skepticism over a guaranteed positive outcome.\n\nChervinsky stressed the erroneous assumption that the SEC's past decisions on Bitcoin ETFs will automatically translate to Ethereum.\n\nJohnsson pointed to potential regulatory hurdles, arguing that the SEC might demand consistent correlation across a 2.5-year sample period.\n\nThis diverging viewpoint is echoed in the industry, with JPMorgan offering a cautious 50% chance of approval due to legal uncertainties, while Bloomberg Intelligence's Eric Balchunas predicts a more optimistic 70% chance of approval.\n\nEthereum's price performance\n\nThe current trading price of Ethereum stands at approximately $2,372.37 with a market cap nearing $285 billion.\n\nDespite these robust figures, the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index indicates a neutral market sentiment, with a current score of 54.\n\nThis underscores the cautious optimism among investors as they await the SEC's decision and its potential impact on Ethereum's value."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Nethermind client software saw a bug that pulled validators offline for four hours last week, raising concerns in the Ethereum community about client centralization.\n\nEthereum clients are software that enable users to interact with the blockchain, allowing them to send transactions and run smart contracts, for example.\n\nWhen a minority client shuts down, the penalty often involves losing ether. However, in this case, Nethermind going offline has also sparked similar concerns around what would happen if Geth, Ethereum\u2019s most popular execution client, failed as well.\n\nRead more: Coinbase confronts client diversity risk following Nethermind bug\n\nLast week, it was estimated that 84% of validators used Geth, meaning that Ethereum itself would not finalize if Geth were to go offline.\n\nMark Mackey, an Ethereum Core Developer at Sigma Prime, noted in a post on X that the reason Geth has become one of the most popular execution clients is correlated with its early mover advantage.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, we used to have 2 clients: Geth and Parity. They were roughly equal in their usage,\u201d Mackey wrote. \u201cBut then an exploit in the Parity wallet froze [500,000] ETH forever, including the vast majority of funds that were raised for the development of Polkadot.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAfter Gavin Wood, the founder and CEO of Parity, decided to pull the plug on developing the execution client following the Parity wallet exploit, Geth became the only viable option, Mackey wrote.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent Nethermind bug, a renewed interest in execution clients has arisen and crypto community members are now calling for client diversification.\n\nOne of the most prominent companies to respond to client diversification concerns was Coinbase Cloud, whose nodes currently solely rely on Geth.\n\nThe company noted that although Geth is the only execution layer software client that meets its technical requirements, it is also looking into other client execution layers for alternative options, with further details to be expected in February.\n\nCoinbase Cloud is not the only team to have looked into diversifying its execution client. Allnodes shared in a recent post on X that it had fully transitioned to Besu, noting that not a single one of its 23,895 validators is on Geth anymore.\n\nP2P, another proof-of-stake validator and RPC node provider, had also transitioned to using Besu. It noted in an X post that \u201cwe believe that together with the rest of the community, we can reduce GETH usage to below 66%.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Aave-Chan, a delegate platform, noted that it would be switching minority EL clients for all its ETH nodes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be diversity maxi without putting our money where our mouth is,\u201d wrote Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave-Chan Initiative.\n\nA week following calls for client diversification, there are \u2014 as of today \u2014 an estimated 78% of validators using Geth, meaning that in just a week, around 6% of node operators had switched their execution client.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Reaching $4000 from current levels would translate to a growth of around 70%.\n\nAccording to Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, ETH will mirror Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) trajectory. The US SEC\u2019s (Securities and Exchange Commission) recent approval of 11 spot BTC ETFs was a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. Many anticipate a similar ruling for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: SEC May Approve ETH ETF in May, Says Bloomberg\n\nWhen will the SEC approve a spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nAccording to Standard Chartered\u2019s report, the US SEC may approve a spot ETH ETF by May 2024.

Additionally, ETH\u2019s presence as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange bolsters the likelihood of approval.\n\nKendrick\u2019s predictions extend beyond mere approval, suggesting a potential spike in Ethereum\u2019s price to $4,000, akin to Bitcoin\u2019s price performance prior to its ETF approval. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\u201d\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nThe potential for Ethereum ETFs isn\u2019t without its nuances. Kendrick anticipates the initial approvals to focus on simple Ethereum ETFs that track the price movements of ETH. He predicted that more complex offerings, such as ETFs incorporating staking yield rewards, may emerge later, drawing on European models as a reference.\n\nFurthermore, Kendrick comments on Ethereum\u2019s impending network upgrades, like Dencun or Proto-Danksharding, viewing them as beneficial for price growth. These upgrades will enhance the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s value retention by reducing Layer 2 fees and maintaining higher staking rewards.\n\nKendrick also maintained a positive view of the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. His earlier projections anticipated a surge in the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s price to $100,000 by year-end and a staggering $200,000 by the close of 2025, driven by inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs."

Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed \"blobs\" to help optimize performance.\n\nDevelopment efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.\n\nEthereum to fight back against its competitors\n\nMany new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.\n\nWith the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more."

I spoke with coin desk's Ethereum protocol reporter Margot Ny about the developments yesterday ahead of the upgrade, it kicked off the conversation about why Ethereum upgrades are such a big deal. Let's take a look. Ethereum goes through a lot of these upgrades just because there's always been this road map and there's vision to make the Blockchain more scalable, more user friendly and as the network gets bigger and bigger, it matures there is this need for to make these improvements so that as, you know, as activity grows and as the user base grows, it could be more easily used. And so that's why we're seeing at this point. Um you know, upgrades happening on Ethereum basically almost once a year. The biggest one, you know, I think was the merge, we can all recollect that was sort of happening um or was in the making for a while. Um Since then, we've had, you know, Chappelle, we talked about this last year on here where, where the uh ether withdrawals or state ether withdrawals um were enabled. And so now this next one, it's called Denk. It's supposed to mostly help roll ups. The layer two blockchains that sit on top of Ethereum over the last few years has been a growing ecosystem with the with the layer twos. So it's important to address those issues too. And I unpack this for us a little bit more. What functionality does this unlock for users? Sure. So um high level uh basically if you're transacting on a roll up or layer two, the transaction fees are supposed to lower with this. Mostly thanks to a in the code, the more official title is called E IP 4844. But everyone knows it sort of as proto dame Shorting, which is this weird terminology that the devs have come up with. But basically what it's supposed to do is supposed to make extra available room for blobs of data of what they call it. But that sort of enables for transactions to happen on um roll ups or those fees to to to become cheaper. And also, you know, like I would mention that as more and more people use the Ethereum Blockchain, the availability like the data available to store and track what like and download those transactions. Like the info of those transactions has become more and more expensive. And so this upgrade is supposed to also help make that cheaper when you want to sort of download that data. Um, yeah, so that's sort of what, what the main, there are some other minor protocol changes happening in these packages. Like, usually they'll ship something that's a big, um, technical change with a bunch of other little ones, but that gets very into the weeds. That's sort of like what we like to call the star of the show. I was going to ask you to explain proto dank shouting to me like I'm five and so I'm going to do it anyway. Just humor me. I'm five years old. Just break it real down for me. Sure. So the doves actually have this really great analogy that I think of proto dank shorting. It is the first iteration of one of these technical features that the developers want to tackle cold charting, which is basically splitting up the Blockchain into mini blocks to or blockchains to sort of be able to process more data or process more transactions. Now, what does that mean? Like, how can we sort of think of this in a more basic level, let's say, like you're driving a car on a highway, right? And you add more lanes to the highway to be able to process more cars. And in theory, that's supposed to get more cars through, get you through faster because it's able to handle a bigger load of cars. That's sort of the same thing that's happening here on the Blockchain. We're adding more mini shards or we, that's the eventual goal is to add more shards to make split offs of many blockchains to be able to transact or handle more transactions and therefore make those transactions hopefully cheaper. Because right now if there's more congestion on the Blockchain, like as if there's more congestion on the highway tolls might be higher. So, you know, gas fees might be higher. It all sort of is like a great comparison. Um, but that's sort of, if you're going to picture it, that's sort of the way to go about or to think about this. Ok. And the test net is like a dress rehearsal for the devs. What happens if something goes wrong? Well, that's why they have these test nets to make sure that things can go wrong because they can address those bugs in their, in their tests and therefore patch it out before it gets onto the main net block chain where there's a lot more at stake. Right. There's like a ton of apps, a ton of crypto locked into the smart contracts and we've had already one test. The first one was on girly that happened about 10 days ago and there was some slight issue in it. There was a bug that basically the, the terminology they use meant that they weren't able to finalize transactions, which sounds a lot scarier than it is. But basically, you know, when you, when you transact on the Blockchain, it happens and then it sort of gets written in ink and it becomes immutable on the, in this case, it wasn't able to come immutable until like a few hours later. So they were figuring out what happened with that bug. So they go through these dress rehearsals like three times in order to ensure that, you know, once this hits Main Net, it's not going to create such big issues. Um But yeah, that now is the time to make mistakes basically, like that's why they have these dress rehearsals. And if there's a mistake that could push out the main net launch, yes, if there's a mistake, there could put up, put that the main net launch, even there's like there's a test next week that could push back that. But right now, they haven't really scheduled the date yet for the main net. It's projected to happen sometime of end of February, maybe early March. And that really just depends on how these tests run and how comfortable the developers feel shipping it. If you look at Ethereum history, they like to lean on the safe side, they postponed the merge for years and years because they want to make sure it ran smoothly. So my guess is this is just a judgment call is that, you know, they want to try and push it um for as like as safe a time as possible. Ok. And Margot, it's 2024. I can't believe it's already almost February. But what are the other big expectations from Ethereum as we head into 2024? Yeah. So this is going to be definitely the biggest change happening right now in 2024 they are already planning their next big upgrade. But otherwise I think a lot of the conversation is still happening around the layer twos on Ethereum, um especially, you know, this upgrade is catered towards those layer two roll ups. Um So we're gonna have to sort of see what the aftermath of all of this is. Um Once this goes live, Margo, thanks so much for joining the show and thanks for explaining that to us using just normal words. I think it's, it's starting to make a lot of sense."

        "content": "Standard Chartered: Ethereum Spot ETFs Likely To Be Approved by May 2024\n\nStandard Chartered has projected that Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and potentially double the current price of ETH, according to a report by the British multinational bank on Tuesday.\n\nStandard Chartered expressed confidence that spot ETH ETFs will receive the green light from the SEC by the final deadline on May 23, citing the fact that the regulator has not classified ETH as a security. This is in contrast to the SEC's crackdown on crypto companies selling unregistered securities. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), on the other hand, has consistently classified ETH as a commodity, an asset that can be bought and sold.\n\nStandard Chartered expects that the approval of spot ETH ETFs will lead to a surge in the value of ETH, with the cryptocurrency potentially reaching $4,000. ETH is currently priced at $2,332, according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data. Several high-profile asset management firms, including BlackRock, have submitted their applications for spot ETH ETFs.\n\nStandard Chartered also maintained its bullish outlook on Bitcoin, reiterating its prediction that BTC could reach $100,000 per coin by the end of 2024. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank's forex and digital assets research, stated that this price range \"still looks achievable.\""

        "content": "Ethereum price extended its increase above the $2,320 resistance zone. ETH is correcting gains but the 100 hourly SMA might provide support and start a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum started an extended recovery wave above the $2,320 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend lien with support at $2,325 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair might start a fresh increase if it manages to stay above the $2,300 level.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum price remained in a positive zone above the $2,250 resistance zone. ETH cleared the $2,320 resistance to move further into a positive zone, outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nThe price traded close to the $2,400 level. A high was formed near $2,390 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2,350 level. The price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,235 swing low to the $2,390 high.\n\nBesides, there was a break below a key bullish trend lien with support at $2,325 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, Ethereum is still above $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,325 level. The next major resistance is near $2,350, above which the price might rise and test the $2,400 resistance. If the bulls push the price above the $2,400 resistance, they could aim for $2,450. A clear move above the $2,450 level might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,550 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,325 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,300 level and the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,295 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,235 swing low to the $2,390 high. A daily close below the $2,295 support might start another steady decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,325\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Standard Chartered is optimistic that the Ethereum price will soar to $4,000 following the potential approval of its associated spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe British multinational banking giant is anticipating the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF by May according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nMany companies have indicated their interest in issuing spot Ethereum ETFs. Nonetheless, while there are futures-based ETF equivalent trading in the market at the moment, the skepticism for this product is profound.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETF earlier in January has positioned the minds of many stakeholders that the markets regulator will not want to backtrack on the precedent it set. Standard Chartered falls into this category.\n\nStandard Chartered Assumptions Challenged\n\nStandard Chartered might be optimistic about the prospects of a spot Ethereum ETF, but it is worth noting that more solid arguments about that posit otherwise.\n\nMarket veterans like Scott Johnsson believe past precedents on crypto ETFs might play little to no role in projecting the SEC\u2019s stance over Ethereum.\n\nThe dissensions surrounding the status of the asset as either a security or commodity also lend complication to the broader conversation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn Johnsson\u2019s argument, he believes the regulator may want to see market consistency that might span over 2.5 years.\n\nFor the better part of the past decade, Bitcoin ETF issuers had been lobbying the SEC for approval, and not until a court ruling in Grayscale\u2019s favor came last year that the commission had to rethink its stance.\n\nPopular crypto advocate and SEC Commission Hester Peirce has admitted that the regulator has learned from its mistakes and will approach the Ethereum ETF applications differently. The final deadline for the VanEck and Ark 21Shares ETH ETF filing is slated for May 23.\n\nWill Price Roar as Expected?\n\nConsidering that Ethereum\u2019s price and market capitalization are down by 0.23% to $2,309.90 and $277,418,766,113, the $4,000 projection from Standard Chartered is quite ambitious.\n\nMany analysts projected a parabolic boom for Bitcoin should its association ETF be approved by the SEC. Surprisingly, the reverse has been the case with the digital currency just recuperating from the downtime the approval brought with it.\n\nWhile breaching the $4,000 benchmark is not uncommon for Ethereum considering its All-Time High (ATH) price of $4,891.70, the Standard Chartered timeline might require some time concessions as events unfold."

Essentially, it will allow DNS records to be verified via an off-chain gateway and eliminate the gas fee.\n\nThis means you can use your real domain names in the ENS ecosystem for free.\n\nDomain name owners will need to enable DNSSEC and add a TXT record, but will no longer have to pay gas fees."

        "content": "TD Cowen\u2019s Washington Research Group predicted that spot Ethereum ETFs will not gain approval this year, according to Kitco on Jan. 29.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must soon decide on proposed rule changes that would allow spot Ethereum ETFs to be listed and traded on securities exchanges. TD Cowen argued that approval is unlikely, stating:\n\n\u201c[The SEC] can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation \u2026 Either will take another year or two to play out.\u201d\n\nIn that event, any possible spot Ethereum ETF approval is unlikely to occur until late 2025 or early 2026, the research group said.\n\nThe SEC must reach a decision on VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application by May 23 but is not required to approve the fund. The securities agency is expected to reach a decision on similar applications at the same time.\n\nOther sources are divided on whether a May approval is likely. One Polymarket prediction market suggests 47% odds of approval, while one JP Morgan executive has suggested a 50% chance of approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart is slightly more optimistic and has predicted a 60% chance of approval.\n\nPolitical factors are at play\n\nTD Cowen said that its low approval expectations are based on partisan attitudes toward cryptocurrency. The research group wrote:\n\n\u201cThis is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Democrat, needs support from progressives in order to advance his agenda or potentially obtain a different government position in the event that U.S. President Joe Biden wins a second term. It suggested that approving a spot ETF would involve a \u201cneedless fight\u201d and that Gensler is likely in \u201cno hurry\u201d to approve such a fund.\n\nDemocrats broadly opposed the earlier approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, as TD Cowen observed. Within the SEC, two Democratic commissioners voted against the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF while two Republicans voted in favor of approval. Gensler voted in favor of approval in spite of his Democratic party membership and his broader concerns about cryptocurrency.\n\nOutside of the SEC, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed complaints about the decision to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 12."

If ETH prices perform similarly to how BTC prices performed in the lead-up to BTC ETF approval, ETH could trade as high as $4,000 by then.\u201d\n\nKendrick projects a favorable outcome for the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, basing this anticipation on two pivotal factors.\n\nFirstly, the SEC\u2019s historical stance in its legal proceedings against crypto companies has not classified ether as a security, setting a precedent that bodes well for the approval process.\n\nSecondly, the recognition of ETH as a regulated futures contract on the prestigious Chicago Mercantile Exchange lends additional credibility and support to the case for spot Ethereum ETFs, reinforcing the expectation for their eventual approval.\n\nGiven the BlackRock ETH spot ETF has been delayed I don't expect to see an immediate uptick on ETH CME Futures OI anytime soon. Something I will be observing closely. pic.twitter.com/Lj56ph1Zwt \u2014 McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) January 25, 2024\n\nKendrick added :\n\n\u201cGrayscale also has an ETH trust that it wants to turn into an ETF, so a denial of that application would likely lead to another appeal by Grayscale. We see no fundamental reason for the SEC to view ETH differently than the CME already does.\u201d\n\nBullish Crypto Forecast Amid Market Fluctuations\n\nKendrick continues to exude confidence in the crypto market\u2019s potential, particularly highlighting promising price trajectories. Preceding the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, he anticipated these funds to magnetize an influx ranging from $50 to $100 billion within the year.\n\nThis capital injection, he predicted, could propel Bitcoin\u2019s value to an impressive $100,000 by the year\u2019s end, potentially soaring to $200,000 by the close of 2025.\n\nSome bold bitcoin price predictions have been made for 2024. In April 2023, Standard Chartered attracted attention when it predicted bitcoin prices would reach $100,000 by the end of next year. \u2014 hamza jakir (@JakirHamza) January 26, 2024\n\nDespite the transient dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value following the initial nod to spot Bitcoin ETFs, attributed mainly to withdrawals from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Kendrick\u2019s $100,000 price target remains firmly within sight. In his latest report, he underscores the belief that a consistent inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs will methodically bolster Bitcoin\u2019s price. The cryptocurrency\u2019s resilience is evident, as it has recuperated from its post-approval decline and is presently trading at approximately $43,540 , showcasing the dynamic nature of the crypto market."

The blockchain saw software developer kit (SDK) installs increase 31% year over year to 106.4 million downloads in 2023, up from 81.4 million in 2022, according to Alchemy\u2019s Web3 Development Report for 2023.\n\nThe total Ethereum SDK installs have increased consecutively over the past five years, the report said. The number included SDK packages like ethers, web3, hardhat, truffle, foundry, eth, alchemy-sdk, viem, userops and wagmi. In 2022, there was an overall increase in developer activity. A separate report by Electric Capital found that the number of monthly active crypto developers declined 25% last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see confirmation of the clich\u00e9 that bear markets are for building,\u201d Jason Windawi, protocol specialist at Alchemy, told TechCrunch+. \u201cDuring the depths [of the downturn] it was easy to wonder if that\u2019s true; we knew it was, but it\u2019s good to have this data to show that.\u201d"

        "content": "Although the digital asset industry is a relatively new creation in the grand scheme of technology, it is noted for its rapid progression. Subsequently, its presence requires a steep learning curve for many entering the field. Therefore, this guide is going to share some insight into how to bridge Ethereum (ETH) to Solana.\n\nThe process of bridging your digital assets has become increasingly necessary in the vast marketplace. Different networks and cryptocurrencies all coexist within the sector and necessitate the understanding of how to work alongside the technology parameters that exist today.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana represent two of the most popular digital assets present in the marketplace today. However, due to compatibility restraints, it is important to know how to bridge different assets from one network to the other.\n\nThis guide is going to delve a bit deeper into the role that bridges play in the current digital asset landscape. Moreover, it is going to explore the best way to approach bridging Ethereum to Solana in a way that will hopefully equip and empower newfound and seasoned traders alike.\n\nWhat is Bridging?\n\nAlso Read: How to Bridge to Fantom?\n\nNow, before we get to specifics regarding a bridge from ETH to Solana, it is crucial to start at the beginning. For new traders, the idea of bridging assets from different networks may be a little bit confusing. So, let\u2019s discuss a little bit about the process, what it entails, and why it\u2019s important.\n\nBridges in the cryptocurrency sector are the foundation of cross-chain maneuvering for investors. As the title explains, a bridge allows a pathway for both assets and necessary information to travel from one chain to another.\n\nThis becomes necessary when one user is seeking to use bridges to allow one network to interact with another. For the case of this guide, a bridge is necessary to transfer assets from the Ethereum network to Soolana.\n\nAlso Read: How To Bridge to Avalanche?\n\nA bridge will ensure that assets can move between differing blockchains that may not otherwise be compatible. however, it is important to note that the actual bridge being used by the individual to trade is subject to change depending on who is transferring, and other factors.\n\nYet, most all bridges, work through the locking of assets on what is called the source chain, or the starting network. then, it will mint assets equivalent to that total on the destination chain, or the network you are transferring to. This way, you can maintain the value across the process.\n\nNow that we know a bit more about bridges in cryptocurrency, let\u2019s delve into how to bridge ETH to Solana\n\nHow to Bridge ETH to Solana?\n\nSource: Blockworks\n\nAlso Read: How to Bridge Polygon to Solana?\n\nNow, to begin a bridge from Ethereum to Solana, it starts with selecting what bridge is right for you. As previously mentioned, this is a process that is one only you can truly know. For this example, we are going to be divulging the bridging process using Portal Bridge.\n\nNow, when it comes to bridging these two blockchains, it can be presented in four rather simple steps. First, you are going to need to open Portal Bridge. Within this step, you are going to want to connect your supported wallet. This can be anything from MetaMask to Phantom, depending on whichever you have.\n\nSecondly, you will want to select \u2018Ethereum Mainnet\u2019 as the source chain. This is the vital starting point because that is where the assets are being transferred from. Moreover, in this step, you will want to select \u2018Solana\u2019 as the destination chain.\n\nThirdly, you will want to select Ethereum (ETH) as the token you wish to bridge. This is another simple step that is also crucial to the process. Within this step, you will also have to specify the amount that you want to transfer across chains. After that is inputted, you will select the \u2018Next\u2019 button.\n\nFinally, you are going to want to make note of instructions that will arrive on your wallet interface. Specifically, you will need to complete these to facilitate the bridge which should be rather quick and secure.\n\nRemember, that fees will be a part of the bridging process. However, the specifics of those fees will be dependent on various factors. Starting from Ethereum will likely make fees start at around $20. Moreover, using Portal Bridge will make transaction fees rather low. Specifically, they should be around $0.0001 per transfer."

        "content": "A development that could be another landmark decision for the digital asset market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve Spot Ethereum ETFs in May, according to Standard Chartered Bank. Indeed, they predict that the approval could come on May 23rd, according to a report from The Block.\n\nAdditionally, Standard Chartered has forecasted a $4,000 target for Ethereum if approval is granted. Specifically, it notes that the potential value surge if the asset could mimic what occurred with Bitcoin (BTC) before its Spot ETF approval in the United States. Overall, the bank said that the process for Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval will mirror Bitcoin\u2019s journey at the tail end of last year.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Delays BlackRock Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nStandard Chartered Bank Predicts Spot Ethereum ETF Approval in May\n\nThe digital asset industry experienced a landmark development just ten days into the new year. After months of speculation, the SEC greenlit the creation of 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Naturally, that approval led many market participants to ask what next. What other asset could receive the same coveted approval that BTC had witnessed?\n\nWell, according to one prominent bank, Ethereum could well be on its way. Specifically, the SEC is predicted to approve Spot Ethereum ETFs in May, according to Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\u201cWe expect pending applications or ETH US spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration- the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs,\u201d says Geoffrey Kendrick, the head of Standard Chartered Banks foret and digital assets research.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Sees Value in ETH ETF\n\nMoreover, Kendrick noted that ETH could follow a similar pre-approval trajectory that Bitcoin enjoyed. Although BTC has failed to surge in value since approvals were issued, the expectation of such approval had a massive impact on its price. Subsequently, Kendrick predicts that Ethereum \u201ccould trade as high as $4,000\u201d by the approval time.\n\nKendrick expects approvals because the SEC has not categorized ETH as a security in its legal actions against digital asset firms. Moreover, ETH is listed as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Therefore, increasing the potential for approval.\n\nAdditionally, Kendrick notes that Grayscale is seeking to convert its ETH trust into an ETF. Subsequently, a denial of that application will \u201clikely lead to another appeal by Grayscale.\u201d Ultimately, Kendrick said they \u201csee no fundamental reason,\u201d the SEC and the CME would view Ethereum differently."

        "title": "Ether takes center stage as bitcoin heads into one of strongest months - CNBC",
        "content": "Ether is ready to take the limelight in the month ahead after bitcoin and newly launched bitcoin exchange-traded funds dominated crypto investor attention in January. Both bitcoin and ether are on pace to finish the month higher by 0.01%, according to Coin Metrics. January saw sharp price swings driven first by hype before the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and subsequent flows into and out of the funds after they began trading Jan. 11. By now, the outflows have tapered off and bitcoin's outlook for the year is still strong, boosted by the upcoming halving and the potential for rate cuts. As investors came to expect slow, steady flows into bitcoin through newly institutionalized ETFs in coming months, ether and altcoins have been ready for a breakout. \"Short-term flow has been dominated by GBTC [Grayscale Bitcoin] sales. \u2026 As that flow is easing, the market has found its footing and the reality of a world where large asset managers promote crypto actively is starting to hit home,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol. \"ETH and the alts are acting as high beta plays on this trend and our expectation is that both will outperform as more focus starts to direct towards ETH rolling out upgrades to [the Ethereum network] \u2026 as well as a potential ETF approval.\" February is a historically strong month for both bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin has finished nine of the last 11 Februarys in the green and has had an average return of 13.12% for the month, according to CoinGlass. Ether has finished the month higher in six of the last seven since its inception, giving it an average February gain of 12.97%. Soon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs for trading, investors took profits and rotated into ether, pushing it to a 20-month high as they looked ahead to what might come next. The SEC is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale, which is seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. Standard Chartered said in a note this week that ahead of the May decision, it expects ether to track or outperform bitcoin's pre-ETF uptrend in the comparable period. If it does, it could reach $4,000 by then, the bank added, which would equal a roughly 70% increase from current levels. \"Bitcoin remains the more popular macro asset with cross-over appeal to traditional finance, and Solana is gaining popularity as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum,\" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Arca. \"Nonetheless, Ethereum is not going away anytime soon, and it could even compete with Bitcoin if an ETF is approved, or if bitcoin investors realize they want exposure to areas of blockchain's growth that Bitcoin doesn't offer, such as stablecoins, NFTs, [decentralized finance], gaming [and] AI.\" Ethereum is continually improving and upgrading , Dorman added, which will help the network grow in line with cheaper and faster alternatives such as Solana. Its next big update, called \"Dencun,\" is expected to take place in February and is meant to make transactions on so-called Layer 2 solutions \u2014 networks that sit on top of a base network like Ethereum and exist to provide extra capacity and functionality to the network \u2014 less expensive. Ether is also poised to benefit from the popularity of altcoins , many of which run on top of the Ethereum blockchain, according to Jason Urban, the global head of trading at Galaxy Digital. \"We've seen an uptick in alt interest. \u2026 ETH is probably more poised to benefit from that\" than bitcoin, he said. \"There are going to be people that will manifest that play, especially more [traditional finance] people that might not have access or the ability to trade a bag of alts. You'll see that manifest in ETH.\" For January, ETH is heading to a less than 1% gain, while other alts are a mixed bag. Since Jan. 23, however, when bitcoin fell below $40,000 for the first time this year, they've rallied, while ETH has been stagnant. ETH is weaker during that period, while SOL has gained 14%, Polygon's MATIC rose 4% and the tokens tied to Chainlink and Cardano advanced 4% and 3%, respectively. \"If you believe in a bullish market trend like in 2020 and 2021, then it makes sense to invest in the 'fastest horse,' which are the smaller and cheaper blockchains and applications,\" Dorman said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Recently deployed on the Sepolia test network, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade is a crucial step towards the anticipated \"proto-danksharding\" feature.\n\nEthereum, a pioneer in blockchain technology, is set for a transformation by deploying the Dencun upgrade on the Sepolia test network. This marks a crucial step toward the anticipated \"proto-dank sharding\" feature, offering a glimpse into Ethereum's future.\n\nBut what exactly is the Dencun upgrade, and how does it promise to enhance the Ethereum network? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n\u200d\n\nEvolution of Ethereum Since 2023\n\nIn order to understand Dencun, let's take a look back at Ethereum's journey. The Shanghai upgrade, implemented on April 12, 2023, brought significant optimizations to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and introduced various protocol enhancements.\n\nThis upgrade aimed to boost gas efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the overall user experience \u2013 a pivotal stride toward Ethereum's scalability and sustainability.\n\nThe Anticipated Dencun Upgrade: A Game-Changer\n\nNow, all eyes are on the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade, representing the next phase in Ethereum's evolution. Comprising enhancements to both the execution layer (Cancun) and the consensus layer (Deneb) of the Ethereum network, Dencun promises substantial changes to scalability, security, and usability.\n\n\u200d\n\nEthereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade Highlights\n\nCancun: Enhancing Scalability\n\nThe Cancun upgrade, focusing on the execution layer, introduces several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at enhancing scalability and optimizing gas efficiency. Notable among them is EIP-1234, adjusting the block reward and delaying the \"difficulty bomb\" to ensure a smooth transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nDeneb: Improving Consensus and Security\n\nThe Deneb upgrade targets the consensus layer, aiming to enhance security and consensus mechanisms. Key among the EIPs is EIP-2322, upgrading the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm for increased robustness and efficiency.\n\nFinalized EIPs for Implementation\n\nSeveral finalized EIPs will be implemented, including:\n\nEIP-1559: Introducing a new fee structure to improve user experience and reduce transaction fees.\n\nEIP-2929: Enhancing security by increasing the cost of certain operations to deter potential attacks.\n\nEIP-2537: Proposing a new Ethereum-specific opcode for more efficient contract verification of elliptic curve signatures.\n\n\u200d\n\nExpected Benefits of Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade holds deep promise for the ecosystem:\n\nIncreased Security\n\nImplementing EIPs such as 4788, 6780, and 7514, Dencun addresses security concerns at both the user application and consensus levels. Measures include incorporating the parent beacon block root into the execution layer, optimizing opcode functionalities, and introducing a temporary solution for validator bloat.\n\nImproved Staking Experience\n\nOn the consensus layer, EIP-7044 and EIP-7045 aim to enhance the staking user experience and block confirmation times. The validity of voluntary exits in delegated staking will be perpetual, and validators will have more time to submit attestations, contributing to faster confirmation times.\n\nEnhanced Cost Efficiency\n\nIntroducing EIP-5656 and EIP-1153, the Cancun upgrade adds new opcodes to benefit dApp developers. These opcodes improve gas cost optimization, making smart contracts more efficient with zero trade-offs and introducing transient storage for communication within complex transactions.\n\n\u200d\n\nProto-Danksharding: Scaling Ethereum Further\n\nA significant advancement in Dencun is the introduction of danksharding and proto-danksharding, aimed at scaling the Ethereum blockchain and improving its efficiency. Danksharding involves dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller \"blobs,\" enabling parallel processing for enhanced scalability.\n\nProto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, builds upon this concept, expanding storage capacity for more efficient data processing and reduced gas fees for layer-2 solutions.\n\n\u200d\n\nDencun Upgrade Timeline\n\nInitially planned for late 2023, deployment and consensus issues pushed the Dencun upgrade to 2024. The public testnet timeline is as follows:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThe Sepolia testnet has ended, and developers are encouraged to move to Holesky for future workloads. The mainnet launch is expected in early or mid-March, with flexibility depending on the smooth progression of implementations."

Drawing parallels to Bitcoin\u2019s 85% surge post-ETF approval, the report suggests Ethereum might experience less selling pressure post-approval due to factors like the Grayscale Ethereum Fund\u2019s (ETHE) smaller market share compared to the Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC).\n\nAlso Read: Approval for Ethereum ETFs Coming Soon?

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nStory Highlights Green light for Ethereum ETF expected late 2025 or early 2026, not post-Nov 2024 as initially thought.\n\nGensler seen hesitant to approve due to potential criticism from progressive Democrats who opposed the recent Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSEC wants more experience with Bitcoin ETFs before moving to Ethereum, and standard procedures allow for further delays.\n\nIn a strategic move, TD Cowen, the prominent investment bank, has updated its forecast for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Originally expected post-November 2024, the bank now projects approval in the latter part of 2025 or early 2026.\n\nThis adjustment, according to TD Cowen, results from both political factors and the regulatory approach of SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nPolitical Considerations Behind the Delay\n\nTD Cowen suggests that the delay in the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is a calculated political decision. The bank points out that there seems to be little motivation for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to give the green light, especially after the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which faced criticism from progressive Democrats.\n\nThe Washington Research group at TD Cowen, led by Jaret Seiberg, highlighted in a note on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nRead More: Approval for Ethereum ETFs Coming Soon? Key Challenges You Should Know\n\nGensler\u2019s Cautious Crypto Approach\n\nAs the U.S. gears up for the 2024 elections in November, Gensler is expected to exercise prudence in decision-making, seeking support from parliament members to advance his agenda or potentially secure a different government position. TD Cowen emphasizes that, being a Democrat, Gensler is in no rush to approve an Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe bank asserts that Gensler prefers a measured and cautious approach to crypto regulation, desiring more experience with recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs before giving the nod to an Ethereum counterpart.\n\n\u201c[The SEC] can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation \u2026 Either will take another year or two to play out\u201d, the bank writes.\n\nDid You Know? Coinbase & Ripple Pledge $78 Million for Pro-Crypto Fairshake for 2024 U.S. Elections\n\nExtended Timeline\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s Washington Research Group foresees a potential delay in the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF until late 2025 or early 2026, even if Congress fails to enact broader crypto market structure legislation in 2025.\n\nThe bank\u2019s report highlights the SEC\u2019s ability to easily delay or dismiss ETF applications using standard administrative procedures, suggesting that final decisions could take several more years unless there\u2019s significant outside influence or political considerations."

        "title": "Why Solana Beats Ethereum In This Bull Cycle: Crypto Expert - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent analysis, Andrew Kang, co-founder and partner of Mechanism Capital, provided a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the comparative strengths of Solana (SOL) over Ethereum (ETH) in the current bull cycle. Kang shared his insights via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nCentral to Kang\u2019s argument is the idea that in the current market, Solana presents a more favorable trading option than Ethereum. He states, \u201cThe definition of insanity is repeatedly trying to long ETHBTC when longing SOLBTC (or SOLETH) is the much better trade in a bullish environment.\u201d This succinctly captures his perspective on the shifting dynamics between these major cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhy Solana Is The Superior Trade Than Ethereum\n\nKang offers a retrospective view of Ethereum\u2019s journey, noting, \u201cOver the first 6-7 years of ETH\u2019s life, there was a lot of uncertainty and lack of education around ETH. There were a lot of Bitcoin holders to be converted to Ethereum holders.\u201d He recognizes Ethereum\u2019s early volatility and its eventual emergence as a stable trading asset.\n\nHowever, he suggests that this relative stability has now become a double-edged sword: \u201cETH also became a \u2018safe\u2019 risk-on asset that traders could get into in size. That\u2019s what made it a great cross to trade. But over time, people\u2019s allocation to eth vs btc started to harden and the amount of people left to convert whittled away.\u201d\n\nAddressing Ethereum\u2019s advancements in technology, Kang points out a paradox. He states, \u201cWhile these [Layer 2 solutions and Modular technology] might seem like good things, it is these characteristics/innovations that weighs heavy on ETH during risk on periods where ETH previously outperformed.\u201d He suggests that these developments, though innovative, have introduced new complexities that impact Ethereum\u2019s performance in bull markets.\n\n\u201cYes, you may have some conversion from BTC to ETH during risk on periods (much less so these days), but in this era ETH faces much more rotational pressure from those going from ETH as their base asset to these very L2s, modularity coins, SOL, those capitulating ETHBTC longs, and other shitcoins that it is supposed to benefit from,\u201d Kang claimed.\n\nIn contrast, the crypto expert highlights Solana\u2019s advantages, asserting, \u201cNot only does SOL not face these same issues but it also has crossed the chasm in becoming a blue-chip Layer 1.\u201d He emphasizes Solana\u2019s resilience and its appeal to conservative investors who previously focused mainly on Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nKang further elucidates, \u201cConservative giants that previously were comfortable with BTC and ETH have SOL as an easy, safe next step. It is this transition phase of becoming a new major or base asset that you want to ride. A young fast horse, not a horse encumbered by the troubles of age, baggage and Jared Gray.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, Kang notes a major shift in market dynamics, stating, \u201cThere was a secular shift in the collapse of ETHBTC volatility in 2023.\u201d He posits that this shift has redefined the comparative advantage in favor of Solana. Concluding his analysis, Kang confidently asserts, \u201cEven if that ever changes, SOLBTC will be the superior trade.\u201d\n\nAt press time, SOL was just 30% short of a new all-time high against ETH.\n\nFeatured image from securities.io, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Approval Date Set For May 23, Forecasts Suggest ETH Could Reach $4,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to follow a similar approach to approving spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for spot Ethereum ETFs, with the expectation that approval will be granted on the initial final deadline of May 23, as per Standard Chartered Bank analysis.\n\nEthereum ETFs Face Delays, Approval Remains Likely\n\nAccording to a report by The Block, Geoffrey Kendrick, head of forex and digital asset research at Standard Chartered Bank, stated that they expect pending applications for spot Ethereum ETFs to be approved on May 23, which is considered the equivalent date to January 10 for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFurthermore, Kendrick predicts that if Ethereum prices follow a similar trajectory to Bitcoin leading up to ETF approval, Ethereum could trade as high as $4,000 by the specified date.\n\nKendrick further supports the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs based on the SEC\u2019s classification of ether as a non-security in its legal actions against crypto companies.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Ethereum is listed as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) adds weight to the expectation of approval.\n\nFollowing the same line, Scott Johnsson, a financial lawyer, offered insights into the potential roadmap for Ethereum ETFs. Johnsson emphasized that while long-term approval for spot Ethereum ETFs is highly likely, there may be short-term delays due to ongoing regulatory actions involving Coinbase/Binance securities exchanges.\n\nShorter Path For ETH ETF Approvals?\n\nJohnsson highlighted the regulatory path from a plain spot digital asset to a spot ETF offering, using Bitcoin as an example. Johnsson noted that the process for Bitcoin took seven years, involving multiple steps and disapprovals along the way.\n\nHowever, Johnsson noted that the timeline for Ethereum is compressing, with applications open for both futures ETFs and spot ETFs. He suggested certain prerequisites that Johnsson believes may no longer be necessary for spot approval, such as Step 3, which requires the SEC to issue a formal 19b-4 approval for the futures ETF.\n\nJohnsson highlighted two key factors to understand the SEC\u2019s current approach to future approvals, including Ethereum. Firstly, he discussed the threshold question in the context of the Grayscale ruling, which focused on correlation analysis.\n\nSecondly, Johnsson emphasized the SEC\u2019s view, as bounded by the recent BTC approval order, which considers correlation with the CME, a lengthy sample period, intra-day trading data, and consistency throughout the sample period.\n\nWhile the specific threshold for sufficiency remains unknown, the correlation analysis for Bitcoin is within an acceptable range. Therefore, it is expected that Ethereum will likely meet this threshold in the foreseeable future, Johnsson suggests.\n\nOnce the required level of correlation is achieved, Johnsson believes that approval for spot Ethereum ETFs is likely to follow shortly after that, with May being the expected month of approval.\n\nOverall, industry analysts and experts suggest that the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is a matter of time, barring any major legal shifts.\n\nETH is currently trading at $2,370, up more than 2% in the past 24 hours and more than 7% in the past seven days, following Bitcoin\u2019s lead.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTake a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.\n\nEthereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance\n\nAs has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled \"Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.\n\nShibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships \u2013 SHIB rep\n\nIn a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future . Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to \"onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,\" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got \"this far\" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.\n\nJPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price could hit $4,000 before late May, if the token is able to secure its own spot exchange traded fund, Standard Chartered said on Tuesday.\n\nHead of FX Research Geoff Kendrick wrote in a note that this will likely happen, marking a 70% price upside from ethereum's current value.\n\n\"We expect pending applications for ETH US spot ETFs to be approved on 23 May, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to 10 January for BTC ETFs,\" he said.\n\nKendrick forecasts that the process will look similar to how the Securities and Exchange Commission handled the recent bitcoin spot ETF applications, which eventually led to the launch of 11 funds after months of regulatory pushback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn theory, ethereum should follow bitcoin's performance in the run-up to the ETFs' approval. Originally, SEC delays first caused bitcoin to flatline, before Grayscale's court victory against the regulator sent the apex token rallying at the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum has already risen around 19% since Blackrock filed for an ETF on November 16. But that's a modest gain compared to what Kendrick says could happen in May, the final deadline date for VanEck and Ark21Shares' applications.\n\nStill, to reach the $4,000 price target, some conditions will have to be met.\n\nExpectations for the approval will have to be low, as happened ahead of the bitcoin ETF launch, Kendrick said. Market-side implications for an approval will also have to miss the mark \u2014 though some may worry that the SEC's stance that ethereum should be treated as a security could get in the way, the commission has already lost that argument in court, Kendrick outlined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, a number of ETFs must be approved at the May deadline for ethereum to enjoy a boost.\n\nWhile the crypto's pre-ETF price action should resemble that of bitcoin, it's a different story once the funds are active.\n\nThough bitcoin jumped to an intra-day high of $49,000 on the ETFs' approval, it has since slid 6.7%. The surprising downside stems from massive outflows from Grayscale's fund, which previously functioned as a bitcoin trust.\n\nBut the Grayscale Ethereum Trust accounts for a much smaller market cap of the crypto than the bitcoin fund did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grayscale ETH Trust's current market cap of USD 6bn is 2.2% of total ETH market cap, whereas the comparable share for BTC was 3.1% at the time of the ETF approval,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nAnd while the failed crypto exchange FTX led the Grayscale bitcoin selloff, its holdings in the Ethereum Trust amount to just 0.05% of the token's market cap."

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2s Are Growing, But Privacy May Be Their Killer App - DailyCoin",
        "content": "As the new year dawns, the Ethereum ecosystem continues its dominance, with its Layer-2 networks establishing new highs in usage and Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching $23 billion on January 12, according to L2Beat.\n\nThe chains driving the growth include the ever-potent Arbitrum, in the top position with $10B in TVL, Optimism with $5B, and the recently-launched Manta Pacific. According to data by Artemis, however, Polygon PoS leads the daily activity chart, while zkSync Era is challenging Arbitrum in active addresses and transaction volume.\n\nThe numbers paint a rosy picture, but the tech game is far from over. Many of the networks are still in the early stages of their decentralization, while their performance and features are still nowhere close to the ideal.\n\nChallenges L2s are Facing Today\n\nThe blockchain trilemma is alive and well in Layer-2 platforms today. While rollups are the most popular way of tackling this issue, their costs are still significant compared to alternative Layer-1 chains. As highlighted by Vitalik Buterin, there is an alternative in the L2 space that would sacrifice some of the decentralization and security properties of rollups in favor of speed.\n\nValidiums, which store data on independent \u201cdata availability layers,\u201d can significantly cut down on transaction costs. The key difference with rollups is that storing the data outside of the Ethereum chain is cheaper, and this could be a valid solution for use cases such as gaming or non-financial uses.\n\nBeyond performance, richness of features is another major factor in Layer-2 attractiveness. Most rollups are currently just fresh EVM block space \u2014 essentially, they\u2019re many little Ethereums. But L2s could be used for much more, including the \u201choly grail\u201d of blockchain: private smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy opens up a great paradox in the crypto space. Anonymity was one of the most appealing features of Bitcoin. However, very quickly it became clear that complete privacy was not possible, as most blockchains need to be public in order to be verifiable. Privacy coins offered an improvement for normal transactions, but with the rise of on-chain use cases like DeFi and GameFi, this wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nImplementing private smart contracts requires a robust security model, which is where the Layer-2 model can shine. So, while the current stage of rollups is a rehash of previous architectures, there are a number of extremely interesting projects that could use L2s to bring about the next generation of smart contracts.\n\nHow New Projects Could Develop the Infrastructure for Crypto Killer Apps\n\nPrivate smart contracts would enable a new paradigm of blockchain usage: securely storing sensitive data. It\u2019s not just about financial applications \u2014 private smart contracts enable easy identity storage and verification, password-based wallets, unique applications in GameFi and many more uses yet to be found.\n\nOne of the more established privacy-centric L2s is Aztec, which has been quietly developing for several years. Aztec uses zero knowledge cryptography in an attempt to implement fully private and expressive transactions, powered by its custom smart contract language called Noir.\n\nWhile development is in full swing, Aztec had to make several fundamental improvements to zero knowledge proofs to even have a chance at developing its vision. The road is still quite long, but the project has recently launched a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox.\n\nBut there are many ways to skin a cat. Besides many other zk-based projects, two new competitors sprung up that could go out on the market sooner than expected.\n\nCoti, a payments network and jack of all trades, has announced plans of implementing the V2 of its network as a private Layer-2. It uses a much simpler approach based on Multi-Party Computation and \u201cgarbled inputs,\u201d a technology allowing the encryption of the functions used to transform some inputs into particular outputs. The end result is similar, with Coti enabling a private L2 network with full support for Solidity smart contracts.\n\nAnother project is Fhenix, based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a type of cryptography where the encrypted data can be used for computations without the need to decrypt it. Hence, the information is never public throughout the entire transaction execution process \u2014 it\u2019s end-to-end encryption for Web3.\n\nFHE wasn\u2019t accessible until recently, as its development only gained momentum over the last five years. But now that the development hump is behind us, its implementation is much simpler than zk-proofs.\n\nFhenix also offers a key advantage over zero knowledge thanks to its full EVM compatibility. This means existing Solidity smart contracts can be used with no changes, which makes adoption much simpler. The Fhenix devnet already launched in July 2023, while the public mainnet is due for early 2025. The project is headed by Guy Itzhaki, former FHE executive at Intel, making Fhenix one of the better positioned teams for launching FHE in production.\n\nThe race for private L2s is heating up, and we might start seeing powerful solutions live as soon as next year. When ready, private computation could usher in an era of Blockchain 2.0, unlocking new cases and a much higher adoption ceiling."

        "content": "British multinational bank Standard Chartered has made fresh predictions regarding the U.S. SEC\u2019s potential approval of Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nIn a recent report shared by Bloomberg, Standard Chartered predicted that the U.S. SEC would approve an Ethereum spot ETF launch in May 2024. The financial institution highlighted May 23 as the tentative date for the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs.\n\nIt bears mentioning that May 23 is the final deadline by which the commission must approve or deny Ethereum spot ETF applications from Ark Invest and 21Shares, and VanEck.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, Standard Chartered expects the securities regulator to approve the Ethereum ETF on the final deadline the same way it did on January 10, when multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved at once.\n\nKey Similarities Between ETH and BTC\n\nCommenting, Geoff Kendrick, the head of the Standard Chartered FX Research unit, drew parallels between Bitcoin and Ethereum trajectories. He pointed out that since both crypto assets have similar legal and financial status, they will likely follow the same ETF approval pattern.\n\nNotably, the SEC has excluded Bitcoin and Ethereum from the list of crypto assets it considers to be securities. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum also has a future-based ETF traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). These funds were approved by the SEC.\n\nAs a result, the report suggests that the SEC will approve the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs since Bitcoin now has its own spot-based fund.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nETH to Surge to $4K in May\n\nRecall that Bitcoin surged to around $47,000 days before the SEC finally approved the multiple BTC spot ETFs. The top asset rallied to $48,500 a few hours after the approval.\n\nNotably, Kendrick speculated that if ETH follows the same pattern as BTC, it could rise to $4,000 by the projected May 23, 2024 approval date.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH is changing hands at $2,307, 0.3% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAside from Standard Chartered, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects the SEC to approve at least one of the multiple Ethereum spot ETF applications by May 2024.\n\nSome asset managers seeking the SEC\u2019s approval to launch Ethereum spot ETFs include BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, and Ark Invest."

        "title": "Here's How Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Sees AI and Crypto Intersecting Beyond Data Storage - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has lent his perspective to the search for intersections between AI and crypto.\n\nButerin delves into the subject, outlining four major categories for this intersection.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder calls for caution as the open-source nature of crypto works at odds with AI.\n\nWith AI and Crypto sharing the limelight in the emerging tech space in recent years, enthusiasts continue to seek intersections between the two fields. At present, dominant narratives include AI decentralization and blockchains providing data storage and tracking for AI models. However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has pushed beyond these in a recent blog post.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Buterin Digs Deeper\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, January 30, Buterin asserted that there were more promising intersections between AI and crypto with the advent of more capable and powerful AI and blockchains.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder outlined potential intersections in four primary categories by likening future roles AI could play in crypto to the components of a game. These categories included AI \u201cas a player in the game,\u201d \u201cas an interface to the game,\u201d \u201cas the rules of the game,\u201d and as the objective of the game,\u201d listed according to their perceived level of viability.\n\n\u201cAI as the Player in the Game\u201d\n\nPer Buterin\u2019s analysis, AI as a player in the game represents the most viable AI-crypto intersection. As explained by the Ethereum co-founder, this category has existed since DEXes gained popularity.\n\n\"Any time there is an exchange, there is an opportunity to make money through arbitrage, and bots can do arbitrage much better than humans can. This use case has existed for a long time, even with much simpler AIs than what we have today, but ultimately it is a very real AI + crypto intersection,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever, Buterin noted that arbitrage bots were not the only example of this AI-crypto intersection. He stated that prediction markets were also exploring this use case, using AIOmen\u2019s, a demo prediction market\u2019s, support for AI players to bolster liquidity and attract large participants.\n\n\u201cAI as an Interface to the Game\u201d\n\nMoving further, the Ethereum co-founder tipped AI as an interface to the game as the next most viable use case. Buterin suggested improving services in this category, like wallet scam detection features with AI.\n\n\"AI could give a much richer human-friendly explanation of what kind of dapp you are participating in, the consequences of more complicated operations that you are signing, whether or not a particular token is genuine \u2026 and so on,\" he wrote.\n\nOn the downside, however, he noted that in this application, scammers may also be able to optimize their efforts to not trigger the wallet\u2019s defenses with access to the AI assistant due to crypto\u2019s open-source nature.\n\n\u201cAI as the Rules of the Game\u201d\n\nApplying AI as the rules of the game would see DAOs and smart contracts cede subjective decision-making to AI. Here, however, the Ethereum co-founder calls for extra caution. At the same time, he points out that the open-source nature of crypto again works against the model, allowing an exploiter the chance to create optimized attacks to trick the system.\n\nWhile he concedes that this concern can be theoretically addressed with zero knowledge proofs, he points out that, in practice, this approach is computationally cumbersome.\n\n\u201cAI as the Objective of the Game\u201d\n\nIn the final application, Buterin points to the development of decentralized and trusted AI that applications can be built on to eliminate bias and unfair treatment. However, he points out that to achieve this, developers would have to create \u201ctrustworthy black-box AIs\u201d whose contents are not known by anyone and are trained through some combination of blockchain technology and multi-party computation.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAside from the categories highlighted by Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, a growing class of blockchain tools is also being built to help users identify AI-generated content. An example of this is the recently launched Fox Verify tool.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe intersection of AI and crypto has become a trending narrative in crypto circles. Buterin\u2019s most recent blog post takes a deeper look at what these intersections could be.\n\nRead this for more on Buterin\u2019s views on AI:\n\nHow Vitalik Thinks Decentralization Fits into an AI Future\n\n\n\nLearn about Polygon zkEVM\u2019s plan to reward users:\n\nPolygon zkEVM To Reward Users in DeFi \u201cRamp Up\u201d Campaign"

        "content": "The gradual roll-out of the Dencun upgrade continues within the Ethereum ecosystem \u2014 this time with no hiccups \u2014 as the multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) upgrade is activated on the Sepolia testnet.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, the Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, introducing several EIPs, including EIP-4844, which enables proto-danksharding, a highly anticipated improvement touted to reduce layer-2 transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\n\nUnlike the activation of Dencun on Goerli, which suffered a four-hour delay caused by a bug that prevented the testnet from finalizing the upgrade, Sepolia\u2019s upgrade was carried out without incident on Jan. 30, as highlighted by Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano:\n\nDencun, the next Ethereum network upgrade, has now been activated on the Sepolia testnet and went off without a hitch!\n\n\n\nNext up is the final testnet upgrade, Holesky, and if all goes well, we can expect Dencun to launch on mainnet sometime in March.\n\n\n\nEIP-4844 is coming. \u2014 sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) January 31, 2024\n\nGalaxy Digital researcher Christine Kim suggested in an X post that the odds of the mainnet activation of Dencun were increasingly favorable but still dependent on the activation of the upgrade on Ethereum\u2019s final Holesky testnet. The last testnet upgrade is scheduled for Feb. 7.\n\nfwiw, based on how smoothly sepolia went today, id say odds of a mainnet activation for dencun in march is now 70%, up from 60%.\n\n\n\nodds only get stronger if holesky upgrade next wednesday also goes smoothly! https://t.co/c5gV6NLrmL \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) January 30, 2024\n\nEthereum Foundation DevOps member Parithosh Jayanthi also highlighted the uneventful activation of Dencun on Sepolia in an X post.\n\nBlobs are now flowing in Sepolia :D\n\n\n\nUneventful testnet forks are the best ones! https://t.co/HTTVwYcytm pic.twitter.com/Al45RZz95B \u2014 parithosh | (@parithosh_j) January 30, 2024\n\nThe Dencun upgrade includes significant changes to Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layers, as outlined in an official announcement from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper\n\nDencun is set to significantly impact the cost of layer-2 scaling protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem. Proto-danksharding is aimed at reducing the cost of rollups, which typically batch transactions and data off-chain and submit computational proof to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce data blobs that can be sent and attached to blocks. The data stored in blobs is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will be deleted after a certain time period, which is touted to drastically reduce transaction costs.\n\nHappy birthday beacon chain!\n\n\n\nHere's an updated roadmap diagram for where Ethereum protocol development is at and what's coming in what order.\n\n\n\n(I'm sure this is missing a lot, as all diagrams are, but it covers a lot of the important stuff!) pic.twitter.com/puWP7hwDlx \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 2, 2021\n\nLayer-2s stand to gain the most from EIP-4844, with these scaling protocols becoming an increasingly important part of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism following the Merge in 2022, layer-2 networks are increasingly relied upon to provide fast, low-fee transactions for decentralized applications and Ethereum-based platforms. Their performance is also dependent on layer-1 upgrades like Dencun to decrease costs.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "The bank\u2019s report also predicted ETH could hit $4,000 in the lead-up to an approval.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank is eyeing May 23 as the date for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds, according to a report shared with the bank\u2019s clients and reviewed by Unchained.\n\nThe Block first reported the news.\n\nThe SEC is likely to take a strategy similar to the one it took for approving spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to the report. If approved, Ethereum ETFs would be the second domino to fall after the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, and be a boon for an industry that has undergone a prolonged bearish period.\n\nRead more: SEC Delays Decision on BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nUnder a section of the report entitled \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s crypto research, wrote that he expects \u201cpending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs.\u201d\n\nKendrick noted that if Ether follows how Bitcoin performed in the lead-up to its ETF approval, its price could hit $4,000 by late May. Ether is currently trading at around $2,370, according to CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual filings,\u201d said an SEC spokesperson when asked for comment. \u201cBroadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR. Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\u201d\n\nStill, the SEC postponing decisions on two ETH ETFs (BlackRock and Fidelity) on Jan. 24 follows the same pattern as its deliberative process when it came to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t seem to agree with Kendrick, however, with a wide range of opinions about whether Ethereum ETFs will even be approved at all.\n\n\u201cBased on market commentary, we believe approval expectations are relatively low, likely below 50%,\u201d wrote Kendrick. Yet, he believes the market is wrong in this case."

        "title": "Analyst Compared Solana To Ethereum ICO Boom, What Does This Mean For SOL Price? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Crypto analyst Santiago Santos recently drew parallels between the Solana and Ethereum networks. As part of his analysis, Santos suggested that Solana had an advantage over Ethereum, something which he believes could cause the former to catch up with the latter soon enough.\n\nSolana\u2019s Recent Run Similar To Ethereum\u2019s ICO Boom\n\nSantos mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Solana is \u201cgoing through what Ethereum did during the ICO boom.\u201d However, unlike then, when it was only whitepapers, Solana has applications seeing meaningful usage and growth, the analyst further claimed. This is one of the reasons why Santos believes that Solana will \u201cconverge on Ethereum faster than most believe.\u201d\n\nThe crypto analyst was referring to Solana\u2019s recent run, with the network seeing a lot of activity. Some of this activity has been credited to the applications and protocols being built on the Solana network. Particularly, the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Jupiter has been drawing a lot of attention to Solana and even recently surpassed Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap in daily trading volume.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is known to have generated significant buzz at the height of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) boom, with a lot of projects swamping the network at the time. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape then happened to give the network an edge, a contributing factor to ETH\u2019s rise to become the second largest crypto token.\n\nSantos\u2019 recent comment echoes a growing belief in the crypto community that Solana may indeed be primed enough to take Ethereum\u2019s place as the King of DeFi. Narratives that have continued to work in Solana\u2019s favor include its speed and cost-effectiveness.\n\nFollowing Santos\u2019 post, another X user hinted that Solana\u2019s adoption rate would probably be higher than Ethereum\u2019s, considering users don\u2019t have to worry about high fees.\n\nSOL price loses footing above $100 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nSolana To Hit $150 Soon?\n\nThe significant activity on the Solana network is believed to be one of the catalysts that could drive SOL\u2019s price to $150. Several analysts have continued to highlight that price level as the next significant stop for the crypto token. Moreover, Jupiter is set to airdrop its JUP tokens on January 31.\n\nThis highly anticipated event will cause new money to flow into the Solana ecosystem, with SOL\u2019s price likely to be positively impacted by this splurge of liquidity. Beyond Jupiter, other DeFi projects on Solana are making waves, and these projects could also launch their native tokens at some point in the year.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at just over $100, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from The Block, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Pick one of the Ethereum online casinos from our list\n\nBegin by selecting a reputable Ethereum casino from a trusted source. Consider factors such as security, reputation, and game selection. Also, check user reviews to make an informed choice.\n\n2. Open an account\n\nVisit the chosen Ethereum casino's website and sign up for an account. Provide the required information, including a valid email address and a password. Some casinos may require additional verification steps to ensure security.\n\n3. Buy Ethereum\n\nTo fund your account, you'll need to purchase Ethereum. Use cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance or Kraken to buy Ethereum.\n\nOf course, ETH isn\u2019t the only digital currency you can use. For instance, Binance Coin casinos are widely esteemed in the market. You should always take note of the different cryptocurrencies that you can use.\n\nIt's advisable to avoid platforms that may penalize gamblers. Follow the exchange's instructions to create an account.\n\nComplete the necessary verification process, and purchase Ethereum using fiat currency or other cryptos.\n\n4. Prepare your Ethereum\n\nOnce you have obtained Ethereum, it's important to store it in a secure wallet. Choose a non-custodial or hosted wallet that provides you with full control over your funds.\n\nPopular options include hardware wallets like Ledger or software wallets like MetaMask. Follow the wallet provider's instructions to set up and secure your Ethereum wallet.\n\n5. Check your account's deposit address\n\nIn your Ethereum casino account, navigate to the deposit section. You will find a unique deposit address, which is a cryptographic code or public key.\n\nDouble-check this address to ensure accuracy. Avoid sending funds to the wrong destination.\n\n6. Deposit and start playing\n\nTransfer the desired amount of Ethereum from your wallet to the provided address. Initiate the transaction from your wallet, following the prompts.\n\nOnce the ETH is successfully transferred, it will appear in your account balance. Next, you can start playing your favorite games.\n\n7. Withdraw your winnings\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to win, you can withdraw your winnings. Navigate to the withdrawal section of your casino account, and enter the desired amount.\n\nProvide the wallet address where you want to receive your Ethereum. Review the transaction details carefully, and confirm the request.\n\nThe Ethereum will be sent to your specified wallet address. You can manage it from there.\n\nHow To Select Your Ethereum Casino\n\nWhen you choose an Ethereum casino, there are several factors to consider. Let's explore each of these aspects in detail.\n\nAvailable payment systems and cryptos for deposit\n\nLook for Ethereum casinos that offer a wide range of payment methods. The emphasis should be on cryptocurrencies to deposit. The more options available, the better it is for you.\n\nLook for casinos that explicitly state their acceptance of Ethereum or cryptocurrencies. It's also a great feature if they support other cryptos like Bitcoin or Litecoin.\n\nAdditionally, consider sites that regularly add new currencies, as you might want to diversify your deposit options.\n\nYou should stick with casinos that accept fiat payment methods alongside cryptocurrencies. Ensure that the casino supports popular and reputable payment methods.\n\nThe list should include credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets. A wide variety of payment options increases flexibility and convenience.\n\nWithdrawal speed and limits on Ethereum casinos\n\nEthereum transactions are known for their speed. However, some sites may introduce additional validation steps. This could delay your withdrawals.\n\nEnsure that the withdrawal speed offered by the casino is at least close to what ETH allows.\n\nAlso, check the withdrawal limits imposed by the Ethereum casino. This will ensure they align with your betting preferences and financial goals.\n\nAside from this, also assess the transaction fees associated with depositing Ethereum.\n\nSome casinos may charge additional fees for cryptocurrency deposits. In fact, this should be one of the main factors in your decision-making process.\n\nConsider casinos that offer competitive or low transaction fees, as this will maximize your betting budget.\n\nGames quality, variety, and exclusivity\n\nThe quality and variety of games available at an Ethereum casino are crucial factors. Look for casinos that offer a wide selection of high-quality games.\n\nThey should come from top software providers. Exclusive or proprietary games can also enhance your gaming experience, and give you unique offerings.\n\nLook for games from the leaders such as Microgaming and NetEnt. Other good options are Betsoft, Evolution, and Yggdrasil, among others.\n\nYou should also be aware of the Return to Player (RTP) percentage of specific games.\n\nStick with Ethereum casinos that welcome users from your country\n\nDifferent countries have varying laws and regulations regarding online gambling.\n\nYou should select an Ethereum casino that welcomes users from your country. This ensures compliance with local laws.\n\nYou can also mitigate legal risks and enjoy better protection of your information.\n\nETH casinos that cater to specific countries tailor their platforms to users\u2019 preferences. This can result in a more localized user experience, with relevant and varied language options, and better customer support availability during the day.\n\nIn addition, you can expect region-specific promotions or bonuses.\n\nYou should always pay close attention to the casino's terms and conditions, avoiding sites with unclear wording.\n\nReputation\n\nConsider the reputation of the Ethereum casino before making your choice. Look for casinos with robust security features and appropriate licenses.\n\nCuracao licensing is a standard in the crypto space, but be aware that it can be relatively easy to get.\n\nSearch for any complaints or feedback from players to gain insights into their experiences and the reliability of the site.\n\nEngage in thorough research by reading user reviews and ratings. Feedback from other users can provide valuable insights into the reliability and security.\n\nYou should pay particular attention to any positive or negative comments regarding payment systems and deposits.\n\nPromotions, bonuses, and VIP benefits on Ethereum casinos\n\nExamine the promotions and bonuses offered by the Ethereum casino. Look for welcome bonuses and deposit offers.\n\nYou also want to check VIP benefits, and other bonuses, including those specific to Ethereum. Understand the wagering requirements associated with these bonuses, and look for VIP benefits with bigger bonuses, free spins, or special gifts.\n\nAlso, make sure you consider what the casino offers in terms of rewards for loyal players. Here is a little more information about specific bonuses.\n\nWelcome bonuses\n\nThese are rewards for players and a way to attract them to join the platform. These bonuses usually come in the form of a percentage match on the initial deposit. This provides players with extra funds to explore the games.\n\nWelcome bonuses can boost your bankroll and increase your chances of winning.\n\nDeposit bonuses\n\nOffered to players who make subsequent deposits after the initial one. These bonuses can be structured as a match percentage or a fixed bonus.\n\nEthereum casinos run promotions where they match a certain percentage of a player's deposit so that you get more funds to play with. Deposit bonuses are a popular feature that allows players to extend their gameplay.\n\nFree spins\n\nMany Ethereum casinos offer free spins as part of their bonus packages. Free spins allow players to spin the reels of selected slot games. They provide an excellent opportunity to try out different slot titles.\n\nIn this way, you can potentially win real money without risking your own capital.\n\nNo deposit bonus\n\nSome Ethereum casinos offer no deposit bonuses that do not require a deposit. These bonuses are usually provided as a small amount of free funds. They can also be in the form of free spins upon registration.\n\nNo deposit bonuses give players a chance to explore the casino's offerings.\n\nCustomer support\n\nEvaluate the customer support provided by the Ethereum casino. Live chat support that responds promptly in your language is essential.\n\nThe support team should also be easy to find and efficient when it solves any queries. It\u2019s always helpful to test the support before making a deposit.\n\nFavor end-to-end Ethereum casinos\n\nIt is recommended to choose end-to-end Ethereum casinos, as they provide a complete crypto experience. These brands not only accept crypto deposits but also allow players to use their native currency.\n\nBe cautious of casinos that only accept crypto as a deposit method. They could convert the funds into another currency, and impose additional fees and spreads.\n\nBy considering these factors when selecting an Ethereum casino, you can make an informed decision. This will ensure an enjoyable and secure gambling experience.\n\nOur Review Process for ETH Casinos\n\nOur review process for Ethereum casinos involves the following step-by-step procedure.

Here are the reasons why you should choose ETH casinos today!\n\nGeo restrictions are a thing of the past\n\nIf you opt for an Ethereum casino, you definitely have fewer geo-restrictions. This is because it operates on a decentralized blockchain and is therefore accessible to players worldwide. This allows individuals from different regions to engage in online gambling activities.\n\nOn this note, it\u2019s important to underline that online gambling regulations vary from country to country. It is unwise to try and gamble in a country where online casinos play is banned.\n\nFaster transactions, higher limits\n\nWhen you pick an Ethereum casino, you can enjoy faster payments and higher limits. Ethereum speeds up transactions, so you can add or take out money faster than with other methods.\n\nWith Ethereum, there are no middlemen or third-party processors involved.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum casinos often allow higher limits. This means you have more flexibility and can bet larger amounts.\n\nEthereum's decentralized nature helps handle financial transactions efficiently. As a result, you have higher limits for deposits and withdrawals. This is useful if you like to bet big or need the freedom to manage your transactions.\n\nYour ETH balance could increase over time\n\nOn traditional online casinos, your winnings are paid out in fiat currency. On the other hand, Ethereum casinos allow you to gamble and accumulate Ethereum cryptocurrency.\n\nThe value of Ethereum has shown significant growth over the years. This makes it a possibly promising investment.\n\nThen, when you gamble with Ethereum, you can win prizes and also profit from the growth in value of your Ethereum holdings.\n\nYet don\u2019t forget that when you use Ethereum for gambling, the value of your balance can rise or fall. It will depend on the market price of Ethereum.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum increases, your balance could also increase. As a result, you can get additional gains.\n\nBut it's important to note that this applies to Ethereum and not stablecoins because these maintain a stable value by following major currencies.\n\nEthereum casinos give you higher privacy and anonymity\n\nPlaying on Ethereum casinos offers the advantage of higher privacy and anonymity. This is certainly superior to what you find with traditional online casinos.\n\nWhen you engage in gambling activities at Ethereum casinos, you can enjoy a greater level of privacy. Indeed, your personal information is not directly linked to your transactions.\n\nInstead of providing sensitive personal details, you can use your Ethereum wallet address.\n\nAnonymous casinos provide an added layer of security so that your identity and financial information are safe from breaches or misuse.\n\nNo bank involvement\n\nBy leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Ethereum casinos offer a more private experience.\n\nAs a result, when you play at Ethereum casinos, your bank or financial partner won't know about it. Ethereum transactions are pseudonymous, and your protection is huge.\n\nWith these platforms, you have a level of anonymity that isn\u2019t possible with traditional banking methods.\n\nCutting-edge sites\n\nEthereum casinos are often at the forefront of innovation. Not only do they take full advantage of blockchain technology to create immersive experiences, but also provide seamless user journeys and visually appealing interfaces.\n\nEthereum casinos are well-made and high-tech, so you can have a good time while playing.\n\nThey also offer a better user experience and modern designs. Aside from this, their interfaces are usually mobile-friendly. All these benefits enhance convenience and accessibility for players.\n\nSome Ethereum casinos even offer dedicated mobile apps, making them similar to the top real-money mobile casinos. This makes it possible to access your favorite games on the go.\n\nThe emphasis on innovation and user-centric design ensures that you have an engaging experience.\n\nCrypto or fiat?\n\nCrypto offers a decentralized and transparent financial system that operates independently of traditional banking institutions.\n\nChoosing Ethereum allows you to embrace the world of cryptocurrencies over traditional currencies.\n\nCrypto is considered cool and new, with many enthusiasts finding the concept and technology behind cryptocurrencies exciting. You too can now become part of this growing community.\n\nCrypto gives autonomy\n\nWith Ethereum, you don't need permission from any central authority. It's a decentralized system that empowers individuals with control over their money.\n\nYou can transact freely and securely, without relying on third parties. As a result, you enjoy the freedom in managing your finances.\n\nThe Cons of Using Ethereum Casinos\n\nWhile Ethereum casinos offer numerous advantages, it's important to consider the potential disadvantages. Let's explore these drawbacks in detail.\n\nA largely unregulated sector\n\nThe Ethereum casino industry operates in a legal gray zone due to the absence of regulation. Obtaining a Curacao license is common and easy.\n\nHowever, it may not provide the same level of protection as stricter regulatory bodies. Trust in an Ethereum casino often relies on its historical reputation within the crypto space.\n\nOne of the main concerns with a largely unregulated sector is the potential for fraud and scams. Without proper regulation, it becomes easier for malicious actors to create fake casinos or crypto bookmakers.\n\nThey can also manipulate the outcomes of bets. This can lead to individuals losing their hard-earned money without any legal protection.\n\nA lack of recourse\n\nThere is also no standardized system for dispute resolution. If a user has an issue with a bet or a payout, there is no governing body or regulatory authority to turn to for assistance.\n\nThis lack of accountability can result in frustration and financial loss.\n\nAnother drawback is the risk of money laundering and illegal activities. In an unregulated environment, it becomes easier for individuals to use ETH and launder money.\n\nThe lack of KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols and identity verification makes this issue worse.\n\nTransfers irreversibility\n\nEthereum transactions are processed quickly, with low fees. Sometimes, you won\u2019t face any limits. However, one of the downsides is the irreversibility of these transactions.\n\nIt is crucial to be extremely cautious when using a deposit address. Even a small error can result in sending your Ethereum to the wrong recipient. This means that you won\u2019t be able to recover your funds.\n\nThis lack of reversibility increases the importance of due diligence and caution. Be aware that errors or fraudulent activities can result in permanent losses.\n\nLess help if you have issues\n\nSince Ethereum casinos operate outside the traditional banking system, you need to do your research carefully to choose trustworthy Ethereum casinos.\n\nReliable brands are so crucial to play on because they always prioritize customer support and fair play.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in traditional casinos, regulatory bodies enforce responsible gambling practices. They also ensure that operators adhere to strict guidelines.\n\nHowever, in the unregulated Ethereum casino, there are no such mechanisms. This could make players more vulnerable.\n\nKnowing how to use Ethereum\n\nIf you decide to play on an Ethereum casino, you need to be familiar with crypto. For instance, it\u2019s vital to know how to create and manage an Ethereum wallet and interact with smart contracts.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to learn how to navigate decentralized applications. This technical expertise could be a challenge for individuals new to crypto.\n\nUsers should also be aware of gas fees; that is, transaction fees paid to miners for processing transactions on the network.\n\nThe fluctuating nature of gas fees can impact the overall cost of casino betting. This is why users have to stay informed and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nVolatility of ETH value\n\nBeing a cryptocurrency, Ethereum can fluctuate in price, which could have a direct impact on the value of bets and payouts.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of ETH's value introduces an element of risk. This is not a great thing for individuals looking for stable betting environments.\n\nThis volatility of ETH value could eventually affect the profitability of casino and crypto sports betting platforms, as operators of Ethereum betting platforms need to account for the fluctuations in ETH price.\n\nThis is especially the case when determining the odds and setting the payout ratios.\n\nWhat Sorts of Games Are Available on Ethereum Casinos?\n\nEthereum casinos offer a wide variety of games to cater to different preferences and interests. Here are some of the popular game categories you can find on Ethereum casino.s\n\nETH casino classics\n\nEthereum casinos feature classic casino games that have been enjoyed by players for decades.\n\nThese include card games like crypto blackjack and baccarat. Players can test their skills and strategies as they aim to beat the dealer.\n\nOne of the most popular classic games is blackjack. This card game of skill and strategy challenges players to beat the dealer. They need to get a hand value as close to 21.\n\nEthereum blackjack offers the same thrilling gameplay as its traditional counterpart. However, you\u2019ll enjoy added benefits such as secure transactions and transparent gameplay\u2026\n\nOther \u201cclassics\u201d include roulette, slots, and video poker.\n\nLive casino games with Ethereum\n\nEthereum casinos also offer live casino games. They provide a captivating and authentic gaming experience.\n\nPlayers can engage in real-time gameplay with professional dealers, and also have the chance to interact with other participants.\n\nNotable providers such as Evolution Gaming and Pragmatic Play offer high-quality live casino games. Some of them are live blackjack, live roulette, live baccarat, and live poker.\n\nThese games are hosted by professional dealers who conduct the gameplay. The action happens in real-time through high-quality video streaming.\n\nLive games feature various betting options and table limits and cater to players of different preferences. The availability of live games with Ethereum ensures that you can find your favorite titles.\n\nEthereum Crash games\n\nCrash games have gained popularity in the Ethereum casino space. It's a thrilling and fast-paced game that offers the opportunity for big winnings.\n\nIn Ethereum Crash Games players bet on the \"crash point\" of a rising multiplier. The multiplier starts at a certain value and continues to rise until it suddenly crashes.\n\nThe goal is to predict the point at which the multiplier will crash. You have to cash out your bet before it happens.\n\nOne benefit of Ethereum Crash gambling is the potential for substantial winnings. As the multiplier continues to rise, so do the potential rewards.\n\nOther provably fair games\n\nEthereum casinos often feature provably fair games. They use blockchain technology to ensure transparency. These games include Mines, Plinko, Dice, Hi-Lo, and others.\n\nPlayers can verify the integrity of the game outcomes. They can enjoy the excitement of these provably fair options.\n\nWhat Is the #1 Exchange for Ethereum Casinos?\n\nChoosing an exchange for Ethereum casinos requires considering several factors. Some of them are reliability, security, and fees. While there are several exchanges available, we recommend Binance as the top choice.\n\nBinance is a widely recognized and reputable exchange. It comes with a user-friendly platform and a range of features.\n\nIt has established itself as a trusted platform in the crypto space. Binance has a strong track record in terms of security and reliability.\n\nOne of the pros of using Binance for casino Ethereum is the competitive fee structure. Binance offers relatively low transaction fees.\n\nThis allows users to maximize their funds for crypto gambling purposes. It could be beneficial for frequent gamblers who want to minimize costs.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Binance is that it welcomes gamblers. This is crucial to note, as some exchanges may freeze accounts if they are used for gambling transactions.\n\nHowever, Binance has a more open approach and does not penalize users.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Using Ethereum on Casinos\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). This is the primary method of value exchange within the ETH ecosystem.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons of using it for online gambling.\n\nPros of using Ethereum on online casinos\n\nHere are a few reasons why gamblers can\u2019t get enough of ETH:\n\nFast and secure transactions: Ethereum offers fast and secure transactions and allows quick deposits and withdrawals on casinos that accept it.

Discover SCENE\n\nIf Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin ever aspired to be the face of the cryptocurrency space, he doesn't want be that anymore.\n\nButerin published a blog post Wednesday in which he meditated on the \"end of his childhood\" as a young pioneer in crypto, marking a transition in the industry. Buterin also mapped out his vision for the future growth of Ethereum and decentralization.\n\nButerin founded Ethereum in 2013 at the age of 19, quickly becoming a leading voice in the booming crypto industry. Now approaching 30, he writes, \"if that was ever my role, it is no longer.\" Buterin sees new, even younger innovators taking leading roles across crypto and related technologies like synthetic biology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I am now in some different kind of role, and it is time for the next generation to take up the mantle that used to be mine,\" Buterin reflected.\n\n\"One of my most striking memories from my last two years was speaking at hackathons, visiting hacker houses, and doing Zuzalu in Montenegro, and seeing people a full decade younger than myself taking on leading roles, as organizers or as developers, in all kinds of projects,\" he wrote.\n\nZuzalu is a gathering of about 200 high-ranking names in crypto, pharmaceuticals, politics, and academia who spent two months abandoning their respective lives and identities to become the first citizens of a new civilization\u2014one founded among the resort hotels and Airbnbs of Lustica Bay, Montenegro, and tasked with envisioning what they consider to be a new future for humanity. It's a \"pop-up city community\u201d conceived by Buterin.\n\nHe also shared that the majority of his decisions concerning Ethereum were made as a response to other people's pressures and requests.\n\n\"When I met Vladimir Putin in 2017, I did not try to arrange the meeting; rather, someone else suggested it, and I pretty much said 'ok sure',\" he writes. \"Now, five years later, I finally realized that (i) I had been complicit in legitimizing a genocidal dictator, and (ii) within the crypto space too, I no longer had the luxury of sitting back and letting mystical 'other people' run the show.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Ethereum founder argued the crypto community should \"create an entire decentralized tech stack\" to \"compete with centralized tech companies at every level,\" spanning finance, identity, communications and more. He provided a chart outlining this vision for a parallel structure, from stablecoins to replace banks to encrypted messaging replacing big tech messaging platforms.\n\nButerin also focused heavily on the human element enabling decentralization, analyzing the differing motivations between token speculators, builders, intellectuals and end users. \"There is an opportunity to improve understanding between the four groups,\" Buterin wrote, noting financial incentives are not everything.\n\nBy visiting crypto communities worldwide from Argentina to Taiwan, Buterin highlighted the diversity of needs and ideals driving adoption\u2014from inflation troubles to academic curiosity. \"If places like Silicon Valley are frontiers, filled with abstract far-mode thinking about a better future, places like Argentina are frontlines, filled with an active drive to meet challenges that need to be handled today,\" he wrote.\n\nAs the \"characters\" of crypto's early years exit, Buterin concluded decentralization itself persists by creating new communities: \"Continuing to stay active and doing what we can to create the new is a task for each one of us.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Solana Dominates Stablecoin Market, Surpassing Ethereum and Tron Jan 31, 2024\n\nSolana Dominates Stablecoin Market, Surpassing Ethereum and Tron\n\nIn a groundbreaking development, Solana has emerged as the leading blockchain for stablecoin transactions, surpassing longstanding giants Ethereum and Tron. The surge in stablecoin transfer volumes on Solana reflects a monumental shift in investor behavior and market dynamics, signaling unprecedented transformations within the crypto landscape.\n\nSolana\u2019s Market Share Soars, Reflecting a Significant Milestone\n\nA recent data analysis by leading crypto insights provider Artemis highlights a remarkable transformation in Solana\u2019s market share, skyrocketing from a mere 1.17% to an impressive 33.76% within just a year. This exponential growth underscores Solana\u2019s ascension to prominence in facilitating stablecoin transfers, marking a significant milestone for the blockchain network.\n\nThe rise of Solana in stablecoin transfers also underscores the crucial role played by DeFi (Decentralized Finance) in reshaping the crypto landscape. The decentralized nature of the Solana blockchain, combined with its high throughput and low transaction costs, makes it an attractive choice for users engaged in stablecoin transactions.\n\nSolana Sets Record with $497 Billion in Stablecoin Transactions\n\nThroughout January, an unprecedented $497 billion worth of stablecoins were transacted on the Solana blockchain, setting a new record for the platform and signaling its increasing utility and adoption within the broader crypto community. This surge in activity comes amid a growing demand for stablecoins, fueled by optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and positive market forecasts.\n\nSolana\u2019s meteoric rise has reshaped the stablecoin market, outpacing the performance of its competitors. Notably, Solana witnessed a five-fold increase in monthly stablecoin volumes between November and January, surpassing the modest growth observed in Ethereum\u2019s volume and the stagnation in Tron\u2019s stablecoin trades.\n\nUSD Coin (USDC) Dominates on Solana, Driving Surge in Volumes\n\nA closer examination reveals that USD Coin (USDC) has emerged as the dominant stablecoin on the Solana blockchain, capturing over 56% of the total supply, according to DeFiLlama. The significant increase in USDC\u2019s market cap on Solana, along with the resilience of its volumes amid market fluctuations, indicates that USDC transactions have played a pivotal role in driving the overall surge in stablecoin transfer volumes on Solana.\n\nSolana\u2019s Success Prompts Intensified Blockchain Network Competition\n\nLooking ahead, the competition among blockchain networks for stablecoin dominance is likely to intensify. Solana\u2019s success not only signifies a shift in market dynamics but also prompts other blockchain platforms to enhance their capabilities and offerings to meet the evolving demands of the crypto community.\n\nIn tandem with Solana\u2019s triumph in the stablecoin arena, the network\u2019s native token, SOL, has witnessed a resurgence in bullish momentum, surpassing the $100 mark for the first time in over two weeks. This uptick in SOL\u2019s value further underscores the network\u2019s robustness and investor confidence, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nSolana\u2019s Ascent Signals a New Era of Innovation in DeFi\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve and adapt to changing dynamics, Solana\u2019s ascent as the premier blockchain for stablecoin transactions heralds a new era of innovation and growth within the decentralized finance ecosystem. With its unparalleled scalability, speed, and efficiency, Solana stands poised to redefine the future of digital transactions and reshape the global financial landscape."

        "title": "Ethereum to $20,000: Analyst Sees Spot Ethereum ETFs Fueling Bull Run - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A crypto analyst, Eric, believes Ethereum (ETH) could spike to $20,000 in the upcoming bull run. The analyst said the potential launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States will propel this upswing.\n\nEthereum To $20,000 Possible\n\nIn a post on X, Eric cited Ethereum\u2019s historical tendency to mirror Bitcoin (BTC), albeit with a one-cycle lag. In the previous bull market, the analyst noted that Bitcoin surged 22-fold from $3,100 to $69,000. Therefore, if Ethereum follows a similar trajectory, reaching $20,000 would be a realistic possibility.\n\nAs the analyst noted, Ethereum\u2019s recent bear market bottom of $880 in 2022, if extrapolated using the 22x growth rate seen in BTC, places the coin at $19,360. However, the analyst believes Ethereum might surpass expectations, making $20,000 a base and a psychological round number to monitor closely.\n\nSupporting this forecast is the possible approval of a spot Ethereum ETFs. Like the spot Bitcoin ETF, this authorization will likely attract institutional investors and significantly boost Ethereum prices and liquidity. Institutional investors can gain exposure to Ethereum through these complex derivative products without the complexities of directly trading or storing the coin.\n\nWhile the optimism remains, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely follow the same path it took before approving the first spot of Bitcoin ETFs in January. For context, the strict agency failed to approve any spot Bitcoin ETF for over ten years, citing market manipulation risks and the absence of proper monitoring tools.\n\nWill The US SEC Approve A Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nHowever, in a recent statement by The Block, Standard Chartered, a global bank, said the US SEC will likely approve Ethereum ETF\u2019s first spot in May 2023. By then, the bank added, ETH prices will be trading at around $4,000, propelled by general market optimism.\n\nThe bank notes that the failure of the agency to classify ETH as a security further adds weight to this expectation. At the same time, Grayscale Investments, which is issuing Grayscale Ethereum Trusts (ETHE), wants to convert this product into an ETF. Each share traded at around $20 as of January 30.\n\n\n\nEarlier, Grayscale won against the US SEC\u2019s arguments, wishing to prevent the conversion of their Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. This win set the ball rolling for the eventual approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Ethereum Futures ETFs were recently approved and listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a net positive, paving the way for a potential listing in May 2024.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Spikes Up 10% and ETH Approaches $2,500 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nAmidst a rally that has seen Bitcoin (BTC) spike over 10%, crossing the $43,000 threshold, and Ethereum (ETH) approach the $2,500 mark, the crypto market is riding a wave of bullish momentum. This surge sparks an intense focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions as investors gauge the sustainability of this uptrend.\n\nThis remarkable uptrend is partly fueled by Grayscale\u2019s decreased Bitcoin sales, injecting a wave of optimism among investors and contributing to the positive market sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the buoyant performance of the US stock market and Google\u2019s renewed acceptance of Bitcoin ads have further bolstered BTC prices.\n\n#Bitcoin pump as market await Fed #rate verdict. If #btc fails to break this trend line to the upside, this could be a trap. pic.twitter.com/dcS0qQwQJA \u2014 Nelson Julius (@hbdherculean) January 30, 2024\n\nHowever, with the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting casting a shadow of uncertainty, investors are on edge.\n\nThe meeting\u2019s outcome, along with the January job numbers, could significantly impact Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions, making this a critical moment for potential buyers and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nBitcoin Price Rises as Whales Gain Confidence\n\n\n\nThe global digital asset industry witnessed a brief surge as Bitcoin reclaimed the $43k level, leading to a 2% increase in the total market cap to $1.66 trillion within 24 hours.\n\nDespite a temporary drop to $38k, Bitcoin whales showed confidence by accumulating more BTC, with 67 new entities now holding 1,000 BTC or more, indicating a 4.50% increase in two weeks.\n\nThis surge positions Bitcoin for its fifth consecutive monthly gain, marking the longest streak since the pandemic-era rally. The recent boost is attributed to the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity, contributing to positive market sentiment.\n\nBITCOIN WHALES ACCUMULATED $3 BILLION IN JANUARY, SURPASSING ETF INFLOWS Bitcoin whale wallets holding >1,000 BTC have amassed a staggering $3 billion worth of BTC in January.

This is a big deal because it means companies like VanEck and BlackRock can now reach more people through Google, increasing awareness and attracting more investors.\n\nThis move shows that cryptocurrencies are gaining acceptance in finance. However, there are risks, like scams. Google says they\u2019ll enforce rules globally to prevent misuse.\n\nAll in all, Google allowing Bitcoin ETF ads is a major step in making cryptocurrencies more mainstream, but everyone should stay informed and careful in this evolving market.\n\nGM!\u2600\ufe0f#Bitcoin ETF ads are live on Google! Bull run on its way\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/YKEou4EZnw \u2014 EvanLuthra.eth (@EvanLuthra) January 30, 2024\n\nConsequently, the news of Google allowing ads for Bitcoin ETFs could positively impact BTC prices by increasing visibility and attracting more investors, fostering mainstream acceptance and potentially contributing to a price uptick.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s technical posture on January 30 presents a pivotal moment for traders, as evidenced by its latest chart structure. Currently, Bitcoin trades narrowly above its pivot point, marked by the green line at $42,491. This level serves as a fulcrum for the price action, with immediate resistance waiting at $42,710. Beyond that, the subsequent resistance levels are charted at $42,989 and $43,769, potentially capping upward movements. Conversely, supports are arranged below, providing a safety net at $42,491, followed by more substantial floors at $41,675 and $40,586. These levels will be crucial if Bitcoin experiences a downturn. The RSI indicator, positioned at 65, suggests that the market is approaching overbought territory but not excessively so, hinting at a tempered bullish momentum. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum\u2019s price action, as of the latest four-hour chart snapshot, suggests a market in cautious ascent. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $2,346.5, with the pivot point established at $2357.7, indicated by the green line. Resistance levels are delineated at $2,359.5, $2,423.1, and $2,477.2, each forming a potential ceiling for upward price movements. On the downside, immediate support is found at $2,286.3, with further cushions at $2,263.9 and the more definitive level at $2,240.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment without veering into overbought territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,263.9 provides additional support, reinforcing the positive bias as the current price is hovering above this line. Observing Ethereum\u2019s chart patterns, we see a recent break above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, typically a bullish sign. However, the proximity to the pivot point warrants vigilance, as a drop below could quickly shift the trend."

        "content": "Wed 31 Jan 2024 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAccording to recent analyses by Standard Chartered, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States could be on the verge of approving a spot-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum as early as May. This prospect, long sought after by investors and market players in the crypto space, could not only further validate Ethereum as an institutional investment asset but could also propel its price to unprecedented heights.\n\nToward a regulatory revolution?\n\nStandard Chartered Bank anticipates an imminent approval of the spot-based Ethereum (ETH) ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States, a move that could propel the price of ETH to $4,000.\n\nAccording to Geoff Kendrick, head of forex and crypto research at Standard Chartered, the SEC is likely to follow a similar process to that used for Bitcoin spot ETFs, starting with initial rejections and eventually granting approval at the first final deadline, scheduled for May 23. This anticipation is based on the belief that the SEC has no fundamental reason to treat ETH differently from Bitcoin, especially given that ETH is also listed as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nImplications and optimism about the price of Ethereum\n\nThe expected approval of the Ethereum spot ETFs is seen as a major catalyst for the price of ETH, with a projection of nearly a 70% increase from current levels. This outlook is even more plausible considering that ETH could experience less selling pressure post-approval compared to BTC, notably because of the relatively smaller market share of the Grayscale Ethereum Fund (ETHE) compared to that of the Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC). The bank also highlights that, contrary to BTC, ETH has not been categorized as a security in the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against crypto companies, thus strengthening the argument for its approval. In addition, the presence of ETH on regulated platforms and its exclusion from the list of 67 cryptocurrencies considered securities by the SEC in its case against Ripple add to its favorable case.\n\nBeyond the impact on price, the approval of an Ethereum ETF could significantly accelerate the adoption of Ethereum as a foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain innovations. By providing a regulated and secure path for institutional investment, an Ethereum ETF would broaden the pool of potential investors, including those who have hitherto been reluctant to engage directly with the crypto space due to security concerns, volatility, or transaction complexity. This new wave of investment could provide the necessary funds to further develop Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, thus supporting innovation and growth in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the approval of an Ethereum ETF represents an exciting opportunity for the future of Ethereum and for the broader adoption of cryptos, it comes with a complex set of regulatory and financial challenges. How these challenges will be addressed will determine not only the success of the Ethereum ETF but also the extent to which Ethereum can realize its potential as a pillar of decentralized finance and blockchain innovation.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The blockchain world revolves around titans, and Cardano vs Ethereum stands shoulder-to-shoulder among them. Both are Layer 1 solutions, fueling decentralized applications (dApps) and shaping the future of finance and beyond. But choosing between them can feel like picking between fire and ice\u2014each offers unique strengths and vulnerabilities.\n\nIn this deep dive, we\u2019ll crack open the vaults of these blockchain behemoths, examining their ins and outs. Get ready to discover which platform might ignite your dApp dreams and freeze out the competition.\n\nCardano vs Ethereum: Key differences\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s dive into the comparison and find out the difference between Cardano vs Ethereum.\n\n1. Philosophy\n\nEthereum was envisioned as a multi-purpose platform, a \u201cworld computer\u201d for dApps and smart contracts. Its early arrival allowed it to gain a substantial foothold, attracting a vast community of developers and users.\n\nThe platform\u2019s development style is agile and responsive, with a focus on accommodating a wide array of applications, including financial services, games, and social networks. This approach has made Ethereum akin to a marketplace.\n\nIn contrast, Cardano, introduced by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), adopts a more methodical and academic approach. Its development is distinguished by a strong emphasis on peer-reviewed research and formal verification methods.\n\nThis philosophy underscores a commitment to high assurance code and a rigorous process for protocol upgrades, aiming to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and unintended consequences.\n\n2. Architecture\n\nEthereum\u2019s architecture is based on a single-layer structure. It features a blockchain for recording transactions, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for executing smart contracts and dApps, and Ether (ETH) as its currency.\n\nThis single-layer architecture, while effective for Ethereum\u2019s broad range of applications, can lead to network congestion, higher transaction fees, and scalability challenges.\n\nThat\u2019s where Layer 2 scaling solutions come into play. Layer 2 solutions, like rollups, state channels, and sidechains, enhance scalability and speed by offloading transactions from the main chain.\n\nMoreover, sharding splits the Ethereum network into smaller, more manageable parts, each capable of processing transactions and smart contracts independently, enhancing its capacity from within.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano adopts a unique two-layer architecture which includes:\n\nCardano Settlement Layer (CSL)\n\nCardano Computation Layer (CCL)\n\nThe CSL handles the transaction and ledger functions, while the CCL is responsible for smart contract execution. This separation allows for more flexibility and efficiency, as each layer can be optimized independently. This enables it to handle an average of 250 transactions per second (TPS) which is a lot compared to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Cardano also leverages scaling solutions. One of the prominent ones is called Hydra. The use of \u201cHydra Heads\u201d improves transaction throughput and reduces latency. The network also uses Mithril, off-chain computing, and sidechains.\n\nFor a long-term perspective on Cardano\u2019s growth, explore our analysis of whether ADA can reach $1000 by 2040 and the factors that might influence its recovery.\n\n3. Supply\n\nEthereum does not have a capped supply. This leads to fluctuating inflationary and deflationary trends based on network activity.\n\nHigh network activity raises transaction fees, potentially pushing fees above the rate of new Ether issuance, leading to deflationary periods. Conversely, during lower activity, inflation occurs as new supply awarded to stakers outweighs the amount of Ether \u201cburned\u201d (destroyed) in transaction fees.\n\nThis delicate balance between issuance to stakers and fee burning determines Ethereum\u2019s supply trajectory, making it unique in the cryptocurrency landscape. As of January 2024, Ethereum has a circulating supply of 120,182,821 ETH.\n\nUnderstand the economic factors influencing Ethereum by exploring whether Ethereum\u2019s GDP will have a positive impact on ETH.\n\nCardano has a fixed supply cap, set at 45 billion ADA, its native cryptocurrency. This hard cap is intended to prevent inflation, ensuring a predictable and limited supply over time.\n\nThe approach of having a capped supply is akin to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) supply model. As of January 2024, Cardano boasts a much larger circulating supply of 35.4 billion ADA, which constitutes over 78% of the total supply.\n\n4. Governance\n\nEthereum\u2019s approach to governance is characterized by its informality and inclusivity. Unlike some protocols with built-in governance mechanisms, Ethereum relies on Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to propose modifications and enhancements.\n\nThese proposals encompass a wide array of changes, including standards for protocols, contract interfaces, and recommended practices. This system ensures that the evolution of the Ethereum platform is both consistent and collaborative, involving an array of stakeholders from various sectors of the community.\n\nCardano emphasizes a more structured and community-driven approach to governance through its \u201cProject Catalyst\u201d system. Community members can propose and vote on projects, shaping the platform\u2019s development. Moreover, successful proposals are not just acknowledged but are also financially supported, receiving funding directly from Cardano\u2019s treasury.\n\n5. Journey and roadmap\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for Ethereum\u2019s future presents a comprehensive and multi-phased roadmap. Each phase addresses specific aspects of the Ethereum network:\n\nThe Merge: The transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe Surge: Enhancing scalability through rollups and data sharding, increasing transaction speed and efficiency.\n\nThe Scourge: Improving censorship resistance and decentralization, addressing Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and other protocol risks.\n\nThe Verge: Simplifying block verifications to maintain network security and accessibility.\n\nThe Purge: Reduce computational costs for running nodes and optimize data history and state for efficiency.\n\nThe Splurge: Miscellaneous upgrades for overall network enhancement that don\u2019t fit into other categories.\n\nCardano\u2019s roadmap is organized into five distinct phases. Each phase is named after historical figures who made significant contributions in various fields.\n\nThese phases represent the evolutionary stages of the Cardano blockchain, gradually adding functionality and complexity. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each phase:\n\nByron (foundation): Established the Cardano network\u2019s core infrastructure.\n\nEstablished the Cardano network\u2019s core infrastructure. Shelley (decentralization): Covered the transition to a decentralized network structure.\n\nGoguen (smart contracts): Introduction of smart contracts capabilities.\n\nBasho (scaling): Enhancements for scalability and performance.\n\nVoltaire (governance): Implementation of a governance model for network sustainability.\n\nUnderstand the implications of Cardano\u2019s classification in the financial market by exploring our in-depth discussion on whether Cardano is a security and why it matters to investors.\n\nCardano vs Ethereum: Similarities\n\nCardano and Ethereum, despite their distinctions, also align with certain shared objectives.\n\nDecentralization: Both platforms are built on the principles of decentralization, meaning they are not controlled by a central authority.

        "title": "Analyst Anticipates Spot Ethereum ETF Approval by Late May as SEC Delays Decision on Fidelity\u2019s - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) until March 5.\n\nAccording to a filing on Thursday, the SEC cited the need for additional time to evaluate the proposed rule change and the associated issues thoroughly. Fidelity had initially applied for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund in November, referencing a court ruling from the previous year that questioned the SEC\u2019s rationale for rejecting spot crypto ETFs while permitting futures-based products.\n\nNotably, the delay had been widely anticipated, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart expressing his expectation on X, stating, \u201cFidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May, in my view.\u201d Seyffart\u2019s insight suggested that the crucial decisions regarding the Fidelity Ethereum ETF will likely transpire in late May.\n\nLast week, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg noted that they anticipate the SEC will not approve ETFs for alternative crypto tokens, including Ethereum, \u201cany time soon.\u201d The reasoning behind this cautious approach is the SEC\u2019s intention to gain experience from the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs before extending the approval to other cryptocurrencies. He further noted that the expectation is that Ethereum and other crypto token ETFs may face a longer wait, possibly extending beyond the 2024 U.S. presidential elections scheduled for November.\n\nNotably, the SEC recently granted authorization for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to commence trading, prompting speculation within the industry about the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Fidelity, entering the race for a spot Ethereum ETF alongside industry giants BlackRock and Grayscale, is thus poised to play a significant role in shaping the regulatory landscape for Ethereum-related investment products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin highlighted the significance of the SEC approving a spot Ether ETF, citing the inefficiency of existing financial instruments compared to ETFs. He distinguished Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that while Bitcoin serves as a store of value or collateral currency, Ethereum is a commodity that powers transactions and storage on its network.\n\nRecently, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, also expressed his endorsement for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), coming on the heels of the triumphant launch of the asset management giant\u2019s long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF, stating he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nThat said, following the latest development, investors are vigilantly monitoring potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. Notably, the approval of a spot ETH ETF could also serve as a catalyst, paving the way for approvals in the realm of other cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Cardano according to some experts."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Go Up Because of the NFT Industry? - Crypto Head",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a validation of cryptocurrency or any particular provider, service, or product. It should not be taken as advice to engage in trading or use any services. Please check our terms and conditions .\n\nQuick Answer: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that are different from traditional cryptocurrencies due to their non-replicable nature and are often tied to the Ethereum blockchain. The value of NFTs lies in their originality and scarcity, similar to artwork. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain supports NFTs by providing a decentralized platform for smart contracts, which are used to create and trade NFTs. Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency, Ether, is used as a currency and for executing smart contract code, necessary for NFT creation and trade. The relationship between NFTs and Ethereum is symbiotic; as NFTs grow in popularity and value, the demand for Ether may increase, potentially driving up its price. However, this market is new and unpredictable, and both NFTs and Ethereum could fluctuate in value. Investing in NFTs and Ethereum carries risks, including market volatility and security issues. The market is unregulated, and there\u2019s no government protection for investments. It\u2019s important to research and understand the potential for loss. OpenSea is a decentralized NFT marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to trade digital assets directly. Ethereum is also undergoing an upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, aiming to improve scalability, transaction speed, and reduce fees through a transition to proof of stake with the Ethereum merge. Investors should be aware of the risks, including market volatility and security threats from hackers. As with any investment, especially in a new and rapidly changing market like cryptocurrency, thorough research and caution are advised.\n\nBecause non-fungible tokens (NFT) are making waves in the crypto world, experts think other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC), will increase in value.\n\nWill Ethereum go up because of NFTs?\n\nWhen talking about Ethereum and NFT relationship, it is difficult to say so. However, because they both exist in the same ecosystem, it is possible they will both change.\n\nKeep reading, and we\u2019ll look more on how do NFTs work, how are NFTs tied to Ethereum, will Ethereum go up because of NFT, risks, and the future of NFT investing.\n\nWhat Are NFTs\n\nWhat is NFT? Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that owners can exchange with each other. These assets are different from traditional cryptocurrency products because the same tokens cannot replace them.\n\nNFTs are more like artwork, so the value is in the originality, not the replicability.\n\nPeople can sell copies of NFTs, but the original is the one with value. Because only one original exists, it increases in value, especially if other people want to own that NFT.\n\nNFTs differ from crypto because currencies can be replicated with costly mining procedures.\n\nNFTs do not depreciate, like stocks \u2013 yet. As NFTs continue to grow in market value, more users create them for video games in ERC-20 and as pets like Cryptokitties. One of the more popular choices is creating NFTs in virtual land.\n\nETH and Ethereum Blockchain\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference. It was developed by Vitalik Buterin and his co-founders from the ground up to have flexibility and scalability.\n\nEthereum uses a proof-of-work system (POS) where computers compete to solve complex math puzzles called hashes which verify transactions made using ether. This process creates blocks that secure the network and allow users to move funds around freely.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain also allows users to create smart contracts and execute transactions between them. Smart contracts allow for automated agreements between two parties, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries such as lawyers or banks. This technology has been used to build new financial instruments like tokenized securities, which are digital representations of real assets.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Merge?\n\nThe Ethereum network has two different blockchains, one for users and another for developers. This means that each blockchain operates independently from the other.\n\nTo solve this problem, the Ethereum Foundation decided to create a new blockchain called \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d which would be merged into the existing Ethereum blockchain. This process is known as the \u201cmerge\u201c.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is the next generation version of the blockchain technology, which was developed by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThe new version of the platform aims at solving scalability issue, improving transaction speed, and reducing gas fees. This upgrade will be implemented through the Casper protocol, which is based on the proof of stake consensus algorithm.\n\nThe main goal of Ethereum 2.0 is to create a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nWhy is Ethereum Used for NFTs?\n\nAs organizations create more NFTs, they use block-chain currencies to value their companies. For example, Decentraland, an Ethereum-based company, lets users buy virtual land using Ethereum to craft their NFTs.\n\nTo gain access to the world of NFTs, users need to access virtual space. This is where Ethereum and NFT relationship starts.\n\nMany rely on Ethereum, the first brand in the newest cryptocurrency market. Why are NFTs bought with Ethereum? The Ethereum token, called Ether, works as both a currency and a tool for network contracts. Ether powers the Ethereum network as people pay fees using the currency, making trading volume increase rapidly.\n\nIn the virtual world, users need Ethereum to pay for virtual services and to buy items. When a virtual user wants to build an NFT in an Ethereum-based world, the builder needs Ethereum to buy virtual land and supplies and needs Ethereum to execute the code to create the NFT.\n\nEthereum works differently than other cryptocurrencies, because it needs transactions to keep it flourishing, and users need to use the currency to function in Ethereum-based worlds. Each Ethereum transaction involves an incentive and disincentive, as it keeps people working, but prevents spam and bots from blocking work.\n\nNFTs and Ethereum Relationship\n\nNFTs are one-of-a-kind collectibles. In essence, an Ethereum-based token is also a collectible, thus increasing the value based on scarcity.\n\nTo make the NFTs have any value, they need Ethereum to give the collectible value. So, as NFTs increase in value, the Ethereum used to make and purchase it will increase, too.\n\nDevelopers have not created a cryptocurrency that does the job of Ether. In the future, someone might develop a currency that does more than Ether, but at this point, Ethereum is the only one that provides access to services and items. Until the relationship between NFT and Ethereum changes, Ethereum price will be tied to NFT, and vice-versa.\n\nWill NTFs Make Ethereum Go Up?\n\nAs no one can predict the future, the value of Ethereum and NFTs is difficult to predict, much like other crypto prices for that matter. If you are considering investing in one or the other, it is best to do research and consider that you could lose money in the short term or long term. Consider how quickly Bitcoin reached an all time high, then lost it.\n\nPeople who invest in the NFTs see value in the collectible market in the virtual world. On the flip side, people who choose to invest in the Ethereum blockchain understand the value of building the virtual world.\n\nConsider Ethereum like real estate in the virtual world, while NFTs decorate that real estate as digital art. The two co-exist in the virtual ecosystem, but both can change in value.\n\nAs both investment opportunities sound like win-win situations, remember that the virtual world and cryptocurrency is a new market. Unlike the stock market and other traditional investment opportunities, the virtual world is young and untested in the long term. Ethereum and NFTs could become as worthless as overproduced baseball cards in the 1990s.\n\nThe Risk of Investing in the NFT Market\n\nAll investments have risks. While it might be attractive to invest in the NFT craze, the untested market could lose money. If NFTs and Eth are tied, if one fails, the other is sure to follow.\n\nThe decentralized finance market is not regulated, so no investments in digital currency are protected by any government agency.\n\nIf you choose to invest in NFTs, you will need someplace to store your assets. You will need a private key for NFT sales, and if you lose that key, you lose your assets. The unregulated crypto market can have unexpected ups and downs, like the dogecoin craze.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is NFT minting?\n\nNFT minting is the process of converting digital assets into physical collectibles using blockchain technology. The first ever NFT was released in 2014, when CryptoKitties was launched. Since then, thousands of different types of collectible items have been minted, such as CryptoPunks, CryptoBears, and CryptoCats.\n\nHow does NFT go up in value?\n\nThe price of NFTs goes up when there are more people interested in buying it. This can be caused by new projects being launched, or an increase in demand for the token itself.\n\nAre NFTs based on Ethereum?\n\nNo, NFTs are built on top of Ethereum blockchain technology, which allows them to be traded like any other digital asset.\n\nWhat is OpenSea NFT Marketplace?\n\nThe OpenSea NFT Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace for trading digital assets such as ERC20 tokens, collectibles, and other digital assets.

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights The prices of Ethereum & Polygon have been displaying significant strength as they have been sustaining above the crucial support\n\nThe activity on the platforms is expected to intensify in the coming days, as network activity could surge heavily in the coming months\n\nThe crypto markets have witnessed the emergence of a wide variety of altcoins, which have established a strong presence in the space. In recent times, we have witnessed the AI space gaining more attention. Hence, it is believed that some sectors of the crypto space, including AI, RWA, DeFi, etc could thrive and dominate the markets in the coming days.\n\nAlongside, the Ethereum & Polygon networks are growing stronger regardless of the price actions of their respective native tokens, ETH & MATIC. Interestingly, these networks could become a major base for RWA projects, which are considered the future of the crypto space. As per reports, Ethereum and Polygon host nearly 50% of all the RWA or real-world asset projects, across all blockchains.\n\nEthereum has been the home for smart contracts, decentralised finance, NFT, etc., and numerous projects have been growing over the network. Meanwhile, Polygon\u2019s large user base, relevance, and popularity have also helped the network gain immense adoption, which has led to RWA adoption. However, the other networks are also trying hard to gain some dominance, while Ethereum & Polygon have set up a strong base.\n\nHow will this impact the ETH & MATIC prices?\n\nThe growth of the value of the native tokens usually depends on the strength and activity of the chain. The growing interactions over the network make the traders optimistic about the future of the token. This could, in turn, increase the buying pressure, which may positively impact the value in the future. With the resurgence of the AI & RWA projects, the ETH & MATIC prices are believed to thrive in the latter half of 2024."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nSolana has emerged as a competitor to Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin dominance. Amid this, investors are exploring Rebel Satoshi, a leading meme coin whose presale is ongoing.\n\nSolana\u2019s ascendance in stablecoin volume\n\nSolana\u2019s total stablecoin volume reached $322 billion in January. In October, it was only $12 billion.\n\nThis growth is due, in part, to the introduction of USD Coin (USDC) and Paxos\u2019 stablecoin USDP, which attracted a large number of users and transactions.\n\nYou might also like: Solana Pay partners with Shopify to enable USDC payments\n\nEthereum is still the leader in stablecoin transfers, with a total volume of $335 billion in January, slightly more than Solana.\n\nHowever, Solana is catching up and could soon surpass Tron to secure the second position.\n\nCan Solana surpass Ethereum?\n\nSolana offers fast transaction speeds and low fees. However, it faces tough competition from Ethereum, which has an established user base and a thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase to charge fees on USDC to USD conversions\n\nEthereum is also upgrading its platform to make it more efficient and scalable.\n\nWhile Solana is growing, it must overcome challenges such as building trust with users and ensuring network security and scalability to compete with Ethereum.\n\nRebel Satoshi presale is growing\n\nRebel Satoshi promotes decentralization and defying centralized authority, drawing inspiration from the philosophies of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThrough its native token, RBLZ, the project encourages long-term commitment by offering rewards for staking. RBLZ holders support the ecosystem\u2019s stability and enjoy rewards aligning with their commitment to decentralization.\n\nRebel Satoshi is also entering the NFT space with two collections featuring 9,999 characters.\n\nThe project sold over 107 million RBLZ in the ongoing presale, raising over $1.5 million.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Discover SCENE\n\nJupiter\u2019s massive JUP token airdrop claim began Wednesday, and volume on the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator soared to new heights in the process.\n\nAccording to data from both CoinGecko and Jupiter itself, the platform has racked up more than $1.2 billion worth of daily trading volume over the past 24 hours. That makes it top among all crypto DEXes, beating typical leader Uniswap V3 on Ethereum with $854 million (per CoinGecko). Note that the tally does not include Uniswap volume on other chains.\n\nJupiter\u2019s 24-hour rolling tally also appears to be an all-time record for the protocol, which has recently seen surging demand. Another data source, DeFi Llama, shows that Jupiter\u2019s single calendar-day volume record is just above $1 billion on December 14, 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday\u2019s traders won\u2019t get anything from the initial JUP airdrop, which serves up 1 billion tokens for earlier Jupiter users to claim. Jupiter took a snapshot of eligible wallets in November and said that about 955,000 wallets could claim tokens during the drop.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to be optimistic: Jupiter has allocated another 3 billion tokens, 30% of the total token supply, for future airdrops to reward newer users. The timing for the next airdrop has not yet been announced, however, and amid the buzz of claim day and the sizable drops landing in Solana wallets, traders are eager to start racking up activity on the platform.\n\nJupiter opened up the claim at 10 a.m. ET and the coin started with a market price of about $0.42, according to data from Birdeye. JUP quickly popped over 70% to a price above $0.72, as Decrypt reported earlier, but it has since calmed to a current price below $0.67.\n\nEven with the sinking price late Wednesday, JUP commands a market cap of about $914 million based on the current circulating supply, and the token has generated over $500 million in trading volume in less than nine hours.\n\nAccording to a Dune dashboard that tracks public blockchain data, eligible wallets have already claimed about 566 million JUP tokens out of the initial 1 billion JUP airdrop allocation. Nearly 392,000 unique wallet addresses have claimed tokens so far, as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSOL itself has fallen about 6% on the day to the current price of around $97, according to CoinGecko, after bouncing up and down since the JUP drop.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Standard Chartered Bank has projected a bullish rally for Ethereum, anticipating a major surge in its value following potential ETF approvals. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of forex and digital assets research, recently highlighted May 23 as a crucial date. This is when the SEC might greenlight the first batch of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, aligning with a similar timeline previously seen with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAnticipated SEC Strategy and Ethereum\u2019s Market Prospects\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approach mirrors the path of Bitcoin ETFs, starting with initial rejections before granting final approvals. Kendrick points out the importance of this date, likening it to a similar milestone for Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. He suggests that Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory following Bitcoin\u2019s pre-ETF approval pattern could soar as high as $4,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKendrick bases his optimism on several factors. The SEC has not labeled Ethereum as a security in its legal pursuits against crypto entities. This distinction and Ethereum\u2019s status as a regulated futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange strengthens the case for ETF approval.\n\nMoreover, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum trust, poised to transition into an ETF, adds to the anticipation. Kendrick perceives no substantial reason for the SEC to deviate from the CME\u2019s stance on Ethereum.\n\nResilience and Future Developments\n\nEthereum\u2019s market dynamics present a resilience not seen in Bitcoin\u2019s post-ETF approval phase. Kendrick attributes this to the relatively smaller market share of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust compared to its Bitcoin counterpart during the BTC ETF approvals. Additionally, FTX holdings within this framework are notably low, further insulating Ethereum from similar post-approval volatility.\n\nMay 23 might usher in basic Ethereum ETFs, reflecting the cryptocurrency\u2019s price movements. However, Kendrick foresees the introduction of more complex ETFs, potentially including staking yield rewards, at a later stage.\n\nHe acknowledges the existence of such ETFs in Europe, citing the 21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP (AETH) as a prominent example. Nonetheless, he notes that higher fees associated with these ETFs often counterbalance the staking rewards.\n\nImpact of Upcoming Ethereum Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun or Proto-Danksharding upgrade garners attention in Kendrick\u2019s analysis. He believes this upgrade will bolster Ethereum\u2019s value by enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s efficiency. By reducing Layer 2 fees, Ethereum becomes more competitive.\n\nConcurrently, a deceleration in staking pace is likely to sustain higher staking rewards for an extended period. These factors collectively promise a positive outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nRead Also: BlackRock and Fidelity Bitcoin ETFs Challenge Grayscale\u2019s Reign"

To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFirst, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.\n\nHighlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.\n\nIdeal reality by Vitalik Buterin\n\nButerin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum's role as a financial platform, Buterin encourages the community to broaden its focus, positioning his brainchild as a competitive force against centralized tech companies.\n\nThe essay articulates a nuanced perspective on the roles of token holders, intellectuals, builders and pragmatic users within the crypto ecosystem, highlighting the need for collaboration and understanding between these groups."

Uneventful testnet forks are the best ones!\u201d\n\nBlobs are now flowing in Sepolia \ud83d\ude00 Uneventful testnet forks are the best ones! https://t.co/HTTVwYcytm pic.twitter.com/Al45RZz95B \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) January 30, 2024\n\nThe Sepolia testnet follows the earlier deployment on the Goerli testnet in January, where Dencun initially encountered challenges that resulted in a network split due to a bug in the Prysm client.\n\nDespite the initial hiccup, developers swiftly addressed the issue. The successful activation on Sepolia sets the stage for the upcoming and final testnet deployment on Holesky, scheduled for Feb. 7.\n\nDencun, initially projected for the final quarter of 2023, is set to be Ethereum\u2019s most substantial upgrade since the Shapella upgrade last March, which introduced the capability to withdraw staked ether (ETH).\n\nThe Proto-danksharding Upgrade\n\nThe upgrade introduces EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, a feature to enhance data availability and reduce transaction fees on Layer 2. The proto-danksharding upgrade achieves this by replacing gas-intensive calldata with \u201cblobs,\u201d creating a more efficient and cost-effective transaction environment for Layer 2 blockchains by reducing associated data availability expenses.\n\nThis development is especially crucial as the Ethereum ecosystem has surged on-chain activity, increasing Layer 2 transaction costs and gas fees. Gas fees on popular Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, OP Mainnet, and Base have seen a notable increase of approximately 50% to 100% since mid-October, according to data from GrowThePie.\n\nDencun\u2019s upgrade is strategically positioned to bolster Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 ecosystem, allowing it to compete with transaction fees offered by alternative Layer 1s while retaining the robust security layer of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. With the final testnet deployment scheduled for Feb. 7 on Holesky, the Ethereum community eagerly awaits the activation date on the main blockchain."

When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights ETC price action rounding bottom reversal in the daily chart with a neckline at $26.\n\nWith the bullish comeback from the 50-day EMA, the uptrend gains momentum.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci levels in the weekly chart, the reversal trend can reach the $40 mark.\n\nWith the news of an Ethereum ETF making waves in the market, the Ethereum Classic, a close cousin to Ethereum, bounces back in action. The anticipations rise up with the Standard Chartered Bank hoping for Ethereum ETF approval in May, driving the ETH price higher.\n\nMoreover, the bullish turnaround creates a price action that may soon act as a bounce pad for the upcoming rally. Under such recovery conditions, will the Ethereum classic price reach the $1000 mark in the next bull run?\n\nTo find answers to such intriguing curiosities, read our complete ETC price prediction NOW!\n\nWill ETC Price Exceed The Escape Velocity To Cross $30?\n\nFollowing a remarkable 53% jump from the critical support trendline, the ETC price takes a pullback to the 50D EMA. Accounting for a 22% drop, the altcoin retests the 50D EMA, leading to multiple lower price rejection candles.\n\nSource \u2013 Tradingview\n\nWith the recent bounce back of 8% over the past two days, the bullish engulfing candles project a rise in momentum. Further, the 82% hike in trading volume supports the recovery trend, increasing the bull run chances.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD Indicator: With a significant reversal in price trend, the MACD and signal line give a bullish crossover. This signifies a high possibility of a continuation of the bullish trend.\n\nWill Ethereum Classic Give A Bullish Break?\n\nFollowing the impressive reversal over the past two days, the ETC price is ready for a rounding bottom breakout. With the neckline of the trend reversal pattern at $26, the buyers are anticipating a breakout entry opportunity shortly.\n\nIf the buyers manage to lift the uptrend, the ETC price may break past $26, then the uptrend could reach $30. Optimistically, a prolonged uptrend can reach the $50 mark if the market sentiments continue to improve. Moreover, catalysts like Ethereum ETF news and the Bitcoin Halving can fuel the bullish trend.\n\nHowever, if ETC fails to maintain its momentum, it may break under the $24 level to test the $20 mark."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.\n\nAfter a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.\n\nA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.\n\nImmediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.\n\nA scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.\n\nConversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.\n\nSolana shows strength\n\nDuring this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the \"Ethereum killer.\"\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.\n\nOn the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.\n\nThe next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.\n\nFundamental Ethereum problems\n\nAs it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming \"unusable\" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.\n\nLayer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems."

The currency faces immediate resistance at $43,922, with further ceilings at $45,229 and $46,446, which could impede upward movements. Conversely, support levels at $42,209, $40,810, and $38,822 offer a cushion against price retractions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 53, hinting at a neutral to slightly bullish momentum without tipping into overbought or oversold conditions. There\u2019s an upward channel on the 4 hourly timeframe which is likely to support uptrend in Bitcoin. The 50 EMA at $42,209 provides a baseline for the currency\u2019s resilience. In conclusion, the trend for Bitcoin appears cautiously optimistic, hinging on its ability to maintain above the pivot point with an eye towards testing the immediate resistances. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum is currently trading at $2,299.7, slightly below its pivot point of $2,308.3, as indicated by the green line. The digital asset faces immediate resistance at $2,393.1, with subsequent barriers at $2,482.6 and $2,546.4. Supports lie at $2,292.5 and further down at $2,233.0, with a stronger base at $2,166.5. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral at 59, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressures. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lies at $2,300.4, hovering near the pivot point, which could serve as a dynamic support in the short term. Currently, Ethereum is contained within a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating consolidation and the potential for a breakout. The chart suggests a holding pattern with the potential for a bullish move if Ethereum sustains above the upward trendline and the $2,300 support area. Buyers may gain confidence for a push towards higher resistance levels if this support holds. Overall, the market posture for Ethereum is cautiously optimistic, with a close eye on the pivotal $2,300 mark to determine the short-term directional bias."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is on track for a colossal rebranding as the hotly-anticipated Dencun upgrade with proto-danksharding was successfully deployed on the second of three testnets, Sepolia, on Tuesday.\n\nDencun Goes Live On Sepolia\n\nDencun is coming. Ethereum core developers activated the network upgrade on the Sepolia testnet at 22:51 UTC on Jan. 30, and it was finalized shortly after.\n\n\u201cBlobs are now flowing in Sepolia,\u201d Parithosh Jayanthi, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, said on X. \u201cUneventful testnet forks are the best ones!\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum development team implemented Dencun on the Goerli test network earlier this month with a few hiccups. Sepolia is the second of three testnets, which will be followed by the third and final testnet Holesky, on Feb. 7. The third successful testnet activation will serve as a precursor to Dencun\u2019s anticipated launch on the Ethereum mainnet by March, as noted by Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano:\n\nDencun, the next Ethereum network upgrade, has now been activated on the Sepolia testnet and went off without a hitch!\n\n\n\nNext up is the final testnet upgrade, Holesky, and if all goes well, we can expect Dencun to launch on mainnet sometime in March.\n\n\n\nEIP-4844 is coming. \u2014 sassal.eth/acc \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) January 31, 2024\n\nOf particular interest is EIP-4844, which enables proto-danksharding, a novel improvement touted to drastically lower L2 transaction costs and boost scalability by introducing a new compartmentalized data storage mechanism known as \u201cblobs\u201d. Data is momentarily stored in these blobs to verify transactions and can be safely deleted after a certain time period to avoid network overload.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter successful execution, Dencun will enable the Ethereum network to handle over 100,000 transactions per second at lower fees. It will do this by making Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocols such as Optimism much cheaper, developers promise.\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly improving. Most notably, in September 2022, the second-largest blockchain transitioned from a proof of work consensus algorithm to proof of stake in a highly-publicized upgrade dubbed \u201cthe Merge.\u201d Last April, Ethereum finalized the Shapella upgrade, enabling withdrawals for users who had staked their ether tokens to secure and validate transactions on the network."

        "title": "Forget XRP, This Cryptocurrency Is Poised for an Incredible Run - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Just a few years ago, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) was a crypto market darling. Investors thought it was going to skyrocket in value, and it became one of the top cryptocurrencies by overall market cap. Today, however, XRP is trading for under $1 and is still mired in an ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSo maybe it's time to forget about XRP and find a new cryptocurrency capable of soaring in value. That cryptocurrency could be Solana (CRYPTO: SOL). After an epic rally at year-end, it passed XRP's market cap in December and is now poised for an incredible run.\n\nIs Solana the next Ethereum?\n\nThe case for investing in Solana can be distilled down to a single thesis: Solana is the next Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). When Solana publicly launched as a smart contract blockchain platform in March 2020, it was immediately touted as a potential \"Ethereum killer\" due to its super-fast speeds and super-low transaction costs. That made Solana valuable for a wide range of uses, from blockchain gaming to decentralized finance (DeFi). In fact, at one time, people referred to Solana as a \"decentralized Nasdaq.\"\n\nNow, four years later, Solana is starting to fulfill some of its early promise. While Solana is still a long way from surpassing Ethereum, it is making inroads quickly. And institutional investors are starting to take notice. In November, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest appeared on CNBC, making the case for Solana as a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum. If Solana keeps up its momentum, it could eventually topple Ethereum as the premier smart contract blockchain platform, and that would provide a huge boost to its overall valuation.\n\nHow high can Solana go?\n\nThe big question, of course, is how high Solana might eventually go. Back in October, investment firm VanEck modeled a number of scenarios for Solana's future growth. In a base-case scenario, VanEck saw Solana reaching a target price of $335 by the year 2030. At the time, Solana was trading around $30, so that price implied a 10x gain. But the bull-case scenario called for Solana to reach a target price of $3,211. At the time, that price implied a more than 10,000% gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo exactly how realistic is this super-bullish price forecast? According to VanEck, it will require Solana to continue to chip away at Ethereum's dominant market share in several key categories, including both decentralized finance and blockchain gaming.\n\nOh, and it also was premised on the idea that Solana would eventually find a \"killer app\" capable of onboarding 100 million users. To put that number into perspective, ChatGPT onboarded 100 million users in two months. The AI system doesn't rely on blockchain networks, but it's a useful reference in terms of sheer scale of Solana's most bullish price projections.\n\nThe 100 million user problem\n\nSo where is Solana going to find that mythical \"killer app\" capable of onboarding 100 million users? My assumption is that it may come from Solana's new mobile crypto strategy, which includes physical hardware products (i.e., a new phone called the Saga) as well as software tools (i.e., the Solana Mobile Stack) that mobile developers can use to create blockchain apps.\n\nThe big picture basically comes down to this: Entice developers to create new apps, put those apps in an app store, and then get consumers to download those apps to their phones. At some point, one of those apps is going to hit it big, right?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAdmittedly, solving the 100 million user problem will not be easy. \"Killer apps\" like ChatGPT come along rarely. As a result, I'd be careful about using the top-end $3,211 price target for Solana. But even if you use the more conservative base price target of $335, that would still imply a more than 3x return from Solana's current price of $100 per token.\n\nSolana's trajectory in 2024\n\nWhile I'm long-term bullish on Solana, it is concerning that Solana has had so much difficulty gaining traction this year. After a remarkable 2023 when it soared by nearly 900%, Solana is down approximately 5% to start this year. To some extent, I'm chalking it up to the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype. In all the enthusiasm around Bitcoin, investors seem to have lost interest in every other cryptocurrency.\n\nBut I'm expecting things to turn around soon for Solana. Unlike XRP, it doesn't have an SEC case hanging over its head. And, unlike XRP, it is gaining traction with institutional investors as a potential Ethereum challenger. If you're looking for a crypto poised for an incredible run, you should consider Solana.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Solana wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The industry is bustling with the trading of the newly introduced spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, yet there\u2019s no equivalent for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Jag Kooner, Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, suggests that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could impact the SEC\u2019s view on an Ethereum ETF, likely influenced by Ether\u2019s classification as a security or commodity.\n\nWhile speaking to CryptoPotato, Kooner highlighted that Ethereum ETFs swiftly emerged in other regions following the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, particularly in Canada, where regulators were comfortable with the product due to the presence of a regulated futures market for ETH. This environment facilitated risk management for market makers during the creation and redemption of units.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Path to ETF Approval\n\nThe Bitfinex exec also noted SEC chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s stance, suggesting that crypto other than Bitcoin are viewed as securities, contrasting with Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\u2019s observation that the SEC appears to regard Ethereum as a commodity, given the implicit acceptance of Ethereum futures-based ETFs.\n\nThe entry of prominent financial entities like BlackRock into the Bitcoin ETF space signaled a positive trajectory for crypto ETFs, potentially extending to Ethereum ETFs, as institutional participation often validates the market for regulators.\n\nHowever, initial attempts by Grayscale and BlackRock to convert their Ethereum trusts into ETFs faced SEC pushback, underscoring the importance of Ether\u2019s categorization. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen favorable trends, driven partly by GBTC\u2019s substantial investment, a similar scenario could unfold for Ethereum, according to Kooner, albeit contingent on Ether\u2019s recognition as a commodity.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that ETFs serve the purpose of bridging tradfi US investors and traders and crypto and the same could most likely not be true for other crypto assets which have not stood the test of time and established the reputation of \u201cdigital gold\u201d or a commodity as the largest crypto asset by market capitalization. An example could be the lackluster performance on the launch of futures Ethereum ETFs in comparison to futures-based Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nWhen Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nTD Cowen, through its Washington Research Group led by Jaret Seiberg, has outlined a clearer timeline for the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States, targeting late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nDespite previous speculation that approval could occur post-November 2024 elections, the bank now anticipates a delay, stating that the SEC is unlikely to approve a fund dedicated to Ether in 2024. This decision is speculated to have been influenced by political factors, particularly the potential backlash from progressive Democrats following the recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has offered his opinion on the growing trend of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology.\n\nIn a new blog post titled \u201cThe promise and challenges of crypto + AI applications,\u201d Buterin outlined his top concerns about AI and advised developers to \u201ctread carefully,\u201d particularly when implementing cutting-edge apps in high-value and high-risk situations.\n\nVitalik Buterin Raises Concerns Over AI Risks in Development\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder explained that \u201cit is important to be careful: if someone builds e.g. a prediction market or a stablecoin that uses an AI oracle, and it turns out that the oracle is attackable, that\u2019s a huge amount of money that could disappear in an instant.\u201d\n\nThe promise and challenges of crypto + AI applications:https://t.co/ds9mLnshLU \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 30, 2024\n\nButerin acknowledged that both AI and blockchain are of vital importance today. AI could play a role in helping users understand the intricate details of the cryptocurrency world, making sure that their actions are consistent with their objectives, and protecting them from potential fraud.\n\nThe developer explained that one of the areas where AI has the greatest potential is enabling it to take part in solutions like prediction markets at a macro-scale that would be impractical for humans. Buterin adds that AI could also be utilized in user interfaces for cryptocurrency wallets, guiding users through transactions and signatures and identifying fraudulent activity.\n\nThe Areas of Caution\n\nDespite the positive side of the AI+ blockchain ties, Buterin believes there are some gray areas. For example, Buterin notes that using AI to enforce governance or oversee the administration of crypto networks would be the riskiest undertaking because open-source AI models would be subject to hostile attacks.\n\nButerin explains that open-source AI is prone to attacks as hackers can examine its code and craft effective attacks against it. On the other hand, Buterin claims that closed-source AI offers \u201csecurity through obscurity.\u201d However, according to him, this model lacks transparency.\n\nThe Ethereum developer said in his blog, \u201cMy own opinion is that pure AI interfaces are probably too risky at the moment as it increases the risk of other kinds of errors, but AI complementing a more conventional interface is getting very viable.\u201d\n\nButerin concludes by warning developers to exercise caution at the intersection of AI and blockchain.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "title": "TD Cowen: Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely to Happen in 2024 - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "According to TD Cowen, several factors, including Gensler\u2019s \u201cgo-slow\u201d approach, make spot ETH ETF approval unlikely this year.\n\nIn a recent note, investment bank TD Cowen has doubled down on its prediction that the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will not happen any time soon. According to TD Cowen, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take its time before any more approvals of this sort. The note also contains a likely timeline for the approval:\n\n\u201cWe do not expect the SEC in 2024 to approve a spot Ethereum ETF. This is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nGensler Not in a Hurry to Approve Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nLed by Jaret Seiberg, the TD Cowen Washington Research Group had previously noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is \u201ctaking a go-slow approach\u201d with the ETH ETF. According to the note, one of the reasons for this approach is that Gensler\u2019s tenure runs until June 2026. This gives the Chair quite a bit of time to wade through court cases and more enforcement action, instead of supporting legislation. Essentially, TD Cowen believes that \u201cGensler is in no hurry to act\u201d.\n\nAfter rejecting applications for over a decade, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. Since the first application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss\u2019 Gemini in 2013, the SEC has disapproved all proposals due to fraud concerns. Consequently, recent submissions seemed to address these concerns by including a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA), which promotes market transparency and reduces the risk of fraud. While this contributed to the SEC\u2019s recent decision to approve, another major factor is a court ruling against the agency.\n\nGrayscale Investments had dragged the SEC to court after the Commission\u2019s 2022 refusal of the company\u2019s proposal to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The company accused the Commission of \u201cfailing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles\u201d. According to Grayscale, the SEC was \u201cacting arbitrarily and capriciously\u201d. After the SEC lost the case, it seemed that approval was only a matter of time.\n\nTD Cowen Believes Gensler Is Treading Carefully on ETH ETF\n\nTD Cowen writes that Gensler might be unwilling to upset progressives any further as he would need them for any agenda he intends to push this year. Also, the investment bank believes that Gensler\u2019s possible interest in other roles, such as Treasury Secretary, might not come to fruition even if President Joe Biden wins a second term if the progressives are not on his side. The note also adds that Gensler would also like to monitor the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs before approving ETH products.\n\nSo far, more than a dozen applicants have submitted proposals for spot ETH ETFs to the SEC. Last week, the Commission delayed decisions on Grayscale\u2019s and BlackRock\u2019s applications, stating that it needed more time to consider certain uses. For Grayscale, the SEC has instituted certain proceedings, including calling for public comments on the ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) and Polkadot\u2019s (DOT) wallet application, Talisman Wallet, launched Signet\u2019s private beta on January 30. Signet is an enterprise workflow management and multisig solution for on-chain organizations.\n\nFollowing the launch, Signet Lead Willian Chen explained how his product aligns with the Web3 needs to assist institutional operations.\n\n\u201cThe Web3 world must adapt to the complex needs of modern on-chain organizations, and this solution, which can be thought of as an operating system for blockchain financial operations, does just that. Signet improves organization workflow and enables signers to execute Multisig transactions more efficiently than ever.\u201d \u2014 William Chen, Signet Lead\n\nAside from workflow process management, Signet is committed to data privacy, \u201coffering several built-in features to support the Aleph Zero (AZERO) ecosystem,\u201d as communicated to Finbold.\n\nSignet to join the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nNotably, the Talisman Wallet is a popular choice for over 70,000 users, according to the team. These users have staked 5 million DOT using Talisman, worth $33.35 million considering Polkadot\u2019s current price of $6.67.\n\nTherefore, Signet Multisigs will be able to connect with thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) throughout the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nErin Grasmick, Technical Lead of Infrastructure & Data at Parity Technologies, said the following:\n\n\u201cSignet is a fantastic addition to the Polkadot ecosystem and fills a much-needed gap in the multisig space. The talent behind the beloved UX and design of the Talisman wallet have applied their years of experience to streamlining multisig signing \u2013 and the result is a product that has all the usability we\u2019ve come to expect from this team. The work put in, and the attention to detail given should benefit anyone with a complex multisig workflow immensely. I\u2019m very excited to see where future development takes the project.\u201d \u2013 Erin Grasmick\n\nIn conclusion, Talisman Wallet\u2019s Signet targets figures involved in the Polkadot ecosystem, particularly on-chain enterprises and large institutions. As Signet embarks on its journey with the Private Beta program, it encourages interested parties to explore the future of enterprise workflow management and Multisig solutions in the blockchain space."

        "content": "The co-founder of software giant Palantir Technologies thinks one type of buyer could introduce a new wave of demand for the crypto markets going forward.\n\nJoe Lonsdale says in a new interview with CNBC that artificial intelligence (AI) agents could rely on crypto as it expands across society.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a whole new financial story driving [crypto] from the side of buyers necessarily, although there\u2019s one type of buyer that could be very important here. AI agents are going to start doing a lot of things in our economy, and for AI agents to coordinate with incentive systems, they\u2019re probably going to use crypto.\u201d\n\nLonsdale, who also works as a founding partner at the venture capital fund 8VC, says those AI agents will probably use Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), and he thinks the price of those three crypto assets are correlated.\n\nThe Palantir co-founder also says crypto prices could soar if the US government continues spending money at prolific rates and inflation kicks back up in 2025 or 2026.\n\nDavid Marcus, the former president of PayPal and ex-Facebook vice-president, echoes Lonsdale\u2019s insight on BTC and AI. Marcus says he sees Bitcoin becoming the currency of choice for AI agents looking to trade information.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance Bitcoin sats will become the 24/7 default neutral, native value exchange asset for AI agents. Agents will net settle in real time on Lightning between them. When fiat payouts need to happen, sats will get converted for a tiny fee.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,571 at time of writing.

SOL\u2019s bullish bets outnumbered bearish bets in the last two days, AMBCrypto observed using Coinglass data."
