        "content": "Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves validators instead of miners to create and verify blocks of transactions. Therefore, validators, entities that help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH, receive transaction fees, but not in full. They get the priority fee or the tip that users add to the base fee to entice validators to prioritize their transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is burned, taking ETH out of circulation."

        "title": "ETH Facing Huge Decision: $1400 or $1800 Next? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following an unexpected and rapid drop from the $1.8K threshold, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a significant dip, falling below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs).\n\nThis development is considered a significant bearish sign for ETH. However, the price managed to find support within a crucial range, hinting at the possibility of an imminent consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that the price\u2019s breach beneath the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, around $1,835 and $1,800 correspondingly, caused a marked downtrend that eventually landed Ethereum\u2019s value within the pivotal support zone at $1.6K.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the 200-day moving average holds substantial significance as an indicator of prevailing market trends. Traditionally, a bearish sentiment engulfs the market when the price remains below this MA.\n\nCurrently, the $1.6K support level has proven its resilience in upholding the price, indicating the potential for a recovery and subsequent pullback. However, the recent downtrend has shifted the market\u2019s structure into a more bearish stance, thus enhancing the possibility of a retest of the $1,400 zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that ETH lost the critical support point of $1.8K. This quick decline led the price to find support within the range of $1.5K, resulting in a temporary end of the prevailing downtrend.\n\nRemarkably, this support level has so far demonstrated its efficacy in maintaining the price, resulting in a period of sideways consolidation. As a consequence of this consolidation phase, Ethereum\u2019s price movement has taken on the form of a roughly symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern can develop into bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction in which the pattern\u2019s breakout occurs.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price trajectory currently remains in a state of uncertainty, displaying no clear inclination towards an upward or downward movement. Consequently, as the price chart offers limited insights into forthcoming market trends, delving into the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s current state.\n\nThe following chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s funding rates, a pivotal point for identifying the dominance between long traders and short sellers. Positive values align with a bullish outlook, while negative values signify a bearish stance.\n\nNotably, an apparent pattern emerges from the data. Following a sudden impulsive decline, succeeded by a consolidation phase with stagnant price action, the funding rates undertook a downward trend, forming lower peaks on the chart. This unfolding scenario hints at a lack of interest in going long in the futures market, potentially paving the way for a bearish trajectory.\n\nNonetheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, there remains the possibility of a minor corrective phase preceding a more pronounced downward trend. Should the funding rates assume a negative stance, this could elevate the likelihood of a cascade of short liquidations, potentially leading to a substantial bullish rebound that propels the price upwards."

        "title": "Can You Still Mine Ethereum? ETH Mining Post-Merge Guide - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "As the world of blockchain technology evolves, the Ethereum network has embarked on a significant transition from the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to the Proof of Stake (PoS) model. This monumental shift, often termed \u201cThe Merge,\u201d has both potential benefits and drawbacks, particularly for miners.\n\nThis comprehensive guide explores the various implications of this transition for Ethereum miners and outlines possible future pathways in the post-Merge landscape.\n\nCan you still mine Ethereum?\n\nThe answer is: No, you cannot mine Ethereum as of September 2023.\n\nEthereum has transitioned from a PoW consensus mechanism to a PoS consensus mechanism. In a PoW system, miners use specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a PoS system, validators stake their ETH to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nThe Merge, which was completed on September 15, 2022, was the final step in Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS. As a result of the Merge, Ethereum mining is no longer possible.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in the Ethereum network, you can stake your ETH to become a validator. However, it is important to note that staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH, which is a significant investment.\n\nCheck out our detailed blog to stay informed about how blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in data privacy.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to PoS: The Merge\n\nThe Merge signifies Ethereum\u2019s transformative journey from the energy-intensive PoW consensus mechanism to the considerably more eco-friendly PoS model. The transition to PoS is part of the broader Ethereum 2.0 upgrade aimed at enhancing network security, scalability, and sustainability.\n\nWhile the PoW model requires miners to solve complex encryption problems to validate transactions and generate new Ether (ETH) coins, the PoS model will replace mining with staking.\n\nEthereum 2.0: Unpacking the benefits\n\nDespite the concerns surrounding Ethereum mining, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 brings a host of benefits. Ethereum 2.0 will significantly reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption, a crucial step towards a more sustainable future for the blockchain industry.\n\nFurthermore, the PoS model promises enhanced network security and scalability, opening up more opportunities for the ETH ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\nWill Pepecoin survive the cryptocurrency market in 2023? Check out the odds here.\n\nWhy did Ethereum switch to PoS?\n\nThere are several reasons why Ethereum switched to PoS. Here are some of them:\n\n1. Energy efficiency\n\nThe transition to PoS was primarily driven by concerns over the energy-intensive nature of PoW. Traditional PoW mining involves powerful computers solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions, consuming vast amounts of electricity.\n\nIn contrast, PoS relies on validators who lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (in this case, ETH) as collateral to secure the network. This approach drastically reduces the energy footprint of the network, making it more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\n2. Enhanced security\n\nPoS networks are generally considered more secure than PoW networks. In PoW, malicious actors can attempt a 51% attack by accumulating more computational power than the rest of the network.\n\nHowever, in PoS, an attacker would need to accumulate a substantial portion of the cryptocurrency supply and lock it up as collateral. This makes such attacks significantly more expensive and economically infeasible, bolstering network security.\n\n3. Scalability\n\nPoS offers improved scalability compared to PoW. Traditional PoW blockchains often face congestion and scalability issues due to the limited capacity of miners\u2019 hardware.\n\nPoS networks can efficiently process more transactions and onboard additional validators, making them better equipped to handle increased demand and scale as needed.\n\n4. Decentralization\n\nPoS promotes greater decentralization by eliminating the need for expensive mining equipment. With PoW, mining has become concentrated in the hands of large mining pools and companies with access to substantial resources.\n\nPoS, by contrast, allows a more diverse group of participants to become validators, reducing centralization risks and ensuring a broader distribution of power within the network.\n\n5. Reduced costs\n\nPoS significantly reduces the cost barrier for participation in network maintenance. PoW requires miners to invest in specialized hardware, which can be expensive and inaccessible for many.\n\nPoS validators only need to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral, making it a more cost-effective way for individuals and entities to contribute to the network\u2019s security and governance.\n\nLooking to learn more about blockchains?

We have covered the basics of blockchain for you in our comprehensive guide.\n\nThe impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining\n\nThe Merge was the final step in Ethereum\u2019s transition from a PoW consensus mechanism to a PoS consensus mechanism. This transition has had a significant impact on Ethereum mining, including several changes that have completely transformed the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nNegative impacts\n\nThe most significant negative impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has made mining on the Ethereum network impossible. This has left many Ethereum miners without a way to earn income.\n\nAnother negative impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has reduced the demand for mining hardware. This has led to a decline in the price of mining hardware, which has hurt the mining industry as a whole.\n\nPositive impacts\n\nOne positive impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has made Ethereum more environmentally friendly. PoW mining is very energy-intensive, while PoS mining is much more energy-efficient. This means that the Ethereum network is now consuming less energy, which is good for the environment.\n\nAnother positive impact of the Merge on Ethereum mining is that it has made Ethereum more secure. PoS is more secure than PoW because it is more difficult and expensive to attack a PoS network. This makes the Ethereum network more secure for users and investors.\n\nOverall impact\n\nOverall, the Merge has had a significant impact on Ethereum mining. It has made mining on the Ethereum network impossible, reduced the demand for mining hardware, and hurt the mining industry as a whole. However, it has also made Ethereum more environmentally friendly and secure.\n\nThe proposed Ethereum hard fork: EthereumPoW\n\nIn response to the potential job losses for ETH miners due to the Merge, Chinese Ethereum miner Chandler Guo and a group of developers proposed a hard fork, EthereumPoW (ETHW), that would retain the PoW mining model.\n\nThis proposed fork could serve as a viable option for miners, as it allows them to continue mining. Notably, some large Ethereum mining pools are expected to support ETHW, and even Coinbase has indicated its willingness to consider listing the forked Ethereum.\n\nAlternatives to Ethereum mining\n\nIf you\u2019re a miner looking to mine cryptocurrencies, here are a few prominent alternatives to Ethereum for you to try out. Take a look:\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, is the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and remains one of the most profitable coins to mine. However, it\u2019s essential to note that Bitcoin mining is now primarily performed using specialized hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).\n\nWhile profitable, the initial investment in ASIC miners can be substantial. Miners are incentivized through block rewards and transaction fees, making Bitcoin mining lucrative, particularly in areas with low electricity costs.\n\n2. Litecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin is often considered the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. It is among the earliest cryptocurrencies and can be mined using ASICs, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile it may be less profitable than Bitcoin mining, it\u2019s relatively easier and requires less specialized hardware, making it a suitable choice for those new to cryptocurrency mining.\n\n3. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin started as a meme but has gained significant popularity. Unlike Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin can be mined using graphics processing units (GPUs), which are more widely available and less expensive than ASICs. While it\u2019s less profitable than Bitcoin or Litecoin, it provides an accessible entry point for miners.\n\n4. Monero (XMR)\n\nMonero is renowned for its focus on privacy and anonymity. It can be mined using GPUs or CPUs, offering a more inclusive approach to mining. Monero\u2019s mining algorithm, RandomX, is designed to be ASIC-resistant, ensuring a more level playing field.\n\nWhile it may be more challenging than some other cryptocurrencies to mine, Monero can be more profitable for those committed to privacy-centric projects.\n\n5. Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain that continued to use the PoW consensus mechanism after Ethereum transitioned to PoS. This allows Ethereum Classic to be mined using both GPUs and ASICs. While it may not be as profitable as Ethereum once was, it can still yield returns, particularly in areas with low energy costs.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies offer various opportunities for mining, each with its own level of profitability and accessibility. The choice of which one to mine depends on factors like available hardware, electricity costs, and personal preferences.\n\nAdditionally, USDT\u2019s dominance over Tron has been skyrocketing. What does it mean? Check out our article to stay updated!\n\nThe future of Ethereum mining\n\nThe future of Ethereum mining is uncertain. Some miners have switched to mining other PoW cryptocurrencies, while others have sold their mining equipment. It is possible that Ethereum mining will continue on a smaller scale using PoW forks of Ethereum, such as Ethereum Classic.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that Ethereum mining will eventually disappear altogether. While the era of ETH mining may be drawing to a close, the transition opens up opportunities for miners to explore other cryptocurrencies and potentially contribute to the evolution of the blockchain industry.\n\nSumming up\n\nThe transition from PoW to PoS working mechanism marks a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of the blockchain industry. While it spells the end of Ethereum mining, it paves the way for more sustainable and scalable blockchain networks.\n\nFor miners, the Merge necessitates a strategic reassessment of their roles within the crypto ecosystem. Whether through mining other altcoins or supporting the proposed ETH fork, miners have opportunities to adapt and continue playing a vital role in this rapidly evolving industry."

        "title": "Another Exchange to Stop Ethereum Staking for US Customers - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum staking will no longer be valid for Bitstamp US customers starting in September. It\u2019s becoming more difficult for exchanges to offer staking services to American investors\n\nBitstamp to Stop Ethereum Staking\n\nBitstamp, one of the world\u2019s most established cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it would halt Ethereum staking on the exchange. The service will officially be suspended on September 25.\n\nSpeaking of the news, CEO of Bitstamp USA, Bobby Zagotta, stated: \u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. Rewards, along with the principal, will be credited to users\u2019 main Bitstamp account balances.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Bitstamp said that the staking rewards and the initial deposit amount would be distributed to the customer\u2019s main account balance. It\u2019s noteworthy that the process might take a few days and could be affected by the Internet connection.\n\nBitstamp\u2019s move came amid intensified scrutiny by regulators on the crypto market. Major crypto exchanges with operations in the US have made specific actions to comply with the current regulatory landscape. Some of the most popular acts are to halt staking services and remove some trading pairs.\n\nCoinbase recently decided to delist six tokens from its exchange due to its failure to meet its standards. These tokens, including BarnBridge (BOND), DerivaDAO (DDX), Jupiter (JUP), Multichain (MULTI), Ooki (OOKI), and Voyager (VGX), will no longer be available for trading starting on September 6. Furthermore, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime services for these tokens will also be discontinued.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance also announced a series of delistings. In August, the exchange removed Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) from its platform earlier this week. The move affected the following trading pairs: SNM/BTC, SNM/BUSD, SRM/BUSD, and YFII/USDT\n\nEarlier this month, Bitstsamp also halted trading for seven tokens in the US. All of these tokens are on the SEC\u2019s list of unregistered securities, including Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Near Protocol (NEAR). This action was taken to steer clear of any potential legal complications.\n\nCrypto Staking Targeted\n\nBitstamp is not the only exchange that has to stop the staking service in the US under mounting regulatory pressure. In February, California-based exchange Kraken announced the suspension of its staking service in the US as part of the settlement with the SEC.\n\nThis move raised questions about whether the SEC plans to crack down on crypto staking more broadly.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in February that there were speculations about the SEC\u2019s possible ban on the crypto staking for retail customers in the US. Armstrong\u2019s statement, however, lacked clarification regarding his assertion that the SEC\u2019s ban only targets retail investors.\n\nArmstrong additionally highlighted the advantages of staking in blockchain technology. Staking involves using assets to safeguard and maintain the blockchain while preserving its decentralized nature.\n\nThe CEO also argued that crypto staking is a vital part of blockchain technology and should not be banned. He has warned that banning crypto staking would harm the US\u2019s technological leadership and could lead to exchanges moving their operations overseas.\n\nThe SEC has not yet taken any concrete action against crypto staking. However, the SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, since September 2022, has indicated that staking can be considered a form of security.\n\nConsequently, staking operations must register with the SEC to offer services to American investors. The SEC Chairman previously asserted that most cryptocurrencies, excluding BItcoin, are securities.\n\nGensler\u2019s remarks coincided with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network globally, successfully implementing its major upgrade known as the Merge to support ETH staking. The Ethereum community is awaiting the next major event \u2013 the Dencun upgrade, which is expected to launch within the year."

        "content": "DEX aggregator 1inch withdrew over $40 million worth of cryptocurrencies from its investment fund and purchased $10 million worth of Ethereum during the early hours of Aug. 28 at an average price of $1650, according to Etherscan data.\n\nA breakdown of the withdrawals showed that the DeFi platform withdrew 41.8 million worth of Tether\u2019s USDT, 396,000 in Uniswap\u2019s UNI token, 3,120 Ethereum (ETH), and 75,000 in USDC. Additionally, 1inch swapped $10.075 million USDT and USDC to buy 6,088 ETH.\n\nThe reasons behind the transactions remain unclear as of press time. 1inch was yet to respond to CryptoSlate\u2019s request for comment as of press time.\n\nOnchain sleuth Lookonchain highlighted a smart money move executed by the 1inch earlier this year. Per Lookonchain, 1inch generated nearly $4 million in profits in July by selling 11,000 ETH for $21 million.\n\nThis transaction followed 1inch\u2019s accumulation of approximately 17,000 ETH, valued at $26.8 million, throughout the year\u2019s first quarter. The acquisition was made at an average price of $1,569, and the subsequent sale occurred at an average price of $1,906.\n\nAt the time, 1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz reportedly explained that the transaction was to test a new feature on the protocol Fusion Mode. Fusion mode allows users to place custom swap orders without paying gas fees.\n\nThe protocol claimed that the upgrade would help users avoid sandwich attacks, which have become prevalent with MEV attacks.\n\n$15k worth of tokens to be unlocked\n\nThe Token Unlocks dashboard shows that 64,290 1Inch tokens, worth $15,000, will be unlocked by Aug. 31. These tokens account for 0.01% of the asset\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nPer CryptoSlate\u2019s data, the 1inch token has seen its value drop by 1% in the last 24 hours to $0.2407. The asset is down 22% in the previous 30 days.\n\nAmid these developments, 1inch recently deployed on the Coinbase-backed Base layer-2 network. The expansion would help the DEX users access a layer-2 solution with lower transaction fees, higher speeds, and extra liquidity.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Discover SCENE\n\nMore fans, more creators, more money. For the content creator site OnlyFans, 2022 was a pretty good year. For Ethereum? Maybe not so much.\n\nOver the weekend, Crypto Twitter zeroed in on a financial statement submitted by OnlyFans\u2019 parent company Fenix International Limited to British authorities on Thursday. It showed that the company had owned over $19 million in Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native token, but its value was slashed to about $11.4 million by the end of the reporting period in November 2022.\n\n\u201cDuring this year, the group diversified part of its working capital into a cryptocurrency asset\u2014ETH or Ethereum,\u201d the company said in a strategic statement that opens the 48-page document. \u201cThere are no limitations or restrictions on the group's ability to sell the cryptocurrency assets. The asset has been impaired to its fair value at the year end.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, OnlyFans\u2014infamous for the many adult performers hosted on the platform\u2014made a splash in the crypto space by announcing that creators could use verified Ethereum NFTs in their profile images. Creators who did so received an Ethereum symbol to show their ownership of the asset.\n\nAt the time, OnlyFans\u2019 CEO Amrapali Gan said the feature\u2014similar to one introduced for Instagram and Facebook by Meta\u2014aimed to \"empower creators to own their full potential.\"\n\n\"This feature is the first step in exploring the role that NFTs can play on our platform,\" Gan told Reuters.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could not have anticipated the crypto bear market lurking around the corner. At the time of the NFT announcement, ETH was trading at $2,797.43, but fell to $1,298.94 by November 30 when the reporting period ended. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,645.90.\n\nImage: Coingecko\n\nLast year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency markets. It was marked by a cascade of failures including the collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin and governance token LUNA, the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius, and the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut apart from its ETH woes, OnlyFans enjoyed a positive 2022. According to the financial statement, the site saw the company's revenue shoot up to $5.6 billion from $4.8 billion in 2021. It also experienced a 47% increase in the number of creators on its platform, on top of a 27% increase in the total number of subscribers."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the cofounder of Ethereum, transferred approximately 3,000 ETH (~$4.95 million) to an address labeled \"Vb 2.\" The move has sparked speculation and interest within the crypto community, given Buterin's influence on the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne plausible explanation for this transfer is that Buterin is redistributing his funds among his own wallets to mitigate the risk of hacking or theft. As of the latest data, Vitalik Buterin's known Ethereum address holds around 73 ETH, valued at approximately $119,865. This strategy of redistributing assets is common among high-profile individuals in the crypto space to enhance security.\n\nHowever, another angle to consider is the possibility of a cashout. The crypto market has been experiencing a downturn, and this move could be a strategic decision for active profit-taking. It is worth noting that large sell-offs from influential figures like Buterin often coincide with significant market-wide corrections.\n\nA brief review of Ethereum's price performance shows a volatile market. While the asset has shown resilience over time, the current market conditions are less than ideal, making any significant move by a key player like Buterin noteworthy.\n\nHistorically, Vitalik Buterin's financial moves have had a ripple effect on the Ethereum market. Whether this recent transaction will have a similar impact remains to be seen. However, given the current market volatility, it is a development that traders and investors should keep an eye on.\n\nWhile the exact reason behind this significant transfer remains speculative, it is clear that it could have multiple implications. Whether it is a simple act of redistributing assets for security reasons or a strategic move in response to market conditions, the transaction is significant enough to keep an eye on Buterin's wallets.\n\n"

This impairment loss indicates that the initial investment in Ethereum has declined in value, aligning with the recent price movements in the general cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to the filings, investing in cryptocurrency is part of putting money into intangible assets with an \u2018indefinite useful life. OnlyFans\u2019 venture into cryptocurrencies could have several implications, pointing towards a deliberate move towards diversification and embracing blockchain technology.\n\nThis move coincides with Ethereum being increasingly considered an attractive asset for its potential as a viable store of value. Its growing integration into mainstream financial establishments further enhances the asset\u2019s allure as a sustainable investment option.\n\nAdditionally, the investment might be linked to Ethereum\u2019s capability to serve as an inflation-resistant asset, potentially allowing it to remain less affected by the fluctuations of conventional financial markets.\n\nApart from its cryptocurrency investments, OnlyFans has previously expanded its financial portfolio through ventures in non-fungible tokens (NFT). In February 2022, OnlyFans introduced a feature enabling users to showcase verified NFTs as profile images. The adult platform only allowed NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOnlyFans strong financial postings\n\nFor the 12 months ending on November 30, 2022, the company posted strong financial results, reaching a revenue milestone of over $1 billion. Simultaneously, the platform attracted over 50 million new users, and more than 1 million new content creators joined its ranks. Collectively, users spent a substantial $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nThe filings indicated that Leonid Radvinsky, a Ukrainian based in the US who acquired the company in 2018, accumulated approximately $485 million in dividends since the beginning of the previous year as demands for OnlyFans grew.\n\nIt is worth noting that OnlyFans\u2019 revenue model involves the company keeping around \u00a31 out of every \u00a34 earned by its content creators. This approach has been highly profitable for numerous adult content creators, leading to significant earnings for some individuals on the platform."

        "content": "Ethereum Transaction Fees Fall To Levels Not Seen Since Late 2022\n\nImage Source: Adobe\n\nEthereum\u2019s total daily transaction fees hit an eight-month low after it plunged to 1,719 ETH approximately $2.1 million on Aug 27.\n\nThe recent decline in total gas fees can be attributed to low network activity and the rise of layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nAccording to data from on-chain analytics firms CryptoQuant and IntoTheBlock, the second-largest cryptocurrency, became the cheapest since Dec 26.\n\nThe bearish market outlook plays a significant role in the sharp decline in gas fees. Reduced activity around decentralized finance solutions will lead to low gas fees while the reverse often leads to network congestion and skyrocketing fees.\n\nDaily transaction fees on Ethereum are also down 83% from 16,720 to 1,719 ETH per year-to-date data since May 5. Despite the popularity of friends.tech launched on Aug 10, fees remain lower pointing to the importance of scaling solutions.\n\nFriend.tech has gained massive traction with over 100,000 users And 2 million raised in revenue in its first month of operation signaling that the era of network congestion is now in the past.\n\nDavid Lawant, Falcon X head of research noted that the reduced fees now recorded across the network are in contrast with the times CryptoKitties where new projects typically clogged the network for long periods.\n\n\u201cEthereum L1 fees since friends.tech launched on August 10 are 25% lower than the average for the year until then, which is in stark contrast to the times when the success of early NFT application CryptoKitties or the latest Yuga Labs NFT drop would commonly temporarily clog the Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nLayer 2 saves the day\n\nThe Ethereum network has come a long way in terms of development. Being at the forefront of smart contract development, the blockchain hosts the bulk of decentralized applications (Dapp) and most decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nWhile this led to huge adoption and a sharp increase in the price of the asset, a massive downside was its expensive gas fees and slow transaction speed when clogged.\n\nFor years, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin alongside other devs stressed the need to upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 which will transition the network to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism getting rid of miners.\n\nThe upgrades also included layer 2 solutions taking off pressure from the network reducing transaction speed and fees without compromising security.\n\nThe last few years have seen mass adoption on layer 2 networks with multiple developers deploying projects on these solutions.\n\nFriend.tech launched on Coinbase\u2019s layer 2 chain, Base leading to a smooth operation of the network amid its staggering traction.\n\nOn-chain data from IntoTheBlock also shows that layer 2 scaling solution Optimism mainnet recorded a new all-time high of 900,000."

        "title": "When Was Ethereum Created, and Where is It Heading? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has revolutionized the blockchain landscape with its unique features and ambitious roadmap. Its journey from a fledgling idea in 2013 to its current status as one of the leading blockchain platforms is a compelling story filled with innovation, challenges, and potential. If you\u2019re wondering when Ethereum was created, give this blog a read.\n\nThis article will chronicle the history of Ethereum and delve into its future prospects.\n\nThe creation of Ethereum\n\nIn 2013, a computer programmer named Vitalik Buterin conceived the idea of Ethereum. Distinct from Bitcoin and other existing cryptocurrencies, Buterin\u2019s vision for Ethereum was not just a digital currency but a platform for executing smart contracts and building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nButerin publicized his unique concept in a white paper. This document outlined Ethereum\u2019s innovative features, such as smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This has enabled developers to create dApps on the Ethereum platform. Buterin\u2019s white paper marked the foundational phase of Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nEthereum\u2019s founding fathers\n\nWhile Buterin is considered the primary founder of Ethereum, he was not alone in bringing this groundbreaking project to life. A group of skilled and visionary individuals joined Buterin in crafting Ethereum\u2019s initial framework.\n\nAmong these co-founders were Dr. Gavin Wood, who designed Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s programming language, and Charles Hoskinson, who later created the Cardano blockchain platform. These co-founders, along with other early contributors, played an essential part in shaping Ethereum\u2019s philosophy and architecture.\n\nThey gathered at the North American Bitcoin Conference in 2014, where Buterin introduced Ethereum to the public. The team subsequently conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund Ethereum\u2019s development.\n\nDiscover the ultimate comparison between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and find out what sets them apart.\n\nThe birth of the Ethereum blockchain\n\nFollowing a successful ICO, the Ethereum blockchain officially went live on July 30, 2015. This initial launch, codenamed \u201cFrontier,\u201d saw Ethereum adopt a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Ethereum diverged from Bitcoin in several ways, such as its support for smart contracts and its inflationary nature, with no maximum cap on ETH coins issuance.\n\nThe launch of Ethereum represented a significant leap forward in blockchain technology. It expanded the potential use cases of blockchain beyond mere financial transactions, paving the way for a new era of decentralized internet.\n\nThe decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) hack incident\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey was not without its share of challenges. One such significant hurdle was the infamous \u201cDAO hack\u201d in 2016. The DAO was a specific smart contract on Ethereum that raised $150 million in ETH.\n\nHowever, the DAO was exploited by hackers who siphoned off approximately $50 million worth of ETH. This hack resulted in a split within the Ethereum community. One faction wanted to reverse the hack via a hard fork, while the other group argued against this, stating it would violate the principle of blockchain\u2019s immutability.\n\nEventually, the majority of the community favored the hard fork, leading to the creation of two separate Ethereum chains\u2014Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nLooking to trade Bitcoin options? We got you! Our complete guide covers everything you need to know.\n\nEthereum\u2019s continuous progress\n\nFollowing the DAO incident, Ethereum embarked on a series of upgrades to enhance its capabilities and address its deficiencies. These included the Byzantium and Constantinople upgrades, which introduced optimization for Ethereum\u2019s gas fee structure and scalability enhancements.\n\nNotably, Ethereum also facilitated the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with games like CryptoKitties gaining popularity in 2017. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues became more apparent with the increasing demand for dApps and NFTs.\n\nLooking to trade crypto professionally in 2023? Check out our detailed blog to know more.\n\nEthereum 2.0: The future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s future centers around a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2. This upgrade aims to transition Ethereum from a PoW consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. This has significantly reduced Ethereum\u2019s environmental impact and potentially increased its transaction throughput.\n\nThe road to Ethereum 2.0 involves several stages. The first was the introduction of the Beacon Chain in 2020, marking the beginning of Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS. The next significant milestone, dubbed \u201cthe Merge,\u201d occurred in 2022, when the PoW blockchain was finally merged with the Beacon Chain, marking the completion of Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS.\n\nThe post-Merge era and beyond\n\nFollowing the Merge, Ethereum\u2019s path forward includes a series of planned upgrades, collectively referred to as \u201cthe Surge,\u201d \u201cthe Verge,\u201d \u201cthe Purge,\u201d and \u201cthe Splurge.\u201d\n\nThese upgrades aim further to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, efficiency, and capabilities, potentially enabling Ethereum to handle up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nEthereum\u2019s future also involves more integration with traditional finance. Notably, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has started offering Ethereum futures trading, enabling more institutional investors to engage with ETH.\n\nThe future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities continue to drive innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various other applications within the blockchain space.\n\nThe introduction of EIP-1559, a proposal aimed at reducing transaction fees and improving the network\u2019s predictability, further reflects Ethereum\u2019s commitment to enhancing user experience. However, challenges such as network congestion, scalability, and competition from other blockchain platforms remain.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s active developer community, ongoing upgrades, and role in shaping the decentralized landscape suggest that it is poised to play a significant role in the future of blockchain technology and the broader digital economy.\n\nSpeaking of transaction times, how does FTM ensure super-fast transactions? Find out!\n\nSumming up\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey from its creation to its current state has been a story of innovation, resilience, and growth. Its influence on the blockchain landscape is undeniable, as it has opened new avenues for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nHowever, as Ethereum continues to evolve, it can play an even more significant role in shaping the future of blockchain technology and the decentralized web."

Daily transaction fees hit an eight month low of $2.8 million on Sunday. That's according to data track by Blockchain Analytics firm, crypto. A decline in total fees paid represents low network usage as fees are determined by the level of activity in the network. But it could point to a rise in laity of Ethereum layer two scaling solutions, which is actually a long term positive for the development of the Blockchain. David Lewin, head of research at Falcon said in a note last week that Ethereum layer one fees have decreased, which is in stark contrast to the early days of crypto kitties when the network would commonly get clogged.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nShibarium, a layer-2 blockchain developed by the Shiba Inu (SHIB) team, has reopened fund withdrawals on its bridge to Ethereum, which allows users to move their assets between the two networks.\n\nIn a Monday update, the pseudonymous Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama said users can now withdraw a range of assets, including SHIB, LEASH, and wrapped Ether (WEth) tokens.\n\nThe withdrawal process is anticipated to be concluded within a reasonable timeframe of 45 minutes to 4 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWithdrawals of the network\u2019s native BONE are also available but may take up to seven days to process, as specified by the network\u2019s design\n\nShibarium is a layer-2 network developed by the Shiba Inu community on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to serve as a scaling solution for Shiba Inu, expanding it from a meme coin into a comprehensive ecosystem with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, metaverse apps, and blockchain games.\n\nThis reopening comes after the initial launch of Shibarium on August 16, which resulted in approximately $1.7 million worth of Ethereum reportedly being stuck on the Ethereum bridge.\n\nReacting to the incident, the Shibarium team clarified that the problem was not a result of a malfunctioning bridge. Instead, they attributed the issue to an overwhelming surge in user activity, generating an exceptionally high volume of traffic.\n\nThe developers explained that this surge in transactions placed an excessive load on the network's servers, causing them to surpass their intended operational limits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdditionally, the developers turned to the Polygon team for assistance, forking the Polygon protocol to resolve the matter.\n\n\u201cQuickly after the incident began, I called Sandeep from Polygon directly, and without a second thought, he helped provide additional resources to ensure a perfect outcome to the situation. And that is why our pivot to fork Polygon was the correct one,\u201d wrote Kusama in today\u2019s blog post.\n\nDecrypt has reached out to Shibarium and Polygon developers for additional comments and will update this article should we hear back."

        "content": "ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio slipped below its 180-day small moving average.\n\nThis is a bearish signal, and it indicated a further price decline might be imminent.\n\nLeading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] is at risk of further decline, as its daily Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has fallen below its 180-day small moving average (SMA), Twitter crypto analyst Ali_Charts found.\n\n#Ethereum MVRV Ratio, compared to the 180-day SMA, offers insights into market trends! When MVRV surpasses the 180-day SMA, it indicates macro uptrends; when below, downtrends are suggested. Notably, after the recent #ETH price decline, MVRV fell beneath the 180-day SMA,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ITvA586HBf \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) August 25, 2023\n\nThe MVRV ratio tracks the ratio between an asset\u2019s current market price and the average price of every coin or token of that asset acquired. A positive MVRV ratio above one signals that an asset is overvalued.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the more this ratio increases, the more likely traders have historically demonstrated their willingness to sell.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConversely, a negative MVRV value shows that the asset in question is undervalued, as if holders sold at the asset\u2019s current price, they would realize losses.\n\nAs noted by Ali_Charts, when an asset\u2019s MVRV ratio rests above the 180-day SMA, the market capitalization is greater than the total amount of profit realized, which suggests that the market is in an uptrend.\n\nOn the other hand, when the MVRV ratio is below the 180-day SMA, the market capitalization is less than the total amount of realized profit, which suggests that the market is in a downtrend.\n\nRegarding ETH, its MVRV ratio recently fell below the 180-day SMA, suggesting that its recent price decline may not be over.\n\nETH traders continue to dawdle\n\nWith many uncertain of the coin\u2019s next direction, the recent market deleveraging event has caused ETH holders to stay their hands from accumulating the altcoin. Since 17 August, when the market suffered a huge liquidity exit, key momentum indicators have plummeted, suggesting a drop in buying pressure.\n\nBelow their respective center lines at press time, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and its Money Flow Index (MFI) were 30.44 and 18.54.\n\nLikewise, as of this writing, the alt\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a negative value of -0.08, a position it has occupied since the capital exodus. Generally, a CMF value below the zero line is a sign of weakness in the market.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOutside the spot market, reduced ETH trading was also observed in the futures market. Across cryptocurrency exchanges, the total amount of ETH\u2019s Open Interest valued in dollars has trended downwards since 17 August. In the last seven days alone, this has declined by 4%.\n\nAlso, on leading exchanges Binance and dYdX, ETH\u2019s funding rates have been predominantly negative for the past two weeks. This signaled where market sentiment lies, showing investors preferred to bet against the alt\u2019s price."

As of now, the identity of the recipient and the intent behind the transfer remain undisclosed.\n\nNotably, Buterin has been known to offload chunks of his ETH holdings over the past five years and has also publicly discarded tokens received in unplanned altcoin airdrops.\n\nThe development comes after Vitalik Buterin recently transferred 600 ETH, roughly valued at $1 million, to the U.S. exchange platform Coinbase."

        "title": "Top Altcoin Picks For Next Week: Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) And Shiba Inu (SHIB) Are On The Way To Recovery - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past week, Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations within its consolidation range, influenced by various macroeconomic factors such as Jerome Powell\u2019s address. As Bitcoin falls short of meeting the short-term bullish expectations of investors, capital is increasingly flowing into the altcoin sector. Looking ahead to the coming week, a substantial recovery rally in the altcoin market is anticipated, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading this rally.\n\nAltcoins On The Edge Of Recovery\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price continues to flash volatility near $26K in response to Powell\u2019s hawkish comments. This development is somewhat expected, considering the bearish trend Bitcoin had been exhibiting in the days leading up to the Jackson Hole symposium. Traders had been preparing for Powell\u2019s ongoing moves on controlling the inflation to align with the central bank\u2019s 2% target.\n\nAmid this, the prices of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu have been hovering near key support levels. With sellers unable to push prices further downward, a potential bounce-back from these support levels is anticipated for the coming week.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther\u2019s price recently attempted to break above $1,700 but couldn\u2019t maintain its position, indicating strong defense from the bears at this price point.\n\nThe declining moving averages and the RSI below the midline suggest that bearish momentum still dominates. Sellers are likely to aim for pushing the price into the $1,625 to $1,544 range. If successful, we could see a drop below the support channel, plunging the ETH price toward the $1,360 level.\n\nConversely, bulls aren\u2019t leaving the field easily. They are expected to robustly defend the support zone and attempt to push the price above the 50-day EMA of $1,678. If they manage this, it would imply that the ETH price could continue to hover in a bullish range of $1,785-$1,863.\n\nLitecoin Price Analysis\n\nLitecoin has been trading within a narrow band of $60 to $67 over the last several days. While the bulls have managed to hold a decline below the $60 support level, they\u2019ve been unable to push past the $67 resistance.\n\nAn extended consolidation often leads to a solid breakout momentum ahead, and LTC price might experience that soon. If bulls successfully break above the consolidation next week, LTC price could initially target the 200-day EMA at $77 before aiming for the more ambitious $85 mark, where significant bearish activity is expected.\n\nConversely, it\u2019s crucial for the bulls to defend the $60 support level. Failure to do so could trigger the next downward phase, potentially driving the price to $47.\n\nShiba Inu Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on SHIB\u2019s candle pattern indicates that bearish traders are still active, selling off during upward movements.\n\nIf the price falls below the immediate support level of $0.000008, it would imply that the bears are still in control. In such a scenario, SHIB\u2019s price could decline to a low of $0.0000077. A further drop below this point could lead to a retest of the long-standing support at $0.00000705.\n\nOn the other hand, a surge above EMA50 will strengthen bullish positions, sending the meme coin toward $0.00001."

However, Ethereum\u2019s journey contrasted sharply with this success.\n\nAt the start of the report in May 2022, the company\u2019s Ethereum assets were worth over $19 million, but by November, their value had fallen to about $11.4 million.\n\nPer the company\u2019s statement, OnlyFans diversified some of its operational capital into Ethereum during the year. The report noted that the company could freely liquidate its Bitcoin holdings, valuing the asset at its year-end market price.\n\nLast year, OnlyFans, known for adult content, made waves in the crypto space by allowing creators to feature verified Ethereum NFTs as profile images.

        "content": "OnlyFans, the well-known adult content subscription platform, has made a bold move into the world of cryptocurrencies. Its parent company, Fenix International, recently revealed its significant investment of nearly $20 million in Ether (ETH) in 2022.\n\nAccording to official financial filings submitted to the UK corporate registry, Fenix International acquired nearly $20 million worth of ETH over a two-year period.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s investment in Ether demonstrates its progressive approach, it wasn\u2019t immune to the market\u2019s inherent volatility. By the end of November 2022, the value of Ether had plummeted by $8.5 million, leading to an impairment loss on the investment.\n\nThe remaining carrying amount of Ethereum stands at $11.434 million, reflecting the broader trends and uncertainties in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOnlyFans Ventures Beyond Traditional Offerings\n\nThe move to invest in Ether aligns with OnlyFans\u2019 broader strategy of diversification and technological innovation. Investing in intangible assets with an \u201cindefinite useful life\u201d showcases the company\u2019s willingness to embrace emerging technologies like blockchain, positioning itself at the forefront of industry trends.\n\nThe disclosure about Fenix\u2019s acquiring a substantial amount of Ether has not seemed to provide a lift yet to the price of the crypto. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,636, down -0.8% in the last 24 hours, and sustaining a slight 2.2% loss in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.\n\nThe financial filings offer a glimpse into OnlyFans\u2019 multi-faceted performance. Despite the challenges posed by its cryptocurrency investment, the company reported impressive financial results for the year ending November 2022.\n\nWith revenue surpassing the $1 billion mark, driven by an influx of over 50 million new users and more than a million content creators, OnlyFans solidified its position as a revenue-generating powerhouse. Users collectively spent an astounding $5.5 billion on the platform.\n\nOnlyFans Pioneers NFT Integration And Celebrity Trading Cards\n\nLeonid Radvinsky, the visionary entrepreneur of Ukrainian origin who acquired OnlyFans in 2018, has reaped the rewards of the platform\u2019s surging popularity.\n\nThe filings unveil that Radvinsky amassed dividends approximating $485 million since the inception of the previous year, in line with the escalating demand for OnlyFans\u2019 offerings.\n\nThis recent crypto venture is not the company\u2019s first stride into the digital asset domain. In early 2022, OnlyFans facilitated a pioneering move by enabling verified creators to replace their profile pictures with Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nBitcoin slides back into the $25K region. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nMoreover, in June of the same year, former OnlyFans executives unveiled Zoop, a celebrity trading card platform leveraging the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon. Zoop allowed users to trade 3D digital playing cards depicting their favorite celebrities.\n\nThe disclosure of Fenix International\u2019s Ethereum holdings dovetailed with an industry-wide trend, as adult content creators began flocking to Friend.tech, a decentralized social media platform rooted in the cryptocurrency realm. This rush underscores how crypto\u2019s recent surge has not only captured financial markets\u2019 attention but also influenced sectors far beyond conventional investments.\n\nFeatured image from Verit\u00e0 e Affari\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The Shibarium team has not only restored mainnet operations but also made sure that the bridge is working smoothly. Users can now withdraw various assets such as ETH, SHIB, LEASH, and wrapped ETH.\n\nAccording to Kusama, these withdrawals should take between 45 minutes and 3 hours.

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has multiple public wallets that carry a significant amount of ETH and these wallets are religiously tracked by on-chain sleuths. This is why whenever the founder makes a withdrawal, the destination of the ETH being sent is closely followed and recent reports reveal that Buterin has been sending significant amounts of ETH out to different wallets.\n\nTwo Vitalik Buterin Transactions Spark Speculations\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, the on-chain data tracking platform PeckShieldAlert took to X (formerly Twitter) to share some interesting movements that have been taking place in wallets said to belong to Buterin. This time around, the tracker flagged a single transaction carrying 3,000 ETH.\n\nThe 3,000 ETH, worth roughly $4.95 million at the time of the transfer was sent out from the well-known Vitalik.eth wallet to another wallet identified publicly as Vb2. This brought the latter\u2019s balance to 3,017 ETH, worth a little over $4.95 million.\n\nThe speculations of whether the Ethereum founder is offloading some of his stash come in relation to an earlier transaction made by him. The transaction which was also reported by PeckShield alert showed that Buterin had sent 600 ETH worth around $1 million at the time to the Coinbase crypto exchange.\n\nFor many, however, this transaction was insignificant in the grand scheme of things and did not lead to a cause for alarm. The most recent transaction also follows in the same vein since it looks like the billionaire founder is just redistributing his assets to other wallets.\n\nETH price struggles coming out of the weekend | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs This Why ETH\u2019s Price Is Struggling?\n\nSo far, there is no indication that Buterin\u2019s wallet movements have anything to do with the ETH price decline. As already mentioned above, the ETH liquidity is too deep for a $1 million sell to trigger such a decline, which would suggest something else is behind the coin\u2019s struggles.\n\nThe most obvious factor is that the broader crypto market has been taking a hit and ETH has not been left out. Bitcoin fell from $28,000 to below $26,000, taking the majority of the market down with it. As a result, investor sentiment swung far into the negative which is preventing new money from coming into the market.\n\nWith the bear market waxing strong, there could be more decline to come for the digital asset until investor sentiment improves and the market starts to recover once more. For now, ETH is still ranging above $1,640 as bears and bulls are locked in a tug-of-war for control.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Police1, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum retail traders accumulate: Will their efforts drive a bullish reversal? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH flagged multiple signs indicating that it was ripe for a bullish takeover.\n\nETH whales could be keeping the sell pressure alive.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been on a bearish streak since the second week of July. Its mid-August dip extended that downside, but now the bulls have been showing signs of exhaustion. Recent findings suggest that accumulation is gaining traction.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nETH delivered sideways price action for the last few days, indicating that the bears are taking a break. According to one of the latest Glassnode alerts, retail addresses have been accumulating at the current levels. The alert reveals that Ethereum addresses holding at least 10 ETH just reached a 4-week high.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Number of Addresses Holding 10+ Coins just reached a 1-month high of 348,950 Previous 1-month high of 348,949 was observed on 25 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/6ggy1nLbSD pic.twitter.com/stSzgk9qDJ \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 26, 2023\n\nThe observation was an indicator that ETH traders were regaining some confidence in the market. This was further backed by the observation that ETH has been flowing out of exchanges. In addition, ETH exchange balances just fell to a multi-year low.\n\nThe last time that ETH exchanges were at the current level was in 2016. This observation was also favorable for a long-term bullish outlook because it confirms a long-term bias.\n\nDespite these findings, ETH bulls remain subdued. This means that the prevailing levels of accumulation are not strong enough for a sizable rally. This is likely because investors are concerned that the downside might continue, especially considering the prevailing threat of higher interest rates.\n\nAnalyzing the key reasons why the bulls remain dormant\n\nThe current state of demand in the derivatives market underscores the aforementioned concern. Usually, a substantial price drop such as the one we observed recently attracts significant demand.\n\nHowever, that price crash was characterized by heavy liquidations. The threat of more downside and subsequent uncertainty resulted in a dip in ETH options open interest.\n\nETH\u2019s estimated leverage ratio is currently hovering at its lowest level in the last 4 weeks. It further emphasizes the point that there is currently a low appetite for the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the usual suspects seem to be the ones holding back the possibility of a rally. Addresses in the 1,000 and 10,000 ETH categories have been shedding off some of their coins, thus contributing to sell pressure.\n\nRead about ETH price prediction for 2023/2024\n\nEvaluating the possibilities\n\nWhile the threat of more downside is real, traders should note that the next FOMC meeting is scheduled to take place in the second half of September. This means there might be an opportunity for the bulls to gain an edge over the market.\n\nBut with the current whale activity, traders should keep an eye out for when whales start to pivot because it would signal the start of a bullish relief."

As a result, the company lost $8.5 million on the investment by the end of November 2022.\n\nDespite the setback, OnlyFans experienced significant growth and success during the same period, reporting a 16.6% increase in revenue. In tandem, user engagement surged by 47% as the CEO and main private shareholder, Leonid Radvinsky, netted a salary of $1.3 million per day.\n\nA Growing Interest in Crypto?\n\nCryptocurrency interest in the company\u2019s strategy predates the multi-million investment in Ethereum. OnlyFans has been making forays into the crypto space for a while now. In February 2022, the platform allowed verified creators to mint their profile pictures into Ethereum-based NFTs.\n\nThe decision by Fenix to reveal its crypto portfolio is a testament that digital assets are gaining institutional attention. As mainstream businesses acknowledge blockchain technology\u2019s and cryptocurrencies\u2019 potential, investments in \u201cultrasound money\u201d assets, such as Ethereum, will become more prevalent.\n\nOther companies interested in crypto through infrastructure investments and asset holdings include IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan, and SpaceX.\n\nRead why some OnlyFans creators would love to be paid in crypto:\n\n\u201cI Would Much Prefer to Be Paid in Crypto,\u201d Says OnlyFans Creator\n\nExplore why friend.tech is disrupting the social media landscape:\n\nFriend.tech: How Much Crypto Is Your Friendship Worth?"

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nWith December only a few months away, investors holding Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pomerdoge (POMD) are becoming skeptical about their potential price movements. Let\u2019s look at their current price movements and what analysts have to say.\n\nClick Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale\n\nEthereum (ETH) Struggling With Bearish Pressure\n\nThe Ethereum coin is trading below both the $1,670 mark and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The altcoin is currently struggling to surpass the $1,680 and $1,700 thresholds. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) is valued at $1,659.74, a decrease of 0.05% over the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum bulls are aiming for resistance at the $1,670 level. If they succeed, the price of Ethereum could climb higher and attempt to surpass the resistance at the $1,700 zone. Meanwhile, surpassing this level would spark a major recovery for the altcoin.\n\nHowever, if the Ether falters in surmounting the $1,700 resistance, it could then drop to the $1,640 level. Nevertheless, analysts are bullish and believe the Ethereum price could trade between $2,079.48 and $2,392.52 by December.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast For December\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price has dropped from recent highs with declining trading volume, which is typically a bearish sign. However, the drop in the trading volume could be beneficial to the Shiba Inu coi. The drop in trading volume translates to reduced liquidity.\n\nThis means that an increase in buying power could drive the Shiba Inu price up significantly. On the other hand, if a surge of sellers enters the market, it could cause a sharp downward movement. This could affect the meme coin\u2019s price greatly.\n\nCurrently, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is $0.00000809, a 1.14% price decline in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, analysts are bullish on Shiba Inu. Tradingbeasts have forecasted the memecoin to trade between $0.0000087 and $0.0000127 by December 2023.\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) Eyeing $0.15 By December\n\nPomerdoge (POMD) has emerged as a breath of fresh air in the crypto and gaming space. Notably, the project has managed to capture the community\u2019s attention through its play-to-earn gaming ecosystem. Also, the growing interest in Pomerdoge has led to the sale of over 150 million tokens.\n\nWe have officially raised over $1,500,000\n\n\n\nThere are hundreds of orders in pending since the price is increasing in 3 hours we expect this to significantly rise before the price increases to $0.01https://t.co/3Hm1hYrira pic.twitter.com/NLAYMc7vDH \u2014 Pomerdoge (@pomerdoge) August 25, 2023\n\nExperts are predicting even more significant price surges as the project continues to progress. Central to Pomerdoge is the Pomergame, a forthcoming play-to-earn crypto game. Within this game, players will be able to enhance their in-game characters to elite levels.\n\nWhat truly sets Pomerdoge apart is its unique marketplace called Pomerplace. This marketplace will enable players to monetize their achievements by trading skins, items, and valuables. Additionally, Pomerplace will function as a battle arena for gamers. At present, Pomerdoge\u2019s native token is available for purchase at a mere $0.009.\n\nIntriguingly, analysts have foreseen a remarkable 17x surge prior to the culmination of the presale. Besides, Pomerdoge will capitalize on the ever-expanding online gaming market. With such substantial support, the Pomerdoge token could reach $0.153 by the end of December.\n\nFind out more about the Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Today:\n\nWebsite: https://pomerdoge.com/\n\nTelegram Community: https://t.me/pomerdoge"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Why market volatility could resume this week - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price remains range bound, sliding horizontally at $26,139 with indications of a possible move soon.\n\nEthereum price is stuck in a range but could test the $1,630 support soon amid resuming volatility.\n\nRipple price climbed above the $0.5000 psychological level over the weekend and could continue north if bulls steady their hands.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate, same case for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices. However, this might chance this week as the market braces for key macroeconomics as well as timelines for spot BTC ETFs closing in.\n\nBitcoin price could be ready for its next move after almost two weeks of consolidation. The anticipation comes as the US market prepares for three key macroeconomics this week- The consumer confidence report, slated for Tuesday, followed by the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, and Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) later in the week.\n\nAnother possible driver for the market this week will be the anticipation of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expected to provide a decision for Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Galaxy, Fidelity, and Valkyrie. Nevertheless, owing to the recent dry-up in macroeconomics' relationship to BTC price and with the SEC's recent history of delays, the impact could be fleeting.\n\nAlso Read: Will volatility be back to crypto markets?\n\nBitcoin price could move soon\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to test the upper boundary of a longstanding demand zone at $26,154, with minimal volatility as the market remains devoid of impulse. However, momentum indicators suggest a possible move to the upside, and BTC could soon test the $27,300 resistance level.\n\nGiven the current market state, Bitcoin price could extend north, tagging the supply zone (red order block) at $28,973, with selling pressure from this area likely to trigger a correction. However, BTC must record a decisive daily candlestick above the range high at $31,130 for a confirmed uptrend. Such a move would constitute a 20% climb, with the most likely trigger being a spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rising, while the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator flash green, suggesting bullish dominance that could soon translate into a positive price move.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, considering the position of the RSI at 27 and that the AO was still negative, bears still have the advantage, and Bitcoin price could dip into the green order block (demand zone). For a confirmed downtrend, BTC must confirm below the lower boundary of the demand zone at $25,174 to render it a bearish breaker.\n\nIn the dire case, Bitcoin price could tag the $24,079 support level, marking a 10% slump from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin traders remain fearful of 'tail risk' amid renewed price lull: Observers.\n\nEthereum price bends to selling pressure\n\nEthereum (ETH) price outlook opposes that of BTC, showing signs of a downtrend. It comes after the network's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, executed a huge transaction, moving 3,000 ETH to an address labeled \"Vb 2.\" The impact is yet to be seen as the PoS token continues consolidating.\n\nWith momentum indicators (RSI and AO) favoring the downside, Ethereum price could break below the immediate support level at $1,630. In the dire case, the largest altcoin by market capitalization could test the August 17 lows at $1,552. This would denote a 5% fall below the current price.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, bullish momentum, possibly sprouting from Bitcoin price showing strength, could send Ethereum price north, breaching the $1,699 resistance level and potentially making a 10% climb to the supply zone at $1,835.\n\nA strong move above this zone could set the tone for Ethereum price to breach the psychological $2,000, potentially tagging the July 13 high at $2,008. A decisive break above this level would confirm the uptrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum is eyeing $1500 support with A-B-C drop\n\nRipple price remains indecisive\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains indecisive, with the RSI still moving horizontally. The remittance token continues to wind along $0.5203. For a confirmed downtrend, XRP must record a daily close below the mean threshold of the order block at $0.4800.\n\nFor as long as Ripple price continues to consolidate above this level, the odds for an uptrend outweigh that of a downtrend, with the possibility of XRP breaching the $0.5752 level and, in a highly bullish case, tag the monthly high of $0.6840.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, selling pressure could send Ripple price below the order block to tag the range low at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: Celsius bankruptcy judge denies classification of CEL as a security, rejects precedent set in Ripple XRP case"

They are the first in the list of supported e-money coins. So, what is the difference between these giants of the blockchain world?\n\nIf we talk specifically about the gambling industry, there is no big difference between them. Bitcoin is by far the most widespread and more widely used than Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies are very fast in transactions, although Ethereum has many more advantages, such as speed \u2014 ETH casinos pay you faster because Ethereum has an up-to-date block processing system, while BTC falls behind.\n\nThus, it is difficult to say that a Bitcoin casino is better than an online Ethereum casino or vice versa, as this is a matter of taste and experience. The main thing is that the casino is reliable and safe, and the choice of currency depends only on the player.\n\n\n\nIf you have already decided for sure that Ethereum is not your choice, you can find here the best bitcoin gambling sites.\n\nPros & Cons of Ethereum Gambling\n\ngame table roulette keyboard\n\nTo decide whether you are interested in Ethereum gambling, let's see what advantages and disadvantages this type has.\n\nPros\n\ninstantaneous transactions\n\nprivacy & anonymity\n\nlow or zero transaction fees\n\npeer-to-peer connectivity\n\nbigger bonuses\n\nCons\n\nscalability issues\n\nhigh volatility\n\n\n\nGetting Started with an ETH Casino\n\nlaptop online casino registration\n\nIf you are new to crypto gambling, you need to compensate for the lack of experience and solid base knowledge, which we have prepared in the mini-guide format to start your ETH Casino adventure.\n\nRegistration at Crypto Casinos\n\nRegistration in any crypto casino is presented in a much more simplified format than in a traditional online casino. Thanks to the blockchain system, users do not need to provide personal documents to verify their identity, as anonymity is a key concept in the crypto industry. To create an account, you must fill out a simple form: email, username, password, and date of birth. Usually, filling out the form is common for all Ethereum gambling sites.\n\nHow to Deposit/Withdraw ETH\n\nPerforming transactions with Ethereum does not require special knowledge. That is just a set of specific actions. To make a deposit, you should first register on your chosen site. Then enter the address of your wallet where Ethereum is stored and enter the desired amount. The money will be credited to your gaming account within a few minutes.\n\nYou must go to the Receive section to withdraw winnings from your gaming account. Make sure you choose the correct cryptocurrency. If the cryptocurrency is selected correctly, you will see the address of your wallet. Then copy and paste the address to the cashier page of the casino site and enter the amount you want to withdraw.\n\nWagering Requirements in Ethereum Casinos\n\nWagering requirements are the minimum number of bets a player makes to withdraw money from a gaming account. The online casino sets wagering.\n\nLet's see how wagering works on the example of the Welcome Bonus from Bets.io Casino. The essence of the bonus is as follows: you should make a first deposit of at least 0.001 BTC to receive a 100% bonus. The wagering amount is x40. Hence, the bonus received after the deposit should be wagered (played) 40 times.\n\nIn general, there are no special features for Wager Requirements with ETH. The main thing is to remember to meet these requirements. Always carefully read the conditions for receiving Ethereum bonuses so that they are realistically feasible.\n\nHow to Buy ETH?\n\nThere are several ways to buy ETH. The simplest and most understandable is a crypto exchange. There are many different exchanges: Binance, Coinbase Exchange, CoinDCX, and many others. Find the conditions for buying cryptocurrency from different exchangers and choose the most convenient one.\n\nMany Ethereum online casinos, such as Stake and BC.Game, offer the function of buying ETH directly through the site using Visa and Mastercard credit cards. That is a very handy feature, and all operators should introduce it.\n\nHow To Gamble Responsibly With Ethereum?\n\nResponsible gambling can be viewed from two perspectives: from the side of the player and the side of the Ethereum gambling casino. Each online casino operator should have a Responsible Gambling section, where the issues of temporary and irrevocable self-exclusion, raising and lowering limits, and card blocking are considered in detail.\n\nAll sites licensed in Curacao are required to adhere to the Responsible Gambling Policy. That includes three aspects:\n\ninforming players about the nature of gambling;\n\nencouraging players to bet within reasonable limits;\n\nproviding complete information about the games.\n\nIgnoring the principles of responsible gambling by users can lead to unpleasant consequences \u2014 gambling addiction.\n\nSigns of Gambling Addiction\n\nTo prevent obsessive gambling, you must know what signs may indicate this. Carefully read the list below so that you and your family are out of the risk zone and receive timely assistance if necessary.\n\nPlanning gambling activities;\n\nChanging the range of habitual interests;\n\nState of mental discomfort after stopping the game;\n\nThe desire for high-risk and high uncontrollable costs;\n\nLoss of control after a failed bet.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nCrypto gambling is already on the way to gaining a solid background that will speed up the process of its legalization. This review has looked at the best gambling websites for this new online entertainment niche. We hope that will help you choose the best Ethereum gambling website!\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nIf you or someone in your family suffers from obsessive gambling, we strongly encourage you to call 1-800-522-4700 and get counseling with the National Problem Gambling specialists.\n\nIt is more important to be able to prevent a problem than to deal with it. Hence, use the sites below to prevent gambling addiction:"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: $ETH Slips Under $1,700; Yet Whales Favor $XRP, $ROE, and $FIL - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent price dip below $1,700 has made headlines. However, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big thing, eager to diversify their portfolios and tap into new opportunities. While mainstream cryptos like Ethereum navigate uncertain waters, a set of altcoins, most notably $ROE from Borroe, are catching the eye of investors.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Borroe, read on to find out why it is the best crypto to invest in today.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\n$ROE Is Attracting Investors and Crypto Whales\n\nAt its core, Borroe sets itself apart by harnessing the power of AI and blockchain technology. Borroe operates on a dual-purpose framework. It\u2019s an advanced system that taps into AI-powered risk assessment. Furthermore, its underlying blockchain technology ensures security, transparency, and efficiency \u2013 three pillars that have become essential in the decentralized finance world.\n\nThe platform offers a suite of features tailored to both novice and seasoned investors. Whether it\u2019s the real-time analytics providing insights into market movements or its user-friendly interface that makes trading seamless, Borroe\u2019s offerings resonate with a wide spectrum of users.\n\nBorroe\u2019s benefits aren\u2019t just technological. Token holders can expect a plethora of advantages, both immediate and long-term. With the platform\u2019s emphasis on security and transparency, investors can trade with peace of mind. The deflationary nature of the $ROE token, combined with its rising demand, paints a promising picture of huge capital appreciation.\n\nBorroe\u2019s unique presale stages attract forward-looking investors. The presale stages are systematically designed to increase in price. With the Beta Stage already sold out at an initial price of $0.01 and the subsequent stages projecting up to a 300% price boost before it is launched on global exchanges, the growth trajectory of $ROE is nothing short of impressive.\n\n$XRP and $FIL Remain on a Bullish Trajectory\n\nRecent developments have pushed Ripple\u2019s $XRP and Filecoin\u2019s $FIL into the limelight. Ripple, recognized for its swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions, recently emerged victorious against the US SEC.\n\nThis landmark decision has not only improved Ripple\u2019s market position but has also injected renewed confidence into blockchain projects like Filecoin. Despite facing a low in December 2022, FIL\u2019s trajectory has been bullish, with experts forecasting a staggering 1,500% growth in 2023.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: $ETH Slips Under $1,700\n\nEthereum, despite its robust market presence, is experiencing high volatility. One example was its recent dip below $1,700, attributed to news of SpaceX offloading its Bitcoin holdings. This decline was heightened by the escalating liquidations in the DeFi market, with DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain surpassing $75 million in liquidations.\n\nThis trend could further depress Ethereum\u2019s value. However, hope is on the horizon. The US SEC\u2019s potential nod to Ether (ETH) futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) might bring about a trend change, allowing investors to access Ethereum akin to stock trading, possibly leading to a substantial price surge.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n$ROE stands out for its innovation and potential, quickly becoming one of the best crypto to buy. While established tokens like Ethereum undergo market tests, newcomers like $ROE promise a lucrative future \u2013 early investors stand to earn at least 300% before the tokens hit major exchanges.\n\nFor those eager to dive into popular NFTs, the Borroe platform offers a competitive edge that cannot be underestimated. If you are looking for the next big thing in crypto, this may be the ideal moment to join the $ROE presale and participate in the financial revolution!\n\nLearn more about Borroe ($ROE) here:\n\nVisit Borroe Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Borroe on Twitter\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe lower timeframe price action showed the bears were heavily favored.\n\nEthereum was trading at a higher timeframe support zone, where recovery could be initiated.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has trended downward on the lower timeframe price charts in the past two weeks. Its recent attempts to reclaim the $1700 level were met with failure. The falling MVRV ratio suggested the downtrend was likely to continue.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe price action showed the structure was bearish across multiple timeframes from the daily to the 1-hour chart. ETH was within a higher timeframe area of interest where buyers would be interested, but it hasn\u2019t materialized yet. Here\u2019s what the prices can do in the coming week.\n\nThere is a strong chance Ethereum can descend to $1400 if it can\u2019t bounce soon\n\nThe price action of the past two weeks indicated a robust bearish sentiment. The series of lower highs and lower lows have continued in the past four days, although the momentum slowed down. The 1-day chart showed that the $1625-$1680 was a demand zone, where the previous Ethereum rally reaching $2020 was initiated.\n\nHence a bullish structure break on the H4 chart would be the first step toward recovery. The RSI climbed toward neutral 50 to signal a shift in momentum. Yet the OBV did not ascend by a notable amount. This highlighted weak demand and a lack of volatility.\n\nA move below $1620 and a retest of the $1620-$1650 region could offer an opportunity to short ETH. To the south, the $1520-$1550 region could serve as support. Another demand zone lower on the chart was at $1370-$1440.\n\nConviction was lacking in the futures market and bears have the advantage\n\nThe 1-hour chart from Coinalyze showed that the Open Interest did not fluctuate much in the past week. Ethereum saw a bounce from $1580 and $1680 but has sunk to the $1640 level once more. The OI has trended downward in the past three days alongside the decline in price to signal bearish sentiment was prevalent.\n\nHow much are 1, 10, or 100 ETH worth today?\n\nThe spot CVD had been in a downtrend till 23 August but has flattened its path since then. This showed that neither buyers nor sellers had the upper hand. The funding rate was positive and suggested more traders were long than short. Yet, this does not guarantee a bounce by itself.\n\nAggressive ETH bears can wait for a move below $1620 or a move to the liquidity pocket at $1700-$1720 and a rejection to enter short positions."

        "title": "Is Borroe the New Gold Standard? Why Dogecoin and Ethereum Investors Are Rushing - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "After surpassing investor expectations, Borroe ($ROE) is now attracting Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) investors. Borroe ($ROE) is still in presale but has already shown great potential, especially after rising by 25%. But will that be enough to make it surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH)? Let\u2019s see what investors are saying.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Falls As Space X Dumps All Crypto Holdings\n\nLike many tokens, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been seriously declining over the past few days. Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) drop followed SpaceX\u2019s announcement that it had sold off nearly $400 million worth of crypto. The news shocked many investors who feared that SpaceX and its founder were no longer as bullish on cryptocurrencies, especially on Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nWhile Elon Musk has been open about his likeness to Dogecoin (DOGE), the only digital asset his companies have purchased is Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 which also uses the Proof of Work Consensus like Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nAfter the announcement of SpaceX\u2019s crypto sale, the market was hit with a wave of liquidations, and several tokens crashed. Some investors say Dogecoin (DOGE) could rise by 12.6% to $0.071 due to its high investor demand as the market starts recovering.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Drops Despite Excitement Around Pending Futures ETFs\n\nReports from Bloomberg indicate that the SEC is poised to approve Ethereum (ETH) Futures ETFs. While there has been no official confirmation of which funds will receive approval, Ethereum (ETH) holders are already jubilant, with many believing that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) value will go up.\n\nA similar thing happened when bullish excitement around Bitcoin ETFs filled the market, leading Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise above $31,000. Now, Ethereum (ETH) is expected to pull off a similar price increase.\n\nAnalysts expect Ethereum (ETH) to rise by 10.7% to $1,850 due to excitement around ETH Futures ETFs. In addition, Ethereum (ETH) is still one of the best DeFi projects on the market, so it might be a good crypto buy now.\n\nBorroe ($ROE): Unlocking Hidden Potential Within Short-term Capital Markets\n\nMany crypto firms and Web 3.0-based brands have complained about a lack of easy access to short-term capital. Most traditional revenue finance providers take lengthy delays, costing businesses more time and money.\n\nFortunately, a viable solution has emerged. Borroe ($ROE) Finance is the intersection of the revenue finance industry and blockchain technology. Borroe ($ROE) intends to provide easy access to short-term capital markets by revamping the fundraising process.\n\nBorroe ($ROE) uses fractionalized NFTs and AI to ease taking loans using future invoices as collateral. Moreover, the platform ensures appropriate risk assessment techniques are in place to provide the needed comfort to attract investors.\n\nBorroe\u2019s ($ROE) approach to revenue financing is expected to make it one of the best cryptocurrency investments. But that\u2019s not all there is. Its marketplace offers multiple rewards, including discounts and notifications of special funding requests.\n\nIn addition, Borroe ($ROE) currently costs $0.0125, but it is expected to rise to $0.040 by the end of its presale, a 220% ROI, granting its investors further gains.\n\nLearn more about Borroe ($ROE) here:"

While they had taken mitigation measures to significantly reduce risks, they also clarified that it was not possible to stop the affected pools.\n\nTo avert further breaches, the team recommended that users withdraw from the impacted liquidity pools.\n\nBalancer disclosed the critical vulnerability in question on 22 August. This prompted an urgent call for users to withdraw funds from liquidity providers and leading to the temporary suspension of pools.\n\nThe vulnerability posed a threat to assets deployed on various platforms. These include Ethereum, Polygon [MATIC], Arbitrum [ARB)], Optimism [OP], Avalanche [AVAX], Gnosis [GNO], Fantom [FTM], and zkEVM.\n\nBalancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting a number of V2 Pools. Emergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk.

However, as of 24 August, a significant level of risk persisted, with at least $2.8 million remaining vulnerable, accounting for 0.42% of the total locked value.\n\nBalancer issued a warning to its users on X, advising them about the status of their funds across various pools. They underscored that funds within the mitigated pools labeled as \u2018mitigated\u2019 were categorized as safe.\n\nNevertheless, users were strongly recommended to contemplate migrating to more secure pools or initiating fund withdrawals. Pools that remained susceptible were designated as \u2018at risk,\u2019 prompting LPs engaged in those pools to promptly exit.\n\nThe protocol closely intertwined its journey with its deployment on the Optimism network in June of the previous year. This deployment aimed to enhance user functionality while reducing transaction fees, making it more accessible and cost-effective for participants."

        "content": "Mon 28 Aug 2023 \u25aa 7 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\n\u25aa Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology has attracted massive interest due to the relevance of the solutions it offers. As this interest grows, so does the need to improve the operational efficiency of blockchain networks. In response, Layer 2 scaling solutions have emerged as efficient options. This is particularly true for so-called Layer 1 blockchains such as Ethereum. Thanks to Layer 2 scaling solutions, the challenges associated with Layer 1 blockchains have now been overcome. However, the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions has given rise to a complex and competitive landscape. A dynamic marked by the emergence of several projects proposing varied approaches to solving scaling problems. At a time when the market for Layer 2 solutions is facing numerous challenges, an analysis of the key dynamics of this market is essential.\n\nLayer 2: what is it, concretely?\n\nIn a recent analysis, we spoke of challengers threatening to dethrone Ethereum as Layer 1 market leader. To fully understand the Layer 2 protocol, we need to return to the notion of Layer 1.\n\nLayer 1 is not unrelated to Layer 2, the subject of this analysis. The link between these two notions lies in their interaction within the ecosystem of blockchain technology.\n\nAs a reminder, Layer 1, also known as the \u201cfirst layer\u201d, refers to the main blockchain itself. It is in fact the fundamental crypto infrastructure where transactions and smart contracts are validated, recorded and then secured. This, via consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nBut Layer 1 blockchains have functional limitations. They may therefore encounter restrictions. Their operational processing capacity is not optimal. The same applies to the transaction fees they charge. These are generally high, while transaction validation times are longer.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains have been designed to overcome these obstacles to Layer 1 operation. They incorporate various scaling solutions to reduce the workload on the main blockchain. This is achieved by moving certain activities off the main blockchain. What\u2019s more, Layer 2 protocols work in synergy with the Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nAs you can see, Layer 2 blockchain marks a major technological advance. This progress has been made against a backdrop of strong demand for efficient, scalable blockchain infrastructure. A unique set of assets that explain the sustained growth of the Layer 2 protocol market.\n\nLayer 2: current market trends and statistics\n\nThe market for Layer 2 protocols is extremely dynamic. And it\u2019s growing steadily. Here are a few key figures to illustrate this dynamism.\n\nThe total blocked value (TVL) of Layer 2 protocols is worth over $10 billion.\n\nCrypto-data provider Datawallet notes the growth of Layer 2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem. This evolution is remarkable when we look at the total value locked (TVL) linked to this technology.\n\nSince Tuesday, August 8, it has exceeded $10 billion in value. Layer 2 scaling solution Arbitrum One leads this trend, with a TVL of $6.01 billion, for a market share of 56.98%.\n\nArbitrum One is followed by OP Mainnet, which accounts for 27.01% of the market, with a TVL of $2.85 billion. With a market share of 4.06%, the Layer 2 zkSync protocol comes in 3\u1d49 position. Its TVL is estimated at $429 million. It is $337 million for dYdX, which captures 3.19% market share. Base closes the game, retaining just 1.37% market share with a TVL of $145 million.\n\nLayer 2 protocols massively adopted by centralized exchanges (CEX)\n\nAccording to Datawallet, Layer 2 scaling solutions are currently very popular. This is particularly true of CEXs such as Binance and Coinbase. The latter, for example, has introduced its basic Layer 2, a rollup using the OP stack. Crypto derivatives exchange Bybit has done the same with Mantle.\n\nThe list is by no means exhaustive. But these examples of major exchanges maneuvering around Layer 2 reflect the growing importance of this technology. This is helping to reinforce the scalability and efficiency of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nTrend towards Layer 2 solutions\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions are technically so powerful that alternative Layer 1 blockchains are migrating to them. This is the case, for example, with Celo, a blockchain project developed by CLabs.\n\nAccording to Datawallet, this migration dynamic is not just a question of interoperability. Basically, it\u2019s financial motivations, and in particular cost-efficiency, that underpin the adoption of Layers 2.\n\nBy opting for this technological solution, crypto firms want to avoid the expense of issuing rewards. To achieve this, they want to take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s network security. A strategy that promises to improve liquidity sharing, developer experience and recognition of Layer 2\u2019s economic benefits. Moreover, this choice enables Layer 1 blockchains to allocate substantial resources to innovation. A policy that marks a turning point in the evolution of blockchain.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has to be said that Layers 2 protocols are tending to redefine the crypto market, particularly that of Ethereum. This, by offering improved scalability that reduces transaction costs. Clearly, Layer 2 solutions are spearheading the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. However, as with any emerging technology, there are hurdles to overcome. In particular, there are potential centralization issues. Users and developers need to remain vigilant and understand the subtleties of each Layer 2 solution. A strategic choice that should enable them to make informed choices.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ethereum Boosted By $20M Purchase By OnlyFans' Parent Firm - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a strategic move that underscores the growing integration of crypto into mainstream business operations, Fenix International Limited, the parent company of the adult content subscription platform OnlyFans, has made a significant investment in Ethereum (ETH). The company\u2019s financial statement for 2022, recently submitted to British authorities, reveals a purchase of Ether worth $19.889 million in 2022.\n\nThe acquisition of Ether by Fenix International Limited comes at a time when the broader crypto market experienced a series of highs and lows. As of November 30, 2022, the purchased ETH had an impairment loss of $8.455 million, bringing the carrying amount to $11.434 million. This impairment reflects the volatile nature of the crypto market, with Ethereum\u2019s price dropping from $2,797.43 to $1,298.94 during the reporting period.\n\nOnlyFans Goes Saylor Mode With Ethereum Purchase\n\nThe investment in Ether is not OnlyFans\u2019 first foray into the world of digital assets. In 2022, the platform announced a feature allowing creators to use verified Ethereum NFTs as their profile images. This move was seen as an attempt to empower creators and explore the potential role of NFTs on the platform. OnlyFans\u2019 CEO, Amrapali Gan, emphasized the initiative\u2019s aim to \u201cempower creators to own their full potential.\u201d\n\nHowever, the crypto landscape in 2022 was not without its challenges. The year witnessed significant disruptions, including the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin and governance token LUNA, the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius, and the implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Despite these setbacks, Ethereum remains a focal point of interest for its potential as an investment into web3 and its integration into mainstream financial systems.\n\nOnlyFans, known for its adult content offerings, has seen substantial growth over the past year. The platform\u2019s revenue surged to $5.6 billion in 2022, up from $4.8 billion in the previous year. The number of creators on the platform also saw a 47% increase, with a 27% rise in the total number of subscribers. Simultaneously, the platform attracted over 50 million new users, and more than 1 million new content creators joined its ranks.\n\nThe decision by Fenix International Limited to diversify its working capital into Ethereum is indicative of a broader trend. As businesses recognize the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, investments in assets like Ethereum are becoming increasingly common. With its inherent properties as an \u201cultra-sound money\u201d, Ethereum continues to attract attention from both individual investors and large corporations.\n\nAs the crypto ecosystem evolves, the integration of digital assets into traditional business models will likely become more prevalent. OnlyFans\u2019 significant investment in Ethereum is a testament to this trend and the growing belief in the long-term potential of crypto.\n\nAs of press time, Ethereum is trading at $1,645.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "OnlyFans invests in Ethereum: how much did it affect the price? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Recently, Fenix International Limited, the well-known company behind OnlyFans, acquired Ethereum (ETH), one of the most prestigious crypto assets. But how much did this affect the coin\u2019s price?\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details below.\n\nThe purchase by OnlyFans and the price considerations of Ethereum\n\nAs anticipated above, the British subscription-based adult content company, OnlyFans, entered the cryptocurrency arena in conjunction with a period of significant business expansion.\n\nAccording to filed financial data, OnlyFans has invested in Ethereum (ETH) worth $19,889 million.\n\nHowever, the value of acquired ETH was released immediately, resulting in an impairment loss of $8,455 million by 30 November 2022. As a result, Ethereum\u2019s remaining accounting value stands at $11,434 million.\n\nThis depreciation underscores how the initial investment in Ethereum has lost value, in line with recent fluctuations in the global cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to the submitted documentation, the cryptocurrency investment falls under the category of investment in intangible assets with an \u201cindefinite useful life.\u201d\n\nThis move by OnlyFans into the cryptocurrency world could have multiple implications, highlighting a deliberate purpose of diversification and adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nMoreover, this move comes in parallel with Ethereum\u2019s growing recognition as an attractive asset due to its potential as a solid store of value.\n\nIndeed, the increasing integration of Ethereum into mainstream financial institutions adds further appeal to this asset as a sustainable investment option.\n\nIn addition, this investment could be linked to Ethereum\u2019s ability to act a reserve, potentially reducing the magnitude of its fluctuations in response to movements in conventional financial markets.\n\nIn addition to its foray into cryptocurrencies, OnlyFans has previously expanded its financial strategy through initiatives regarding non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIn fact, in February 2022, OnlyFans introduced a feature that allows users to view verified NFTs as their profile images. At present, the adult platform only allows the use of NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFocus on the price of the Ethereum crypto\n\nDuring the month of August, Ethereum experienced the cancellation of all profits that had remained for a period longer than a month.\n\nThe alternative cryptocurrency leader suffered a sharp drop from the level of around $1,800 recorded two weeks ago and has since fluctuated in the $1,600 range.\n\nAt the moment, the value of ETH is pegged at about $1,649, denoting a decline of more than 11% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. This correction in prices has also produced an effect on the overall profitability of the network.\n\nIn addition, a recent Glassnode update found that about 55.42% of all ETH addresses were profitable, marking the smallest value in seven months.\n\nThe level of profitability can also be assessed through the Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator. The latter basically represents the difference between unrealized profit and unrealized loss and makes it possible to determine whether the network is overall in a profit or loss state.\n\nAlthough the positive value confirmed that the network was in a net gaining phase, the profitability degree experienced a marked decrease. So, the NUPL dropped to 0.032 from the value of 0.13 before the correction in prices.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the bearish trend in prices has failed to dent the enthusiasm of ETH stakeholders. Ignoring the ups and downs of the market, the amount of funds locked in Ethereum smart contracts has in fact continued to reach new peaks.\n\nAccording to the latest available update, more than 28 million ETH were staked on the network, equivalent to about 23% of Ethereum\u2019s entire circulating supply.\n\nThis significant increase in the amount of funds in play also highlights the confidence investors have placed in this mechanism, which was previously absent. Finally, since the implementation of Shapella\u2019s hard fork, the supply of ETH has increased by more than 50%."

However, due to the market-wide decline in crypto asset values throughout the previous year, the total valuation of its Ether holdings experienced an $8.5 million decrease by November 2022.\n\nCalculated Ventures and Financial Trends\n\nSource: Fenix International\n\nBy November 30, 2022, a time when Ethereum was priced at $1,295 each, Fenix International's ETH holdings were valued at $11.4 million. Despite the initial downward movement in their crypto investments, the parent company witnessed robust growth in its core operations during the reporting period that concluded on November 30, 2022.\n\nSolid Revenue Growth and Platform Expansion\n\nThe filing revealed a notable 16.6% surge in the company's revenue, escalating from $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5.6 billion in 2022. Notably, the platform, which predominantly caters to adult entertainment, observed an impressive 47% rise in the number of content creators and a substantial 27% increase in total subscribers.\n\nCrypto Expansions Beyond Investments\n\nFenix International's cryptocurrency engagement extends beyond investments. In February 2022, the platform allowed verified creators to adopt Ethereum-based NFTs as profile pictures, demonstrating its willingness to experiment with digital assets.\n\nAdditionally, the company's executives ventured into the digital asset realm with the launch of \"Zoop\" in June 2022. This celebrity trading card platform, built on the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon, enabled users to trade 3D digital playing cards featuring their favorite celebrities."

        "content": "Decoding Ethereum\u2019s Gas Fees: Historical Trends, EIP-1559, and the Shift to PoS \u2013 A Comprehensive Guide\n\nBy Raghav Sawhney\n\nEthereum\u2019s Gas Fees: Navigating the Waves of Change\n\nEthereum, often dubbed the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has been a beacon for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and the DeFi movement. Its versatility and adaptability have made it a favorite among developers and investors alike. However, as with any pioneering technology, it has faced its share of challenges, with gas fees being a prominent one.\n\nThe Essence of Ethereum\u2019s Gas Fees\n\nAt its core, gas in Ethereum is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations, like making a transaction or running a contract. Users pay for this computational work in ETH, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency. The total cost of a transaction is determined by multiplying the gas used by the gas price set by the user.\n\nHistorical Context: The Peaks and Troughs\n\nEthereum\u2019s gas fees have historically been a reflection of the network\u2019s demand. During the ICO boom of 2017 and the DeFi explosion in 2020, the Ethereum network saw unprecedented congestion. This surge in demand led to skyrocketing gas fees, with users sometimes paying exorbitant amounts to ensure their transactions were processed promptly.\n\nHowever, these peaks were often followed by troughs. Periods of lower network activity naturally led to reduced gas fees, providing relief to users. The recent dip to an 8-month low of $28 million in daily transaction fees is a testament to this ebb and flow.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake and Its Implications\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is monumental. In PoW, miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. In PoS, validators replace miners. These validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d or lock up as collateral.\n\nIn this new system, validators receive the priority fee or tip added by users to entice them to process their transactions faster. The base fee, rather than going to the validators, is burned, removing it from the total supply of ETH. This burning mechanism has profound implications for the economic model of Ethereum, potentially making ETH deflationary over time.\n\nEIP-1559: A Game-Changer for Gas Fees\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 marked a significant shift in how gas fees are determined. Before EIP-1559, users would engage in a bidding war, often overpaying to ensure their transactions were processed. With EIP-1559, the network sets a \u201cbase fee\u201d for transactions based on network demand, providing more predictability and fairness in transaction costs.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nWhile the recent dip in transaction fees is a welcome respite for users, the Ethereum community knows that long-term solutions are essential for the platform\u2019s sustainability. Layer 2 scaling solutions, like rollups, are being explored and implemented to offload some of the transactional volume from the main chain, ensuring faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey is emblematic of the broader blockchain industry\u2019s growth trajectory: filled with challenges, innovations, setbacks, and triumphs. The gas fee saga is but one chapter in this ongoing story, highlighting the platform\u2019s adaptability and the community\u2019s unwavering commitment to creating a decentralized future.\n\nRaghav Sawhney Raghav is a significant contributer who uses his knowledge, skills and experience towards development & growth of the organisation in an efficient and effective manner.\n\n"

        "title": "OnlyFans see record profits as owner rakes in $485 million amid Ethereum investment - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In a year marked by unprecedented growth for online adult content platforms, OnlyFans, the British adult content subscription service, has emerged as a dominant force. The company\u2019s revenues surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2022, reflecting a significant surge in demand for its services. Predominantly focused on pornographic material, the platform has seen an influx of both content creators and subscribers.\n\nSurge in popularity: OnlyFans\u2019 billion-dollar milestone\n\nLeonid Radvinsky, the US-based Ukrainian entrepreneur who acquired OnlyFans in 2018, has reaped substantial rewards from the platform\u2019s success. Recent accounts filed with Companies House reveal that Radvinsky collected a staggering $485 million in dividends since the beginning of the previous year. This financial windfall comes in the wake of over 50 million new users registering on the site in the 12 months leading up to November 2022. Additionally, the platform welcomed over 1 million new content creators, with users collectively spending an impressive $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial health is further underscored by its sales figures. OnlyFans reported a 17% increase in sales, amounting to $1.1 billion for the year. Even more notably, its pre-tax profits witnessed a 21% jump, reaching $525 million during the same period.\n\nDiversifying investments: OnlyFans\u2019 foray into cryptocurrency\n\nIn a move that signals the company\u2019s forward-thinking approach and its intent to diversify its investment portfolio, OnlyFans disclosed that it has channeled some of its capital into Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency. This strategic decision not only showcases the firm\u2019s adaptability to a rapidly evolving digital landscape but also its commitment to leveraging emerging technologies and financial instruments to ensure sustained growth and profitability.\n\nDespite its financial successes, OnlyFans has not been without its share of controversies. A BBC News investigation last year unearthed alarming findings that children had managed to sell and appear in videos on the platform. This was particularly concerning given the site\u2019s claims of restricting access to individuals below the age of 18.\n\nIn response to these concerns, OnlyFans has been proactive in emphasizing its dedication to safety and security. The company stated in its accounts that it \u201cgoes above and beyond the legal requirements, and our peers, to provide a safe platform for creators and fans.\u201d\n\nThe platform prides itself on striking a balance between ensuring safety and allowing creators and fans the autonomy to produce, view, and monetize lawful content.\n\nOnlyFans\u2019 revenue model and public controversies\n\nThe revenue model of OnlyFans is structured such that the company retains approximately \u00a31 for every \u00a34 earned by its content creators. This model has proven lucrative for many of its adult content creators, some of whom have amassed fortunes on the platform. One such creator disclosed to the Standard that she had earned over \u00a34 million on OnlyFans, subsequently investing a portion of her earnings in a rival platform.\n\nPublic perception of the platform and its creators remains mixed. OnlyFans celebrity, Eliza Rose Watson, recently found herself at the center of a controversy. Watson faced backlash for displaying posters featuring a model in a bra top across billboards in locations such as Harrow, Tottenham, Lambeth, and Edgware. Critics argued that such imagery was inappropriate for younger audiences. However, the UK advertising regulator weighed in on the matter, ruling that the image was neither overtly sexual nor objectifying towards women.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs OnlyFans continues its trajectory of growth and profitability, it faces the dual challenge of maintaining its financial momentum while addressing safety concerns and public perception. The company\u2019s recent moves, from investing in Ethereum to reinforcing its safety protocols, indicate a willingness to evolve and adapt in a dynamic digital age."

        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin's Stance in Light of Crucial US Economic Insights - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "In light of the impending major US economic revelations, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) demonstrate varying market behaviors. Here\u2019s a comprehensive insight into their recent trajectories.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Recent Movements\n\nStarting off the week in the vicinity of $25,864, Bitcoin indicates the market\u2019s anticipation of significant economic information. After reaching its weekly peak at $26,166.90 on Sunday, it saw a drop, reaching as low as $25,855.26 during the Monday session.\n\nThe renowned digital currency has shown a stable pattern around this price range over the last ten days. This followed a notable surge earlier in the month when it rose above $30k. Nevertheless, a considerable market dip occurred shortly after, causing Bitcoin to plummet to its lowest in two months.\n\nCurrent trends suggest lateral movements as the 1-day relative strength index (RSI) is 25,86.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Behavior\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, remained steady on Monday, showing negligible change from its Sunday lows. The ETH/USD pair experienced a slight rise, registering a daily high of $1,660.72 after Sunday\u2019s low of $1,645.57.\n\nThis recent development has enabled Ethereum to set $1,663.48, especially after a preceding decline beneath this marker. Echoing Bitcoin\u2019s behavior, Ethereum\u2019s 1-day RSI is currently hindered, which is 30,26. This particular threshold appears to be the key obstacle preventing a positive momentum. Should Ethereum overcome this, we can anticipate its value to possibly exceed $1,700 in the near future. Current price of Ethereum is $1,652.01.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWith significant US economic disclosures on the horizon, including the consumer confidence report and data on gross domestic product and nonfarm payrolls, the cryptocurrency market is manifesting signs of anticipation. As traders and investors closely monitor these developments, the movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain under scrutiny."
