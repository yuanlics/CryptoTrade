        "content": "As for how soon you can access the ETH you want to unstake, \u201cit depends on how many people will unstake at a time,\u201d Marius Van Der Wijden, a developer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk. Only 16 partial withdrawal requests can be put into a slot (which happens every 12 seconds), and there is a single queue for both full and partial withdrawals on the blockchain. But the likelihood of all validators choosing to exit the blockchain is slim, given that staking will enable a new chapter for Ethereum and those that trade on top of it."

        "content": "The European Investment Bank (EIB) is once again leveraging Ethereum in its quest to tokenize capital markets, this time while issuing the first-ever digital pound sterling (GBP) bond on a seperate private blockchain.\n\nEIB, the primary lender of the European Union, deployed the \u00a350 million ($86.6 million) bond to a permissioned network underpinned by HSBC\u2019s tokenization platform, Orion. The EIB is a public institution owned by the EU\u2019s 27 member states.\n\nThe bank opted for a private network for privacy and efficiency, according to a statement. In an effort to increase transparency, the bond was also recorded on Ethereum, a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\nThis was done to provide evidence the issuance took place while still maintaining the anonymity of bondholders (Blockworks reached out for some transaction IDs but they weren\u2019t readily available. We\u2019ll update this piece should EIB provide them).\n\nHSBC debuted Orion last November, when it first flagged intent to launch the tokenized GBP bond. BNP Paribas, HSBC, and RBC Capital Markets were named as joint lead managers of the bond, with those firms serving as custodians. Client assets will be stored in digital securities accounts kept on Orion, the bank said.\n\nThe EIB\u2019s new vehicle is expected to bring a range of benefits to market participants, including reduced costs, improved efficiency and real-time data synchronization in an otherwise cumbersome process.\n\nDigital bonds have garnered interest from financial institutions in various countries, including Australia, Germany, France and Sweden since at least 2017.\n\nA Luxembourg legal framework that enables firms to issue dematerialized securities using distributed ledger technology was enacted into law in January 2021, paving the way for further exploration.\n\nDematerialized securities refer to digital representations of financial assets that exist only in electronic form, rather than as physical certificates or paper documents.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for further innovation in the financial sector,\u201d said EIB Vice-President Ricardo Mourinho Felix. \u201cThis new financial tool will provide additional capital flow that the EIB will invest in projects with global impact.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first digital bond issued by the EIB. That happened back in Apr. 2021, when the European Union\u2019s investment bank deployed a two-year, 100 million euro ($110 million) bond entirely on Ethereum.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "\"Mergers in Winter\": Ethereum as eco-friendly blockchain - Lexology",
        "content": "2022 was a difficult year for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, with markets generally performing poorly, the collapse of terra luna, job cuts at almost all major exchanges, the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and lending platform Celsius Network, and the stupendous collapse of FTX. On the positive side, the major blockchain Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-state consensus mechanism, officially reducing the energy consumption of the blockchain by ~99.95 %.\n\nWhat was the Merge?\n\nTechnically, the Merge was the joining of the original layer of Ethereum with a new layer, called the Beacon Chain. This merger introduced the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to the blockchain, depreciating the initial proof-of-work consensus mechanism.\n\n\u00a9 Stiftung Ethereum; https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/\n\nWhat is proof-of-stake?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database and requires a consensus mechanism to determine entries into it. Proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) are two mechanisms used in various blockchains. Until the Merge, PoW was used by the most important blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum. PoW requires participants (\"miners\") to solve an arithmetic riddle by performing billions of arithmetic operations. These operations require an enormous and increasing amount of computing power. Bitcoin, for instance, is estimated to use 0.16 % of global energy production and emits 0.10 % of the world's carbon emissions as of Q3 2022. Despite improvements, the energy consumption is increasing.\n\nPoS, in turn, is a mechanism based on the idea that those members on the blockchain who own the most tokens have an interest in keeping the network maintained. The decisive factor is therefore the stake of a user, i.e. the proportion of the total amount of tokens they own. The larger the stake, the more likely it is that this user will be selected to mine the next block. Broadly speaking, compared to proof-of-work, the proof-of-stake mechanism is more like a joint-stock corporation. Whoever owns a larger share in the company normally receives more voting rights entitling them to make decisions. PoS does not use energy to secure the network.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, transitioning to PoS meant that the blockchain's energy consumption was reduced to ~0-0026 TWh/year. Estimates show that YouTube, for instance, used over 175 times more energy streaming the \"Gangam Style\" video in 2019 compared to what Ethereum uses per year. The following chart from the Ethereum website shows the estimated annual energy consumption in TWh/year for various industries (retrieved in June 2022; Ethereum is on the right end of the chart titled \"ETH PoS\"):\n\n\u00a9 Stiftung Ethereum; https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/\n\nHow does PoS work?\n\nParticipants (node operators) must deposit 32 Ether (ETH) as collateral (via a smart contract \u2013 this is called \"staking\") to become network validators and receive rewards. One node is then chosen randomly as the recipient of the rewards. Via a staking pool, holders of Ether may pool their Ether holdings to participate in the PoS consensus process; the reward is then split between the pool participants. Many cryptocurrency exchanges (such as our client Bitpanda) offer staking solutions.\n\n\u2026and what happened then?\n\nThe Merge was a global event. It was successfully completed on 15 September 2022. Besides the effects on energy consumption, transactions are also expected to get faster, because PoS requires significantly fewer validations to be performed on the blockchain at the same time. This should also reduce transaction fees. It remains to be seen whether this thesis will uphold.\n\nDespite the technical success of the Merge, the blockchain's cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), like almost all other cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, is still under pressure. At the time of writing (10 November 2022) it was trading at around EUR 1,000 per ETH, down from around EUR 3,300 at the beginning of the year. It remains to be seen if and when this crypto winter will melt into a crypto spring, and whether the Merge will be a commercial success for the network and its users."

        "content": "The 2018 peak of Ethereum was followed by the initial coin offering (ICO) crackdown that caused a collapse across crypto. Ethereum itself avoided regulatory ramifications, but billions of dollars were lost in the meantime.\n\nOn the first day of 2018, Ethereum (ETH 0.39%) traded for $772.35 per token. Since then, its value fell below $100, skyrocketed to over $4,500, and then fallen below $1,000 before climbing to its recent levels above $1,500n. This shows how digital assets have been able to post solid long-term gains, but where will Ethereum go from here?\n\nWhy Ethereum is moving higher\n\nMomentum can't be undersold in the crypto market. A big reason Ethereum and other tokens have gained value in the last few years has been momentum trading during the pandemic, which correlated with higher values for growth stocks as well. It's no coincidence that these assets rose and fell together over the last few years.\n\nWhat's more sustainable long-term is Ethereum's smart contract capability, which has attracted a critical mass of developers and venture capital funding. Coinbase (COIN 0.78%), MetaMask, and OpenSea were just a few of the companies working to make Ethereum more usable. A16Z estimates that by 2022 there were 4,000 developers building on Ethereum, at least four times more than Bitcoin (BTC 0.71%) or Solana (SOL -0.96%).\n\nNot only are developers building on Ethereum, but the blockchain itself has also gone through some major changes.\n\nPoW to PoS and other upgrades\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum completed an upgrade that changed the consensus mechanism for the blockchain from proof-of-work (PoS) to proof-of-stake (PoS), which reduced energy consumption by about 99%. But there are more upgrades in store.\n\n\"The Surge\" is expected to improve the scalability of the blockchain and Layer-2 crypto projects built on top of Ethereum, \"The Verge\" introduces Verkle trees, \"The Purge\" will eliminate historical data and technical debt on the blockchain, and \"The Splurge\" will add miscellaneous upgrades.\n\nWhen completed (which could take many years), the blockchain should be even faster, cheaper, and more user and developer friendly. This could be the start of the next bull run for Ethereum.\n\nCompetition is coming\n\nThe bad news for Ethereum is that it's not the only game in town anymore. Solana has a similar number of users and is a much faster and cheaper blockchain. That's attracted many developers and non-fungible token (NFT) projects, in addition to decentralized finance platforms.\n\nThere are many other blockchains that have seen Ethereum's strengths and weaknesses and tried to improve on them. The cost challenge will continue to be Ethereum's pain point for the foreseeable future. It costs multiple dollars to make normal transactions on Ethereum, which makes the blockchain unusable for small financial transactions or even buying low-cost NFTs.\n\nThis will be the biggest challenge in Ethereum's future. Developers need to make the blockchain faster and cheaper, and we've seen it takes a long time to make upgrades on Ethereum.\n\nA profitable investment\n\nAs I'm writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,552.26, which means a $1,000 investment in the cryptocurrency at the start of 2018 would be worth $2,009.76 today. The ride has been wild, but this has been a profitable investment over the last five years. If upgrades happen quickly and blockchain adoption grows, the next five years could be profitable as well."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) has been struggling with the $1,680 resistance since Jan. 20. Still, the ascending triangle pattern and improvements in investor sentiment in ETH derivatives provides hope that Ether price could reach $1,800 or higher by the end of February. This, of course, depends on how the Ether price behaves as it reaches the pattern deadline by mid-February.\n\nEther/USD price index, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nFrom one side, traders are relieved that Ether is trading up 33% year-to-date, but the repeated failures to break the $1,680 resistance coupled with negative newsflow might give bears the power to cancel the bullish triangle pattern.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 30 report from Axios, New York State's Department of Financial Services is reportedly investigating cryptocurrency exchange Gemini over claims that the firm made regarding assets in its Earn lending program. The suspicions followed reports that multiple Gemini Earn users believed their assets had been protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nOn Jan. 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the Gemini exchange with offering unregistered securities through Earn. In addition, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has claimed that Genesis and DCG owe $900 million to Gemini's clients.\n\nSeveral United States senators have reportedly penned a letter requesting answers from Silvergate Bank, according to a Jan. 31 Bloomberg report. The policymakers were not fully satisfied with the bank\u2019s previous answers about its alleged role in handling FTX user funds. Silvergate reportedly cited restrictions on disclosing \"confidential supervisory information.\"\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi announced that the \"Zhejiang\" public testnet will be launched on Feb. 1. The implementation will allow staked Ether withdrawal on a test environment so that validators can anticipate the proposed changes for the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nLet's look at Ether derivatives data to understand if pro traders are frustrated by the recent price rejection at the $1,680 level.\n\nETH\u2019s futures premium has failed to enter the FOMO area\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe annualized two-month futures premium should trade between 4% and 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. When the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that traders using future contracts have failed to enter the neutral-to-bullish 4% threshold. Still, the current 3.5% premium denotes a moderate sentiment improvement compared to two weeks prior, but that does not mean traders expect an immediate positive price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions traders are comfortable with downside risk\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew has stabilized near 0% in the last two weeks, signaling that Ether options traders held a neutral sentiment. That is particularly intriguing since ETH gained 10% on Jan. 20 \u2014 indicating pro traders are pricing similar upside and downside risks.\n\nRelated: UK Treasury publishes crypto framework paper, Here\u2019s what\u2019s inside\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to whales and market makers not comfortable with adding leverage longs, but at the same time, not worried if the $1,570 ascending channel support breaks.\n\nTraders will watch to see if Ether bulls are able to keep the price within the bullish triangle formation for the next two weeks, but if the macroeconomic environment allows, ETH derivatives point to a potential rally toward $1,800.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "In January, ETH\u2019s supply decreased by 10,145.72 units.\n\nFebruary might be marked by a price decline.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound Money, in January, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] supply decreased by 10,145.72 units, resulting in a net deflationary value of approximately $16 million. As of this writing, the current total supply of ETH stood at 120,515,752, with an annual growth rate of -0.012%.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum: Deflation is the preferred option\n\nThe decrease in the supply of ETH has several implications for the cryptocurrency market. A decrease in supply leads to an increase in demand, as less of the asset is available for purchase. This can drive up the price of ETH, making it more valuable. Thus, the increase in demand could also attract more investors to the market, which could further boost the price of ETH.\n\nAlso, the net deflationary value of ETH could positively impact the currency\u2019s stability. Notably, deflationary currencies maintain their value over time, as the decrease in supply creates a scarcity of the asset. This reduces the risk of inflation and can make the currency more attractive to investors, as it is less likely to depreciate.\n\nOutlook is gloomy in the interim\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s net deflationary value might ensure price stability in the long term, an assessment of price movements on a daily chart revealed that an imminent price reversal was on the horizon.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $1,569.93. In January, the altcoin\u2019s value rose by 32%. However, as many investors rallied to take profits, buying pressure appears to have declined significantly.\n\nA look at ETH\u2019s moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) confirmed the commencement of a new bear cycle on 27 January. Since then, the indicator has returned only red histogram bars, and ETH\u2019s price has fallen by 2%.\n\nAt press time, key momentum indicators aimed for their respective neutral zones. ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have declined persistently in the last week and remained in downtrends at 56.33 and 59.40, respectively, at the time of writing. A drop in ETH accumulation marked the past week, and many took to selling their holdings.\n\nLikewise, the dynamic line (green) of the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) aimed to cross into the negative zone. Many investors shied away from buying more ETH.\n\nHow many ETHs can you buy for $1?\n\nThe lack of new demand for ETH was depicted by a consistent decline in its Open Interest in the past ten days, data from Coinglass revealed. Within that period, ETH\u2019s Open Interest fell by 16%.\n\nTypically, a decline in an asset\u2019s Open Interest means that traders are closing out their positions and there is a decline in new contracts being created. This suggests that they are becoming less confident in the future price movements of the asset and are reducing their exposure."

        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate analysts shows that Asia, the U.S., and the EU have been bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) since late January.\n\nAs the regional price metrics indicate, investors from all three regions feel more bullish on BTC than they do on ETH. In the meantime, year-over-year BTC supply for Asia means BTC will continue to increase in the short term.\n\nRegional prices\n\nThe regional price metric used in this research shows the 30-day change in the regional prices of Asia, the EU, and the U.S. The price movements during the working hours of a region must be recorded before calculating the regional price metric. Then, the price for a region can be determined by calculating the cumulative sum of the price changes recorded within the working hours of that region.\n\nThe chart below reflects the regional BTC prices for all three regions since the beginning of 2022. The red bars represent the regional price for the U.S., while the blue and green ones represent the EU and Asia, respectively.\n\nIf the metric falls below the zero line, this indicates that the region is bearish on BTC. If it places above the line, it represents the region\u2019s bullish sentiment.\n\nAccording to the chart, that all three regions turned on the bullish side in late January 2023 and have been bullish since then, with the U.S. being the most bullish. The last time all three regions were bullish was during a short time in August 2022, right after the Luna collapse.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe regional ETH prices for Asia, the U.S., and the EU also represent a similar bullish sentiment. The chart below illustrates the regional ETH prices for each region since the beginning of the year 2022. The U.S., the EU, and Asia are represented with red, blue, and green, respectively.\n\nSimilar to the regional BTC prices, all three regions currently appear bullish on ETH, with the U.S. being the most bullish one. However, none of the regions show the same level of enthusiasm as they do with BTC.\n\nYear-over-Year supply of Asia\n\nThis metric provides an estimate for the year-over-year (YoY) change in the market share between the BTC supply held and being traded. The chart below shows the YoY supply for the Asia region since the beginning of 2010.\n\nThe data shows that the region\u2019s YoY supply is currently over 8.5%. This percentage indicates that Asia is at the highest bullish point it has ever been.\n\nPrevious CryptoSlate research revealed that Asian investors built and maintained a smart money reputation by consistently buying at the bottom and selling at the top. Assuming Asiacontinuesg to act \u201csmart,\u201d their bullish sentiment indicates that BTC will continue to increase, at least in the short term.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Shanghai+Capella will be triggered 6 days later (at epoch 1350),\u201d Busa said.\n\n\u201cOnce the upgrade has been triggered, you can test partial and full withdrawals as well as a few other EIPs that are included in the upgrade,\u201d tweeted Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nBusa added that a faucet for testnet ETH will be deployed shortly after its launch. Users can monitor for information and news relating to the testnet at zhejiang.ethpandaops.io.\n\nThe news comes as Ethereum developers aim to enable staked ETH withdrawals sometime in March or April.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Beacon Chain consensus layer launched in December 2020, allowing ETH holders to stake their coins for the first time.\n\nBut despite the Beacon Chain merging with Ethereum\u2019s execution layer in September 2022 to boot Proof-of-Work miners from the network in favor of Proof of Stake validators, stakers still cannot withdraw their ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Merge Goes Live in Historic Upgrade for Ethereum After Years of Toil and Tests Ethereum Shifts to Proof of Stake and Sets Stage for Further Changes\n\nRoughly 16.3M ETH worth $28.5B is currently staked.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

They followed up by launching a shadow fork supporting withdrawals on Jan. 23.\n\nThe recent progress towards enabling withdrawals has bolstered the performance of liquid staking derivative (LSD) providers. Many analysts expect Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to bolster LSD adoption and drive traders to eliminate much of the spread between ETH and LSD tokens.\n\nThe native tokens of top LSD providers Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stakewise have surged 126%, 93.5%, and 107% in January, according to Coingecko."

The project quickly sold out regardless.\n\nAnndy Lian, author of the new book \u201cNFT: From Zero to Hero,\u201d told Forkast in an emailed statement that Polygon\u2019s growth isn\u2019t really about Trump. The main reason for Polygon\u2019s gain is it has a vast support system with gas fees (costs for transacting on the network) that are much lower than on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe actual spike in popularity was with [collaboration with social media platform] Reddit in August 2022,\u201d Lian said. \u201cThe collaboration with top brands such as Meta, Starbucks and Nike are also key indicators that they are on the right track and well accepted by mainstream audiences.\u201d\n\nLian added that Polygon is also host to a large percentage of projects with greater utility, such as Sandbox and PlanetIX, which were both top 10 ranked collections across all NFT marketplaces in January.\n\n\u201cWhen there is demand, there is supply,\u201d Lian said. \u201cThis is what we see in the case of Polygon.\u201d\n\nOpenSea is the largest NFT marketplace in the industry, and had 40% of the total NFT sales volume in January, according to DappRadar.\n\nSee related article: Polygon cofounder says bear market is an opportunity for blockchain builders"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMore individual NFTs were sold on Polygon than Ethereum via leading overall marketplace OpenSea for the second consecutive month, according to public blockchain data curated via a Dune dashboard.\n\nIn January, OpenSea handled over 1.5 million NFTs sales on Ethereum sidechain Polygon, while Ethereum\u2019s own mainnet tallied a little over 1.1 million sales via the same marketplace. That continues the trend from December, when 1.3 million NFTs were sold on Polygon through OpenSea compared to just under 1 million Ethereum NFTs.\n\nEthereum has long been considered the premier blockchain for NFTs, and it hosts most of the high-value projects\u2014despite its sometimes-high gas fees. But as Polygon continues to forge large brand deals with big names like Meta, Starbucks, and Reddit, and as additional game projects tap the scaling network, more and more assets are being traded on the sidechain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the Ethereum merge\u2014which was finalized back in September\u2014reduced the mainnet\u2019s energy consumption by 99.998%, it didn\u2019t resolve the problem of the network\u2019s gas fees, which can sometimes exceed the base price of the asset itself. A gas fee is a cost that the Ethereum network charges users to complete a transaction.\n\nBy contrast, Polygon and layer-1 Ethereum rivals like Solana and Avalanche offer exponentially lower fees for user transactions, and have in turn become increasingly known for hosting more affordable NFT collections.\n\nAccording to OpenSea, the top Polygon NFT collection in January overall was the controversial Donald Trump digital trading cards, which saw nearly 5,500 sales across all Polygon marketplaces, tallying 1,743 ETH (nearly $2.8 million) in trading volume.\n\nBut when it comes to Polygon collections with the highest number of sales across all marketplaces beyond just OpenSea, Planet IX notched roughly 5 million sales over the last 30 days, while Sunflower Land tallied 1 million sales, Mocaverse saw 42,000 sales, and Lympo Athletes accumulated about 37,000 sales in the past month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that most of these sales are for low-cost assets to be used in metaverse worlds or Web3 games. In some cases, such as with Sunflower Land and Planet IX, NFT assets are selling for pennies\u2019 worth of ETH, significantly bringing down the average sale price for Polygon-based NFTs over that span.\n\nWhile Polygon surpassed Ethereum in the total number of sales, Ethereum is still seeing substantially more value traded overall. On OpenSea, Ethereum saw roughly $446 million in total volume in January traded while Polygon NFT sales comprised just $15.4 million worth. With about 1.5 million NFT sales on Polygon, that puts the average sale price around $10.\n\nNotably, this isn't the first time that the total number of monthly Polygon NFT sales has topped Ethereum. Dune shows a similar spike in late 2021 and early 2022, but then the number of Polygon sales fell sharply until the recent rebound.\n\nThe priciest and most desirable NFTs (such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club) still live on Ethereum, which is driving significantly more trading volume than Polygon. But the sidechain network is seeing traction as a destination for gaming NFTs and low-cost collectibles\u2014which could aid broader NFT adoption by reaching a much larger audience."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nWith the broader jump in the performance of most crypto assets today, Ethereum (ETH) is notably riding the train. The price of the digital currency is pegged at $1,671.53, up by 5.69% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing. With the growth, Ethereum is now rebuilding its week-to-date (WTD) metrics, having accrued just about 4.13% within that time frame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the most important factor fueling the growth in the price of Ethereum remains broader crypto market sentiment, two other distinct factors can be pointed out.\n\nFirst is the intense activities of both retail and whale buyers, according to popular crypto market analytics platforms. While Glassnode showed that the total number of nonzero addresses topped 93,275,549, an indication of intense buying, WhaleStats confirmed the use of the Ethereum protocol by whales, as measured through the accumulation of altcoins like Gala (GALA) and Chainlink (LINK).\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides this, the network activities have lent positivity among all Ethereum investors. Besides the circulating supply of the digital currency dropping to its lowest point, the public testnet that will help simulate the staking Ether withdrawal process has also been launched, per an earlier U.Today report.\n\nEthereum's journey to $2,000\n\nFollowing the completion of the transition of Ethereum from the proof-of-work (PoW) model to the proof of stake (PoS) through The Merge, many expected a corresponding upshoot in the coin's price.\n\nWith the positive rally Ethereum has gained thus far this year, the projection that it will retest a new high of $2,000 has resurfaced. While this price growth, if it happens, will not come as a surprise seeing as Ethereum's all-time high (ATH) remains pegged at $4,891.70, the projected short-term $2,000 growth might be unrealistic.\n\nThis is because, with the advent of the Shanghai upgrade, a number of staked Ethereum may be withdrawn and liquidated, a trend that may tank the price of the coin."

        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai fork is coming, but it doesn't mean investors should dump ETH - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s next big upgrade, Shanghai, is on the horizon for March. The Shanghai hard fork will implement further improvement proposals for the Ethereum network as well as enable Ether (ETH) stakers and validators to withdraw their assets from the Beacon Chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, staked ETH represents approximately 14% of the total supply, or 16 million coins. It equates to over $25 billion at ETH\u2019s current price, a substantial sum that will gradually become liquid following the fork.\n\nSome ETH stakers have waited over three years to withdraw their rewards. Does that mean most of them will line up to withdraw and sell their ETH as quickly as possible? This scenario is improbable. There are numerous reasons why investors shouldn\u2019t be concerned about the impending update, and even more why most Ethereum stakeholders will increase their investment into staking following Shanghai.\n\nEthereum will remain the leading PoS network\n\nAlthough ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum is the leading proof-of-stake (PoS) network. At the time of writing, it accounts for approximately 65% of the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, sitting at around $48.7 billion.\n\nTotal value locked on all blockchains. Source: DeFi Llama\n\nDespite the current market, the amount of ETH deposited over time has continued to increase at a steady, stable rate, reaching over 500,000 validators in January 2023.\n\nStaking yield remains strong\n\nThe staking yield remains stable and currently sits at about 5.45% annual percentage rate (APR). Therefore, new entrants should familiarize themselves with the overall yield compensation structure consisting of staking rewards, tips and maximal extractable value (MEV).\n\nWith MEV-Boost, stakers can increase their rewards 2x\u20133.5x over vanilla blocks. However, when demand for ETH is on the rise, it is tips and MEV that ultimately improve ETH staking yields. Since moving to proof-of-stake, MEV relayers have relayed approximately 85,000 ETH and facilitated an increase of 32,500 ETH in additional rewards.\n\nLiquidity attracts stakers\n\nAs with any market, liquidity is king. Most investors were originally reluctant to stake ETH when it became available because doing so required locking up their funds for an undetermined period of time. Staking ETH required a minimum of 32 ETH, meaning that when Eth2 launched in December 2020, the price of entry was around $19,000. At its peak in November 2021, the price was nearly $150,000.\n\nRelated: Post-Merge ETH has become obsolete\n\nThat cost to stake gave validators pause, and many held off on securing the network. The Shanghai update, however, will remove this uncertainty, and tokenholders will be allowed to withdraw their staked assets. The obvious reaction is to assume that people will simply withdraw their funds and \u201ccash out,\u201d but we are likely going to see the exact opposite. Because such a large percentage of investors were initially reluctant to stake ETH \u2014 remember, only 14% of the supply is currently staked \u2014 the percentage of ETH staked is likely going to rise with the risk of withdrawal uncertainty gone.\n\nAdditionally, many ETH stakers bought the token during the bull run when prices hit a top of $4,500. But with the current price hovering around $1,600, it is unlikely that current stakers will sell at a loss. With MEV-boosted rewards sitting close to 7% and a positive outlook on a market price increase due to deflationary tokenomics, we expect to see a significant inflow into ETH staking.\n\nThe rise of liquid staking\n\nStakers can stake ETH directly with Ethereum, which requires a hefty sum of 32 ETH, or via liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is a concept that democratizes Ethereum staking for investors who can stake as little as 0.01 ETH. Staking small amounts of Ether is possible when investors exchange their ETH for derivative tokens, which are backed one-to-one and represent the amount of Ether staked in the pool.\n\nThe capital efficiency of liquid staking is one of its main advantages for investors. Sometimes referred to as liquid staking derivatives (LSD), it gives you the freedom to enter and exit the market at will. Because it\u2019s a derivative, it gives investors access to additional markets, and the LSD industry is just beginning to get off the ground.\n\nImprovement proposals and their impact\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade (EIP-4895) will focus on enabling withdrawals on the execution layer \u2014 Shanghai \u2014 and the consensus layer, referred to as the Capella upgrade. The Capella upgrade is especially beneficial for ETH stakers interested in understanding how withdrawals will work, as interactions are necessary to complete a full withdrawal on the consensus layer.\n\nRelated: Tax on income you never earned? It\u2019s possible after Ethereum\u2019s Merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap has several updates coming after Shanghai \u2014 sometimes referred to as the \u201cSurge,\u201d \u201cVerge,\u201d \u201cPurge\u201d and \u201cSplurge\u201d \u2014 demonstrating the community\u2019s dedication and long-term vision, which is essential for the protocol\u2019s future evolution. In the immediate future, EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) can scale Ethereum with new transaction roll-ups reducing gas fees, and EIP-3540 will aim to reduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine\u2019s resource requirements.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum saw a 178% increase in developer activity for programming libraries, reaching 1.5 million downloads. Despite the market being down, developers have ramped up real-world solutions and continue to build smart contracts on Ethereum at a blistering pace, hitting 4.6 million deployments for Q4 2022.\n\nEthereum mainnet smart contracts deployed per quarter. Source: Dune\n\nThe success of switching Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake should not be understated as an incredible achievement. Now that this move has been a resounding success, upgrades will be released faster, thanks to a community that is unmatched in terms of creativity, values and long-term vision. The foundation of cryptocurrency and proof-of-stake has been built on Ethereum, and it has a highly promising future.\n\nInvestors and stakers would be wise to keep their ETH staked, allowing it to continue to secure and decentralize the network. And generating some additional passive income from staking rewards doesn\u2019t hurt the decision to remain, either.\n\nKonstantin Boyko-Romanovsky is the CEO of Allnodes.

        "content": "The Ethereum Shanghai hard fork is less than two months away, and liquid staking derivatives (LSD) are gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFollowing Shanghai, users can withdraw ether locked up on the Beacon chain \u2014 opening up an exit for long-time Ethereum stakers.\n\nBlockworks Research analysts note in a report that this upgrade is likely to encourage more ETH holders to lock up their assets over the long term, increasing pressure on stake rate \u2014 but it is possible that there could also be a dip in staking demands as withdrawals become available.\n\nAlluvial co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Mike Taormina told Blockworks that the rise in popularity of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum should come as no surprise, as it\u2019s about more than the debut of withdrawals.\n\n\u201cLiquid staking also solves a real problem: When you lock tokens to participate in the security of the network, those tokens are illiquid,\u201d he said.\n\nNot so, with ether receipt tokens.\n\nLiquid staking in proof-of-stake ecosystems\n\nThe ordinary staking process involves locking up cryptocurrency in a proof-of-stake network to support blockchain operations and enable transactions, while simultaneously allowing users to accrue staking rewards.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, an individual user must deposit 32 ETH ($50,900) to the blockchain and activate the validator software to participate in staking.\n\nAs ETH holders often do not have enough funds or technical expertise to run their own validator node \u2014 now exceeding 510,000 worldwide \u2014 liquid staking protocols, including Lido, Rocket Pool and Frax, remove the barrier to entry by allowing ether holders to participate in staking without having to lock in any tokens.\n\nThis is often referred to as pooled staking, and users who participate are given ERC-20-compliant liquidity tokens that represent their staked ether, which they can hold in their wallets and use in other DeFi applications. But using decentralized exchanges, they can also sell back into normal unstaked ether at any time.\n\nOf course, liquid staking is not only limited to the Ethereum blockchain. The Solana network has been actively looking at ways to grow its total value locked (TVL) \u2014 particularly following events related to FTX, which hit Solana hard \u2014 and liquid staking derivatives may address some of these challenges.\n\nMarinade Finance, a non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on the Solana blockchain, is hoping to increase DeFi activity on its network by launching a program that will distribute its governance token MNDE to individuals and protocols in hopes of growing mSOL TVL.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much locked SOL that\u2019s staking. It\u2019s helping decentralization and validation, but it\u2019s not helping liquidity, so what we want to see is some of that stake turn into liquidity \u2014 and help DeFi protocols \u2014 and liquid staking tokens is really the mechanism for that,\u201d Brandon Tucker, a growth lead at the DAO, told Blockworks.\n\nSetting a new liquid staking standard\n\nFollowing the Shanghai upgrade, Taormina believes that liquid staking tokens may become even more popular \u2014 driving increased confidence in the Ethereum blockchain and welcoming a new cohort of mainstream adopters.\n\nEthereum has a much lower percentage of its token staked \u2014 less than 14% per Blockworks Research \u2014 compared to other blockchains, Taormina said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something holding Ethereum holders back from participating in staking, this is why the upgrade is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Shanghai upgrade will finally enable withdrawals and remove uncertainty\u2026we think that more people will end up participating [in staking].\u201d\n\nIn anticipation of a growth in staking participants, Taormina and his team at Alluvial are partnering with a handful of Web3 teams to design a new liquid staking standard.\n\nThis new standard, dubbed \u2018Liquid Collective,\u2019 will be an enterprise-grade liquid standard built to attract enterprise-grade users to Web3.\n\n\u201cThis is important because it helps onboard a cohort of users that are on the sidelines that would be interested in staking but need experience to meet some minimum thresholds that aren\u2019t currently met today,\u201d Taormina said.\n\nIf you want to read more about the current state of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum and their yield market share, you can subscribe to Blockworks Research and read their latest report at no charge for the next 24 hours.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A testnet that will demonstrate Ethereum staking withdrawals is set to go live on Wednesday, according to statements from developers on Jan. 30.\n\nEthereum Foundation members Parithosh Jayanthi and Barnabas Busa said the Zhejiang testnet will go live on Feb. 1 at 15:00 UTC. The Shanghai and Capella upgrade will be triggered on the testnet six days later (at epoch 1350 on the blockchain).\n\nOnce the process is complete, validators can try out staking withdrawals in a practice environment without real funds. Validators can convert between credentials, test partial and full withdrawals, and fully exit their validator node.\n\nEthereum currently supports most other staking-related features. Users can now stake 32 ETH ($55,200) to operate a validator node. That feature has been available since developers launched Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain in December 2020. Users have also been able to earn staking rewards since September 2022\u2019s Merge upgrade.\n\nDespite those capabilities, Ethereum does not allow validators to withdraw staked ETH. This limitation was introduced to ensure the strength of the staking network.\n\nThe absence of staking withdrawals is one reason liquid staking services, such as those offered by Lido and Coinbase, have become prominent. While users of these platforms may be prevented from withdrawing their staked ETH, they also issue a corresponding \u201cliquid\u201d token that can be invested freely elsewhere. Some liquid tokens have seen price movement due to the upcoming staking withdrawal upgrade.\n\nThe Zhejiang testnet is the next step toward introducing proper staking withdrawals on Ethereum. Recent developer calls suggest that the feature will be introduced on the mainnet in March. However, there is still no definite date for the upgrade.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The derivative tokens can then be used for other purposes, while the ETH remains locked in the proof-of-stake system. Ahead of Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, which is set to take place in March and will allow ETH stakers to withdraw their tokens, interest in liquid staking has been growing as users have sought ways of exploiting the ETH currently locked on the network."

The company is licensed by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fin-FSA), which targets to reduce the complexity of converting and paying in volatile cryptocurrencies.\n\nMembrane Finance is excited to announce the launch of EUROe on Ethereum!\n\n\n\nRead more at https://t.co/nV8dYKkBmK, and read the thread below to see how you can get started with $EUROe from today! \u2014 EUROe (@EUROemoney) February 2, 2023\n\nBy fusing EUROe with the Ethereum blockchain, Membrane Finance aims to enable near-instant payments globally for a fraction of the cost required in a traditional fiat setting.\n\nEach EUROe token is backed by \u201cat least one fiat euro [...] In a European financial institution or bank, ring-fenced from Membrane Finance,\u201d according to the company\u2019s post. The company believes it will allow for \u201cnear-instant payments\u201d at close to zero cost, in contrast to the high cost and slow speeds of traditional finance.\n\nMembrane Finance CEO Juha Viitala expressed hope that the regulated EUROe coin would encourage more Europeans to grow their wealth through the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, stating:\n\n\u201cStablecoins are an essential part of the transition towards blockchain-based money infrastructure, and Europeans deserve to have a full-reserve euro stablecoin from the EU and regulated by an EU-based financial authority. EUROe hopefully brings more regular people to DeFi, who were previously unable to or worried about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nSince 2021, the European market has witnessed numerous Euro-pegged stablecoin offerings being launched to over the complexities present in the fiat economy, including Circle's EUROC and Cardano's Stasis Euro (EURS).\n\nRelated: UK-native stablecoin integrates into 18,000 ATMs nationwide\n\nMembrane Finance plans to extend EUROe's support from Ethereum to other popular blockchains to improve its cross-compatibility.\n\n\u201cStablecoins,\u201d or crypto tokens backed by fiat currency, have had a long and illustrious history in the crypto world. The first U.S. dollar stablecoin, Tether (USDT), was initially released for the Bitcoin Omni Layer, with an Ethereum version arriving in 2018. It is now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn Jan. 19, Circle and the team behind the Uniswap decentralized exchange released a report claiming that blockchain-based foreign exchange can reduce remittance costs by as much as 80%."

        "content": "A popular crypto strategist says Bitcoin (BTC) and two Ethereum (ETH) rivals, Solana (SOL) and Fantom (FTM), have more room to run.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 190,500 Twitter followers that Bitcoin is likely to surge at least 25% from its $24,007 value at time of writing.\n\n\u201cBTC: The longer that this hangs around this area, the more bullish I am. I think that it\u2019s quite likely that we see a gap fill up to $30,000 eventually.\u201d\n\nNext, Sherpa says Solana appears headed to the $30 range.\n\n\u201cSolana has done well and it should go to the mid-$30s if BTC holds up. I\u2019m not sure what the long-term future for this coin is, FTX/Alameda had a big bag of it iirc (if I recall correctly) and who knows how that\u2019ll get liquidated. The culture of this chain is still good though.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $24.89 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Fantom, he sets a price target of more than $0.60. Fantom is worth $0.58 at time of writing.\n\n\u201cFTM: Looks extremely\u2026 strong, I like this one. It will eventually hit $0.60ish IMO [in my opinion].\u201d\n\nSherpa also looks at four other altcoins.\n\nHe says Avalanche (AVAX) is likely going to retrace to $17, a more than 20% decline from its $21.48 value at time of writing.\n\n\u201cAVAX: Strong move but you probably still get some bids lower at like $17. High volume node around there and some S/R levels. Price currently pulling back due to S/R + 200-day EMA, which acts as resistance in these situations.\u201d\n\nNext, he says Cardano (ADA) is holding up against Bitcoin but he doesn\u2019t expect a strong rally in price, especially when compared to the upside potential of other altcoins. Cardano is trading at $0.40 at time of writing.\n\n\u201cADA: I don\u2019t really see any reason to buy this coin. The ADA/BTC pair looks pretty good to be honest and at support but I don\u2019t think this outperforms other altcoins relatively. Still, it has an insane community.\u201d\n\nHe says Polkadot (DOT) is underperforming relative to other altcoins and does not see a strong case for the token to move to the upside.\n\n\u201cDOT: I don\u2019t see any reason to buy this coin. It\u2019s unpumped relative to the rest of the market but it has performed horribly overall. Not a fan of the chart.\u201d\n\nLastly, he says STEPN (GMT) is likely forming a bottom and will rally to $0.79, a more than 38% increase from its $0.57 value at time of writing.\n\n\u201cGMT: Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this forms a low around here and continues higher to the $.79 area if BTC is stable. 200-d EMA acted as resistance but it\u2019s still ok for now IMO. I still use this app every week and invested in this one.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe average number of 56 industry experts expect ETH to hit finish 2023 above $2,000 and hit $6,000 by 2025.\n\nFinder\u2019s panelists also opined that Ethereum could flippen Bitcoin as the largest crypto by market cap by 2024.\n\n56% of Finder\u2019s experts said now is the time to buy Ether and 60% believe ETH is underpriced at its current levels.\n\nA report from Finder on crypto\u2019s largest altcoin Ether (ETH) said that the token could skyrocket to $6,000 by 2025 as the markets recover following a murky year in 2022. Finder\u2019s analysis in January engaged 56 industry experts on what they believe the future holds for Ethereum and its native asset ETH.\n\nEther (ETH) Price Predictions\n\nThe panel average predicted key price levels for the largest altcoin by 2023, 2025, and 2030. Amid uncertainty within the broader financial industry, tightening monetary policies from the fed, and global inflation levels, most panelists expect ETH to close 2023 at around or just above $2,000. Currently, the token trades at around $1600 after crypto prices rallied in January.\n\nFinder\u2019s panelists turn more bullish down the line, predicting that ETH is set to reach $6,000 by 2025 and $14,000 by 2030. Founder of Seasonal Tokens Ruadhan O noted that transaction costs on Ethereum will rise as global economies recover, and this will incentivize users to buy more tokens. The increased buying pressure will propel ETH to higher prices as more validators and users flock to the network, Ruadhan said.\n\nBen Ritchie, Managing Director of Digital Capital Management AU, opined that Ethereum will power through harsh market conditions and \u201cdominate the market as the leading smart contract platform\u201d. Ritchie added that this should boost ETH\u2019s price as more businesses develop decentralized applications (dapps) on Ethereum and network activity increases.\n\nOrigin Protocol co-founder Josh Fraser hailed Ethereum as the base layer of innovation for most of DeFi and NFTs. DefiLlama data showed that Ethereum boasts over $29 billion in total value locked (TVL), the highest of any DeFi chain. Some of the most prominent NFT projects like Bored Apes, Azuki, and CryptoPunks also run atop Ethereum\u2019s chain. Fraser believes these factors will put ETH on track for $14,000 by 2025.\n\nCEO of Standard DAO Aaron Rafferty expressed bullish sentiment on ETH with a long-term point of view. Rafferty noted that ETH supply will drop, causing asset scarcity and hiked token prices.\n\nThe last 2 years have been extremely positive fundamentally for Ethereum from EIP 1559 to the Merge, [which] when combined, caused a deflationary effect to the protocol. As more companies like Mastercard and Visa use the protocol and more scaling solutions are integrated over the next few years, we should see on-chain supply reduce exponentially in the long term to the point that it will be nearly impossible to buy [ETH] from an open exchange in 2030.\n\nIndeed, not all the panelists reached a consensus on ETH\u2019s future prices and some experts predicted more pain in the market before users experience upward momentum. AskTraders\u2019 senior analyst for crypto and forex, Nick Ranga, foresees \u201cmore downside in the short term\u201d. Ranga argued that geopolitical tensions coupled with higher energy prices could stifle markets until 2024.\n\nJeremy Cheah echoed a similar bearish view on ETH due to a lack of regulated protection for crypto retail investors. Cheah who is an associate professor of DeFi at Nottingham Trent University predicted that ETH will end 2023 at $1000. Cheah added that the token might only reach $2000 by 2025.\n\nETH Underpriced? When flippening?\n\n60% of the experts agreed that ETH is currently underpriced at $1600. 56& of the panelists also chimed that now is the time to stockpile ETH. About 12% of the 56% specialists opined that ETH is overpriced and 16% recommend offloading Ether tokens now, expecting another downturn in crypto asset prices in the short term.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent bone of contention throughout Finder\u2019s report revolved around whether Ethereum can flippen Bitcoin to become the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum\u2019s market cap currently sits around $194 billion, while Bitcoin boasts a massive $445 billion despite heavy slumps in crypto prices since market highs in November 2021.\n\nETH Market Cap BTC Market Cap\n\n18% of industry experts predicted that the flippening could arrive by 2030. 30% of Finder\u2019s specialists think the flippening will never happen.\n\nDespite contrary opinions regarding Ethereum flippening Bitcoin, some experts believe ETH\u2019s chain holds more promise compared to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum looks to be more interesting than Bitcoin. The long-term charts highlight the ability to set ever-higher lows from June 2022. Also, Ether has returned above the 200-week average, something Bitcoin cannot yet boast of. \u2013 Alexander Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst for FxPro.\n\nWhile not all 56 panelists agreed on price ETH price levels in the short term and long term, the general sentiment among industry experts suggests bullish movement for Ethereum and its native asset as the dust settles and the broader crypto markets recover."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a decentralized naming system for Ethereum addresses, is voting to execute the swap of 10,000 ETH into stablecoin USDC.\n\nThe ENS DAO, which oversees the ENS protocol and its treasury, currently holds an estimated $1.2 billion in funds, with $227 million in liquid assets, according to DeepDAO.\n\n10,000 ETH, about $16 million, is equivalent to 25% of the total ether held in its treasury and register controller, the DAO said in a proposal.\n\nWhen the proposal was written, it was expected that the sale of its ETH holdings would generate more than $13 million USDC, which will cover ENS DAO\u2019s operational expenses over the next 18 to 24 months. At current prices, $10,000 ETH is worth $15.8 million.\n\nAs DAO operations are often quite expensive \u2014 with a majority of its expenses funneled into salaries \u2014 it would be necessary for organizations to have a steady source of income.\n\nIf the proposal were to be approved, the trade would occur on CoW Swap, decentralized exchange aggregator that leverages Batch Auctions as its price-finding mechanism.\n\nSince entering the bear market, ether prices have been fluctuating. At the time of writing, ether is trading around $1,600, down 44% over the past year. Exchanging a portion of ENS\u2019 ether for a dollar-pegged asset like USDC would go a long way if the bear market extends much further.\n\nToken Terminal, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, estimates annual salaries for DAO members for MakerDAO, Lido, and SushiSwap cost $205,000, $132,000, and $256,000, respectively.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEthereum Name Service DAO members worry about USDC\n\nIn the case of ENS, pseudonymous community member futurealisha noted the majority of USDC expenses at the DAO come from ENS Labs, the Singapore-based non-profit powering ENS development.\n\n\u201cENS Labs receives a daily stream of $11,500 USDC, which amounts to [around $4.2 million per year. Over two years, that is [roughly $8.4 million],\u201d futurealisha wrote in a discussion forum.\n\nAnother source of USDC spending would be working groups, \u201cThis budget would allow working groups to claim up to [about $1.5 million] in USDC per term between them. This amounts to [around $3 million per year and $6 million over two years],\u201d she said.\n\nNot all community members are thrilled about the swap. Another user posted that USDC is a centralized token which could be blacklisted by the US government, echoing concerns raised by MakerDAO members last year.\n\n\u201cThe DAO will have little recourse to recover the funds in this instance as the ENS token will be considered an illegal security if things get to this point,\u201d they said.\n\nThe on-chain proposal vote is currently live on Tally, with 98% of voters currently in favor of the proposal. A quorum of 1 million has also passed \u2014 though voting will continue until Feb. 7.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Aside from crypto, the report discussed various exciting technologies, including Molecular Diagnostics, Artificial Intelligence, and the technological convergence of Public Blockchains with other fields that could put the platforms on the road to a $200 trillion valuation by the end of the decade.\n\nBitcoin Is Likely To Scale Into A Multi-Trillion Dollar Market\n\nCathie Wood has been vocal in her support for Bitcoin. The recent downturn in the crypto market failed to deter her confidence in the flagship cryptocurrency. The report by her firm stated that the crypto winter elevated Bitcoin\u2019s value propositions as a decentralized alternative, by shedding a light on the role of centralized counterparties in the crypto contagion.\n\nWe believe Bitcoin\u2019s long-term opportunity is strengthening. Despite a turbulent year, Bitcoin has not skipped a beat. Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the current fundamentals of BTC are stronger than they were during the past drawdowns. Data gathered by Ark Invest indicated that BTC holders are more long-term focused today than at any point in history. The firm\u2019s research estimated that the price of one bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030. The bear case puts 2030\u2019s price target at $258,500 for 1 BTC. The base case presented a target of $682,800. The most optimistic estimation, i.e. the bull case, valued BTC at $1.48 million by the end of the decade.\n\nThe report also took a closer look at the role of public blockchains in the future of finance and related technologies. Ark Invest believes that large-scale adoption of blockchain tech will eventually prompt all money and contracts to migrate onto public blockchains that enable and verify digital scarcity and proof of ownership."

        "content": "Suppose you plan to invest in the crypto space this year. Then these three cryptocurrencies might catch your attention: PancakeSwap (CAKE), Ethereum (ETH), and Snowfall Protocol (SNW). There is a lot of potential in these projects. Snowfall Protocol just ended its presale, and it\u2019s already showing great prospects. Let\u2019s look at the potential and growth of these currencies and the direction they are heading in.\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) is rising again.\n\nThe current value of PancakeSwap (CAKE) is $4.25. It has mostly stayed the same in the past few weeks, except for a slight drop. When PancakeSwap (CAKE) first started, each coin was only worth $0.30, but it went up to a high of around $42.08. Even though the amount has gone down since then, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has had spikes and drops, which will likely happen again.\n\nMany analysts and experts have given different predictions for Pancakeswap (CAKE). Still, most agree that the price will increase significantly shortly and even more in the long term. Most predictions are that by the beginning of December 2023, the coin will be worth between $11 and $12. If this is accurate, many people agree it will keep going up, making it a good investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is increasing in value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized platform that executes smart contracts. These are applications that precisely run as programmed, without the chance of fraud or third-party interference. These apps run on a blockchain that was built just for them. This opens the door for developers to participate in a wide variety of activities, including creating marketplaces, storing records of contracts or debts, transferring funds, and many others.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a well-known cryptocurrency whose price is also about to increase significantly. Right now, Ethereum (ETH) has hit a 12-week ATH, with its price being $1585, give or take, but it could be worth a lot more before the year runs out.\n\nIf you want to invest in a cryptocurrency this year, Ethereum (ETH) is a good choice because it will give you a good return in the short to medium term.\n\nSnowfall Protocol is expected to yield 5000x at launch.\n\nThe Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is an ecosystem for cross-chain transfers developed for fungible and non-fungible tokens. Their decentralized application allows customers to trade assets across chains that are compatible with EVM and those that are incompatible with EVM. They are making a platform that will enable millions of users to interact with every blockchain.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) was trading at $0.015 per coin when phase 1 of the presale started. However, as of right now, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is priced at $0.20. As a result of its one-of-a-kind compatibility approach, demand for Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has surged by more than 30% since the presale stage. Some industry experts believe that Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has the potential to increase its size by a factor of 5000 by the time it is launched.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) and Ethereum (ETH) are great projects to invest in this year. However, if you want a high ROI, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has a huge prospect as market experts predict 5000x returns. Now is the best time to key in.\n\nFind out more about the Snowfall protocol:\n\nPresale: https://presale.snowfallprotocol.io\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/snowfallcoin\n\nWebsite:https://snowfallprotocol.io\n\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/snowfallcoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The rise of Web3 functionality has been a boon for decentralized domain name services over the past two years, with millions of blockchain-based domains registered to date. Challenging market conditions may have hampered exponential growth, but industry leaders believe that utility-driven adoption will continue in the future.\n\nWeb3 is fundamentally changing how businesses, brands and retailers serve customers, who are taking full control of their data, wallets and online identity courtesy of blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized domain names are valuable tools for users and businesses to integrate with Web3 functionality. From providing human-readable names that replace numerical wallet addresses to serving as a decentralized profile across the Web3 ecosystem, decentralized domains offer an alternative to conventional domain services.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) and Unstoppable Domains are the two most prominent platforms serving the space, having a combined six million-plus domain registrations since their respective inceptions. Both services saw significant increases in newly minted domains through 2021 and 2022.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to a handful of decentralized domain name platforms to gauge the current state of the industry, who is leading registrations and what the future holds.\n\n2022 in review\n\n2022 proved to be a massive year for both ENS and Unstoppable Domains, with both firms highlighting some key metrics from the year in correspondence with Cointelegraph.\n\nENS is a distributed, open, extensible naming system that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It maps human-readable names like \u201calice.eth\u201d to machine-readable data like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs.\n\nENS emulates the conventional Domain Name Service (DNS) by using dot-separated hierarchical names, commonly known as domains, with the owner of a domain controlling both it and any subdomains. An ENS domain is effectively a nonfungible token (NFT) that serves as an Ethereum wallet address, cryptographic hash or website URL.\n\nENS developer Makoto Inoue said that the platform\u2019s official registered domain total was 2.8 million as of January 2023, excluding any reregistered names after expiry. When including subdomains and DNS names, that number rises to 3.9 million \u2014 excluding off-chain names like Coinbase\u2019s in-house cb.id domain solution for wallets and decentralized identities.\n\nNora Chan, vice president of communications at Unstoppable Domains, unpacked the premise of the blockchain-based domain name service. Unstoppable Domains offers Web3 domains on Polygon with no gas fees, providing an affordable way for users to establish a secure and portable identity for Web3.\n\nThe domains can be bridged to Ethereum and used for various purposes, such as sending and receiving cryptocurrency, logging in to hundreds of apps and metaverses, building decentralized websites and constructing a Web3 identity.\n\nThe platform has registered and minted 3.1 million domains to date, with 1.2 million registered in 2022 alone.\n\nMeasuring growth in a bear market\n\nBoth Inoue and Chan reflected on the bearish market conditions of 2022 and offered varying views of its effect on decentralized domain registrations. Depressed market conditions were actually a boon to ENS registrations, as Inoue explained:\n\n\u201cDuring the bull market, high gas fees actually hindered the growth of ENS because a .eth registration was costing somewhere between $50\u2013$100 when a one-year annual registration is only $5/year.\u201c\n\nBut as gas fees have slowly reduced, it is becoming more affordable to register ENS names. Inoue also noted that the discovery of \u201ccategories influenced the growth of 2022 ENS registrations.\u201d\n\nThis included the minting of ENS domains based on a list of names with common traits like the \u201c10K Club,\u201d which are four-digit domain names from 0000.eth to 9999.eth; and genesis-era ENS domains, which are a select group of ENS names minted before June 2017 \u2014 preceding the advent of the popular CryptoPunks NFT collection.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan conceded that the rate of registrations with Unstoppable Domains slowed in 2022. Nevertheless, the 1.2 million domains registered in 2022 still account for more than a third of its total domain list.\n\nThird-party integration\n\nCompanies, brands and users are becoming increasingly familiar with Web3 functionality. Using a decentralized domain, users can carry their complete digital ID with them, pay for items on an e-commerce site, and collect NFT versions or extras linked to specific real-world products.\n\nAs more of these services plug into Web3, ENS and Unstoppable Domains provide the infrastructure for businesses and users to enter this new paradigm.\n\nFor ENS, the rise of Coinbase\u2019s high-profile cb.id subdomain integration was the biggest third-party service integration story, according to Inoue.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a universal standard for developers to create services and applications that can transact and send information actions across multiple networks. The ENS developer said CCIP Read provides a way to store ENS names outside the Ethereum layer 1, lowering overall gas costs.\n\nChan highlighted that despite the recent cryptocurrency bear market, Unstoppable Domains\u2019 extensive footprint of integrations includes partners like Brave, Opera, Trust Wallet and Etherscan. The firm has also launched various Web3 top-level domains \u2014 including .x, .nft, .wallet and .crypto \u2014 with mainstream brands and companies.\n\nUnstoppable Domains\u2019 work with Blockchain.com saw the creation of its .blockchain top-level Web3 domain, unlocking a potential 83 million users of Blockchain.com who might be looking for a customizable .blockchain domain or human-readable wallet address.\n\nWhat does 2023 have in store?\n\nSubdomain registrations could surge in 2023 if Inoue\u2019s prediction is correct. The ENS developer told Cointelegraph that ongoing development could give users more control of subdomains:\n\n\u201c2023 will see a surge of subdomain registrations. This will be driven by the release of \u2018Name Wrapper,\u2019 a feature to turn subdomains into NFTs (currently only .eth is NFTs), allowing the community to sell and transfer subdomains much more easily.\u201d\n\nInoue also highlighted subdomain integrations with the likes of Coinbase as an adoption driver, making ENS names more accessible to users. It also lowers gas costs to interact with the Ethereum protocol, \u201cmaking it resistant to the bull market gas surge.\u201d\n\nWhile the registration of these subdomains doesn\u2019t bring direct revenue to the ENS organization itself, Inoue said they drive the overall adoption and usefulness of the protocol within the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nChan said focusing on creating more utility, building partnerships and improving the user experience of the service would be key to continued adoption this year.\n\nAn alternative view\n\nCointelegraph also spoke to PeerName founder and CEO Vasil Toshkov, whose platform was founded in 2014, selling .bit domains based on Namecoin. The platform now sells a handful of Emercoin blockchain domains \u2014 including .coin, .bazar, .lib and .emc \u2014 and currently manages around 8,000 domains.\n\nToshkov said that PeerName sells \u201ctruly decentralized domains\u201d for working websites and does not offer NFT domains nor centrally managed services. It previously sold a more comprehensive array of domains from different platforms but now focuses on decentralized practical applications.\n\nPeerName sold around 700 domains in 2022, with Toshkov highlighting increased competition and high fees at the end of the bull market as key challenges:\n\n\u201cOur business performs much better during a bear market. Then, the competition with fake domains disappears. Fees are low, and users can pay seamlessly. We also only have users who buy domains to use, not as speculation.\u201d\n\nThe most sold domains on PeerName include .bit, .coin and .onion. The latter domain is not blockchain-based but is used within the Tor browser and client system. Toshkov believes that the possibility of .bit domains also being integrated into the Tor project and browser could drive adoption.\n\n\u201cIf this happens, the interest in them will be huge. These are the first and most decentralized blockchain-based domains. Kind of like Bitcoin, but for domains,\u201d he said.\n\nCointelegraph has previously explored the prevalence of domain \u201chijacking\u201d and \u201csquatting,\u201d which is driven by speculative users that register domains bearing well-known brands or names."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMetaMask has added new privacy features to its browser extension Thursday, allowing users to enable phishing detection and enable advanced settings like choosing their own remote procedure call (RPC) network and adding a custom IPFS gateway.\n\nMetaMask is a popular Ethereum crypto wallet with over 21 million monthly active users. Back in November, the wallet came under fire after parent company ConsenSys notified MetaMask users that it would begin collecting users\u2019 IP addresses and ETH wallet addresses via its infrastructure provider Infura (the default RPC network) whenever users make a transaction.\n\nNow, users will be able to choose a different RPC provider instead of Infura, a feature that ConsenSys said it was developing back in December.\n\nThe new features can be found under the MetaMask browser extension\u2019s Security and Privacy Settings and can be tweaked during initial crypto wallet setup or modified after the fact for existing wallets.\n\n\u201cWe have updated the MetaMask extension to maximize the control you have over your data,\u201d MetaMask said on Twitter Thursday.\n\nStarting today, extension users will see an updated experience when creating a new wallet, as well as an update in their privacy and security settings. We have updated the \ud83e\udd8a extension to maximize the control you have over your data. \u2014 MetaMask \ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc99 (@MetaMask) February 2, 2023\n\nIn its new settings interface, MetaMask warns that \u201cany RPC will receive your IP address and Ethereum wallet to make transactions.\u201d This means that true privacy is virtually impossible via MetaMask, as users will have to choose which RPC will handle their data, even if it\u2019s not Infura.\n\nWhile users might have more options now, it could be argued that MetaMask is providing users with an illusion of choice. Less tech-savvy users may not know how to optimize their privacy settings, let alone know what an RPC network is or how to choose an alternative.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMina Protocol Cofounder Evan Shapiro is a Web3 privacy advocate who believes in the privacy benefits of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK proof) technology. When asked for his thoughts on MetaMask\u2019s update, Shapiro told Decrypt via email that he isn\u2019t sure it amounts to much increased privacy at all.\n\n\u201cAs far as I understand, they\u2019re still collecting IP addresses. And, they have the ability to change these features at any time as they see fit,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cYou\u2019re still dependent on a centralized RPC. These issues won\u2019t go away until there are easy to run full nodes available to run on browsers and phones.\u201d\n\nDavid Schwed, COO of blockchain security firm Halborn, called MetaMask\u2019s new settings \u201cpositive.\u201d That said, he still sees MetaMask\u2019s ongoing data collection as risky for users.\n\n\u201cThe capturing of IP addresses and their associated transactions are both security threats as well as privacy concerns,\u201d Schwed told Decrypt via email. \u201cA threat actor with access to this information would be able to potentially launch a spear phishing campaign against targeted users based on IP address and wallet balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe change does not allow you to opt out of them collecting IP addresses, they are simply allowing/advising you to utilize another RPC provider to broadcast transactions,\u201d he added.\n\nUsers concerned about their privacy should note that the Ethereum network itself has never been fully anonymized. Etherscan offers detailed information on wallet transactions, and since the U.S. government sanctioned the Ethereum privacy mixing tool Tornado Cash, there aren\u2019t many options to increase user privacy or conceal transaction data.\n\nIn December, ConsenSys published a lengthy explanation of its privacy policies and how and when it collects user data. It claimed that it never sells user data and shared plans to automatically delete user data within seven days\u2014though it\u2019s unclear when exactly that practice will be adopted.\n\nRepresentatives for ConsenSys, Infura, and MetaMask were unable to provide comments to Decrypt before publication. ConsenSys is one of 22 strategic investors in Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "New Bitcoin protocol may shake up the NFT market - Forkast News",
        "content": "A new protocol released on Bitcoin is bringing wider NFT capabilities to the world\u2019s largest blockchain, with the potential to reshape the NFT market and the dynamic between some of the biggest blockchains, industry officials tell Forkast.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, which was released after a Jan. 21 post by developer Casey Rodarmor, allows users to insert relatively large amounts of data into transactions, which can be used for creating collectible images on the network, similar to many popular NFT projects.\n\nThis capability was previously available on Bitcoin, but on a scale too small for workable NFTs. However, Bitcoin upgrades like 2021\u2019s Taproot and 2017\u2019s SegWit allows the Ordinals protocol to expand this functionality.\n\nJonathon Miller, Australia managing director of U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said Ordinals is a positive development for the network, but it has also generated controversy.\n\n\u201cThere are purists who say [Bitcoin] should always just be peer-to-peer cash, but I think that\u2019s possibly not the story when it comes to the reality, which is that people experiment with Bitcoin all the time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt really is exciting to see people build things on top of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWithout this experimentation, the network would not have Layer 2 solutions such as the lightning network, which greatly increases transaction speeds on Bitcoin, he added.\n\nNew killer?\n\nNFTs are regarded as a crucial component of the reimagined internet of Web3 \u2014 in which gaming, social media and financial services are run through decentralized blockchain applications controlled by users\u2019 wallets. And NFTs have long been the domain of the Ethereum blockchain that hosts roughly 70% of all NFT sales value.\n\nMany blockchain networks \u2014 from Cardano to Solana \u2014 have been labelled \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in recent years, or networks hoping to eat into Ethereum\u2019s dominance in Web3 or NFTs, but so far none have made much headway.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT relations strategist for blockchain data aggregator CryptoSlam, said one reason for that is Ethereum has a multi-year head start. But that is not a factor that hinders Bitcoin as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] been around longer than any others \u2014 ten years now, plus \u2014 they have a huge, huge base of users. So, I almost think there\u2019s potential it could compete with Ethereum more quickly than the others could, simply because of adoption.\u201d\n\nMiller had a different view, saying Ethereum has excellent tools for creating NFTs, whereas Ordinals is just the protocol for creating tools on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cPerhaps [Ordinal\u2019s] not going to be something that competes directly with those networks,\u201d he said. And it may well act as a reminder that Ethereum is a really strong and well-tooled network for creating NFTs.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nPetscher said the real change from Ordinals may not be about creating new types of collectibles, but proving that developers can build upon an old blockchain and change the market dynamics in the process. That could prove to be the real innovation in the project, he added.\n\n\u201c[Ordinals] certainly gives Bitcoin as a currency itself more utility,\u201d he said, \u201cit strictly was almost a financial asset and people were very happy with that. It now has another and one that I expect like on Ethereum and these other blockchains will grow exponentially now you can transact collectibles.\u201d\n\nSome of Ordinal\u2019s critics argue that it will increase the demand on the network, driving up fees for regular transactions. Petscher agrees this is a risk, but said the added utility of being able to purchase the NFTs with Bitcoin could also serve to increase the price, helping many miners and long-term holders within the community.\n\nOthers argue that these are frivolous ways to use the network, however, and detract from the intention Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, had in mind when releasing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt can be all of these things at the same time,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cIt certainly can be frivolous and it can be silly and it could be pointless and it can still be awesome at the same time and important to building a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd especially in a decentralized world, not only does it not matter but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d"

        "title": "Is There a Long-Term Case for Crypto? With These 3 Coins, the Answer Is a Resounding Yes - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In 2023, crypto seems to be on the cusp of finally being recognized as a viable long-term investment option for patient, buy-and-hold investors. Big institutional investors are grudgingly acknowledging that crypto is an asset class worth investing in, albeit a very high-risk and volatile asset class. At the same time, there is growing discussion among some of the biggest names in the industry about crypto as a way to plan for retirement.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a closer look at three cryptos -- Bitcoin (BTC 0.71%), Ethereum (ETH 0.34%), and Polygon (MATIC -1.28%) -- that might be suitable for anyone taking a long-term view of the market.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nThe obvious starting point for anyone constructing a long-term crypto portfolio is Bitcoin, which now accounts for close to 45% of the entire capitalization of the crypto market. While crypto is hardly a \"safe\" buy-and-hold investment, Bitcoin has proven surprisingly resilient to the ups and downs of the crypto market. Over its 14-year history, Bitcoin has weathered several major crashes, including one back in 2011 that saw its price plummet to $0.01 in a matter of days. But each time, Bitcoin has bounced back better than before.\n\nOne long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin is that it is \"the future of money.\" Over time, Bitcoin will become increasingly important as an online payment option. According to some Bitcoin bulls, such as Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, Bitcoin will one day be used for all online transactions. When Draper recently suggested that Bitcoin might skyrocket to $250,000, this is what he had in mind.\n\nTaking a very long-term view of things, Bitcoin could eventually start to supplant sovereign currencies. That was the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. The famous Bitcoin white paper has been used to suggest that a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency like Bitcoin could be superior to fiat currencies when it comes to managing macroeconomic factors such as inflation. After all, Bitcoin has a fixed total coin supply of 21 million, so there is no risk of hyperinflation from a government or central bank producing too much money.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nAnother coin with remarkable long-term staying power is Ethereum, which accounts for another 20% of the entire capitalization of the crypto market. While Bitcoin's primary function is as a store of value and an online payment option, Ethereum promises much more in terms of utility and real-world use cases. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, and since then, has been an innovation leader when it comes to decentralized finance, gaming, the metaverse, and digital assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe best way to think about Ethereum is that it is a foundation, or base, for everything that developers can think to build in the blockchain and crypto world. And this is what gives Ethereum so much long-term appeal. When you invest in Ethereum, you are not just investing in a single cryptocurrency, you are also investing in an entire blockchain ecosystem. Some analysts once referred to Ethereum as \"digital oil\" for its ability to power the modern blockchain economy.\n\nNow that Ethereum has transformed into a faster, energy-efficient blockchain as a result of The Merge, it is better positioned than ever to be the leading Layer 1 blockchain in the world. Already, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has laid out a fantastic long-term roadmap for the blockchain, in which it will eventually be able to process 1 million transactions per second. When that happens, Ethereum will become faster and more powerful than today's credit card networks, which can process only 24,000 transactions per second.\n\n3. Polygon\n\nFinally, there's Polygon, which has vaulted into the list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization largely based on its ability to generate innovative use cases for blockchain technology. For example, Polygon has already partnered with Walt Disney, with a long-term aim of developing new use cases within the entertainment sector. It has partnered with Starbucks on a new Web3 customer loyalty program. And it has partnered with Meta Platforms with the goal of making NFTs mainstream for billions of social media users around the world.\n\nPart of Polygon's appeal is that it is a scaling solution for Ethereum. Polygon leverages the security and stability of Ethereum, and then uses its own cutting-edge technology to bundle transactions and deliver world-class performance for end users. In 2022, Buterin praised Polygon for its \"truly amazing\" new scaling technology. Thus, as fast as Ethereum can grow, Polygon might be able to grow even faster.\n\nBuy and hold for the long term\n\nWhile crypto is often associated with short-term speculation and market timing, there is an increasingly robust case for crypto as a long-term investment option. Forget about the silly meme coins and focus on the coins and utility tokens that are developing the future of money and growing the modern blockchain economy. For that reason, I'm long-term bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor nearly a decade, creators have enlisted sidechain or layer-2 solutions to link digital art to the Bitcoin blockchain. But how this is accomplished\u2014or whether it should even be done\u2014has Crypto Twitter up in arms after new project Ordinals developed a way to add digital items to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNFT are blockchain tokens that can serve as a proof of ownership for assets, including digital goods like artwork, videos, music files, and memberships. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs and digital collectibles, many Bitcoin developers have sought ways to bring them to the quintessential blockchain.\n\nOne issue hampering the development of NFTs on Bitcoin is the need for smart contracts. In the minting process, NFTs use smart contracts to assign ownership of the digital asset in the NFT. The smart contract updates the ownership when the NFT is bought or sold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin has only limited smart contract support.\n\nTo address this, earlier projects like Counterparty and Stacks developed alternative solutions that use a native token for the contract piece but ultimately settle their transactions back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEarlier examples\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty launched the first layer-2 solution for digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty, which provides the infrastructure for users to create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, saw its XCP token hit an all-time high above $91 in 2018, but it has fallen about 97% since.\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters\u2014and its assets can be bridged to Ethereum. More importantly, Counterparty is best known as the home for historical assets like Rare Pepes, which still command significant sums on secondary markets. In April 2022, an NFT containing the opening theme to Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was minted using Counterparty.\n\nLaunched in 2017 as Blockstacks, Stacks (as it\u2019s now known) is a blockchain network that can run smart contracts and rolls up all of its transactions before settling them on Bitcoin. Stacks says it doesn\u2019t use a sidechain or layer-2 model, but founder Muneeb Ali told Decrypt in 2021 that he refers to it as \u201ca layer 1.5\u201d built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe STX token hit a peak above $3 in December 2021, according to CoinGecko, as its NFTs started to attract the Bitcoin faithful, and in February 2022, an NFT collection called Satoshibles launched a cross-bridge to send NFTs to the Ethereum network. Broadly, however, Stacks has not developed an especially active or valuable NFT market.\n\nWhat's Ordinals?\n\nThe most recent example of Bitcoin NFTs is Ordinals, and it takes a different approach. Launched in January, Ordinals aims to add NFT-like assets directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDesigned by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core contributor, Ordinals enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC), which may include data such as videos and images. Adding assets to individual satoshis is called inscription, which is stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature.\n\nThe idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos\u2014or even playable video games\u2014isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols. Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2014 Bitcoin is Saving (@BitcoinIsSaving) January 29, 2023\n\nDespite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution (or similar) or an additional cryptocurrency to work.\n\nBitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, but as Ordinals and past examples show, some developers are still trying to use its decentralized network to power new use cases."

Today the founders behind the project unveiled a new path forward with refreshed branding\u2014and future expansion beyond Ethereum with customizable, full-body avatars.\n\n\u201cWith our new strategic direction and rebrand, we want to convey to the community and the broader Web3 space that Cool Cats is here to stay,\u201d Cool Cats Group CEO Stephen Teglas told Decrypt. \u201cWe\u2019re not just building for the next year, or the next five years\u2014we\u2019re planning for the long term.\u201d\n\nCool Cats and Cool Pets NFT holders will soon be airdropped a free Fracture NFT, which co-founder and Head of Content Robert Mehew described as \u201cdynamic NFTs that enable a new storytelling experience via digital collectibles.\u201d The Fracture NFTs will evolve as holders complete missions (or \"Journeys\") within the project's \"World of Cooltopia\" narrative, and eventually unveil potential rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew PFP.

That project not only bridges over to a different blockchain, Flow, but turns the familiar profile pictures into fully featured avatars that can be tweaked and outfitted with virtual apparel.\n\nA Cool Cats representative told Decrypt that the Explorers NFTs will work across multiple layer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling networks, including some that are not Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. Those platforms will be revealed in the coming months. Cool Cats has previously used Ethereum sidechain network Polygon for special edition NFT drops and a mobile game.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to remove as much friction as possible,\u201d a rep said regarding the movement of Cool Cats avatars across blockchains. The team also plans to work with community members to develop assets to be used with the Explorers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday\u2019s announcements were paired with a rebranding of the Cool Cats project across social media and marketing materials, which will correspond with new narrative content centered on Blue Cat, the project\u2019s main character.\n\n\u201cOur new logo features a forward-facing cat, a nod to our focus on building for the future,\u201d Cool Cats co-founder and Creative Director Colin \u201cClon\u201d Egan told Decrypt.\n\nAn example of the refreshed Cool Cats branding. Image: Cool Cats\n\nCool Cats prices surged in late 2021 as the wider NFT market surged, pushing the floor price\u2014or the price of the cheapest-listed NFT on a secondary marketplace\u2014jumping to nearly 14 ETH (over $48,000) that October. The project signed with major Hollywood agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in March 2022 to explore media and licensing deals.\n\nBut Cool Cats prices crashed last year amid leadership departures, mixed reactions to Cooltopia, and gripes that the founders weren\u2019t doing enough to support the project. As of this morning, ahead of the announcements, the floor price sat at just 2 ETH according to data from NFT Price Floor. That\u2019s less than $3,200 worth, given the depressed price of Ethereum.\n\nTo date, Cool Cats has generated about $377 million worth of secondary market trading volume, per data from CryptoSlam, while the Cool Pets spinoff collection has added over $105 million to that tally. Cool Cats collaborated with Time magazine in 2021 for limited-edition NFTs, as well, and today announced a marketing deal with hardware wallet maker Ledger.\n\nWill a refreshed look, gamified reward NFTs for current owners, and a larger-scale avatar push across multiple chains help Cool Cats reaffirm its \u201cblue chip\u201d status after an up-and-down year? Teglas believes that going bigger and broader is key to growing Cool Cats into an entertainment brand that can reach beyond the Web3 faithful.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately believe that scaling Cool Cats\u2019 brand awareness and onboarding more members into the brand is one of the most effective ways for us to deliver on the expectations of our community,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct timing of the NFT airdrop and its functionality.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "As the crypto market begins to show signs of a bull run approaching and your favourite coins are on the rise after a prolonged crypto winter, there is only one wise thing to do\u2026 That is cop and HODL\u2026 In other words, buy now and hold on for dear life (HODL).\n\nMost people jump in when prices are at an all-time high and then regret it later. But this is your chance to get ahead of the crowd when the entire crypto market is on discount and undervalued.\n\nIn this article, we will be diving into our top 5 cryptocurrencies for 2023: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum \u2013 The Kings Of Crypto\n\nOkay, you may know of these already, but anyone without these top two crypto essentials on their top 5 list is bananas\u2026\n\nIn 2009, a mysterious computer nerd going under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto would create the most revolutionary financial asset known as Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin was launched as a digital payment method that works through peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain, eliminating the need for centralised authorities. Although Bitcoin is currently seen as non-eco-friendly, due to the amount of energy BTC transactions take, it is now widely seen as a store of value due to it being the first cryptocurrency and the rare limited supply that it has.\n\nEthereum (ETH), was created as a much faster alternative to Bitcoin and although it\u2019s a decentralised currency, it mainly acts as a platform for people to create decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. What makes Ethereum more versatile than Bitcoin is that it operates on its own blockchain and has its own programming language. Since the inception of Ethereum in 2015, it has revolutionised cryptocurrency as it has acted as an incredibly useful platform for thousands of other crypto projects and it has become the most popular currency for NFTs. As the use case of ETH develops further, its price will follow!\n\nAxie Infinity & Decentraland \u2013 Metaverse Essentials\n\nDecentraland (MANA) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralised virtual world platform where users can build, evaluate, and monetise content. In essence, users use MANA tokens to purchase virtual land known as NFTs on the Decentraland platform. Only the players\u2019 own actions, endeavours, and creativity may advance the game.\n\nAxie Infinity (AXS) is a commerce and combat game powered by blockchain that is run and owned in part by its users. Players can combat and trade token-based Axies, in which each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with a unique set of skills. The winning team gains more experience points, which may be applied to improving an Axie\u2019s stats or evolving its bodily parts.\n\nWith the metaverse expanding to become a popular household term and games becoming more immersive as we head towards the future, it\u2019s essential to look at some of the hottest cryptocurrencies in that space, such as Axie Infinity and Decentraland.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 To Become Biggest Meme Coin\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new meme token that is turning heads as it soars past a stunning $20.5 million in presale! This is just a foreshadowing of how successful the coin could be when it actually launches.\n\nSet to be one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies, Big Eyes Coin aims to shift wealth into the DeFi space, whilst also focusing on saving the oceans of the world by donating 5% of BIG transactions into a visible charity wallet.\n\nDOGE and SHIB best watch their tails, as Big Eyes Coin is an incredibly cut cat that could certainly snatch the crypto meme crown \u2013 now that would be purr-found.\n\nYou can now use their promo code LAUNCHBIGEYES200, for a fat 200% increase on your spend \u2013 but act fast as this code will be expiring soon!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn our top 5 for this article, we have highlighted the most innovative crypto projects which touch a range of aspects, including DeFi, gameworld, metaverse, NFT-related, meme territory and crypto classics. With this diverse crypto portfolio, you can rest assured that you are putting your eggs in different baskets, and therefore likely to see your portfolio skyrocket to the moon!\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Twas a surprisingly good one at that, given all the doom and gloom in November/December (thanks again for that, SBF).\n\nBefore we delve into altcoin specifics, let\u2019s just take a moment to acknowledge how well Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto market-mover in chief, fared across the first month of 2023.\n\nBecause, as you can see from this Coinglass BTC monthly returns chart, it smashed it.\n\nThat\u2019s a near 40% monthly gain for the OG crypto, and its best January performance since 2013. If things were to play out the way the rest of that year did, then it wouldn\u2019t be too shabby, would it?\n\nSuddenly remembers macroeconomic turmoil and recession-related concerns and, ahem, tempers expectations somewhat. That said, if reduced inflation in the US continues to play out, the jobs sector behaves, regulations don\u2019t stifle and the crypto industry fails to shoot itself in the foot again, then who knows.\n\nThere are still crypto-contagion-related worries floating around, for instance potential Digital Currency Group/Genesis implosion, but perhaps any fallout there will be limited, given it\u2019s almost expected now.\n\nJanuary\u2019s 10 leading gainers in the top 100 (and some losers)\n\nThe fact that there weren\u2019t many losers to show this month (courtesy of CoinGecko\u2019s data) and that most of them were, in fact, dollar-pegged stablecoins just fluctuating slightly under a percentage point, also tells you it was a pretty decent month for crypto.\n\nNew layer 1 protocol Aptos leads monthly gainers\n\nWe\u2019ve covered some of the reasons Aptos (APT) was pumping mid-way through January, but since then it\u2019s largely kept up a strong showing.\n\nThe project didn\u2019t launch at the greatest of times in the market late last year \u2013 in October, right before everything crapped the bed due to the FTX implosion and subsequent fallout.\n\nThe thing about it, though, is that it\u2019s a much-vaunted layer 1 Ethereum competitor. And like Solana and Polkadot and Avalanche and Cardano before it, we know how high that particular crypto narrative can ride on waves of hype.\n\nSaid hype stems largely from the fact Aptos is a proof-of-stake blockchain that\u2019s borne from the tech belonging to Facebook/Meta\u2019s abandoned blockchain project, Diem. Aptos\u2019 team comprises former Meta engineers and its CEO and co-founder Mohammad Shaikh worked on Meta\u2019s Novi wallet and has a strong background in financial services and the blockchain industry.\n\nThe protocol seems to be doing its best to keep the hype ball rolling, too, announcing a string of developer and Aptos community events for this year, which it\u2019s dubbed the Aptos World Tour. Get your T-shirts with the dates on the back now.\n\nAnother reason for the surge might be an increasing interest in NFT usage for the blockchain. NFTs \u2013 they don\u2019t created much froth, do they?\n\nYou're about to see a bunch of Aptos NFTs flood the market over the next few days/weeks imo. Where there's a massive pump, there's [sudden] massive interest and innovation. It's all genuine and we're all here for the uhhh tech. \u2014 Loma (@LomahCrypto) January 22, 2023\n\nAlso kicking up in January, we saw metaverse/3D modelling project Render (RNDR) on the back of no major news we could discern.\n\nDecentralised perpetual options exchange dYdX (DYDX), however, we know that\u2019s pumped partly because of this (from this morning\u2019s Mooners and Shakers column):\n\n\u201cDecentralized derivatives exchange dYdX has been surging on the news the protocol has delayed the unlock of its DYDX token for investors until the fourth quarter this year. The exchange announced it in a blog post overnight (AEDT).\u201d\n\nFantom (FTM), another Ethereum competitor, meanwhile, has been pushing its interoperability capabilities thanks to a collaboration with Axelar. More on that, here.\n\nAlso of note on that list is fellow layer 1 protocol Solana (SOL), which has had a particularly wretched time amid the FTX drama, seeing value seep and certain projects depart its blockchain (e.g. top NFT projects DeGods and y00ts).\n\nBut, thanks to a short-squeeze or two, and perhaps some settling down of negative sentiment, it\u2019s managed to claw back some price positivity.\n\nAnd we\u2019d best mention Frax Share (FXS) here, too, as it\u2019s one of a few liquid staking derivative protocols that have had particularly fine months. (Others include Lido DAO and Rocket Pool, for instance, and you can learn a bit more about this sector and why it\u2019s frothy right now, from reading our recent chat with Aussie fundies Apollo Crypto.)\n\nTop 10 gainers and losers in the top 300\n\nZooming out a tad, here then, were the top 10 winners and losers from the top 300 cryptos by market cap, with thanks again to CoinGecko\u2026\n\nThere are a few things on this list that stand out to us\u2026\n\nGala (GALA), is one, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the leading Web3 gaming protocols in the space \u2013 a narrative that many a crypto head has latched on as a potential boomer for the next bullish cycle.\n\nAnd then there are a couple of AI-related projects (SingularityNET and Artificial Liquid Intelligence) with highly impressive monthly gainage, too. AI is another particularly buzzy narrative that\u2019s seeped its way, like some sort of advanced Terminator, into the crypto realm.\n\nWe didn\u2019t cover those particular two projects in this related article, but that\u2019s because it purely focused on the top AI Google searched AI and big-data cryptos, which was led by The Graph (GRT).\n\nRead More Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "As the bullish rally on the cryptocurrency market, which started with the year\u2019s turn, is beginning to slow down, crypto traders and investors are trying to deduce where the price of Ethereum (ETH) could be standing by the end of the second month of 2023.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold consulted the cryptocurrency tracking platform PricePredictions and its machine learning algorithms, which at press time project that the price of Ethereum will amount to $1,555 on February 28, 2023, according to the data retrieved on February 1.\n\nEthereum 30-day price prediction. Source: PricePredictions\n\nTaking into account technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as moving averages (MA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), relative strength index (RSI), and others, this means the algorithm sees Ethereum trading 1.27% lower from its current price of $1,575.\n\nAs for TradingViews\u2019s technical analysis indicators in terms of sentiment on 1-day gauges, they are still largely undecided \u2013 their summary in the \u2018neutral\u2019 zone, which is the result of oscillators indicating \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8 but moving averages actually suggesting \u2018buy\u2019 at 9.\n\nEthereum 1-day sentiment gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nBullish factors for Ethereum\n\nAs always, the price of any digital asset is largely influenced by the developments surrounding its ecosystem, as well as the atmosphere of the wider crypto market and macroeconomic landscape around the world, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nFor instance, one of the developments that could help Ethereum start a new bullish rally in the near future is the launch of the long-awaited Shanghai mainnet shadow fork in March, which would test the readiness of ETH staking withdrawal capability.\n\nIn preparation for the formal launch of the shadow fork, the Zheijang public testnet is set to go live on February 1, followed by the Shanghai and Capella testnets six days later, triggered at epoch 1350, as confirmed by Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi.\n\nThe Shanghai+Capella upgrade is going full steam ahead! The first public withdrawals testnet is launching 1st of Feb at 15 UTC.\n\n\n\nAll info here: https://t.co/S5kp9o6Pzs#TestingTheWithdrurge https://t.co/fw2SZqPbHe \u2014 parithosh | \ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc3c (@parithosh_j) January 31, 2023\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum has been adding close to 130,000 new unique addresses every day since January 1, 2023, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of 221 million, demonstrating a steady increase in on-chain activity and engagement, as Finbold reported on January 30.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is currently changing hands at the price of $1,575, which represents a decrease of 0.06% on the day for the asset but still an increase of 1.18% across the previous seven days, adding up to a gain of 31.21% on its monthly chart.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWith a market capitalization of $192.48 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by this indicator, just below the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC) and its market cap of $445.34 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Shanghai fork Coming at Ethereum: Do Stakers need to dump ETH? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The second-best blockchain, Ethereum, is coming up with the next best thing; EIP-4895, Shanghai, supposedly in March 2023. The activity would be known as the Shanghai hard fork, implementing future advancement proposals for the Ethereum network and allowing Ether, currently trading at $1,668.46, stakers and validators to withdraw their assets from Beacon Chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, the staked ETH amounts to nearly 14% of the total supply of 16 million coins. Meaning nearly $25 billion; with the current TH price, it is expected to be liquidated following the fork.\n\nShould Stakers be concerned?\n\nMost ETH stakers have been waiting for the last three years for rewards withdrawals. This announcement may cause the stakers to line up for the withdrawals selling their ETH as early as possible, but this might not happen as there are numerous reasons for eliminating any concerns, moreover pulling them to increase their investments into staking after Shanghai.\n\nEthereum to be the leading PoS network\n\nThough the market cap had pushed ETH to second place, it proudly holds the leading position as a Proof-od-Stake (PoS) network. At the time of writing, it stood for 65% of TVL in DeFi protocol, approximately around $48.7 billion.\n\nSource: DefiLlama\n\nEven with the current market conditions, the amount of ETH deposited has increased considerably, reaching nearly 500,000 validators in January 2023.\n\nA Stronger Staking yield\n\nCurrently, the yield is stable at a 5.45% annual percentage rate (APR). Hence newbies are expected to habituate themselves to the overall yield compensation structure, which comprises staking rewards, tips and maximal extractable value (MEV). With MEV-boost, stakers can increase the rewards by 2x to 3.5x over vanilla blocks.\n\nAttractive Liquidity\n\nWith the uncertainty of withdrawal eliminated, the initial staking percentage of 14% is expected to multiply. Most of these staked coins were of the bull run, and chances of shorting in the bear market are highly unlikely.\n\nEIP-4895: The Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEIP-4895 will focus on allowing withdrawals on the execution layer, Shanghai, and the consensus layer, also known as the Capella upgrade. The roadmap shows many milestones after Shanghai, commonly referred to as \u201cSurge\u201d, \u201cVerge,\u201d \u201cPurge\u201d, and \u201cSplurge\u201d. The immediate future shows that EIP-4844 (proto-dank sharding) could scale Ethereum by reducing gas fees, and EIP-3540 aims to reduce Ethereum Virtual MAchine\u2019s resource requirement.\n\n2022 saw a 178% increase in developer activities in Ethereum, causing 1.5 million downloads. Even with a slower market, smart contracts deployment hit 4.6 million deployments in Q4 2022.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nSwitching consensus mechanisms may have boosted the growth to some extent, but further developments are required to steal the top position."
