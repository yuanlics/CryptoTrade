        "title": "Two Powerful Blockchain Platforms of the Future: Ethereum and Solana - Paxos",
        "content": "Blockchain, once overlooked in the shadow of cryptocurrency, is now a powerhouse player in its own right with implications far beyond the financial sector. From improving supply chain integrity to facilitating transactions for a wide range of digital assets, its use cases are vast and varied.\n\nBut what lies at the heart of this innovative technology, and how can it be harnessed? It is helpful for enterprises across many industries to understand the fundamentals of blockchain and how key platforms like Ethereum and Solana are leading the charge in this technological revolution.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is digital ledger technology that documents transactions across a network of computers. It can log and track everything from cryptocurrency payments to real-world assets to legal agreements.\n\nBlockchain technology is renowned for its security and immutability. The technology\u2019s name stems from the fact that it\u2019s comprised of a series of \u201cblocks,\u201d with each containing transaction data, a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Every transaction is linked in a \u201cchain\u201d and distributed across numerous nodes.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there\u2019s little risk of manipulation from entities like governments or financial institutions. In fact, a blockchain\u2019s structure makes it nearly impossible to retroactively alter any single record without changing all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers transparency and decentralization, making it an attractive option for transactional applications\u2014among them, money movement, supply chain management and even digital identity verification.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nWithin blockchain technology, there are many different blockchain platforms. Two of the most prominent blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Solana, each with unique features and capabilities.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum, launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced the concept of \u201c smart contracts ,\u201d or self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The latest iteration of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism\u2014essentially, th e process by which validators create new blocks. ( Learn more about consensus mechanisms and how they work here .)\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a newer blockchain platform that launched to the public in 2020. It\u2019s known for speed and efficiency. It employs a unique hybrid consensus model, combining proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS). This enables it to process transactions rapidly and with lower fees compared to Ethereum. As such, Solana is an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and other applications requiring quick transaction times.\n\nEthereum and Solana have gained popularity because they offer solutions to common pain points related to scalability, speed and cost. These platforms have also sparked an entire ecosystem of subsequent innovation: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has given rise to decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe future of finance: instant transfers and more\n\nImagine a world where international suppliers are paid the moment goods are shipped, employees receive compensation in real-time and complex financial transactions are settled instantly. This immediacy not only streamlines business operations, but also opens doors to new financial strategies like dynamic pricing. The ripple effects of such capabilities include more agile, responsive and competitive businesses and a transformation of the way global commerce operates.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum and Solana have the potential to make such hypotheticals into realities. With their ability to power instant, 24/7 financial transactions across borders, blockchains may be particularly attractive to enterprises operating in multiple countries or those engaging in high-volume trade, not to mention the implications for sectors like e-commerce and digital supply chain management.\n\nBlockchain technology is evolving rapidly. Many enterprises need a hand when it comes to adopting it and maximizing its potential and a trusted partner can help you seamlessly integrate blockchain into existing operations.\n\nBlockchain is transforming the way we think about money, assets and transactions and is paving the way for new business models and strategies. With the right partners to help you navigate and implement blockchain systems, your business will be well-positioned to stay a step ahead in the digital finance era."

        "content": "Bitcoin is still down on 21-month highs set directly after the SEC bungled its spot ETF announcement on Tuesday. Ethereum, on the other hand, is way up.\n\nEther (ETH) has rallied more than 16% in that time and is now easily the year-to-date best performing top-20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin (BTC) is so far in second-place, with about half those returns.\n\nMarkets sold the news one day early due to the SEC\u2019s unauthorized announcement and appear to have simultaneously bought the rumor on ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) \u2014 the original Ethereum hard fork in 25th position \u2014 is however having a moment. The blockchain\u2019s native token ETC has spiked nearly 50% over the past day.\n\nDue to the timing, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any real rhyme or reason for ETC to be climbing so quickly.\n\nThe devil\u2019s advocate would say that Ethereum Classic is gearing up for a hard fork later this month tipped to better align the network\u2019s EVM with Ethereum\u2019s, which could help inspire projects to work with the chain.\n\nAnd the network\u2019s hashrate did spike to all-time highs following Ethereum\u2019s switched to proof-of-stake in late 2022, as former ETH miners sought a substitute revenue stream at which to direct their GPU mining rigs.\n\nEther has jumped from $2,200 to $2,650 this week. Ethereum Classic has gone from $20 to $30.\n\nMuch of Ethereum Classic\u2019s post-Merge hashrate has stuck around, despite the network only seeing around 30,000 in transactions per day (about the baseline for Bitcoin Cash).\n\nFor scale, Litecoin is currently processing more than half a million transactions per day (boosted by the network\u2019s own brand of inscriptions) while Ethereum mainnet handles about twice as much, per BitInfoCharts.\n\nStill, Ethereum Classic only boasts less than 15% of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate recorded just before the Merge.\n\nETHPoW, the hard fork of Ethereum from around the Merge meant to compete with Ethereum Classic, currently has about one-tenth of the latter\u2019s hashrate.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Still Deciding What To Do With ETHPoW\n\nIn fact, until yesterday\u2019s formal SEC approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, ETC had returned nothing over the past year.\n\nThe more likely explanation is that traders are looking to frontrun the next big media narrative around crypto: the SEC approving spot bitcoin ETFs means an eventual greenlight for spot ether funds.\n\nDue to illiquid markets, dumb money or widespread left-curving, Ethereum Classic has tagged along for the ride but ended up dominating ether for gains over the short-term.\n\nGrayscale does already sell exposure to the token through one of its trusts, and the firm is now set to convert its $29 billion bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nSome reckon fund issuers might soon seek approval for ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, including XRP and solana.\n\nThe odds of fund issuers lining up to launch ETFs for Ethereum Classic are slim.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Predictions for 2024: Comprehensive Insights with MEXC Research - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "MEXC\n\nSingapore , Jan. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement, especially after the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. This development has significantly sparked interest in Ethereum-based tokens, leading to a notable surge in their value. Ethereum's price, in particular, has reached its highest point since May 2022. Investors are optimistic about the possibility of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF receiving SEC approval, contributing to this upward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding to enthusiasm, Vitalik Buterin's recent proposal to increase Ethereum's gas limit further fueled the surge, with Ethereum's price surpassing the $2,600 mark for the first time since May 2022. This has set a promising stage for Ethereum price climbing towards the $3,000 milestone.\n\nTechnical analysis using Bollinger Bands on the daily timeframe supports this bullish perspective. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,655, having moved above the upper Bollinger Band at $2,539, indicating a shift to bullish market momentum.\n\nTo reinforce the prediction of Ethereum reaching $3,000, a significant challenge must be overcome: breaking through the psychological resistance around $2,800. Successfully navigating past this point could pave the way for Ethereum to hit the anticipated $3,000 mark.\n\nMEXC Research's collection of market insights reveals substantial growth in Ethereum markets, driven by strong buying interest. This trend suggests a possible broader upward trajectory in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum poised to benefit significantly from this momentum.\n\nRenowned experts have weighed in with their predictions for Ethereum's price in 2024:\n\n\u2022 Anthony Sano's Optimistic Forecast: Predicting Ethereum to reach an impressive $10,000 by 2024, Sano emphasizes Ethereum's unique staking feature and the likelihood of an Ethereum ETF introduction, which he believes will attract institutional investors.\n\n\u2022 Rekt Capital's Analysis: Suggesting a 22% increase, Rekt Capital believes Ethereum could surpass $2,600 if it maintains firm support at $2,274.\n\n\u2022 FieryTrading's Bullish Trend Prediction: Ethereum has maintained a bullish trend for over 1.5 years, according to FieryTrading, with the potential to reach $5,000 by late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\u2022 Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou's Long-term View: The JPMorgan Managing Director highlights Ethereum's potential, especially with the \"Protodanksharding\" upgrade, projecting a price towards $8,000 by 2026 and possible outperformance over Bitcoin in 2024.\n\n\u2022 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe's Forecast: Anticipating a correction to around $1,900, followed by a rise to $3,400-$3,800 in early 2024.\n\n\u2022 Credible Crypto's Ambitious Predictions: Predicting ETH could reach a minimum of $10,000 and possibly soar to $20,000 in 2024, representing a substantial increase from its current value.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupporting these optimistic forecasts, data from Santiment Information indicates a significant increase in Ethereum accumulation by top holders. The top 150 self-custody wallets now hold a record-breaking 56.25 million ETH, demonstrating considerable confidence in Ethereum's future.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum's price predictions for 2024, as compiled by MEXC Research, range from a conservative estimate of $6,000 to a striking $10,000, heavily influenced by market sentiment and the anticipated introduction of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Following a positive spot Bitcoin ETF announcement, Ethereum-based tokens continue to lead with up to 52% price gains.\n\nLeading CoinMarketCap charts on Jan. 11 is Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which functions as a decentralized naming system built on Ethereum. ENS simplifies human-readable Ethereum addresses like john.eth into machine-readable alphanumeric codes commonly associated with wallets such as Metamask. As of the latest data, ENS is sitting at $23.15, following a 55.1% increase in the last 24 hours, amid a positive trend in the overall Ethereum market.\n\nTop crypto gainers of the day | CoinMarketCap\n\nThe surge in ENS price coincides with Ethereum briefly surpassing the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, marking a 10% rise within the week, in anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF Approval. Additionally, an earlier message from Vitalik.eth underscoring the importance of CCIP resolvers for Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has also been said to feed into positive market sentiment.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum price to cross $3k after Bitcoin ETF approval?\n\nTaking the second spot in the gainers is Ethereum Classic (ETC), a hard fork of Ethereum (ETH) introduced in July 2016, which primarily operates as a smart contract network supporting decentralized applications (DApps). The live price of Ethereum Classic is recorded at $30.53 USD, after a 46% surge in the past 24 hours. The driving force behind this notable increase is again linked to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC. This notable industry announcement has since resulted in the cryptocurrency surpassing $26 for the first time since October 2022.\n\nANNOUNCEMENT: TezFin Production Version has launched!\n\n\n\nDecentralized Lending/Borrowing on Tezos Blockchain.

Tezos (XTZ) is a blockchain network functioning on smart contracts, although it is said to provide more advanced infrastructure. Its price surge is tied to an announcement from TezFin, the Tezos defi lending platform, which announced the launch of its production version, offering decentralized lending and borrowing on the Tezos blockchain. The live price of Tezos currently stands at $1.17, reflecting a 34.6% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith cryptocurrencies being established as a tradeable asset class, many analysts believe big market moves will continue to play out in the coming days.\n\nRead more: Ethereum applications take place as top gainers ahead of ETF announcement\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Traders are now betting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line to get the green light as the price of ether has surged nearly 20% in the last seven days compared to bitcoin's gain of 2.5% during the same period.\n\nBut, according to Panigirtzoglou, the SEC is \"still signaling that it continues to view all other cryptocurrencies outside bitcoin as securities.\"\n\nLast year, JPMorgan said U.S. lawmakers could potentially put ether into a new \u201cother category\u201d to avoid classifying it as a security.\n\nStaking protocols\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLast year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler reiterated that tokens using staking protocols, such as Ethereum's ETH token, could be considered securities under U.S. law. During a nearly five-hour hearing with lawmakers last year, Gensler refused to say whether ETH was a security. And earlier this week, while approving spot bitcoin ETFs, Gensler said that decision \"should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\"\n\nSome analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's James Seyffart, have been more optimistic than JPMorgan that spot ETH ETFs will get approved.\n\nThe SEC had to finally approve spot bitcoin ETFs in part because it had already approved bitcoin futures ETFs, and a federal court ruled that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nSeveral firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have recently filed for spot ETH ETFs."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Amid the current crypto market rally led by Bitcoin, there's one crypto that seems to be getting completely overlooked: Ethereum (ETH 1.13%). That's somewhat surprising, given that Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with an enormous $290 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, the hype around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has focused investor attention squarely on Bitcoin. At the same time, a number of direct Ethereum rivals skyrocketed to triple-digit percentage gains last year, and have become the new darlings of crypto investors looking for maximum upside. But there are several reasons Ethereum might be undervalued at its current price of about $2,400.\n\nEthereum vs. the wannabe Ethereums\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum was the talk of the crypto industry. It had just pulled off The Merge, which fundamentally transformed its blockchain to make it faster, cheaper, easier to use, and much more energy efficient. The hype around Ethereum grew to the point where some investors even thought that Ethereum might eventually surpass Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nBut then came 2023. All of a sudden, rival blockchains like Solana started gaining traction with investors. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year. Avalanche, another Ethereum rival, was up nearly 200% for the year. By way of comparison, Ethereum was up 90%, and seemed to be losing the attention of investors.\n\nSo the big question is whether Ethereum is still best-in-class. If you think that the so-called Ethereum killers are just a bunch of Ethereum wannabes with no long-term staying power, then Ethereum could be highly undervalued at its current price. But if you think that Ethereum's long reign as the top Layer-1 blockchain network in the world is coming to an end, then it's a completely different story.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF incoming?\n\nRight now, the imminent arrival of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market is getting all the headlines. But, according to a growing number of crypto investors, a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming soon. And that means that Ethereum could soon get the same type of boost Bitcoin is getting right now.\n\nCertainly, the underlying logic makes sense. Wall Street is looking for more reliable ways to invest in crypto, and has apparently determined that the ETF investment product is the best way to achieve this. Once it can show that a spot Bitcoin ETF is successful, then it's time to crank up this formula for every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nGiven Ethereum's market heft -- it now accounts for about 17% of the market value of the entire crypto market, second only to Bitcoin -- it would only make sense that Ethereum would be next in line for a spot ETF. And, indeed, there is already an application in the works for just such a product. In September, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. If the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to approve this (admittedly, a big \"if\"), it could result in billions of dollars flowing into Ethereum, pushing up its price.\n\nA sexy new upgrade\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Ethereum's next big upgrade. Ethereum recently published its strategic roadmap for 2024, and one item on the roadmap that caught the attention of investors was something called EIP-4844 (\"Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844\"). Basically, this is a proposed technical change that would enable the processing of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to become much faster and more efficient.\n\nI know, I know. You're probably rolling your eyes right now. What a bunch of blockchain babble, right? But consider that EIP-4844 got J.P. Morgan really excited. In a research note to clients, JPMorgan specifically referred to EIP-4844 as a key reason it thinks Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024. That's because this major technical change would make it theoretically possible for the Ethereum blockchain to handle 100,000 transactions per second, up from about a dozen or so now. With that type of speed, Ethereum would basically be unstoppable.\n\nHow much higher can Ethereum go?\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum needs to convince investors that it is still the preeminent Layer-1 blockchain network. So keep an eye on how Ethereum deals with the growing threat from the likes of Solana. As long as investors buy into the idea that Solana is a faster and more cost-efficient version of Ethereum, it's hard to see Ethereum skyrocketing in price.\n\nWith that in mind, it's certainly possible to find a number of bullish Ethereum price predictions for 2024. Some crypto traders think that Ethereum could double, triple, or even quadruple in value. I may not be as bullish on Ethereum, but I'm certainly open to the idea that Ethereum could surprise a lot of people in 2024."

        "content": "Ether price gained 13.5% between Jan. 10 and Jan. 12, breaking above $2,650 for the first time since May 2022. The pivotal factor for the rally has been the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund approval, although the leading cryptocurrency traded down 2% in the same period. Investors are now questioning if Ether (ETH) has what it takes to sustain its current $322 billion market capitalization.\n\nEther/USD vs. BTC/USD, SOL/USD, and BNB/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the past 60 days, Ether price has gained 27%, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 24% positive move in the same period \u2014 quite a feat considering that the spot BTC approval was expected to catapult its price as it opens room for a whole new set of clients who could not acquire cryptocurrency directly. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, as opposed to their 95% chances for Bitcoin.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck and other asset managers expect the final U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deadline on the spot Ethereum ETF decision by May 23, but given that Bitcoin already paved the way, some analysts believe the final answer might come sooner than anticipated. For instance, the SEC has intermediary deadlines in late January for some of the applicants.\n\nEthereum competitors have lost momentum\n\nGiven that Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF approval had a dismal price impact, one should conclude that Ether\u2019s bullish momentum has been driven by other factors. For starters, Ethereum\u2019s direct competitors faced a correction after expressive rallies. BNB (BNB) declined 2% in the seven days leading up to Jan. 12, while SOL (SOL) dropped 3% in the same period.\n\nIn SOL\u2019s case, the bullish momentum faded after the extremely successful SPL token airdrops \u2014 including JITO, BONK and WIF \u2014 faced 40% and higher price corrections. Moreover, much of the decentralized applications (DApps) activity gain seemed to be concentrated on a handful of projects that had imminent token launches, which also faded after the respective snapshots. Consequently, investors\u2019 appetite for Solana\u2019s SOL token started to diminish.\n\nBNB faced impressive and unexpected 35.7% gains between Dec. 17 and 27, 2023, but the bullish momentum was not accompanied by network activity. In fact, in the seven days ending Jan. 12, BNB Chain\u2019s active DApp addresses declined by 61%, while the number of transactions plunged by 64%, according to DappRadar. As a comparison, Ethereum faced a 2.2% decline in active addresses and 0.3% fewer volumes in the same period.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 7-day DApps activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nRegardless of how the nonfungible token (NFT) markets are depressed relative to the 2021 peak, Ethereum\u2019s network remains the undisputed leader in value, including the leading collections \u2014 CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Pudgy Penguins and Azuki. In essence, those using Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and top NFT assets are not worried about a $6.30 average transaction fee.\n\nEthereum staking and DApp activity remain resilient\n\nEther\u2019s price has also benefited from its 4.3% annualized staking reward and a slightly negative issuance rate. Almost 24% of the entire circulating ETH supply is locked up while participating in the network\u2019s validating process, which fuels investors\u2019 expectations toward its price. In comparison, Solana\u2019s adjusted staking reward is 0.8% due to its high SOL issuance rate.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the US\u2013What to expect next\n\nThe Ethereum network is expected to undergo a hard fork that would mark a significant advancement in its technological capabilities. Focused on increased data availability and reduced costs for rollup transactions, the \u201cDencun\u201d fork has its first testnet implementation scheduled for Jan. 17. Another anticipated improvement is account abstraction, which enables reduced transaction costs and secure social logins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s limited capacity to scale and implement privacy solutions in the base layer has been a constant source of criticism; thus, it makes sense to smooth the process of accessing its second layers in terms of user experience and costs. Therefore, Ether\u2019s rally above $2,600 has less relationship to the spot ETF approval than it meets the eye, as the network remains dominant in the smart contract industry.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum ETFs are poised to gain traction now Bitcoin spot ETFs have regulatory approval.\n\nProminent crypto investor DCInvestor predicts Ethereum will outperform most assets in the current market cycle.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prospects look bright as anticipation builds for the approval of a spot ETF in the United States, following Bitcoin\u2019s recent approval.\n\nThe long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States has opened the floodgates for further innovation in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWith 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs now available to investors, the stage is set for the next major development: spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum ETFs Emerge as New Bullish Catalyst\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long been considered a prime candidate for an ETF. The asset\u2019s strong fundamentals, growing adoption, and established ecosystem have made it a compelling investment proposition for institutional investors. And with the SEC\u2019s recent decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs, the regulatory hurdles for Ether ETFs have significantly diminished.\n\nThe recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has sent Ether prices skyrocketing, as traders speculate that the regulatory agency may soon approve spot Ethereum ETFs as well. ETH traded at over $2,600 in early European hours on Wednesday, up 8% in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin prices went up by 1.3% in the same period. BTC had been falling due to a series of tweets from the temporarily hacked SEC\u2019s X account.\n\nConor Ryder, head of research at the stablecoin company Ethena Labs said :\n\n\u201cNow that the Bitcoin ETF speculation has come to fruition it looks like traders are rotating to ether to get ahead of the next narrative, an ETH ETF, while ETH looks relatively cheap compared to most other tokens.\u201d\n\nThe SEC should make a decision on spot ETH ETF applications in May. BlackRock, Invesco , Ark, and VanEck are among the companies vying for approval, with Grayscale also seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nAlright, that\u2019s enough of spot bitcoin ETFs\u2026 Wen spot ether ETFs? \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 10, 2024\n\nRyder believes the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fueled the recent rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Meanwhile, he says Ethereum has failed to gain traction compared to smaller blockchain networks like Solana and Cardano.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nEthereum ETFs Poised for Breakout\n\nOn January 9, crypto Twitter personality DCInvestor Ethereum would outperform most other assets once the current market cycle ends.\n\ni am not going to tell you that ETH will be the BEST performer this cycle but it will do better and retain more value after this cycle than the vast majority of assets imo it's insanely undervalued at the moment this could be the last great opportunity of a lifetime \u2014 DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) January 8, 2024\n\nThe prediction is based on the assumption that Ethereum is the next logical candidate for a spot exchange-traded product (ETP). DCInvestor also noted that Ethereum already has futures-based ETFs. This, he says, indicates that the SEC could well approve a spot ETF soon.\n\nYouTuber Crypto Rover expressed a on Ethereum\u2019s future to his 635,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nHe :\n\n\u201cAn Ethereum spot ETF is the next big narrative on the horizon. After the Bitcoin spot ETF is approved and the hype surrounding it subsides, the focus will shift to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThe #Ethereum Spot ETF is going to be the next big narrative. After the Bitcoin Spot ETF is accepted, things will settle down, and the next hype will transfer to ETH. No one is paying attention to the upcoming hype on Ethereum, and actually, due to the recent $SOL pump, people\u2026 pic.twitter.com/AOxRfqNsrH \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 8, 2024\n\nHe attributed the current lack of attention on Ethereum to the recent surge in Solana\u2019s price. In the past 90 days, SOL has surged by 360%, while Ethereum\u2019s performance has been relatively modest, with a 48% increase. He believes Ethereum will regain its prominence once the market calms down and the focus turns to its potential for institutional adoption.\n\nInstitutional Demand Drives Approval Prospects\n\nIn a recent analysis, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that the SEC\u2019s approving Ethereum futures and the CFTC\u2019s classifying ETH as a commodity suggest that the possibility of the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs this year is increasing.\n\nA host of prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, are vying for SEC approval to launch spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has set deadlines for each applicant to receive a decision on their proposal:\n\nVanEck: May 23\n\nARK 21Shares: May 24\n\nHashdex: May 30\n\nGrayscale: June 18\n\nInvesco: July 5\n\nFidelity: August 3\n\nBlackRock: August 7\n\nThis intense competition among established financial giants underscores the growing demand for Ether ETFs and the potential impact they could have on the cryptocurrency market."

Kendrick compares this situation to what happened with Bitcoin ETFs and thinks Ethereum\u2019s price (ETH) may reach $4,000 by that date due to hype.\n\nKendrick\u2019s confidence comes from the fact that the SEC hasn\u2019t treated Ether as a security in its legal actions. Ether is already being traded as a future on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\n\u201cGrayscale, which has an Ethereum trust, wants to convert it into an ETF. If they get denied, they will likely appeal,\u201d he said, adding that there\u2019s no reason for the SEC to treat Ethereum differently.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin highlights opportunities and risks in merging crypto, AI\n\nKendrick is generally optimistic about cryptocurrencies and their price valuations. Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of this year and $200,000 by 2025. He believes these targets are possible, especially with funds expected to continually flow into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nKendrick on CNN talking about Bitcoin ETFs\n\nFollowing Bitcoin ETF approval, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell slightly due to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows, but Bitcoin\u2019s price has since rebounded and now sits around $43,540. Kendrick believes Ethereum will not face the same sort of post-approval drop in price due to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust not being as large of a part of the Ethereum market as Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust was for Bitcoin.\n\nKendrick expects that on May 23, the SEC will approve basic Ethereum ETFs that follow the price of Ethereum. He adds that ETFs that include extra earnings from staking might come later and already exist in Europe.\n\nKendrick also talks about Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrades, saying it should make Ethereum more competitive and keep rewards from staking high for longer and that this, in turn, will benefit Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Bloomberg senior exchange-traded fund analyst Eric Balchunas said there is a 70% possibility for the approval of spot Ethereum ETH +1.29% exchange-traded funds from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by May of this year.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the price of ether rose 8% to $2,613 \u2014 recording nearly 18% growth in the last seven days. Crypto industry experts say this signifies investor optimism for a potential ether ETF following the SEC\u2019s approval of eleven spot bitcoin ETFs earlier today.\n\n\u201cStarting with BTC ETF, we are seeing a 'buy the rumor, ignore the news, buy the next rumor' set up,\u201d said Joe Caselin, head of institutional marketing at BIT crypto exchange. \u201cBlackRock filed its ETH ETF application in Nov 2023, and while that is a lot less certain than the numerous BTC ETF applications that were just approved, the potential is huge, as it would mark the first such product for ETH, which already has a large appeal with institutional investors.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, expected to launch its bitcoin ETF on Thursday, has a track record of 575 approvals from the regulator and only one ETF rejection. The first final decision deadline for the SEC on the spot ETH ETF application, from Ark and 21Shares, is on May 23.\n\nUncertainties remain surrounding the spot Ethereum ETF approval, given the current SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s adamant stance that every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin is a financial security. Be that as it may, Gensler\u2019s predecessor, Jay Clayton, once mentioned that a small number of tokens might cease to be considered securities if they became broadly decentralized. Former SEC director of corporate finance William Hinman also said during a speech in 2018 that, considering its decentralized nature, ether coins are not financial securities.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIs a Solana ETF a possibility?\n\nIf the SEC decides to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, other large-cap cryptocurrencies \u2014 such as Solana \u2014 may be next, Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, told The Block. \u201cAlthough Solana is a comparatively young ecosystem compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, its noteworthy performance in 2023, marked by positive news and increased developer activity, has captured investor attention. Notably, Solana achieved an impressive price gain of 920%, significantly outpacing Bitcoin's 155% growth in the same period,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nCaselin of BIT shared the same opinion that an Ethereum ETF launch will bring more financial vehicles, giving access to a wider variety of crypto assets. \u201cWe might be looking at a whole range of ETFs that provide access to top market cap tokens and projects, although it may make more sense for a top 50 ETF rather than 50 individual ETFs \u2014 not unlike an S&P 500 for large-cap or 'blue-chip' tokens.\u201d"

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "To say Ethereum (ETH 1.14%) is down would be exactly correct. However, when considering the gains made among its peers during 2023, its 90% increase makes it feel like Ethereum more or less watched from the sidelines while other cryptocurrencies had triple-digit percentage gains.\n\nGiven its position as the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market, it seems unnatural for Ethereum not to have had a more considerable jump. But all this means is that Ethereum has some catching up to do in 2024. Here's why Ethereum remains an attractive buy.\n\nThe smart contract pioneer\n\nEthereum's launch in 2015 altered the trajectory of crypto forever. Its novel smart contract functionality provided the foundation for developers to create innovative applications of blockchain technology that have now become common. Without Ethereum, things like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and much more would not exist.\n\nAlthough newer cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche provide similar or even superior capabilities today, Ethereum remains the clear-cut leader of decentralized innovation. Several metrics demonstrate Ethereum's dominance over hopeful competitors, but two in particular highlight just how tight the original smart contract blockchain's grip on the market remains.\n\nThe undisputed champion of the decentralized economy\n\nFirst is total value locked (TVL). Quantifying the total value of assets currently staked or locked in a particular blockchain, TVL is a metric used to compare the amount of liquidity within varying DeFi ecosystems. The thinking goes that the greater the TVL, the more robust and valuable a blockchain is. As a disclaimer, this statistic has some limitations, but it does a good enough job of leveling the playing field to make comparisons.\n\nToday Ethereum's TVL is worth roughly $31 billion and accounts for 55% of the TVL across all blockchains with DeFi capabilities. Solana has just $1.3 billion in TVL, and Avalanche has $856 million.\n\nThe distance separating Ethereum from competitors undoubtedly results from its first-mover's advantage. As the first smart contract-capable blockchain, it was the only option for quite a while. Yet even as competing blockchains have joined the DeFi race and attracted significant hype, none has been able to challenge Ethereum where it matters most.\n\nFollow the developers\n\nGoing beyond TVL, assessing the number of active developers provides valuable insights into a cryptocurrency's potential. Developers are key players, responsible for creating applications, fixing issues, and introducing new features -- all critical for the sustained success of a blockchain.\n\nYet again, Ethereum shines. As of the latest count in October 2023, Ethereum had twice as many active developers as Polkadot, and nearly three times more than Solana.\n\nEthereum's extensive developer community is arguably its most valuable asset, giving it a significant competitive advantage over other blockchains. With developers involved in day-to-day maintenance, further upgrades, and exploring new use cases, Ethereum is typically the top choice for new projects seeking a reliable blockchain.\n\nMost importantly, a robust developer community not only ensures long-term viability, but also attracts more projects. Since the value of most cryptocurrencies is tied to their utility, a blockchain supporting numerous use cases often commands a higher price.\n\nEthereum's value proposition today\n\nConsidering its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum simply holds too many advantages compared to other blockchains not to be a leader in the crypto market this year. With an expansive and flourishing ecosystem of tokens, decentralized exchanges, NFTs, stablecoins, and much more, Ethereum provides investors with unparalleled exposure to the burgeoning landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nAs it currently stands, Ethereum remains almost 50% off its all-time high of nearly $4,900. Considering its position as a DeFi leader and the likelihood of a looming crypto bull market, Ethereum holds plenty of upside for the upcoming year. While the rest of the crypto market focuses on newer or more glamorous blockchains, don't forget about Ethereum. It still has plenty of room to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has proposed a significant increase in the gas limit, to improve the network\u2019s throughput.\n\nETH developers are navigating a balance between enhancing transaction capacity and controlling the state\u2019s growth.\n\nThey are working on various solutions to address these challenges, including EIP-4444 and EIP-4844.\n\nEthereum developers are currently grappling with a contentious proposal from the network\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, to increase the gas limit by 33%.\n\nThis suggestion has raised concerns due to the potential impact on the growing size of the blockchain state.\n\nEthereum Proposals Gas Limit Increase to Boost Throughput\n\nEthereum, the second-largest blockchain, finds itself at a pivotal juncture with this proposal. On January 11, Buterin proposed boosting the gas limit from its current level of 30 million to 40 million. This is intended to improve the network\u2019s throughput, allowing for more transactions per block and thus expanding the network\u2019s overall capacity.\n\nButerin said : \u201cHonestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable.\u201d\n\nThe concept of a gas limit in Ethereum has been a dynamic feature since the platform\u2019s launch in 2015. Originally set at approximately three million, the limit has been periodically adjusted upwards to accommodate the network\u2019s increasing usage and the broader adoption of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes a 33% increase in the gas limit, aiming to enhance the network's transaction capacity. This move could impact transaction fees and overall efficiency. Keeping an eye on Ethereum's ongoing developments. \u26d3\ufe0f\ud83d\udca1 #Ethereum #Blockchain \u2014 Nestor Makhno \ud83c\udfad (@NestorMakhno3_0) January 11, 2024\n\nHowever, this latest proposal is a significant leap and is sparking debate among developers over its potential implications.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain state, which is vital for storing account balances and smart contract data, currently requires about 267 gigabytes (GB) of storage space. The entire history of the blockchain is even more substantial, amounting to around 900GB, as per data from Blockchair .\n\nConcerns over Gas Limit Increase, Highlighting Challenges of Scaling\n\nNonetheless, Buterin\u2019s proposal to increase the limit has encountered some resistance. This is primarily due to concerns about its impact on the size of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden articulated these apprehensions in a January 11 blog post. In his post , van der Wijden noted that, while storage space might be relatively affordable, an expanded state size could potentially slow down accessing and modifying data on the blockchain.\n\nI wrote down some of my thoughts on raising the gas limit today: https://t.co/gX0eihUyYa (Haven't proof-read it, so if you find a mistake, you can keep it) \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 11, 2024\n\nVan der Wijden underscored the necessity for clear and effective solutions to manage the state\u2019s growth.\n\nThe proposed increase brings with it several technical challenges. These include extended time for synchronizing the blockchain and complexities in developing and maintaining diverse clients.\n\nP\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, a team lead for Ethereum, echoed concerns that a higher gas limit might demand more bandwidth. He pointed out the significant trade-offs associated with a higher gas limit. While it could indeed boost the network\u2019s transaction capacity, it also risks accelerating the growth of the state size.\n\nThis could lead to slower synchronization times and heighten the risks of network attacks and spam, presenting a complex balancing act for the Ethereum community. These concerns reflect the ongoing challenges faced in scaling blockchain networks while ensuring their security and efficiency.\n\nWhat problem does increasing the gas limit solve? Increasing it definitely has a downside. State will grow faster, sync time will get slower quicker, DoS potential will grow. Would be nice to have a number on those. That said, what does increasing the gas limit net us? \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) January 11, 2024\n\nDevs Seek Scalability Solutions Amid Gas Limit Debate\n\nThe gas limit on Ethereum acts as a threshold for the amount of computational work \u2013 denoted as gas \u2013 that can be included in each block, encompassing transactions and smart contract executions. This limit is vital for maintaining manageable block sizes, which is essential for the network\u2019s optimal performance.\n\nI am for increasing the gas limit, but we need to be more careful. I think after 4844, the best way to do this would actually be:\n\n\u2013 Increase the execution capacity by increasing the gas limit BUT ALSO increasing CALLDATA cost (ETH L1 is for execution, not data)\n\n\u2013 Increase the\u2026 https://t.co/kOblgRCHQV \u2014 Dankrad Feist (@dankrad) January 11, 2024\n\nValidators, who are responsible for creating new blocks, have the discretion to tweak the gas limit, albeit within specified bounds. This flexibility allows for some adaptability in the network\u2019s capacity.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit is seen as a potential way to enhance Ethereum\u2019s throughput and capacity.

        "content": "Ethereum developers are expressing concerns over Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest proposal to raise the gas limit by 33%, citing worries about the growing size of the blockchain state.\n\nThe second largest blockchain Ethereum is currently at a crossroads over a proposal by its co-founder Vitalik Buterin to increase its gas limit.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Buterin recommended a 33% increase in the gas limit, a change aimed at enhancing the network\u2019s throughput. The proposal suggests raising the limit from the current 30 million to 40 million, potentially allowing more transactions per block and increasing the network\u2019s capacity.\n\nThe concept of the gas limit has evolved since Ethereum\u2019s inception in 2015. Initially set at around 3 million, the limit has gradually increased in response to the network\u2019s growing usage and adoption.\n\nEthereum average gas limit through the years | Source: Etherscan\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain state, which stores account balances and smart contract data, currently requires approximately 267 gigabytes (GB) of space. The entire history of the blockchain is even larger, around 900GB, according to Blockchair.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin reveals 6 main focuses for Ethereum in 2024\n\nHowever, the proposal has met with some resistance. Key among the concerns is the impact on the blockchain\u2019s state size.\n\nMarius van der Wijden, an Ethereum developer, expressed these worries in his Jan. 11 blog post, \u201cWhy increasing the gas limit is difficult.\u201d He pointed out that while storage might be affordable, a larger state size could slow down the process of accessing and modifying data.\n\nI wrote down some of my thoughts on raising the gas limit today: https://t.co/gX0eihUyYa\n\n\n\n(Haven't proof-read it, so if you find a mistake, you can keep it) \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 11, 2024\n\nWijden also noted the need for definitive solutions for managing the growth of the state.\n\nThe potential increase also poses technical challenges, including longer synchronization times and difficulties developing diverse clients. Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, highlighted that a higher gas limit could necessitate increased bandwidth.\n\nEthereum team lead P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi shared similar concerns, emphasizing the trade-offs of a higher gas limit. While it might improve transaction capacity, it could also lead to faster state growth, slower synchronization, and increased network attacks and spam risks.\n\nWhat problem does increasing the gas limit solve?\n\n\n\nIncreasing it definitely has a downside. State will grow faster, sync time will get slower quicker, DoS potential will grow. Would be nice to have a number on those.\n\n\n\nThat said, what does increasing the gas limit net us? \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) January 11, 2024\n\nThe gas limit in Ethereum serves as a cap on the amount of gas spent on transactions or smart contracts in each block. It is crucial to keep block sizes manageable to ensure optimal network performance.\n\nValidators have the flexibility to adjust the gas limit within certain parameters as they produce blocks.\n\nWhile increasing the gas limit could theoretically expand the network\u2019s throughput and capacity, it comes with the cost of higher loads on hardware and potential network security risks.\n\nDevelopers are exploring potential solutions, such as EIP-4444, which deals with chain history expiration, and EIP-4844, focusing on rollup data availability using \u201cblobs.\u201d These upgrades are aimed at addressing long-term growth concerns within the Ethereum network.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Lido Staked Ether All Popped This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space has become a rather intriguing one to follow, particularly over the past week. For investors looking at the impressive moves made by Ethereum (ETH 1.14%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -0.51%) and Lido Staked Ether (CRYPTO:STETH), one might surmise that everything is sunshine and rainbows. After all, as of 3:30 p.m. ET, these three cryptos surged 16.3%, 47.3%, and 16.7%, respectively, over the past week.\n\nHowever, it's also the case that Bitcoin (BTC 1.94%) is actually trading exactly flat this week over the same time frame. After surging more than 10% to a multiyear high of more than $48,500 this week, Bitcoin has since given up all its weekly gains, trading back to the $43,800 level at the time of writing.\n\nThis move follows the highly anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which has completely changed the investing landscape in the crypto sector, probably for good. Interestingly, Ethereum and its related tokens are seeing impressive surges, suggesting these cryptos may have ultimately been the better way to play this event.\n\nLet's dive into why.\n\nThese ETF approvals may not be a \"sell the news\" event for all cryptos\n\nIt's usually a good rule of thumb to wait a few days to assess how the enthusiasm around a specific catalyst for any asset plays out. In this case, it appears most of the buying activity for Bitcoin took place prior to, and around, its ETF approvals. Since then, a \"sell the news\" narrative has grown, suggesting perhaps the hype around these approvals may have already been priced into Bitcoin heading into this key catalyst.\n\nHowever, the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent ripple waves through the market. For Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency (and one that regulators have also shown a favorable stance toward in the past), the potential for spot Ethereum ETF approvals has shot higher following this news. Investors hoping for a similar rally heading into future spot Ethereum ETF approvals may be simply looking to get ahead of this trade.\n\nFor Ethereum Classic (the proof-of-work fork of Ethereum) and Lido Staked Ether (staked Ethereum on Lido's liquid-staking network that can be redeemed 1 to 1 with Ethereum), a rising tide tends to lift all boats. What's good for Ethereum is generally good for these tokens and will continue to drive outsized interest in these higher-volatility Ethereum alternatives.\n\nThe optimal way to play a particular catalyst is typically difficult to ascertain\n\nIf you asked me heading into this week whether Bitcoin or Ethereum and its related tokens would have a better week, I probably would have said Bitcoin. Most of the momentum in this sector was firmly behind the gold standard in this space, and a surge in capital (which could be as much as $100 billion) into Bitcoin should, in theory, lead to massive support for the world's largest cryptocurrency. These fundamentals remain in play. However, it's becoming clearer that much of the anticipation around these approvals had been priced in prior to the announcement.\n\nGiven how fast the crypto world moves, Bitcoin ETF approvals are now old news. Investors appear to be clearly focused on the next token with the biggest potential catalyst out there, and that's Ethereum right now."

        "content": "Gwei plays an essential role in transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nA concept you will encounter in your interaction with Ethereum is Gwei. This term is the key to understanding transaction costs, network congestion, and the general operations of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis article delves into the world of Gwei, explaining what it is and how you can determine it.\n\nWhat Is the ETH Gwei?\n\nGwei is a denomination for gas costs on the Ethereum network. The name is short for gigaWei, which is derived from blending two terms, giga and Wei.\n\nThe latter is the smallest fraction of Ether (ETH), the blockchain network\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Giga, on the other hand, denotes a billion, so Gwei comprises a billion Wei.\n\nSimilarly, one Gwei amounts to a billionth of Ether (0.000000001 ETH). So, a transaction costing 50 Gwei will set you back 0.000000050 ETH. Although there are other smaller ETH denominations, it is the most popular and appropriate means of paying gas fees on Ethereum.\n\nBefore delving into how Gwei works, it is essential to explain gas.\n\nGas refers to fees that users incur to verify their transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The fees are central to the network\u2019s functioning as they incentivize verifiers (nodes that validate transactions) and entrench decentralization.\n\nHow Does Gwei Work?\n\nAs the defacto payment medium, Gwei is crucial to the Ethereum gas system, determining the fees for executing different transactions on the network.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of its components and their functioning:\n\nGas: The compensation validators pay to approve their transactions on the blockchain. Every operation has its set gas units.\n\nGas Price: The fee in ETH expressed in Gwei that a user sets for their transaction. Higher prices fast-track the validation of transactions.\n\nGas Limit: The maximum gas a user is willing to pay for the transaction. The transaction fails if the gas required exceeds this ceiling.\n\nDynamic Gas : The gas prices vary depending on the network conditions.\n\nPriority fees : Users may sometimes pay additional fees to incentivize validators to prioritize their transactions\n\nDetermining Gwei on the Ethereum Network\n\nMultiply the gas limit by the price to calculate the transaction fee. We can express this statement mathematically as follows:\n\nTransaction Fee (ETH) = Gas Limit * Gas Price (Gwei) / 1,000,000,000\n\nFor instance, if your transaction\u2019s gas limit is 21,000, and the price is 50 Gwei, the total fee would be 1,050,000 Gwei or 0.00105 ETH.\n\nSeveral factors can affect the amount of Gwei users pay. These include:\n\nNetwork State: Gas prices rise during periods of network congestion as users compete for limited resources. Consequently, transactions at those times are expensive. The reverse is true for non-peak hours.\n\nNature of the transaction: Complex transactions, like using a smart contract or decentralized application (dApp), incur more Gwei and vice versa.\n\nBase Fee: This is the minimum price validators will accept to process a transaction.\n\nPriority Fee: As stated, this is an optional fee. Paying it increases your expenditure and motivates the verifiers to prioritize your transaction.\n\nExplaining Other Ether Denominations\n\nWhile Gwei dominates transaction fees, understanding the wider Ether denomination landscape can be immensely beneficial. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the key players:\n\nWei: This is ETH\u2019s smallest unit. While rarely used directly for fees, it provides granular precision for calculations. It draws its name from Wei Dai, an outlier in cryptography famed for developing b-money, which included the creation of Bitcoin .\n\nKwei: This is the second smallest measure of Ethereum. It is worth a thousand wei and is also known as Babbage, after Charles Babbage, a pioneer in computer automation.\n\nMwei: This unit is also nicknamed Lovelace after Ada Lovelace, who laid the foundation for using algorithms. It comprises a million wei and is one step lower than Gwei.\n\nTwei: Also named Szabo after Nick Szabo, a trailblazer in cryptography and digital assets, this unit is worth a thousand Gwei. It offers a convenient scale for fees associated with significant transfers or complex smart contract interactions.\n\nPwei: Ethereum enthusiasts also refer to this denomination as the Finney. It derives its name from Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin\u2019s founding fathers, and contains a million Gwei. It is handy in substantial transactions, like purchasing a plot of virtual land or funding a large-scale decentralized application (dApp).\n\nEther: It is the native crypto powering Ethereum. It is nicknamed Buterin, after Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s founder.\n\nUnderstanding these denominations empowers users to make informed decisions when interacting with the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy Is Gwei Crucial to Ethereum Transactions?\n\nGwei\u2019s significance goes beyond just fueling transactions. It\u2019s the cornerstone of a dynamic and efficient ecosystem with several key benefits:\n\nPrecise Fee Calculations: Gwei\u2019s granular nature allows for accurate fee estimations, eliminating rounding errors and ensuring users pay exactly what their transactions demand. This precision is essential for small transactions and micropayments, which would otherwise be impractical with larger denominations.\n\nEfficient Resource Allocation: The dynamic Gwei price system acts as a market mechanism, incentivizing validators to prioritize transactions offering higher fees. This ensures network resources are allocated efficiently, with complex or urgent transactions receiving faster processing times.\n\nTransparent Fee Structure: Gwei\u2019s clear and straightforward pricing model eliminates any ambiguity surrounding transaction costs. Users can easily understand the fee associated with each interaction, promoting trust and transparency within the Ethereum Virtual Machine .\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn a nutshell, Gwei isn\u2019t just a fee; it\u2019s the lifeblood of the Ethereum network. It fuels transactions, incentivizes verifiers, and ensures smooth resource allocation, all while maintaining transparency and decentralization."

The current gas limit is 30 million, according to Etherscan, so Buterin suggests an increase of 33%.\n\nEthereum average gas limit over time. Source: Etherscan\n\nThe average gas limit just after Ethereum\u2019s genesis in 2015 was around 3 million, which has increased over time along with network usage and adoption.\n\nThe Ethereum gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas spent on executing transactions or smart contracts in each block. Gas is the fee required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the blockchain.\n\nA gas limit is set to ensure that blocks are not too large, which would impact network performance and synchronization. Validators can also adjust the gas limit dynamically within specific parameters as they produce blocks.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit allows more transactions into each block, which theoretically increases the overall throughput and capacity of the network. However, it also increases loads on hardware and the potential risk of network spam and attacks.\n\nRelated: Daily gas spent on EVM inscriptions surges to record high of $8M\n\nAverage gas prices, or the cost of transacting on Ethereum, are currently around 35 gwei or $1.89, according to Etherscan. However, they have increased since the beginning of 2024 and are much higher for complex smart contract operations.\n\nNetwork gas fees spiked to a 2023 high of 150 gwei in May due to the inscriptions craze. A gwei is a denomination of Ethereum that represents one billionth of a single Ether (ETH).\n\nIn November 2023, Ethereum and Bitcoin users reignited the scalability debate as fees surged amid another round of inscriptions hype.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

Let us learn more about what is happening in the industry and why ETC is going up, in the present article.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approved, Finally\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved by the US SEC on 10 January, 2024. Entire crypto industry has been waiting for this news for several months. And, now that it is finally approved, several altcoins and Bitcoin are following an uptrend.\n\nThe anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF approval has itself brought considerable returns for Bitcoin since the past couple of months. From around $26,600 in October, 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value breached the $45,000 mark as soon as we entered January, 2024.\n\nWhile one of the strong reasons behind this price rally was the awaiting Bitcoin spot ETF approval, another reason is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAs the US SEC final judgment approached, a fake post was posted from the official X account. This caused a sharp price spike in the BTC chart. However, Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC clarified that the US SEC account was hacked and the ETF approval post was posted by unauthorized individuals. As Gary Gensler stated that the post was fake, the BTC price dropped around 5% within a couple of hours.\n\nHowever, the US SEC finally approved the Bitcoin spot ETF application of Grayscale Investments. As a result, several altcoins like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Pepe Coin, and others are rising in value.\n\nEthereum Hits 20-Month High\n\nEthereum Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nSurprisingly, the Bitcoin spot ETF approval has more impact on altcoins when compared to Bitcoin. The BTC price rose slightly and briefly touched the $47,000 mark whereas the Ether price increased by around 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading above $2,600, at the time of writing.\n\nEthereum has hit its 20-month high as the last time it traded above $2,600 was in May, 2022. At present, Ethereum price is recording 18% weekly gains and 16% monthly gains. And, the ETH price is expected to rise further.\n\nMost of the investors believe that Ethereum is the next best cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Because of its sophisticated technology and network upgrades Ethereum stands out from the rest of the cryptocurrencies. And, investors don\u2019t hesitate when it comes to Ethereum in the market conditions like present.\n\nEthereum Classic to Reach the $30 Mark\n\nEthereum Classic Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nThe clear winner among all the altcoins is Ethereum Classic. The ETC price rose by 34% in the last 24 hours and is showing no signs of slowing down with its increasing trading volume. It is currently trading at around $28 and is just $2 away from reaching the $30 mark.\n\nSo far, Ethereum Classic is one of the top performing altcoins in the crypto industry after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval surfaced. In addition to the price, its trading volume is soaring by 276%, standing at $1.8 billion and implying that the price could surge further. Its market capitalization also surged by 34% and crossed the $4 billion mark today.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event are not only pushing the BTC price but also the prices of altcoins."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum continues to assert its dominance, proving to investors and enthusiasts why it reigns supreme among altcoins. The recent price action of Ethereum paints a bullish narrative, with potential signals pointing toward an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine its market stature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's market movement has been extremely dominant following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, with the asset recently piercing through significant resistance levels. After a sustained period above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, ETH has shown formidable strength.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum's price hovers around $2,600, with the immediate resistance level now likely forming near the $2,700 mark, a point at which sellers previously stepped in. A decisive break above this level could open the gates for further escalation toward the $3,000 psychological barrier.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nOn the flip side, local support can be identified at around the $2,500 level, where a confluence of the EMAs and historical price reactions provides a safety net against potential pullbacks. Should Ethereum retreat from its current levels, the $2,400 and $2,300 levels stand ready to act as secondary and tertiary support zones, where buying interest has coalesced in the past.\n\nThe backdrop to this vigorous market movement is the speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent green light for a Bitcoin spot ETF has amplified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. Such approval would be a significant catalyst for Ethereum, potentially drawing in a new wave of institutional and retail investment.\n\nThe primary strength of a spot Ethereum ETF lies in its direct exposure to the actual asset, rather than the derivatives market that futures-based ETFs represent. This means that an ETF would purchase actual Ethereum, providing direct support to its price and reflecting true market sentiment more accurately. Moreover, it would offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing cryptocurrency wallets and keys, thereby simplifying entry onto the crypto market.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF would not only validate the asset's maturity and market significance but also solidify its position as a mainstay in the portfolios of diverse investors. Given Ethereum's foundational role in the development of DeFi and NFTs, an ETF would be a testament to its integral place in the digital economy.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF here\n\nDespite the approval of one of the most long-awaited financial products for the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin displayed a stoic reaction, subverting the expectations of many investors, who were bracing for a significant market upheaval. The cryptocurrency's price stability post-ETF news, while surprising to some, has been a more favorable outcome compared to the sell-off that many had predicted.\n\nThe relative calmness in Bitcoin's price has provided a conducive backdrop for altcoins to shine. Ethereum (ETH) notably breached the $2,500 mark, and Solana (SOL) regained a $100 valuation, underscoring a night of triumph for alternative cryptocurrencies. This decoupling of Bitcoin's movement from altcoin performance is a phenomenon that has been increasingly observed, suggesting a maturing market where assets can thrive on individual merit and ecosystem developments.\n\nThe chart at hand paints a picture of consolidation for Bitcoin, with the price hovering around the $45,000 region. The lack of a significant corrective move post-ETF news has lent a supportive floor to the broader crypto market. Trading volumes, alongside price action, indicate a steady holding pattern, a sign that the market is digesting the recent developments without panic or overenthusiasm.\n\nDespite the current stability, the market should not discount the potential for an uptick in Bitcoin\u2019s value. Historically, actual capital inflow following such regulatory milestones has been a precursor to upward movements in the cryptocurrency's price. If history is to serve as a reference, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may yet act as a delayed fuse, igniting a rally as new capital finds its way onto the market.\n\nInvestors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions have not triggered the volatility many feared, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to the investment landscape of Bitcoin. As traditional investors and institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin through these new financial products, the potential for a significant impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value trajectory is tangible."

        "title": "Ethereum Nodes and Clients Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Types of Ethereum Nodes\n\nThe Ethereum Node system functions according to the Point-to-Point network architecture. Three varieties of nodes exist:\n\nFull Nodes: A full node is tasked with the verification and validation of every transaction occurring within the network, in addition to upholding the blockchain\u2019s state. In the event of a smart contract transaction, full nodes proceed to execute every instruction contained within the smart contract. It ascertains whether the execution of the smart contract is yielding the anticipated outcomes. Each of these nodes upholds an exact replica of the blockchain data.\n\nIt continues to receive locally stored duplicates of the entire blockchain, including its own transactions and retains the most recent transaction state. In the event of a smart contract transaction, full nodes proceed to execute every instruction contained within the smart contract. It ascertains whether the execution of the smart contract is yielding the anticipated outcomes.\n\nLet us consider a scenario in which individual A conducts a transaction with individual B, which is subsequently appended to the blockchain. Subsequently, the full nodes examine the transaction to ensure that it adheres to all Ethereum specifications. If the transaction fails to comply, they either append the specification to the blockchain\u2019s current state or remove it. A transaction involving a discarder occurs when one individual transfers X ETH to another, but the recipient\u2019s account now contains a lesser amount of ETH.\n\nArchive Nodes: Archive nodes are full nodes that have been configured with the \u201carchive mode\u201d option. In contrast to Full Nodes, which solely retain the most recent transaction state, Archive nodes preserve the complete blockchain history, commencing from the genesis block.\n\nWhen requiring blocks anterior to the most recent 128 blocks, the Archive node is utilised. For instance, an archive node is necessary to utilise functions such as eth_getBalance of a historic address and to interact with smart contracts that were initiated in an earlier stage of the blockchain.\n\nArchive Nodes require more than 6 Terabytes of disc space due to their unique characteristic, whereas Full Nodes require only about 500 Gigabytes. Thus, it can be deduced that archive nodes are not practical for the general public; however, they prove to be advantageous when it comes to wallet vending, block perusing, and chain analytics.\n\nLight Nodes: A light node, in contrast to a full node, retains solely the block header and not the complete current blockchain state. It is appropriate for devices with limited memory and computational power, as the maintenance of a light node requires minimal hardware investment, operating expenses, and technical expertise. Full nodes are required for light nodes to operate. These nodes are not required to perpetually operate or transfer substantial volumes of data to and from the blockchain. It offers a straightforward method for creating a wallet, particularly for novices. Solid-state drives, for instance, are financially incapable of storing the gigabytes of data that other nodes consume. However, it is indisputable that light nodes have certain limitations; for instance, the availability of the light wallet provider during critical periods cannot be guaranteed.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Client?\n\nA software application that implements the Ethereum specification and establishes connections with other Ethereum clients via a peer-to-peer network is known as an Ethereum client. Inter-client communication on Ethereum is feasible provided that each client adheres to the reference specification and predefined communication protocols. Although these numerous clients are developed using different programming languages and by different teams, they all \u201cspeak\u201d the same protocol and comply with the same regulations. They are consequently capable of interacting with and operating on the identical Ethereum network.\n\nThese exchanges occur among numerous clients in the network utilising programming languages such as Erigon (Go/Multi), Geth (Go), OpenEthereum (Rust), and Nethermind (C#,.NET). The Ethereum protocol, represented by the yellow paper, enables any user to execute a client and create a node.\n\nThe formal prerequisites that constitute the Ethereum blockchain set it apart from the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Core does not establish standardized behaviours that are mandatory for all Ethereum clients, in contrast to Ethereum. By utilizing a straightforward programming language and standardized documentation, Ethereum\u2019s specifications enabled the blockchain to support non-interoperable software implementations of its clients.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Clients\n\nThere are three types of Ethereum Clients:\n\nFull Client: Full clients store the entire Ethereum blockchain, which, according to the most recent estimates, requires more than one terabyte of disc space and may take several days to synchronize. Complete clients facilitate the ability of interconnected nodes to perform every network operation, such as mining, validating transactions and block headers, and executing smart contracts.\n\nLight Client: Ethereum clients are not always required to retain all data; therefore, developers frequently employ \u201clight clients\u201d when data storage and performance are critical. Light clients offer only a fraction of the capabilities of full clients. By virtue of not retaining the complete Ethereum blockchain, light clients are capable of facilitating expedited delivery while simultaneously liberating space for data storage.\n\nThe functionality of a light client is modified to suit the Ethereum client\u2019s requirements. For instance, light clients are extensively implemented in wallets for the purpose of preserving private keys and Ethereum addresses. Moreover, they oversee the broadcasting of transactions and smart contract interactions. In addition to exchange rate data and web3 instances embedded within JavaScript objects, light clients are also advantageous for Dapp browsers.\n\nRemote Client: A light client and a remote client are comparable. A key differentiation lies in the fact that a remote client does not maintain an independent copy of the blockchain or perform transaction or block header validation. In contrast, remote clients are solely dependent on a full or lite client in order to establish communication with the Ethereum blockchain network. The primary function of these clients is to operate as wallets for transaction transmission and reception.\n\nEthereum Node vs Ethereum Client\n\nEthereum Node Ethereum Client A machine running Ethereum client software is referred to as an \u201cEthereum Node\u201d. A client is an Ethereum implementation that validates all transactions in each block, ensuring the network\u2019s security and data accuracy. The three types of Ethereum Nodes are Full, Light, Archive, and Miner Nodes. The three types of Ethereum Clients are Full, Light, and Remote Clients. The Ethereum node operating system allows us to access the internet. The Ethereum client computer allows a user to access the node operating system.\n\nConclusion\n\nDelving into the intricate world of Ethereum nodes and clients reveals the backbone of this groundbreaking blockchain network. Nodes serve as the decentralized pillars, ensuring the network\u2019s resilience, security, and decentralization. On the client side, the diverse array of Ethereum clients, showcases the flexibility and openness of the Ethereum ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve and transition, understanding the nuances of nodes and clients becomes increasingly crucial."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are on the Move Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's finally here. The long-awaited spot Bitcoin (BTC 1.93%) ETF has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with 11 spot exchange-traded products officially getting the nod from regulators, after years of denials and a very hawkish regulatory stance. Since the Winkelvoss twins first proposed a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2013, investors have effectively been waiting for more than a decade for this product to be launched.\n\nBitcoin briefly surged to nearly $49,000 per token following this announcement, the highest level it's seen in almost two years. Ethereum (ETH 1.09%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 5.05%) saw similar spikes this morning, but have since given up some of these gains. As of 1 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is currently trading flat (having seen a big boost in its valuation yesterday prior to this announcement), but Ethereum and Dogecoin are 6.2% and 7.7% higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nLet's dive into what this approval means for Bitcoin and other top-tier cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nWhat does this spot Bitcoin ETF approval mean for the crypto sector?\n\nThe potential impacts of this approval on Bitcoin are notable. A range of estimates for how much capital could flow into these ETFs has been put forward, but Standard Charter believes that number could be as high as $100 billion. That's a tremendous amount of money, and certainly could change the investing landscape for institutional funds looking to diversify their portfolios into these asset classes.\n\nThe SEC's official approval of a swath of ETFs could pave the way for future spot Ethereum exchange-traded products to be launched. That's a key driver of enthusiasm around the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with Dogecoin rallying as it usually does in tandem with the sector, in a familiar higher-volatility fashion today.\n\nThe 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by regulators include: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, iShares Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Franklin Bitcoin ETF, and Hashdex Bitcoin ETF. These funds are now trading, and are seeing mixed performance.\n\nSome of this divergence among Bitcoin exchange-traded funds can be linked to the rather wide range of fees offered by providers. Updated pricing provided by a number of funds ahead of today's approvals show many ETFs dropping fees substantially, to as low as 0.2%. Given the similar nature of each of these funds, that could indicate a race to the bottom in terms of management fees, which is great for investors.\n\nNotably, crypto traders betting against Bitcoin have lost a substantial amount of money in the derivatives market. Estimates suggest closed short positions cost bears around $100 million.\n\nIs now the time to buy a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nThe value these ETFs provide is notable. Bitcoin, as representative of crypto and digital assets as whole, gains legitimacy in the eyes of many investors. Additionally, investors now don't have to go through the trouble of setting up a wallet, researching how blockchain technology works, and jumping through what can be perceived as too many hoops to invest in crypto.\n\nFor institutional investors, these ETFs also provide liquidity, allowing for seamless integration within their portfolios, and allowing for things like model portfolios (which are investment products tailored to specific investors) to include some proportion of crypto. Being able to readily trade Bitcoin on the open markets is a big deal for asset managers, and I think the market is correct to assume this will lead to a tsunami of cash headed into this space.\n\nEthereum's prospects in terms of getting proposed spot ETFs approved may be more murky. Given the incredibly long lag between proposals and approvals for Bitcoin ETFs, these products could still have a ways to go. That said, these approvals do provide a blueprint for regulators looking at spot Ethereum ETFs, and given the SEC's rather favorable stance toward both Bitcoin and Ethereum, one might certainly surmise that the probability of future approvals has increased over the past 24 hours.\n\nAs is the case with many asset classes, investing in ETFs has its pros and cons. For those comfortable with buying Bitcoin directly, saving even 20 basis points each year can add up over the long term. That said, for those seeking simplicity and convenience, these products certainly look more intriguing than involving oneself in the rigmarole around buying and selling Bitcoin on exchanges. Personally, I think a race to the bottom in fees could make Bitcoin ETFs the preferred investing option for most investors, and I think these are certainly worth considering right now."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum is displaying extreme strength against Bitcoin, which suggests the token is extremely bullish in the mid-term\n\nBesides, Bitcoin's dominance experienced a fake-out after a channel breakout, which is an extremely bullish sign for altcoins\n\nThe Ethereum price displayed an epic retest after marking the daily highs above $2600. Besides, the trading volume on the previous trading day was the highest since November 2022, which elevated the levels by more than 10%. While the ETH price is pumping against Bitcoin because of bullish BTC events, it appears that the Ethereum ecosystem is heavily taking off. After marking new highs, there is a huge possibility of a bearish pullback below $2500 before triggering a fresh upswing.\n\nThe ETH price has maintained a decent upswing since the last few days of October, elevating over 70% from the interim lows of around $1522. The recent price action caused the price to pierce through the crucial resistance zone between $2400 and $2500 and closed the previous day\u2019s trade beyond $2600. Moreover, the value sustained above $2600 at press time suggests the bulls have jumped in action, and hence the target at $3000 has now been activated.\n\nAfter consolidating between the $2150 and $2400 price ranges for over a month, the ETH price broke up and reached a high above the $2600 mark. The token is experiencing a minor pullback at the moment, which could be quickly overcome by giant bullish action soon. Being different from the previous price action, the ETH price is expected to hit $2500 any time from now on. The RSI has still not marked highs above the resistance, and the price soared above the crucial resistance, indicating the bullish momentum may prevail for a long time.\n\nThe upward momentum may lift the price beyond the next target at around $2800 in the next few days, but before hitting the milestone at $3000, bulls could lose their momentum. This is when a bearish divergence in RSI will be recorded, which may compel the price to initiate a fresh descending trend. However, the current resistance zone between $2400 & $2500 may act as a strong support base, which may hold and trigger a healthy rebound soon.\n\nTherefore, the next couple of days may be extremely crucial for the Ethereum (ETH) price, as a bullish weekly close may squash the bearish narrative."

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs backed by actual bitcoin finally hit US exchanges on Thursday after more than a decade of attempts. So far it\u2019s done mostly nothing for bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin briefly neared $49,000 after the spot ETFs went live but it has since shed about $3,000 to retrace by 6%.\n\nThat\u2019s even slightly below where it was before the SEC\u2019s social media hacker posted an authorized approval announcement about the ETFs on Tuesday, about 24 hours before legitimate confirmation.\n\nAny boon to the price of bitcoin seems to have come way earlier. Bitcoin traded around $25,000 before BlackRock filed for its spot ETF last June and rallied 20% within days.\n\nWith the post-BlackRock pump, bitcoin had reclaimed its pre-Terra implosion price.\n\nBitcoin would give up those gains in the weeks following. But by mid-October, a fake news tweet claiming the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s bid set bitcoin on a major uptrend.\n\nThere was immediate volatility around the tweet \u2014 climbing $2,000 and down again within 30 minutes \u2014 but bitcoin ended up shooting nearly two-thirds in two months, from $27,700 to $44,000 in December.\n\nAt this rate, ether could soon overtake bitcoin for six-month returns\n\nAbout there it hovered until earlier this week. Analysts, researchers, traders and pundits were generally in consensus that the SEC would indeed approve spot ETFs for launch in the US, and come Monday bitcoin had jumped 8% to clear $47,000 for the first time in almost two years.\n\nAll things considered, the bitcoin spot ETF approval was massively front-run by those trading on the rumor. Anyone who bought bitcoin when word of BlackRock\u2019s filing first broke last year would now be up by more than half.\n\nAnyone who bought bitcoin when the ETFs were officially approved would now be about even and could even be down slightly.\n\nHad they opted for ether, they\u2019d be up to 8% in the green, as traders appear looking to frontrun the next potential wave of crypto spot ETF approvals in the US.\n\nBlackRock and other issuers including Fidelity, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy have filed for a spot ether ETF since lodging their equivalent bitcoin applications. The SEC has between late May and early August to make its first decision.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin and ether diverge after SEC\u2019s bitcoin ETF snafu\n\nIn the meantime, markets seem to be waiting to find out exactly how much bitcoin BlackRock, Fidelity and other ETF issuers actually bought to back their respective funds after a busy day-one session, when more than $4.6 billion in spot ETF shares were traded in the US overall.\n\nIn and outflow figures would be the first indications of investor interest and could shed light on their potential influence on bitcoin prices moving forward.\n\nSome preliminary figures have been floated on social media but analysts warn they may not be totally accurate. Confirmed data is only expected to be completely accurate later in the day, or even early next week.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Are Surging Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The entire crypto world has been shaken, in a positive way, by recent developments around yesterday's approval of certain exchange-traded products. For Bitcoin Cash (BCH -3.65%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -0.50%), and Litecoin (LTC -1.44%), broadly positive sectorwide sentiment appears to be a key driver behind these tokens' impressive moves higher. As of 2 p.m. ET, these three tokens have rocketed 13.9%, 34.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe approvals of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undoubtedly led to significant interest across the cryptocurrency sector today. Much of today's increase can be attributed to expectations that institutional capital will flow into this sector in dramatic fashion. In fact, projections from some analysts peg the impact of these approvals at around $100 billion. That's a win not only for Bitcoin, but for investors considering this entire space, as it legitimizes crypto for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nLet's dive into what's behind the specific moves in these three cryptos today, over and above the obviously bullish headline news dominating the market right now.\n\nWhy are these three tokens surging today?\n\nFor Bitcoin Cash, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system tied closely to Bitcoin, today's news is obviously a net positive for this network. However, there are other key drivers supporting Bitcoin Cash's recent performance. News that cryptocurrency payments have surged to a record high in 2024 is very bullish for the likes of Bitcoin cash and other payments-focused cryptocurrencies. A report on Jan. 10 cited that nearly 1.3 million Bitcoin transactions were reportedly processed in 2023 alone, bringing the total number of Bitcoin transactions to more than 4 million. For those bullish on crypto as a payments facilitation technology, this is a strong catalyst to consider for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nFor Ethereum classic, the proof-of-work fork of the Ethereum blockchain, excitement around the potential approval for spot Ethereum ETF approvals appears to be driving interest in this adjacent token. Essentially, investors and traders appear to be speculating on a potential hard fork for Ethereum Classic, which would better align the network with Ethereum's, and improve its outlook (if Ethereum surges as a result of ETF approvals, one could argue Ethereum Classic could be due for a rally as well). Of course, such a substantial move of more than 30% may be overdone, so this will certainly be a token traders focus in on in the coming days.\n\nLitecoin's more muted rise today appears to be tied more to sector-specific tailwinds than anything else. Largely viewed as a Bitcoin and Ethereum alternative, this is a token that typically rides the tides higher and lower over specific time frames. Right now, there's a rising tide lifting most boats in this sector, and Litecoin investors are certainly pleased to see momentum taking this token higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nIs this momentum sustainable?\n\nUltimately, we'll have to see if these spot ETF approvals are a \"sell the news\" event, or a strong catalyst that puts a floor beneath crypto prices for the foreseeable future. In many respects, we won't know which outcome will materialize until after the fact. Thus, some amount of hesitation may lead to a waiting period for certain long-term investors, and could present an opportunity for buyers considering these tokens to jump in and ride momentum higher over the medium term.\n\nOverall, I think yesterday's spot ETF approvals are a bullish catalyst for the sector. For one, these approvals legitimize crypto as an asset class institutional investors can buy into. Another key factor driving sectorwide interest is the flurry of institutional capital expected for large-cap cryptos. Accordingly, for those seeking exposure to these trends, and looking for less-visible (and potentially higher-upside) ways to play crypto, these three tokens will likely continue to be in focus in the coming weeks."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is set to push through major changes to the account abstraction standard in Ethereum to reduce gas consumption \u2014 particularly for layer 2s.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the Ethereum Foundation shared a preview of the drastic changes to the ERC-4337 standard specification, which deals with account abstraction, also known as smart accounts.\n\nThe new version 0.7 applies learnings from nine months of ERC-4337 being used, according to developer John Rising in an update shared with Cointelegraph.\n\nThe biggest change is in the structure of account abstraction transactions, which are more complex than regular Ether (ETH) transactions. These now require specifying five gas values instead of just one.\n\n\u201cThe user has to specify more than one gas value to account for the fact that an account can do computation while its signature is being checked,\u201d explained Rising.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Rising elaborated on why more gas values were required.\n\n\u201cWith smart accounts, users can have many different types of signatures and pay for gas in many ways. This means that the amount of gas required varies, and the transaction has to specify how much it is willing to spend for this validation.\u201d\n\nThis makes gas estimation more accurate and reduces gas costs, especially on layer-2 networks, since these changes reduce the amount of data that needs to be published.\n\n\u201cThe major benefits of v0.7 for users will be reduced gas fees,\u201d explained Rising, who added, \u201cIt uses some tricks to use transaction data more efficiently, which is particularly helpful on layer-2 blockchains.\u201d\n\nThe new specification will also penalize users 10% for all unused gas in execution, \u201cwhich prevents apps from putting transactions with unnecessarily high gas limits.\u201d\n\nHow account abstraction works. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccount abstraction, also known as smart accounts, builds upon basic Ethereum accounts by allowing accounts to have programmable logic and rules, opening up many new use cases that are impossible with simple accounts today.\n\nEthereum accounts today are somewhat passive and static, but account abstraction allows them to become active and programmable. It was proposed in September 2021 by Vitalik Buterin and other developers in EIP-4337.\n\nRelated: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calls for 33% increase in gas limit\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has not announced an expected date for version v0.7 but said that the security audit is beginning now.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that everything will be finalized by ETHDenver at the end of February,\u201d said Rising.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "content": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin proposes a 33% increase in the gas limit to improve network throughput. This first change in three years aims to balance efficiency and stability, addressing scalability.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently advocated for a significant change in the Ethereum network: a 33% increase in the gas limit, from 30 million to 40 million. This proposal, made during a Reddit Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session organized by the Ethereum Foundation's research team, marks the first suggested change in the gas limit in nearly three years\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nUnderstanding the Gas Limit and Its Impact\n\nThe Ethereum network's gas limit is a crucial parameter, determining the maximum amount of gas that can be used for transactions and smart contracts in each block. Gas, essentially the fee required for transactions or contract executions on Ethereum, is measured in gwei, a fraction of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH)\u200b\u200b.\n\nAn increase in the gas limit is significant because it directly impacts network throughput \u2013 the number of transactions Ethereum can handle. Since the network's inception in 2015, the gas limit has been periodically adjusted to reflect growing usage and adoption. However, the last three years have seen no change, the longest such period in Ethereum's history\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nBalancing Efficiency and Network Stability\n\nButerin's proposal aims to enhance network efficiency by allowing more transactions per block, thereby theoretically increasing the network's overall capacity. However, this comes with the need to balance improved throughput with potential risks, including increased loads on hardware and heightened vulnerability to spam and attacks\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nEthereum's gas fees have seen notable fluctuations, with significant spikes during periods of high demand, such as the inscriptions craze of May 2023, which saw gas fees reaching 150 gwei. The proposed increase is seen as a step towards accommodating growing transaction volumes more efficiently, while also addressing scalability issues that have been a long-standing concern in the crypto community\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nLooking Ahead: Ethereum's Scalability and Future\n\nButerin's suggestion is not just about immediate relief for the network; it also hints at Ethereum's ongoing scalability challenges. The gas limit increase is seen as a temporary measure, pending the full deployment of the Ethereum 2.0 update, which promises significant improvements in network efficiency and scalability\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe decision to increase the gas limit, therefore, stands at a critical juncture for Ethereum, balancing between immediate network demands and long-term strategic goals. It also underscores the continuous evolution and adaptation that blockchains like Ethereum undergo to meet the demands of their growing user base.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAfter the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, the Ethereum based tokens, surged to its highest point since May 2022. This increase is attributed to investor speculation that an Ether (ETH) ETF will soon receive approval from the SEC.\n\nThe Ethereum markets experienced substantial growth during Thursday\u2019s session, driven by strong buying interest. This trend suggests that the broader cryptocurrency market might be on the verge of a more significant movement. ETH Price is expected to gain substantially from this momentum.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024 :\n\nThe renowned cryptocurrency expert Anthony Sano has recently expressed an extremely bullish outlook on Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024. In a detailed analysis, he predicted Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach a staggering $10,000 mark within the year.\n\nHe highlighted the significance of Ethereum\u2019s ability to offer yield through staking, a feature he believes gives it an edge over Bitcoin and makes it particularly attractive to institutions. With the increasing likelihood of an Ethereum ETF launching in mid-2024, he anticipates a surge in institutional interest.\n\nComparing Ethereum\u2019s performance with that of Solana, he pointed out that despite Solana\u2019s significant drop and subsequent recovery, Ethereum has maintained a consistent value over the year.\n\noverall, his predictions for 2024 range from a conservative $6,000 to a staggering $10,000, if the market hype intensify, particularly with the advent of the ETF."

Although the Bitcoin price failed to react positively, it sustained strongly and defended the lower support, suggesting the token is well prepared for the next rally. Besides being the second largest token, Ethereum is also following the star token but displaying more potential and strength, which may even surpass Bitcoin in terms of gains.\n\nSoon after the SEC officially approved all the spot Bitcoin ETF applications, the crypto space, including ETH prices, roared beyond their respective resistances. While a decent pullback was expected, the token managed to sustain above the gains, displaying the dominance of the bulls. Regardless of the mountaineering selling pressure, the token is expected to maintain a healthy upswing and is speculated to rise beyond the pivotal targets.\n\nA popular analyst, Michael van de Poppe, in his recent analysis, has lauded the bullish strength and hence believes the price may make it to $3500 very soon.\n\nIn the above chart, the analyst highlights the price sticking above the levels around $2,140 for quite a long time. As a result, the levels had become a strong support zone but were failing to trigger a healthy upswing towards the next higher target.

The price after breaching the crucial resistance zone is accumulating strength and hence is believed to trigger a fresh upswing towards $2,700 initially, which may pave the way for a major breakout above $3000."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it looks more likely that the regulator will allow spot Ether funds too.\n\nAfter that, asset managers could turn their attention to altcoins like XRP.\n\nHowever, the regulator is unlikely to allow XRP ETFs while it is battling Ripple in court.\n\nNow that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally ended its longstanding resistance to spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), it raises the prospect that it might accept other types of crypto funds too.\n\nSeveral of the asset managers recently granted permission to launch Bitcoin ETFs have already submitted proposals for spot Ether funds. But why stop there? After Ethereum, XRP could emerge as the next crypto ETF frontier.\n\nVanEck CEO Eyes Ripple ETF\n\nIn a recent interview, Valkyrie CIO Steve McClurg suggested that asset managers are eager to branch out into other cryptocurrencies after the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWithout digressing what VanEck planned to do next, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a lot of filings come out for Ethereum. I even think we might see something for Ripple, given the recent progress.\u201d\n\nEchoing McClurg\u2019s comments, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also believes that XRP is the next most likely ETF prospect after Bitcoin and Ether. However, he acknowledged that Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal troubles will probably hold up progress.\n\nXRP Funds Unlikely Until Ripple Lawsuit Concluded\n\nObserving that Ethereum ETFs could be approved in the coming months, Seyffart suggested that the SEC would be unlikely to accept XRP funds while it is in the middle of a court battle with Ripple. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening this year unless the court case is completely done,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, whereas spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs were preceded by funds that invest in crypto futures, there is no equivalent precedent for XRP. Observing that the existence of Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs strengthens the argument for letting funds hold the cryptocurrencies directly, Seyffart noted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have any of that for Ripple.\u201d"

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nOn January 10, 2024, the SEC approved all Bitcoin Spot ETFs. The first regulated spot, Bitcoin Exchange-traded-funds (ETF), was approved by the SEC a few hours after its fake release, causing $300 Million in Bitcoin liquidation within a few hours.\n\nETF Approval, Opens ETH Gateways to $2800!\n\nOn top of this huge development, Ethereum (ETH) is currently exhibiting notable strength, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s performance with an 8% surge, driven by the mounting anticipation surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nNow that the outcome of Bitcoin ETF approvals is out, there is a growing expectation from analysts that Ethereum might experience a similar trend. Numerous institutions have already submitted applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, contributing to a supply shock as funds pour into the Ethereum market in anticipation of a potential ETF launch.\n\nETH\u2019s price action shows a bullish flag pattern due to consolidation between $2200 support and $2400 resistance. Buyer enthusiasm rises as Ethereum breaks out, suggesting a bullish 2024.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the deal? Is this correction a dip you should buy? Will Ethereum go up?\n\nTechnical, On-Chain Metrics Say\u2019s Possible but with a Twist\u2026\n\nTechnically, Ethereum\u2019s price is navigating within an ascending parallel channel, indicating a bullish stance and the possibility of reclaiming the $2,457 range high. This upward momentum could propel ETH towards the $2,800 level, marking a substantial 15% increase from its current levels. In an exceptionally bullish scenario, Ethereum might even reach the $3000, indicating a 25% surge.\n\nSupporting this optimistic outlook are various on-chain metrics. Santiment\u2019s daily active addresses metric reveals a consistent increase in crowd interaction with Ethereum, reflected in the rise of daily active addresses from 387,000 to 413,000 in under a month\u2014a 6.7% growth. Additionally, whale transactions involving transfers of $100,000 and above have experienced a notable uptick, underlining heightened investor interest.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge the potential for correction, especially if bears take control. A downside correction could lead to ETH losing support at $2,388. In a more adverse scenario, a prolonged decline might push the proof-of-stake (PoS) token down to $2,135, signaling a potential shift in the prevailing bullish sentiment if a lower low is established. Overall, Ethereum\u2019s current dynamics are intricately tied to the broader market sentiment and developments surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals."

        "content": "The approval of a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF was supposed to bring billions of dollars into the crypto industry, but in typical fashion, investors bought the rumor and sold the news. As of 2:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, and the selling accelerated early this morning.\n\nEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has rallied the last few days but dropped 3.7% between 10 a.m. ET and 2:30 p.m. ET. Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) plunged 3.9% in just the last few hours as well.\n\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF approval was months in the making, and when these ETFs were announced on Wednesday, Jan. 10, the market started to sell off. A lot of traders had bought in anticipation of the ETFs (buying the rumor) and then began selling when there was no longer a catalyst to count on in the future (sell the news).\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin has been flat in the past week, Ethereum is up 10%, and Dogecoin is down just 0.4%. So there hasn't been a big move if you pull back a bit.\n\nI do think it's notable that Ethereum has gained as much as it has. The speculation trade has likely moved to the second-largest cryptocurrency, which could eventually be a popular ETF asset as well.\n\nTechnology takes it on the chin\n\nCryptocurrency doesn't trade in a vacuum, either. Over the last three years, cryptocurrency has traded with high-growth tech stocks, and they're having a terrible day.\n\nLayoffs at Cloudflare, Alphabet, Discord, and dozens of other companies are calling into question the growth we should expect for 2024. There's still a delayed realization in parts of the tech industry that growth is slowing and costs need to come under control if companies are going to be profitable.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily impact cryptocurrencies directly, but if cryptocurrencies trade with growth tech stocks, it's not surprising to see a sell-off.\n\nWhat we don't know matters most\n\nThe theory of the last few months in cryptocurrencies was that an ETF approval would bring new buyers into the crypto market, bringing billions of dollars with them. But will that be the case?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt seems to me that buying cryptocurrencies is easy enough for anyone who wanted to buy some over the last few years. An ETF may make it easier in some ways, but it also comes with fees that are unnecessary for cryptocurrencies you can hold in self-custody.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies continue to fall as the market realizes that new money isn't coming in as expected following ETF approvals. And there's no increased utilization of the blockchain for innovative purposes if assets are held in an ETF.\n\nThis week has been more volatile than even a normal week in crypto. Don't be surprised if that's the theme for the next few weeks as the market figures out who is buying crypto to hold and who was just speculating on ETF approvals. There may be more speculation going on than investors would like to think.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "content": "What Happened in Crypto Today: Ethereum ETFs To Be Approved by May?\n\nAfter days of volatility and months of uncertainty, the SEC finally approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF. And as K33 Research expected, this long-awaited move did not become a \"sell the news\" event, as much of the leverage had already been shaken out last week.\n\nNow that this regulatory barrier has come down, we look ahead to what other opportunities may open up in crypto. But before we gaze too far into the horizon, let's recap today\u2019s top crypto news stories.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSEC approves first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFund issuers engage in battle royale for BTC ETF market share, slashing fees \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nGensler offers warnings despite approving BTC ETFs \ud83d\udea8\n\nUK central banker criticizes BTC's value and efficiency \ud83d\ude10\n\nEthereum ETF approval odds look good for May \ud83e\udd1e\n\nRipple announces $785M stock buyback plan \ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow let's dive deeper into each of those topics\u2026\n\nBTC Spot ETF Approved fr! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nFirst, the most important news\u2026\n\nIt finally happened - the SEC approved not just one, but ELEVEN spot Bitcoin ETFs!\n\nThis mass greenlighting came on the expected deadline after months of bottled-up anticipation.\n\nFinancial giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and more now have the all-clear for their BTC funds. Even Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust secured conversion authority!\n\nOf course, Gary Gensler couldn't resist throwing some shade amidst his agency's watershed Bitcoin moment. Despite the reversal, he shilled the same old \"illicit activity\" \ud83d\ude44(we will cover this one in detail).\n\nETF approval unlocks billions (or maybe trillions) in fresh institutional capital and mainstream accessibility.\n\nSo is it going to impact BTC\u2019s price eventually? Read the full story!\n\nThe Hunger Games (ETF Edition) \ud83d\udde1\n\nAnd the battle royale begins! After the SEC finally (and reluctantly) approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, fund issuers drew swords to compete over market share.\n\nAnd their chosen weapon? Significant fee cuts to attract capital inflows!\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock led the charge - dropping its ratio to 0.25% after originally demanding a 0.3% fee.\n\nNot to be outdone - ARK Invest, 21Shares, Bitwise and Valkyrie matched with reductions down to 0.2% or lower.\n\nOf course, one player remains the elephant in the room - Grayscale still demands 1.5% with its $28 billion GBTC AUM.\n\nWhat does this fee war indicate? Is it going to help crypto in any way? Read the full story!\n\nGensler\u2019s Warnings Continue \ud83d\udea8\n\nThe chief regulator couldn't resist throwing some shade on the assets underlying these new funds. Gensler emphasized the SEC does NOT endorse Bitcoin itself following approvals. He gave the same old narratives of volatility risks and usage for nefarious exploits. \ud83d\ude44\n\nGens even dragged precious metals like gold and silver to emphasize BTC's inferior industrial utility.\n\nCheck out his entire statement!\n\nAnd while we are at it\u2026\n\nUK Central Banker Criticizes Bitcoin Again \ud83d\ude10\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey also showed his skepticism about Bitcoin this week.\n\nDuring recent UK Parliament hearings, Bailey dragged Bitcoin as an \"inefficient\" payments innovator while doubting its intrinsic value.\n\nEchoing her boss' skepticism, Deputy Governor Breeden also spotlighted crypto's lack of regulatory guardrails as hindering mainstream adoption. But she did acknowledge the landscape is slowly evolving.\n\nThe banking bureaucrats also fretted about stablecoins and their \u201copaque\u201d inner workings. Concerns we've heard ad nauseam at this point.\n\nRead the full story!\n\nEthereum ETF Approval \ud83e\udd1e\n\nAnd something we are looking forward to\u2026\n\nWith Bitcoin's ETF floodgates busting wide open, the expectation now pivots to the impending ETH spot fund verdict!\n\nAnd Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas puts the odds of approval by May at 70%. That's when the SEC deadline hits for multiple Ethereum trust applications.\n\nHe previously said he can't imagine a scenario where BTC gets the green light but not Ethereum. After all - the ETH spot is \"tied to the hip of the Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nSo with OG coin's decade-long issue finally rectified, hopes run high for Ether's emancipation soon after!\n\nEthereum itself felt the warmth of positive sentiment this week. ETH pumped 15% in the last 7 days - piercing above $2.5K resistance as fund approval odds boost bull morale!\n\nIs Ethereum going to enjoy the same price ride as Bitcoin did? Read the full story!\n\nRipple\u2019s Buyback Announcement \ud83d\udcb0\n\nRipple Labs plans to use $285 million to buy back shares from early investors at a $11 billion valuation.\n\nThis liquidity largesse offers investors a chance to offload up to 6% of their holdings. Ripple also pledged an additional $500 million to grease the wheels on payroll tax and RSU conversions.\n\nRather than rushing to IPO, the firm reaffirmed its commitment to supporting native token growth and pursuing regulatory clarity abroad first.\n\nHow is it going to impact XRP? Read the full story!\n\nAnd that wraps up the key crypto news for today.

Bitcoin recorded over US$18.5 million in NFT sales in the past 24 hours, while US$15.8 million worth of Ethereum NFTs changed hands, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which yesterday approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, is expected to make its first decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications by May 23, 2024. Despite the optimism, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous statements suggest a cautious approach to approving crypto asset securities, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nThe price increase reflects a broader market sentiment that an Ethereum ETF could soon follow the path of Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock and Ark having filed applications.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF has sparked discussions about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, a debate that could impact the SEC\u2019s decision-making process."

        "content": "Rep. Mike Collins discloses purchasing up to $65,000 in Ethereum in early 2024, amid market surges and political events. His actions, while legal under the STOCK Act, raise questions about ethical implications and the need for stricter regulations in lawmakers' digital asset investments.\n\nUS Georgia Representative Mike Collins disclosed investments totaling up to $65,000 in Ethereum (ETH) in early 2024. This disclosure, filed on January 9 with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, includes purchases of $15,000 on January 3 and $50,000 on January 8, adding to his total ETH investments of approximately $110,000 since 2023\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nCollins' engagement with Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, aligns with his ongoing investments in digital assets. The STOCK Act, a regulatory framework designed to prevent conflicts of interest, mandates such disclosures by US lawmakers. However, it does not prohibit them from overseeing legislation potentially related to their investments, which has been a point of contention and debate regarding the intersection of personal wealth and public service responsibilities\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe timing of Collins\u2019 investments coincides with a notable surge in Ethereum's price, which experienced an 11% increase in early January 2024. This market behavior is partly attributed to anticipations surrounding the SEC's potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market\u200b\u200b.\n\nThese financial activities occur against a backdrop of significant political events, including the looming possibility of a US government shutdown and the commencement of the 2024 presidential campaign. The intersection of these political dynamics with market movements underscores the complex relationship between governmental actions and financial markets, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrencies\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis development also highlights the broader trend of lawmakers engaging in cryptocurrency investments, reflecting the growing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial practices. However, it raises questions about the need for more stringent regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency and prevent potential conflicts of interest. The ongoing debates in this arena suggest a growing recognition of the unique challenges posed by the intersection of digital assets and political governance.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Fake Airdrop for Ethereum, Solana, Tron Users Carried out by Scammers\n\nHackers target the Ethereum, Solana, and Tron crypto communities by enticing them with a fake airdrop scheme.\n\nWallet drainers, previously fixated on executing crypto scams via EVM chains, have now expanded their horizons to target Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities.\n\nThis shift marks a concerning trend as these scammers venture into well-established crypto groups.\n\nPhishing Scams via Fake Airdrops\n\nThe modus operandi involves enticing crypto enthusiasts through fraudulent airdrops. The scammers create a webpage where users can supposedly claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThese scams are labeled an \"exclusive opportunity\" for the community, urging individuals to link their primary wallets for access. Scam Sniffer highlights that these fraudsters can drain various crypto wallets using this deceptive webpage.\n\nAccording to CoinGape, this development is particularly problematic given the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, alongside Solana and Tron.\n\nThe lure of substantial crypto rewards might mislead investors, potentially resulting in significant losses amounting to millions or even billions in digital assets due to these wallet drainer scams.\n\nIdentifying and Avoiding Crypto Scams\n\nWhile scammers occasionally upgrade their strategies, identifying potential scams can still be achieved through simple checks.\n\nAccording to Blockworks, Scam Sniffer's shared snapshot reveals grammatical errors on the fraudulent airdrop webpage, serving as a red flag for cautious users. However, it's crucial to remain vigilant as scammers adapt and refine their tactics over time.\n\nTo stay secure, always verify the source of such links. If a reputable entity is not the source of the airdrop updates, it is advisable to steer clear of such offerings.\n\nFurthermore, heightened caution is necessary, considering recent incidents where hackers compromised verified X accounts of well-known companies like Certik and Mandiant to promote crypto scams.\n\nEarlier this month, Certik experienced a similar attack on its X account, followed by Mandiant on January 4, 2024, raising concerns about the security of even the most established platforms.\n\nPhoto: Nahel Abdul Hadi / Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s CEO has dropped hints of a finance landscape upheaval as he openly touts Ethereum.\n\nSmart money has discreetly flown towards Ethereum reflecting a growing confidence in its potential.\n\nAnalysts have cautioned against overinterpretation as DeFi volumes have remained modest compared to centralized exchanges.\n\nThe winds of change are sweeping through the digital finance landscape, with whispers of a potential Ethereum revolution spearheaded by none other than BlackRock, the world\u2019s financial behemoth. This shift, hinted at by CEO Larry Fink\u2019s recent remarks, could have profound implications for the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock CEO Sees Ethereum as \u201cStore of Value\u201d\n\nFink, a traditionally conservative figure in the financial world, surprised many with his open support for Ethereum, calling it \u201ca store of value\u201d with significant potential.\n\nThis endorsement, coming from the head of an asset manager with over $10 trillion under its wing, carries immense weight, sending ripples of excitement through the crypto community. This pivot by BlackRock isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum.\n\nIt coincides with the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, a landmark event that signaled increased mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, smart money, the lifeblood of sophisticated investors, has been quietly flowing towards Ethereum in recent weeks, suggesting a growing confidence in its potential.\n\nSmart Money Bets on Ethereum\n\nWhile Fink\u2019s words don\u2019t guarantee immediate action from BlackRock, they do paint a picture of a future where Ethereum plays a central role in institutional investment strategies. This, in turn, could lead to a surge in adoption, solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency and potentially opening the doors for other blockchain technologies to gain wider acceptance.\n\n\n\nHowever, analysts caution against overinterpreting the current trend. Nansen analyst Martin Lee emphasizes that DeFi volumes, where smart money flows are often tracked, are still relatively small compared to centralized exchanges. Large price movements, therefore, may be primarily driven by activity on traditional platforms, which lack the same level of transparency.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, this alone does not guarantee a seamless path for Ethereum.\n\nThough there is a flow of smart money towards Ethereum, the volumes in the decentralized finance sector are still comparatively small.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDespite the need for measured optimism, Fink\u2019s endorsement marks a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency industry. As institutional interest continues to grow, Ethereum\u2019s position as a major player in the digital finance arena seems increasingly secure. Whether this translates into a full-fledged BlackRock-backed ETF remains to be seen.\n\nTo delve deeper into the surge of SHIB and BONE bolstered by Ethereum whale activity, explore the dynamics shaping this rise here:\n\nSHIB, BONE Rise Up, Backed by Soaring Ethereum Whale Activity\n\n\n\nTo explore the surges in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic post-SEC Bitcoin ETF approval, read here:\n\nEthereum, ETC Skyrocket Following SEC\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Approval"

        "content": "A JPMorgan executive suggested on Jan. 12 that securities regulators are equally likely to approve or disapprove a spot Ethereum ETF in the coming months.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a Managing Director for JPMorgan, told The Block:\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, for the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to bitcoin) rather than a security \u2026 This is far from given, and I wouldn\u2019t put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\u201d\n\nHe added that the SEC is \u201cstill signaling that it continues to view all other cryptocurrencies outside bitcoin as securities.\u201d\n\nPanigirtzoglou\u2019s comments allude to a statement from SEC chair Gary Gensler regarding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) approvals on Jan. 11.\n\nThere, Gensler said that the latest approvals concern only ETPs holding Bitcoin (BTC) and identified Bitcoin as a non-security commodity. Gensler added that the approvals should not signal the SEC\u2019s views on the securities status of other crypto assets; he also asserted that the \u201cvast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts\u201d and therefore under federal securities laws.\n\nOther sources predict up to 70% approval odds\n\nDespite Panigirtzoglou\u2019s low approval estimate, some sources place higher odds on an upcoming spot Ethereum ETF approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted a 70% chance of such an approval by May.\n\nOne prediction market on Polymarket suggests that there is a 57% chance of an Ethereum ETF approval by May 31. Those odds are based on over $15,000 worth of cryptocurrency bets rather than any individual\u2019s personal stance.\n\nPredictions largely focus on May because the SEC must decide on a spot Ethereum ETF application from VanEck by May 23. Other applicants including BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, ARK Invest, and Invesco Galaxy have also filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, but with later decision deadlines.\n\nThe SEC approved a number of ETFs that included Ethereum futures in October 2023 but has not yet approved a spot Ethereum ETF."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs finally approved, and the call for spot ETH ETFs rising, Ethereum is now standing at the threshold of a potential surge, with pivotal developments setting the stage for a remarkable bull in January. The imminent activation of the Dencun upgrade, known as the protodanksharding upgrade or EIP-4844, on the Goerli testnet on January 17 is poised to be a game-changer.\n\nEIP-4844: Unleashing Efficiency\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, specifically EIP-4844, aims to cut Layer 2 transaction fees on Ethereum by introducing \u201cdata blobs\u201d \u2013 sizable data pieces linked to Ethereum blocks and rollups. This innovation enhances efficiency and lowers transaction costs within the Layer 2 scaling solution.\n\nBy implementing EIP-4844, Ethereum looks forward to freeing up Ethereum\u2019s processing capacity, streamlining operations, and enabling rollups to handle transactions at a much lower cost.\n\nThe Expected Bullish Storm\n\nEthereum is on a positive trajectory, surging to $2,500 after the SEC approved the Spot Bitcoin ETF. Keeping steady above key levels like the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at $2,231 and $1,959, analysts now set their sights on a promising target: the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,004.\n\nAs Ethereum gears up with the Dencun upgrade, the optimistic market sentiment following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF has made investors eagerly wait for a potential 50% surge within reach in January."

        "title": "Top 9 Blockchain Platforms to Consider in 2024 - TechTarget",
        "content": "Interest in blockchain platforms has been growing significantly as a way to streamline supply chains, improve traceability, simplify trade and improve financial transactions. A lot of this interest started with the speculative frenzy surrounding Bitcoin, which is based on an older blockchain platform that faces challenges with energy consumption and speed.\n\nModern blockchain platforms have been developed to help overcome these limitations and provide practical value for other business uses and applications. \"We are seeing multiple enterprises adopt blockchain platforms for some of their application needs,\" said Suseel Menon, practice director at Everest Group, an IT advisory firm.\n\nMenon has seen the most interest in areas that require multiparty cooperation or data exchange. Blockchain applications in supply chain tracking, trade finance, digital assets and identity management are going beyond the pilot stage. Menon has also seen a fair bit of activity in using blockchain platforms for building certain functions of ERP, such as vendor management and supply chain management (SCM).\n\nAlex-Paul Manders, a partner at Information Services Group, an IT advisory firm, said the evolution of blockchain platforms to date has promoted heightened awareness of decentralized finance, or DeFi, for driving new business models that pose significant threats to traditional banking, finance and supply chain finance.\n\nAlex-Paul Manders Alex-Paul Manders\n\nManders predicted that blockchain platforms could disrupt legacy supply chain businesses and technology processes. For example, U.S. requirements for pharmaceutical companies to track and trace products and materials call for a new approach for supply chain participants to share and transact data more efficiently and with more transparency than previously required. Blockchain technology could be the answer.\n\nAccording to Menon, the top three blockchain frameworks for these use cases are R3 Corda, Hyperledger and Ethereum, with EOSIO and ConsenSys Quorum gaining ground.\n\nHere are nine of the top blockchain platforms to consider.\n\n1. Ethereum Introduced in 2013, Ethereum is one of the oldest and most established blockchain platforms. It provides a truly decentralized blockchain that is comparable to the Bitcoin blockchain network. Manders said its key strength is that it enables true decentralization with support for smart contracts. Its key weaknesses include slow processing times and higher transaction processing costs compared to other platforms. Besides its role as a blockchain platform that underpins enterprise applications, it has its own cryptocurrency called Ether. Suseel Menon Suseel Menon The Ethereum platform has seen widespread adoption by technologists who build decentralized applications, or dApps, on the Ethereum network. For example, there are numerous platforms and exchanges for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) -- a type of digital asset that can be exchanged on a blockchain. It has a mature ecosystem of tools for writing smart contracts using the Solidity programming environment, which runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. However, alternative blockchain networks can process transactions much faster at potentially lower cost than Ethereum, though many observers expect this to change after Ethereum adopts a more efficient security mechanism. It also has an active developer community orchestrated by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which has more than 250 members, including Intel, JPMorgan and Microsoft. The Ethereum community migrated from a proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof of stake (PoS), which is more energy-friendly. The migration required an elaborate process to spin up a separate, new type of blockchain called a Beacon Chain that has been merged into the existing main Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation estimated this reduces energy use by 99.95% compared to the older approach. The community was previously considering sharding, which involved splitting up the Ethereum blockchain to expand the capacity to store data, scale throughput and cut network fees. However, new techniques for combining transactions to be processed together, called layer 2 rollups, evolved faster than expected, and sharding was dropped from the roadmap. Now the community is focusing on a simpler approach, called Proto-Danksharding, which streamlines layer 2 rollups. The goal is to eventually support up to 100,000 transactions per second using this new approach. There are many things to consider when choosing a blockchain platform, including performance and cost.\n\n2. IBM Blockchain IBM Blockchain is a private, decentralized blockchain network that has been the most successful with enterprise clients who are less risk-averse, Manders said. He has seen the biggest opportunities in using it to link into enterprise cloud and legacy technologies more seamlessly than is possible in other decentralized networks. The IBM Blockchain developer tool was designed to be flexible, functional and customizable. IBM has also invested in creating a user-friendly interface to simplify critical tasks, such as setting up, testing and rapidly deploying smart contracts. Rakesh Mohan, IBM director of development, blockchain, said the company has seen significant progress in financial services and banking, as well as supply chain. Rakesh Mohan Rakesh Mohan Some examples of successful blockchain apps include IBM Food Trust, which has completed more than 18 million transactions representing more than 17,000 products, and Blockchain Community Initiative in Thailand, which supports services such as payment obligations and enterprise auctions for 22 Thai banks. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply is designed to help enterprises improve traceability in supply chain management. Top features support quality assurance for validating the provenance of materials, improved forecasting and tools to reduce the cost of dispute resolution, product recalls and document sharing. Various tools help manufacturing, retail, pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies jump-start their blockchain rollout.\n\n3. Hyperledger Fabric Hyperledger Fabric is a set of tools for creating blockchain applications. Championed by the Linux Foundation, it was built from the ground up with enterprise distributed ledger uses in mind. It has a rich ecosystem of components that can be plugged into a modular architecture. It works well in closed blockchain deployments, which can improve security and speed. It also supports an open smart contract model that can support various data models, such as account and unspent transaction output (UTXO) models. Hyperledger Fabric can also improve data privacy by isolating transactions in channels or enabling the sharing of private data on a need-to-know basis in private data collections. It also enables high-speed transactions with low latency of finality and confirmation, according to its proponents. It is supported by leading cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, IBM, Google, Microsoft Azure and Oracle. Arnaud Le Hors, senior technical staff member of open technologies at IBM, said the latest developments add support for an organization to join a channel without copying the whole history of the ledger. This enables a quicker startup process with less storage required. There is an active and diverse community around Hyperledger Fabric that is working on adding more features related to consensus algorithms, additional privacy options for GDPR compliance and operational improvements. Key features to consider Blockchain platforms consist of a wide range of components, which enables enterprises to select the appropriate components for different kinds of capabilities, said Chris Georgen, founder and managing director at Topl, which built a blockchain for sustainability. Chris Georgen Chris Georgen Georgen recommended examining four features when evaluating platforms: Whether a platform is open (public) or closed (private) and how that affects speed and security. Anyone can join a public blockchain, which can make it easier to set up for small businesses. The downside is open blockchains aren't as fast. Many blockchain codebases can be modified to be either open or closed. Consensus mechanism, such as PoW, PoS or Byzantine fault tolerance. PoW is the older mechanism used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The others are newer and less proven but faster and more efficient, Georgen said. Ledger technology and how it records transactions. Popular approaches include an account model and UTXO. An account model records the balance, whereas UTXO is analogous to cash with serial numbers. The account model is used in Ethereum, Stellar, Tron and EOSIO. IBM Blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth use UTXO. Smart contract functions for capturing business logic on the blockchain. Popular programming languages include Ethereum Solidity, WebAssembly languages and Digital Asset Modeling Language.\n\n4. Hyperledger Sawtooth Another open source blockchain initiative hosted by Hyperledger and the Linux Foundation is Hyperledger Sawtooth. One of its key advantages is that it allows enterprises to choose from several consensus mechanisms for different use cases. One novel consensus mechanism called proof of elapsed time can integrate with hardware-based security technologies to enable \"trusted execution environments\" of program code to run in secure enclaves, which are protected areas of computer memory. It also supports practical Byzantine fault tolerance which can allow nodes to reach consensus if hackers or other bad actors compromise some nodes. Sawtooth Raft uses a leader-based consensus algorithm that provides crash tolerance for a private and controlled group of users. Shawn Amundson Shawn Amundson Shawn Amundson, principal consultant at Bitwise IO, said the most common applications are for developing supply chain systems and customizing Sawtooth for specific purposes, such as novel consensus algorithms. A Sawtooth library enables developers of custom distributed ledgers to pick and choose which pieces of Sawtooth they use in their application. Sawtooth also supports Splinter for networking, which provides dynamic private circuits (groups of nodes); Hyperledger Transact for transaction processing to enhance smart contract capabilities; and Augrim for consensus, which expands the number of supported algorithms.\n\n5. R3 Corda There is some debate whether R3 Corda is technically a blockchain or an alternative type of distributed ledger. It uses a novel consensus mechanism in which transactions are cryptographically linked but does not periodically batch multiple transactions into a block. Even the official Corda site describes it as \"both a blockchain and not a blockchain.\" One of the key benefits of this approach is that all transactions are processed in real time, which can improve performance compared to other types of blockchains. The R3 consortium has a strong following in the financial industry, since Corda provides an attractive approach for financial transactions and smart contracts with strong security. Leading proponents include Bank of America, HSBC, Intel and Microsoft. It supports tools that automate business logic that can execute across company boundaries. In 2022, the group launched a technical preview of Corda Payments, which it claimed will simplify the process for building distributed payment capabilities into apps. A recent platform update purportedly improves availability and scalability and supports interoperability with other platforms. One key innovation is a delivery-versus-payment mechanism designed to improve settlement with other distributed ledger platforms. Manders said Corda has a strong chance of becoming the de facto network of insurance-related transaction processing. However, it faces competition from other federated blockchain networks that can process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\n6. Tezos In development since 2014, Tezos is an older platform that supports decentralized applications, smart contracts and novel financial instruments, such as NFTs, which can be thought of as a modern variation on trading cards that are tied to digital assets. The platform supports a dynamically upgradable protocol and modular software clients that enable it to adapt to new uses. It supports a PoS consensus mechanism that improves efficiency compared to Bitcoin and the original Ethereum implementation. An on-chain upgrade mechanism allows developers to add new features without forking, which would require spinning up a new blockchain and migrating users over. The Tezos community has been upgrading the platform at a rapid clip with enhancements that improved performance and increased the size limit on smart contracts. It has also developed tools to help automate the process of weaving NFTs into enterprise supply chains. The latest update proposal, called the Oxford 2 protocol, promises several new enhancements. An improved PoS mechanism creates new roles for nodes. The update also reintroduces a new version of timelocks (which was previously removed), to improve security and smart rollups to speed up the transaction rate.\n\n7. EOSIO The EOSIO blockchain platform was first launched as an open source project in 2018. It's optimized for developing decentralized applications and smart contracts. It uses a complex consensus mechanism based on PoS that provides better performance than older mechanisms, such as Ethereum, according to its proponents. It also includes support for a governance feature for voting on changes to the platform. Key strengths include fast transactions and advanced account permission features for deploying applications. Over 400 applications have been developed on the platform, including identity management, SCM and gaming. The community also provides tools for customizing blockchain implementations for various decentralized use cases in SCM, healthcare and DeFi. EOSIO-Taurus, a new blockchain released in June, was forked from the EOSIO codebase and is designed for enterprise performance on private blockchains. It includes features to handle a larger volume of transactions more securely and to improve resilience, automatic failover and disaster recovery. In addition, it could make it easier to connect the blockchain to external systems. New debugging tools are meant to improve smart contract development.\n\n8. Stellar Stellar is a newer blockchain platform optimized for various kinds of DeFi applications. It uses Stellar Consensus Protocol, which purportedly can speed up the time required to process and finalize transactions on a public blockchain network. It also includes security mechanisms for shutting out bad or questionable actors in a financial transaction. It has been adopted by several companies for international trade and exchanging money across borders. Examples of applications built on the Stellar blockchain include MoneyGram for money transfer, Circle for payments and treasury infrastructure, and Flutterwave for integrating payment processing into enterprise applications. The Soroban smart contract platform helps streamline development of Web 3.0 and DeFi applications on Stellar."

        "content": "Ethereum developers, node operators and users have yet to agree on Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent suggestion to increase the gas limit on Ethereum.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Buterin advocated for a \u201cmodest\u201d 33% gas limit increase to potentially improve network throughput.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit to the proposed 40 million from the current 30 million would allow more transactions for each block, theoretically increasing the overall throughput and capacity of the network, he argued.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks, according to Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden, who aired his concerns in a Jan. 11 blog post titled \u201cWhy increasing the gas limit is difficult.\u201d\n\nThe primary concern would be the increase in the size of the blockchain state, which contains account balances and smart contract data.\n\nThe total space needed right now is roughly 267 gigabytes (GB) only for the state, he said, adding, \u201cIf we increase the gas limit, this size will grow even quicker.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain full history data size is currently around 900GB, according to Blockchair.\n\nWijden argued that storage is cheap, so size is not the issue, and everyone will be able to store that amount of data, \u201chowever, accessing and modifying it will become slower and slower,\u201d before adding there are \u201cno concrete solutions yet for state growth.\u201d\n\nMoreover, higher limits also raise synchronization times and make building diverse clients harder, he added.\n\nI wrote down some of my thoughts on raising the gas limit today: https://t.co/gX0eihUyYa\n\n\n\n(Haven't proof-read it, so if you find a mistake, you can keep it) \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 11, 2024\n\nGnosis co-founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann also aired concerns, stating there would also be an increase in bandwidth should the gas limit be raised.\n\nEthereum team lead P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi was another who echoed concerns about increasing gas limits.\n\n\u201cIncreasing it definitely has a downside.

        "content": "In the weekly chart analysis, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has shown a departure from the lower high formation that characterized the previous bearish trend until 2022. After a year-long consolidation range throughout 2023, ETC struggled to surpass the resistance at $23.\n\nA recent resurgence, however, has resulted in a bullish breakout from the consolidation range, signaling a notable trend reversal for Ethereum Classic. This breakout is seen as a significant entry point for traders on the sidelines.\n\nThe heightened market activity has contributed to a remarkable 250% increase in the 24-hour trading volume, supporting the sharp upward movement and hinting at the potential continuation of an uptrend. Currently trading at $28.43, Ethereum Classic has formed a bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart.\n\nThe breakthrough above the $25 barrier positions Ethereum Classic for a sustained bullish rally. The rising sentiment in the market is fostering increased risk appetite among investors, contributing to the broader uptrend in the altcoin market.\n\nUnder favorable market conditions, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price trajectory may lead to a breakout beyond multiple resistance levels, with a potential target of $40 on the horizon. However, should ETC struggle to maintain its momentum, a retest of the $25 level could be in the cards. Traders and investors are closely monitoring market dynamics to gauge the sustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s current bullish momentum."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory Wednesday, clocking a 10% gain in 24 hours to breach past the vaunted $2,600 mark. Market watchers attribute this surge to a confluence of factors, primarily fueled by anticipation of a forthcoming Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the wake of the expected approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nIn a historic move that cryptocurrency aficionados hope will bring more individual and institutional investors into the market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds on Thursday.\n\nEthereum ETF Buzz Sparks Strategic Moves\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable trend towards frontrunning the ether ETF,\u201d noted Alex Onufriychuk, CEO of Kaminari, in a Telegram message. This sentiment aligns with the prevailing belief that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, would be the next candidate for an ETF after Bitcoin.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, a prominent investor, dubbed a \u201cwhale\u201d in the crypto universe, made a strategic move by transferring 9,705 ETH (nearly $23 million) from Binance to Compound. This was followed by a 12 million Tether (USDT) loan, seemingly used to further accumulate ETH. The whale subsequently executed three profitable ETH transactions, netting roughly $5 million.\n\nThis decisive action signaled two things: confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future and the potential for profit-taking, which could introduce short-term volatility. Despite the risk, the whale\u2019s activity bolstered positive market sentiment.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,607.8 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nFurther validating this optimism, Ethereum\u2019s network metrics experienced a surge. Both network growth and token velocity saw increases, indicating heightened interest from new addresses and more token movement. These on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nETH Futures Surge Amid ETF Optimism\n\nAlso adding to the bullish case, Open Interest for ETH futures contracts jumped 15% in recent days, reaching $4.57 billion at the time of writing. This signifies more traders entering the market and anticipating significant price gains following a potential ETF approval.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nAccording to reports, crypto traders expect Ethereum\u2019s price to rise after a favorable ETF judgment, even though Bitcoin is getting more attention in the media. If this situation plays out, the price of ETH could soon go beyond $2,600.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and unforeseen factors could still impact prices.\n\nThe timeline for an Ethereum ETF approval is uncertain, and regulatory hurdles could create delays. Additionally, broader market conditions and news on Ethereum development could also play a role.\n\nInvestors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, particularly in the dynamic and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatured image from Medium\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly reached $47,000 in a subdued ascent following the approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of Bitcoin ETFs directly investing in the token. Traders are now monitoring the products to assess their financial impact. While Bitcoin gains stay limited, Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins have registered maximum gains after the ETF approval.\n\nEthereum Investors Cheer the ETF approval\n\nSoon after the news of Bitcoin ETF approval, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by a staggering shooting past $2,600 levels. Several market analysts have already predicted that ETH is likely to outperform BTC in Q1 2024.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs Ether experienced a notable surge, its positive momentum extended to other cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem. Tokens affiliated with Polygon observed a 13% increase, Chainlink saw an 11% advance, and Uniswap registered an impressive 14% surge.\n\nThe speculation around a Bitcoin ETF becoming a reality has prompted a shift in trader focus towards Ether, anticipating the next narrative of an Ethereum ETF. Conor Ryder, Head of Research at stablecoin company Ethena Labs, notes that with Ether appearing relatively inexpensive compared to most other tokens, traders are strategically positioning themselves in anticipation of developments in the Ethereum space.\n\nLooking ahead, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is slated to make decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications starting in May. Major players such as BlackRock, Invesco, Ark, VanEck, and Grayscale, seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF, are among the firms awaiting approval. Speaking to CNBC, Ryder added:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about getting ahead of the narratives \u2014 bitcoin has rallied versus ether for the last six months thanks to spot ETF speculation, and ETF approval ties a bow on that narrative. Meanwhile ETH has struggled to find any momentum and has underperformed compared to most of the smaller Layer 1s,\u201d or blockchain networks, like Solana and Cardano\u201d.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, ETH has experienced a surge of over 10%, contrasting with a general decline in Ethereum NFTs. Notably, Moonbirds has witnessed a drop exceeding 23%, marking its first instance below 1 ETH in history. Additionally, MAYC has seen a decrease of more than 6%, with approximately 290 MAYC currently in Blend liquidation auction status.\n\nAltcoins Join the Party\n\nApart from Ethereum, other altcoins like Cardano have also joined the party. The Cardano (ADA) price is up 12.48% and is currently trading at $0.58 with a market cap of $20.5 billion. As per the breakout on the technical chart, the ADA price can rally all the way to $1 this year.\n\nAt the same time, the Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) prices are also up by 11.47% and 14.6% respectively."

This surge not only surpasses the performance of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also positions Ethereum Classic as the top performer among the 100 leading cryptocurrencies by market cap presently.\n\nRemarkable Rally of Ethereum Classic\n\nWhile Bitcoin recorded a modest 1% increase and Ethereum observed a substantial rise of over 9% in the last 24 hours, ETC\u2019s surge has garnered significant attention. This noteworthy upward movement in price has elevated ETC to a prominent position. It has further established it as the leading performer among the top 100.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing, triggered by the announcement of a Bitcoin ETF, has propelled its value beyond the $26 mark for the first time since October 2022. The accompanying surge in trading volume indicates considerable interest from major traders.\n\nAlso Read: Robinhood CEO Announces Plan to List Bitcoin ETF Soon\n\nSustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s Momentum\n\nThe crucial question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether ETC can maintain its impressive momentum. According to Changelly, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, ETC is anticipated to stay in positive territory over the next few days. The altcoin is predicted to reach as high as $22.59 on Saturday, Jan. 12, following a 5% daily surge. The average anticipated percentage surge for Ethereum Classic in the upcoming days ranges between 3-5%.\n\nSurging Trading Volumes and Neutral Market Sentiment\n\nIn tandem with Ethereum Classic\u2019s surge, there has been a significant spike in trading volumes. It escalated by 234% within a single day and reached a total of $1.54 billion. Despite these substantial movements in price and volume, the overall sentiment surrounding the Ethereum Classic remains neutral. This was indicated by on-chain data provided by Santiment.\n\nInvestor Watch: Monitoring Ethereum Classic Market Developments\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring the developments in the Ethereum Classic market. This is especially true in the aftermath of recent Bitcoin-related news that has stirred the cryptocurrency landscape. As Ethereum Classic continues to defy market expectations, its impressive surge and heightened trading volumes have captured the attention of enthusiasts.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Breaches $2,400 While BTC Bleeds, Will ETH Hit $3,000 Soon?\n\nThe recent 34% surge of Ethereum Classic serves as a testament to the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Investors are advised to remain vigilant, stay informed about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, and closely monitor any subsequent news that may impact Ethereum Classic\u2019s trajectory."

        "content": "Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently made a bullish prediction for the Ethereum price against Bitcoin in the near future, noting the path for this to happen. According to a social media post by the analyst, price action on the ETH/BTC pair for the next months will center around spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a rotation into ETH also in the prediction.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Prediction of 100% Ethereum Price Rise Against Bitcoin\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently took to X to share a chart of Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) on the weekly timeframe. Price action on the chart forms green (bullish) candles during periods of Ethereum\u2019s performance over Bitcoin, while red (bearish) candles are formed during periods of Ethereum\u2019s underperformance against Bitcoin.\n\nTaking a look at the chart shared by Van De Poppe shows that Ethereum\u2019s performance on the ETH/BTC pair has been on a decline since the middle of 2022. This decline particularly increased during the last quarter of 2023, as the enthusiasm regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs led to a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Consequently, the analyst noted that Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin is now around the 2022 low of 0.04922.\n\nAccording to Van De Poppe, the approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to the creation of another liquidation candle on ETH/BTC to eventually take the liquidity around the 2022 low. This would eventually lead to a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair would be propelled to a target just above 0.12 by the rotation, signifying an increase of more than 100%. Notably, the last time ETH reached this level on the ETH/BTC pair was during the crypto\u2019s first major bull run in 2018.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there.

However, the price of Bitcoin has stalled and is now trading at $45,839, about where it was when the news of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs came out.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum rose over $2,500 to reach $2,600, its highest point since April 2022. Ethereum has maintained this gain to outperform Bitcoin and is trading at $2,618 at the time of writing.\n\nAccording to another post on social media by Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe price action since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the rotation is already happening on the ETH/BTC pair.\n\n\u201cThe rotation game is happening already,\u201d he stated, adding a $3,500 price target for ETH.\n\nThe rotation game is happening already.

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Countdown: Analysts Optimistic on Potential Approval This Year - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "The SEC faces deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 7 to make decisions on Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with expectations as analysts predict a high likelihood of the approval of Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the coming months.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Confidence and Comparisons with Bitcoin\n\nEric Balchunas, a notable ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has expressed optimism, estimating a 70% chance of approving an Ethereum spot ETF by May. This potential approval could have huge implications for the crypto market, as Ethereum continues gaining attention from institutional and retail investors.\n\nBalchunas draws parallels between Ethereum and Bitcoin, stating that he couldn\u2019t envision a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved while spot Ether ETFs are not. He emphasized the interconnected nature of the two cryptocurrencies, noting that \u201cEther spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot\u201d.\n\nBalchunas, who has reportedly heard positive signals through informal channels, believes that spot Ethereum ETFs \u201cwill be fine\u201d. Balchunas\u2019 70% probability is worth taking note off. This is because the approval odds issued on spot Bitcoin ETFs last year turned out positive.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, Digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare expressed confidence in the eventual approval of Ethereum spot ETFs this year. However, he adds a cautious note, suggesting that the approval process may take longer than expected. Carlasare believes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working to establish a precedent that allows it to exercise discretion in determining which digital asset ETFs can enter the market, discouraging a flood of applications for various tokens.\n\nCarlasare anticipates that spot Ethereum ETFs might not commence trading until the third quarter of 2024, contrasting with the optimism of some applicants like Hashdex, which hints at potential trading as early as the second quarter. Notably, the timing of the launch remains uncertain, even though the approval odds are relatively high.\n\nJames Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, supports the case for spot ETH ETF approvals, pointing out that the SEC implicitly accepted Ether as a commodity when approving Ether futures ETFs in September. The analyst believes this prior acceptance could pave the way for spot Ether ETFs to gain regulatory approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Application Deadlines\n\nMultiple asset managers, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK), VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe SEC faces deadlines ranging from May 23 to August 7 to make decisions on these applications. If the SEC approves one, it may potentially approve all, similar to the approach taken with spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMeanwhile, the anticipation of Ethereum ETF approval is already influencing the market. Following the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs, ETH experienced a surge of 7.92% in the past 24 hours, with a notable 17% rally over the past week according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest also rose by 11.52% to $7.81 billion, signaling increased trading activity and a bullish sentiment."

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nThe US Securities Commission (SEC) has announced the approval of the Bitcoin-ETP. The initial fake announcement of this created a spike in volatility. This is a stark reminder of how short-term traders are vulnerable to volatility from the news.\n\nBitcoin soared to $48K before returning below $45K. Technically, these moves fit into a trend formed back in late October last year and gained new momentum after December's sideways consolidation. It's worth preparing for a scenario where altcoins, currently appearing undervalued compared to the leading cryptocurrency, start taking centre stage. But that doesn't negate the potential for BTCUSD to reach $50-51K before a significant correction.\n\nEthereum is obviously attracting the attention of speculators, adding over 13% in less than 36 hours, as it is the next favourite for ETP approval. Potentially, these expectations could drive the price of ETH up in the next couple of months all the way to the $3500 area \u2013 the peak in April 2022.\n\nNews background\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, traders lost nearly $1 billion due to a fake tweet about ETF approval. According to Bitfinex, the liquidation of positions in the futures market was the largest since August 2023.\n\nAbout a dozen fund companies in Hong Kong are exploring the possibility of launching spot bitcoin ETFs, HashKey reported. Potential issuers include firms with Chinese capital, as well as from other Asian and European countries.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling book \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\", suggested the price of the first cryptocurrency to rise to the $150K level after the ETF was approved. According to him, he will \"buy more gold, silver and bitcoin with fake dollars\"."

Following the ground-breaking move, the leading digital asset soared to a new yearly high at $47,598, later witnessing a slight market correction to hover above the $46,000 mark.\n\nMeanwhile, the second largest digital asset Ethereum (ETH) embarked on a parabolic 10.2% bull run and also claimed a brand new yearly high at $2,651.44. Ether scored a whopping $53,084,197,769 in trading volume over the past 24 hours, while the open interest in the asset rose by 15% this week.\n\nETH\u2019s Proof Of Work sibling Ethereum Classic (ETC) emerged as the day\u2019s top gainer, as most altcoins are enjoying a double-digit upswing following the bullish news from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The #24 spotted ETC soared by 48.7% to trade at $31.65, according to CoinGecko.\n\nETC has been trading in a downward parallel channel for most of December 2023 and dropped below $20 briefly at the beginning of the New Year. Today, while dwelling around the earlier $28 confluent resistance line, ETC finally broke through the barrier to confirm the price trend reversal.\n\nTrader Measures Ethereum Classic\u2019s Potential To Triple Digits\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is a Proof of Work (PoW) fork of the original Ethereum (ETH). While the latter switched to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, miners on the network were expected to flock to ETC to mine cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the transition took some time, as the blockchain analysis platform Santiment reported that ETC breached $1.23 billion in trading volume on January 10, 2024, for the first time since September 13, 2022.\n\nProfessional crypto trader Javon Marks describes the latest Ethereum Classic\u2019s price movement as \u201cdisplaying major strength towards $127.65,\u201d basing this target on the fact that ETC\u2019s price is still 81% down from its all-time high set at $167.09 over two years ago.\n\nIf the ongoing bullish trend persists, Marks sees potential for an \u201cadditional 380% upside.\u201d Standing at a $4,511,651,295 market cap, ETC added approximately 1.5 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\n$ETC (#EthereumClassic) TAKES OFF, displaying MAJOR STRENGTH towards the $127.65 and we can still be EARLY in this run!\n\n\n\nAs prices continue to hold broken out, this target remains in play, meaning an additional +380% upside can be on the way to reach it\u2026 https://t.co/W4auGOq4MA pic.twitter.com/qRyiqbOSqu \u2014 JAVON\u26a1\ufe0fMARKS (@JavonTM1) January 10, 2024\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn a bearish scenario, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) would be heading to retest the $23 resistance, a barrier that has been historically hard to break.\n\nETC\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) turned to an overbought condition, as the RSI metric is approaching 80 on both daily and weekly charts.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAs the inaugural Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) gained approval, the cryptosphere got a long-awaited entrance to the traditional financial market.\n\nDelve into DailyCoin\u2019s latest cryptocurrency news:\n\nNASDAQ, NYSE, Cboe Gear Up to Offer Approved Bitcoin ETFs\n\nOnly 6% of Funding Goes to Female-Led Blockchain Startups"

Source: Coingecko\n\nEthereum Classic Surge: A Combination Of Factors\n\nETF-fueled optimism: The approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF signifies increased institutional interest in the crypto market, a development that traditionally benefits the entire ecosystem, including altcoins like ETC. This optimism is reflected in the strong performance of other major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum witnessing a 10% climb and briefly hitting a 20-month high above $2,600.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s unique appeal: Compared to its Ethereum counterpart, Ethereum Classic boasts a smaller market cap and lower transaction fees, potentially making it a more attractive option for traders seeking higher returns and cheaper on-chain activity. Its recent network upgrades have also bolstered confidence in its technological capabilities.\n\nSpillover effect and community hype: The Bitcoin ETF approval has undoubtedly fueled a general sense of bullishness across the crypto landscape, influencing investor sentiment towards altcoins with perceived potential. Additionally, the strong community support and active development around Ethereum Classic further contribute to its upward momentum.\n\nETC market cap currently at $4.248 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nETC Trading Volume Soars\n\nThe surge isn\u2019t just limited to price. Ethereum Classic\u2019s trading volume has also soared by a staggering 276% in the past 24 hours, reaching a volume of $1.8 billion.\n\nThis increase in trading activity further validates the market\u2019s interest in Ethereum Classic and potentially indicates continued upward pressure on its price.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains highly volatile. While the Bitcoin spot ETF approval and Ethereum Classic\u2019s recent performance are positive indicators, investors should conduct thorough research and consider both the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions.\n\nWith its strong community, technological advancements, and now, the tailwinds of the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum Classic has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the current altcoin rally.\n\nWhether it can sustain its momentum and break through the $30 barrier remains to be seen, but its recent performance signals a renewed level of enthusiasm for this resilient blockchain project.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe market has already observed a rise in ETH price following the SEC\u2019s green light for a spot Bitcoin ETF, leading analysts to predict a similar approval for an Ethereum ETF. Nonetheless, the SEC\u2019s perspective of Bitcoin as a \u2018non-security commodity\u2019 was a key factor in approving Bitcoin ETFs, a situation that might differ for Ethereum. However, with the backing of BlackRock\u2019s CEO for an Ethereum ETF, there\u2019s a possibility that the SEC\u2019s view on Ethereum as either a security or a commodity could change, following market sentiment.\n\nSupport From Larry Fink Boosts ETH Price\n\nLarry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), backed the notion of an ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) a day after the much-anticipated bitcoin (BTC) ETF went live. \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\u201d Fink said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. \u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going.\u201d\n\nTokenization refers to the process of representing assets, whether they are physical or digital, as tokens on a blockchain. Fink is of the opinion that tokenization has the potential to address issues associated with money laundering and various forms of corruption.\n\nThe $9 trillion asset management firm appears to be considering the listing of a similar product for Ethereum\u2019s native token, aligning with its progressive move towards tokenization. Additionally, Fink mentioned that he views cryptocurrency not as a currency, but rather as an asset class. He specifically highlighted bitcoin, describing it as \u201can asset class that protects you\u201d in the face of geopolitical risks.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. Unlike gold, we\u2019re almost at the ceiling of the amount of bitcoin that can be created.\u201d\n\nFollowing support from BlackRock, the ETHBTC ratio skyrocketed toward its October high, currently trading at 0.06039.\n\nSEC\u2019s Potential View On Ethereum ETF\n\nThe SEC has postponed its decision on an Ethereum ETF, requiring over 45 days to review a rule change proposal that would enable Grayscale to transform its Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. The extended deadline is now set for January 25, 2024. Additionally, the SEC has delayed its decision on the Ethereum ETF proposed by crypto asset management firm Hashdex, as revealed in a separate document.\n\nYet, there\u2019s an ongoing debate over whether Ethereum should be classified as a security or a commodity for ETF approval purposes. The SEC\u2019s previous approval of Ethereum futures ETFs in October signaled an implicit recognition of ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as a commodity, as per a Bloomberg analyst.\n\nThe October 2023 approval of ether futures ETFs and recent spot Bitcoin ETF launch suggests that we can expect further applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, potentially as early as later this year. However, if the SEC were to classify ether as a security, it is quite likely that legal challenges would arise concerning this designation."

He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nContrary to predictions that Bitcoin\u2019s price would quickly exceed $48,000 and settle around $50,000 following SEC\u2019s approval on spot ETF, the pump is yet to occur. Meanwhile, the altcoin market has seen a notable rise, with leading altcoins showing an average growth of 10%-20%. In addition, Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed its $2,500 resistance mark, reaching close to $2,700, with XRP and SOL prices set to capitalize on the current momentum.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Recent Failure Induced An Altcoin Pump\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s decision on the spot ETF application, which did not have the expected impact on BTC\u2019s short-term targets, the altcoin market witnessed a surge in buying interest. ETH investors grew more confident about the possibility of a spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nAdditionally, investors are looking forward to a potential XRP ETF, which may materialize in the coming years, given the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. Furthermore, the recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF is expected to inject billions of dollars into the market, significantly increasing the DeFi market cap and potentially leading to further gains in Solana\u2019s price.\n\nIn the past few hours, the altcoin season index has seen a remarkable exponential increase, rising from a low of 56 to reach 67. It\u2019s worth highlighting that should this metric exceed 75, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. In such a scenario, many investors may shift their focus to altcoins if Bitcoin fails to show any promising trends.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nXRP is currently facing a decline following Bitcoin\u2019s rejection at $49K. However, the downtrend might not intensify as the market holds bullish momentum. As of writing, XRP price trades at $0.598, surging over 6.7% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nCurrently, the 100-day EMA is holding buying confidence and the RSI is trading below the overbought region, suggesting an advantage for the bulls. In the coming days, we might see a bullish attempt to break the crucial resistance at $0.66, pushing XRP\u2019s price above $0.74.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther experienced a significant surge from its 20-day EMA, reflecting strong buying interest at lower prices. However, this upward momentum faced a rejection soon as the price reversed from $2,700, suggesting bearish dominance near that level. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,585, surging over 6.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nShould the price remain stable above $2,500, it would signal a continuation of the upward trend. In this scenario, the ETH price may retest $2,700, followed by a potential climb to the significant $3,000 mark.\n\nSolana Price Analysis\n\nSolana price is hovering within a descending channel pattern as it continues to struggle near the resistance line at $107. However, bulls are defending the SOL price above moving averages. Currently, Solana is trading at $99.3, surging over 4.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe EMA lines are showing a leveling trend, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trading close to the midpoint. This reflects a state of equilibrium between the supply and demand. If SOL breaks the current momentum above the channel\u2019s resistance line, we might see a surge toward $120."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is up 9%, outpacing Bitcoin despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum break past $2,600\n\nWith the SEC approving 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market promptly shifted its focus to Ethereum.\n\nIn November 2023, BlackRock and Fidelity filed applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.

        "title": "Here Are Five Ethereum Rivals Under $5 Set for Breakouts in 2024 - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Many tokens under $5 have experienced significant growth in functionality and adoption, setting the stage to potentially rival Ethereum\u2019s longstanding position as the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nETH may have become expensive and out of reach for many. The Crypto Basic examines more affordable coins believed to be poised for a significant uptrend in the emerging bull market of 2024.\n\nXRP\n\nThe fourth-largest altcoin, XRP, is the leading asset below $5, widely expected to engineer a significant uptrend in the coming bull season.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP\u2019s blockchain XRP Ledger (XRPL) boasts a suite of utilities for both the crypto and traditional financial landscape. XRPL has garnered support from enterprise companies with over a decade of error-free operation.\n\nDevelopers utilize XRPL to pioneer blockchain projects and applications across various use cases. This includes online gaming, asset tokenization, custody, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe Crypto Basic has recently uncovered that over 1,500 projects are operating on XRPL. Moreover, Japan\u2019s financial giant SBI commenced using XRP to facilitate cross-border payment among Asian countries in September 2023.\n\nConsidering XRP\u2019s growing prominence within the financial landscape, experts foresee the potential for XRP to reach double-digit or even triple-digit valuations in the coming years.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt press time, XRP trades at $0.5956, with a 3% gain over the past week.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nThe Charles Hoskinson-led $20 billion valued crypto Cardano (ADA) is another low-priced token with potential in the unfolding bull market. Like XRP, ADA is among the top ten most valuable tokens, trailing Ethereum.\n\nCardano serves various practical purposes, with agricultural companies utilizing it to trace fresh produce from cultivation to consumption.\n\nAdditionally, the platform facilitates storing educational credentials in a tamper-proof manner and empowers retailers to combat counterfeit goods effectively.\n\nWhile ADA trades at $0.5796, influential figures in the community anticipate the asset reaching $10 in this market cycle. The basis for this optimistic target lies in ADA\u2019s previous performance, having reached $3 in the last bull cycle without smart contracts or functional DEXs.\n\nWith the current presence of various utilities on Cardano, community members set their sights on the $10 mark.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC token is an eight-billion-dollar crypto project with a market value of around $0.9144. The Polygon network has evolved into a robust Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\nIt addresses challenges such as high gas fees and network congestion. Reportedly, it has a capacity of processing 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, with a block confirmation time of less than two seconds.\n\nNotably, Polygon wields the backing of established players in the crypto market, such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nIn 2024, several factors, particularly its scaling capabilities, are poised to drive explosive growth for Polygon. Besides, its team disclosed a new road map last year, which includes rebranding MATIC to POL token.\n\nTron (TRX)\n\nTron (TRX) ranks as the 12th most prominent crypto, with a valuation exceeding $9.4 billion. The Tron blockchain boasts diverse applications featuring smart contracts and stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Defillama data, Tron stands as the second-largest network for facilitating stablecoin transactions, trailing only Ethereum.\n\nNote that the market share of stablecoin is $133.84 billion at the time of reporting. Tron commands a substantial 37.46% share in this domain, while the BNB Chain, the subsequent contender, holds a smaller share at 3.2%.\n\nNotably, Tron\u2019s native asset, TRX, trades at $0.1073 at the time of writing.\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nAlso, Algorand has risen as a blockchain platform that delivers security, scalability, and decentralization. The emphasis on speed and efficiency has become a defining characteristic of Algorand, making it an attractive choice for developers.\n\nAccording to reports, the Algorand mainnet demonstrated its capability to process nearly 1 million daily transactions as of three years ago. ALGO trades at $0.1997, ranking among the top 50 most valuable cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nNuggetRush presale in progress.\n\n$2,130 and $2,500 are two key price levels for Ethereum\n\nSolana developers ranged between $2,500 and $3,000, on average, every month in 2023.\n\nCryptocurrency prices are rising as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NuggetRush (NUGX) gain momentum. An analyst predicts that Ethereum could reach new highs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Solana and NuggetRush ecosystems are expanding due to their features.\n\nExploring NuggetRush\n\nNUGX is a cryptocurrency token associated with a play-to-earn game, NuggetRush.\n\nIn the game, users can earn rewards like cash and gold. The project aims to support artisanal miners in developing countries.\n\nThe NuggetRush ecosystem allows players to own mining facilities, build character NFTs, stake them to earn returns, and access other NFT rewards. Players can also stake NUGX.\n\nYou might also like: Analyst highlights key signal for XRP; NuggetRush and Beam start strongly in 2024\n\nAdditionally, NuggetRush does not charge taxes on token sales, which keeps transaction fees low for investors.\n\nThe NUGX token is currently in the fourth phase of its presale.\n\nAnalysts have observed the token price increase from $0.010 to $0.015, a 50% rise.\n\nSome forecast further price appreciation to $0.020.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Crypto Tony believes Ethereum is poised for a bullish run if it can maintain its price above the $2,130 support level.\n\nIf Ethereum successfully crosses the $2,500 resistance level, the bullish momentum could intensify, further boosting positive sentiment in the Ethereum market.\n\nYou might also like: Celsius pays over $90m to Coinbase and FalconX via unstaked Ethereum\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading above $2,300.\n\nIn the past week, its price has fluctuated between $2,184.62 and $2,434.45.\n\nSolana ecosystem expanding\n\nA recent study by the Solana Foundation found that its has over 2,500 monthly active developers.\n\nIn addition, developer retention on Solana has increased by 50% over the past three months.\n\nThis growth is likely due to the increasing activity on Solana and rising SOL prices.\n\nIn December, Solana briefly surpassed BNB to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAt the time, its price reached a yearly high of $125.\n\nHowever, SOL has retraced.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, it was the fifth-largest project by market capitalization.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nCurrently, Ethereum, Solana, and NuggetRush are bullish. NuggetRush is launching a new gaming platform that makes NUGX central. This prioritization might support prices.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has sparked optimism among ether traders, who are hoping for a spot ether product as well.\n\nBlackRock has already filed a prospectus for its iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot ether exchange-traded fund, with the SEC.\n\nThe potential approval of an ether ETF could increase investment and interest in Ethereum-based projects and layer 2 networks, leading to more innovation and growth within the ecosystem.\n\nThe historic U.S. approval of spot bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETF) on Wednesday has buoyed ether [ETH] traders, who are betting the token that powers the Ethereum network could be next in line.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped\n\n\n\nMay 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nThe ETH price has jumped 10% in 24 hours, while bitcoin added 1.3%. Tokens of layer 2 networks, which operate as individual blockchains but are ultimately built atop Ethereum, surged as well. Arbitrum\u2019s ARB and Mantle\u2019s MNT both gained more than 20%. Other Ethereum ecosystem tokens, ranging from meme coins to those that power Ethereum-based applications, rose 14% on average, the category tracked by CoinGecko shows .\n\n\u201cThe largest smart money inflows\u201d were directed toward the Ethereum ecosystem in the past 24 hours, Nansen analyst Martin Lee said in a Telegram message. Nansen defines smart money as wallets that trade or invest in a way that is considered experienced or well informed and are usually profitable.\n\nThe process for a spot ether ETF has already started. Ark 21Shares and VanEck, both sponsors of approved bitcoin ETFs, filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in September. And BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and also a bitcoin ETF sponsor, filed an S-1 prospectus for its iShares Ethereum Trust in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome traders told CoinDesk that an ether ETF could bolster the growth of Ethereum-based financial applications, whose use cases range from on-chain trading and lending to issuance of real-world assets, or tokenization, on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cA potential approval of an ether ETF could further legitimize Ethereum's standing in the mainstream financial world, leading to increased investment and interest in Ethereum-based projects and layer 2 networks,\u201d said RJ Ke, a researcher at Ethereum rollup service Taiko. \u201cThe anticipation could foster more innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\u201d\n\nBets on Ethereum-based tokens may spark a reversal of fortunes for ETH investors, which underperformed bitcoin in 2023. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, climbed more than 150% last year while ether, the No. 2, added about 90%.\n\n\u201cThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has opened the door for other cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Lucy Hu, a senior analyst at Metalpha, in an email. \u201cThe market is now paying close attention to Ethereum ETF applications ... As the ETH spot ETF deadline is coming close, we believe more institutional investors will allocate more ETH in their portfolios this year to capture more returns.\u201d"

        "content": "Best Crypto to Buy Today January 11 \u2013 Ethereum Classic, SUI, Mantle\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC), with its price surge of over 50% for the past 4 days, is leading the charge and establishing itself as one of the best cryptos to buy today against the backdrop of the SEC\u2019s nod to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSUI Network and Mantle are also seeing notable gains, while fresh crypto presale opportunities like Bitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token are also catching the eye of market watchers.\n\nBest Crypto to Buy Now in the News\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) token has surged over 50% over the past few days, rising as one of the top performers amid recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis impressive rally has outpaced the gains seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same timeframe.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #EthereumClassic has blasted off following the #BitcoinETF announcement, reaching above $26 for the first time since October, 2022. Trading volume has surged, indicating major trader interest. However, $ETC sentiment still appears neutral for now. https://t.co/LhebnauCQX pic.twitter.com/wEf3ujmqH6 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 11, 2024\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s rise comes after the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe boom has also coincided with a 403.44% explosion in ETC\u2019s trading volume, signaling heightened market interest.\n\nBeyond Ethereum Classic, SUI Network\u2019s token has climbed 28% to reach $1.0788 as of writing.\n\nSUI\u2019s price has been volatile over the past week, with an overall upward trend. Market indicators show strong support levels for SUI, with predictions of continued volatility in the short term.\n\nRecent SUI developments like the Karrier One partnership to integrate telecom services with web3 technology, along with BitMateX launching the SUI public chain, highlight its growing presence across the tech industry.\n\nScaling to new levels, Mantle (MNT) registered an all-time high of $0.8508 earlier today.\n\nSince then, the MNT price has retraced slightly to the current level of $0.8102, though it remains up 4.53% so far today.\n\nWith its daily trading volume approaching $550 million and a market cap of approximately $2.53 billion, Mantle has a positive forecast assisted by the surging interest in Ethereum and Layer 2 protocols.\n\nAs established cryptos like ETC, SUI, and MNT mark their territory, presales for newer cryptos like Bitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token also offer opportunities for early adopters.\n\nThese up-and-coming crypto ventures are generating interest given their potential in the evolving crypto space.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s impressive performance, the dynamic price action of SUI, and Mantle crossing new milestones are capturing investor and trader attention today.\n\nAlong with rising interest in new presale opportunities, these developments are shaping the narrative around the best crypto to buy today.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Price Shows Potential for Further Climb\n\nAfter posting strong gains for the past few days, Ethereum Classic (ETC) saw its price surge to new multi-year highs earlier today amidst heavy trading volumes.\n\nWith the ETC price challenging key resistance levels, technical indicators suggest the bullish momentum may continue in the days ahead.\n\nThe 20-day EMA for the ETC price currently stands at $22.13, trading above the 50-day EMA of $20.93.\n\nThis bullish alignment is viewed as a strongly bullish signal by technicians, signaling improving momentum in the ETC price.\n\nThe RSI jumped to 76.40, up from yesterday\u2019s 70.92 reading. This shows the ETC price is in overbought territory, but still has room to climb before becoming extremely overheated.\n\nThe MACD histogram rose to 0.64, building on yesterday\u2019s 0.21 value. This indicates a building bullish sentiment that could propel the ETC price higher.\n\nWith the ETC price up 10.94% so far today and trading at $29.30, it is challenging multiple layers of resistance at $26.54 to $27.24, $28.93 to $29.48, and $30.36 to $30.95.\n\nIn particular, watch for a decisive breakout above the $28.93 to $29.48 zone, which aligns with the Fib 0.236 level at $29.17. That could signal a sustained move above the key $30 level.\n\nOn the downside, initial support lies at $22.42 to $23.32. However, given today\u2019s strength, the ETC price may find support at $26.54 to $27.24, near the Fib 0.382 level of $27.23, on any pullbacks.\n\nWith ETC shrugging off overbought conditions, the technical picture remains strongly bullish.\n\nA push above $30 could open the door for further gains, while dips remain buying opportunities. Traders may look to ride the upward momentum while managing risk accordingly.\n\nSui Network (SUI) Price Surges Over 32%: Technical Analysis Points to Bullish Breakout\n\nThe SUI price has seen a dramatic surge in the past 24 hours, with the token rallying over 32% to currently trade around $1.1189.\n\nThis marks a decisive breakout for Sui Network after two weeks of rangebound consolidation between $0.7562 and $0.9422.\n\nThe technical indicators reflect this renewed bullish momentum, with the 20-day EMA at $0.8348 remaining above the 50-day EMA of $0.7394 \u2013 maintaining the bullish alignment that has been in place despite recent consolidation.\n\nThe RSI has also spiked to overbought territory at 70.57, surging from yesterday\u2019s 55.42 reading. This indicates the growing upside momentum behind the SUI price.\n\nMost notably, the MACD histogram has formed a bullish crossover, rising to 0.0097 compared to yesterday\u2019s -0.0075 value.\n\nThis occurrence shows shifting sentiment and further upside potential for the SUI price.\n\nWith its breakout, Sui Network now faces multiple layers of overhead resistance between $1.0611 and $1.2449 as it looks to sustain gains above the psychological $1 mark.\n\nImmediate support lies at the 20-day EMA of $0.8348 and the Fib 0.236 level of $0.8112.\n\nAs long as Sui Network can close today\u2019s trading session above the breakout point of $0.9081, this former resistance would flip to support and give bulls more confidence moving forward.\n\nHowever, failure to hold these levels could lead to a pullback towards the 20-day EMA.\n\nTraders should watch upcoming price action closely to see if Sui Network can continue its uptrend.\n\nPushing through the layered resistance would expose the blue sky upside, while rejection could lead to a rotation lower.\n\nAdhering to defined risk management will remain key amidst the volatility.\n\nMNT Price Hits All-Time High and Retraces: Technical Analysis for Potential Opportunities\n\nAfter reaching a new all-time high of $0.8508 earlier today, the MNT price has retraced to current levels of $0.7990 but remains up 3.20% so far today.\n\nWith the price in overbought RSI territory, waiting for a potential pullback and base formation with stability could be prudent before considering fresh positions.\n\nThe MNT price continues trending above its 20-day EMA of $0.6470 and 50-day EMA of $0.5952.\n\nThe widening gap between these short and long-term moving averages paints a bullish picture.\n\nHowever, the overextended 100-day EMA at $0.5462 highlights the potential for mean reversion.\n\nAt 75.03, the RSI is already in overbought territory above 70. This signals that rally exhaustion is likely forthcoming.\n\nThe expanding positive MACD histogram now reads 0.0137, up from 0.0066 yesterday, reflecting accelerating bullish momentum that may prove unsustainable.\n\nWith the MNT price consolidating below its new all-time high, traders are eyeing whether this marks a top or temporary pause before continuation.\n\nCrucial resistance exists around $0.8508, while initial support holds at the Fib 0.236 level of $0.7879. A break below the Fib 0.382 level at $0.7491 could open the door for a steeper pullback.\n\nMonitoring price action around these technical levels may offer clues regarding MNT\u2019s next directional move. While the uptrend remains intact above the 20 and 50-day EMA dynamic support, overextended indicators warrant caution.\n\nWith market leaders topping new highs, the search is on for promising upstarts before they hit exchanges. Presales for Bitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token give forward-looking investors a chance to buy early.\n\nTheir pioneering advancements could make them smart additions alongside stalwarts like ETC, SUI, and MNT.\n\nExploring New Horizons: Bitcoin Alternatives Worth Checking Out\n\n\n\nAs 2024 unfolds, the focus within the cryptocurrency market is broadening with investors expanding beyond Bitcoin, eager to uncover cryptocurrencies that could spearhead the next surge in industry growth.\n\nThese up-and-coming options are becoming popular as potential Bitcoin alternatives, presenting new opportunities for investors looking to broaden their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token are at the forefront of this trend.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming popular among those searching for the best crypto to buy today.\n\nTheir potential as Bitcoin alternatives is generating interest from forward-thinking investors.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to play a key role in the cryptocurrency domain, the interest in new, promising options is undeniable.\n\nFor investors seeking to broaden their portfolios, exploring these new cryptocurrencies represents a strategic move towards growth and diversification.\n\nSimplify Mining, Amplify Profits: Bitcoin Minetrix Is One of the Best Crypto to Buy Today\n\nThe ongoing presale for Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $8.2 million so far as cryptocurrency enthusiasts invest in the project\u2019s tokens ahead of its full launch.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix looks to improve cloud mining through its stake-to-mine technology that allows token holders to passively earn Bitcoin without expensive hardware or technical expertise.\n\nStage 19 of #BitcoinMinetrix has begun! \ud83d\ude80 What improvements or innovations would you like to see in the field of #Bitcoin mining? \ud83d\udca1 pic.twitter.com/O3Je0vfLGF \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) January 11, 2024\n\nThe presale\u2019s surging popularity signals strong confidence in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nThe project streamlines cloud mining through an intuitive platform designed for mainstream accessibility.\n\nBy staking BTXMTX tokens, users gain computing power to mine Bitcoin on their behalf.

        "content": "Influential whales showed keen interest in Ethereum and accumulated large amounts of ETH.\n\nEthereum experienced a large price surge, coupled with increased network growth.\n\nAmid prevailing uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, Ethereum [ETH] became the focus of significant attention from influential whales.\n\nWhale move in\n\nInsights from Lookonchain shed light on a substantial whale transaction. This whale withdrew a considerable 9,705 ETH ($22.9M) from Binance [BNB], subsequently depositing the funds into Compound.\n\nIn a strategic move, the whale borrowed 12M Tether [USDT] to further accumulate ETH. The trading activity involved three ETH transactions, two of which resulted in profits, accumulating roughly $5M.\n\nThe whale\u2019s decisive actions introduce a spectrum of implications for ETH. On one hand, the substantial investment signals a level of confidence in ETH\u2019s future potential, bolstering positive sentiment within the market.\n\nConversely, the increased incentive for profit-taking introduced an element of risk, potentially impacting short-term price stability.\n\nAnalyzing ETH\u2019s price movement\n\nAs of the latest data, ETH was trading at $2,415.34, reflecting a positive growth of 5.07% in the last 24 hours. Crucially, metrics such as network growth and velocity experienced a surge.\n\nThis indicated heightened interest from new addresses and an increase in token movements, collectively contributing to a positive outlook for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nThe MVRV ratio, a metric gauging the profitability of ETH addresses, expanded in tandem with the recent surge in price.\n\nWhile this points to increased profitability for ETH holders, it also raises the specter of potential sell-offs, which could exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nCounterbalancing this, the rising long/short ratio, indicative of a prevalence of long-term addresses over short-term ones, suggests a greater inclination toward holding rather than selling.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nA holistic view of Ethereum\u2019s network revealed consistent gas usage, a critical metric for measuring transaction activity. However, a concerning decline in NFT trades on the network raises questions about overall network vitality.\n\nThe reduced engagement with NFT transactions may signify a shift in user preferences or potential challenges faced by the NFT sector within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Analyst Says ETH ETFs are Coming in 2024 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nThe Ethereum price has surged by 10% in the past 24 hours, rising to $2,656 on the day after the SEC approved its first ever batch of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet ETH seems to be doing better than most coins today, with its 24-hour gain surpassing the 6% rise the market as a whole has made in the past day.\n\nIt\u2019s now up by 19% in a week and by 98% in a year, with experts now suggesting that the altcoin is the next in line to have spot-based ETFs approved for it in the US.\n\nAnd given ETH\u2019s already-strong fundamentals, 2024 could end up being a very big year for the coin.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Analyst Says ETH ETFs are Coming in 2024 \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\n\n\nETH is clearly in the middle of a breakout at the moment, with its price shooting well beyond its 30-day average and likely to break its current resistance level (red).\n\nIt will therefore come as little surprise to see that the coin\u2019s relative strength index (purple) has just topped 70, signalling very strong momentum while also leaving room for further gains before we enter overbought territory.\n\nLikewise, the 30-day is now rising more steeply beyond the 200-day average, providing another clear sign that ETH is seeing lots of buying pressure.\n\nIf this weren\u2019t already clear enough, the coin\u2019s trading volume \u2013 at around $53 billion \u2013 also provides a very strong indicator that ETH has likely begun a bull phase.\n\nIt actually seems that, after buying up Bitcoin (BTC) over the past few weeks, whales have now turned to Ethereum, with data showing some very aggressive accumulating at the moment.\n\nAfter the spot #Bitcoin ETF was approved, this whale continued to borrow $WBTC and exchange it for $ETH. This whale borrowed a total of 621 $WBTC($28.95M) and exchanged it for 11,663 $ETH at a rate of 0.05327. The whale is long the ETH/BTC trading pair!https://t.co/4uE6Lhgjzx pic.twitter.com/4x93OmYRHL \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 11, 2024\n\nIndeed, some analysts now predict that it\u2019s only a matter of months before Ethereum benefits from the approval of its own spot-based ETFs in the US.\n\nFor instance, analyst Will Clemente noted yesterday on X that May 23 is the final deadline for the proposed VanEck Ethereum-based ETF.\n\nAs with the now-approved batch of BTC ETFs, these and other ETH ETFs could do wonders for the Ethereum price in the next few months.\n\nAnd when combined with Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals as a layer-one blockchain, the launch of such funds could enable ETH to rise to new heights this year.\n\nAs such, now may be the last time to buy ETH this year before it gets too pricey.\n\nEmerging High Potential Altcoins\n\n\n\nFor those who may worry that ETH is heating up too much, there are other promising alts in the market that also have the potential to rally big in the next few weeks.\n\nThis includes Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $8 million in its soon-to-ending presale.\n\nOne of the most interesting new projects in crypto, Bitcoin Minetrix will enable users to mine BTC by staking the platform\u2019s native token, BTCMTX.\n\nUsers who stake BTCMTX will receive tokenized mining credits in return, which they can then spend to pay for Bitcoin mining to take place on their behalf.\n\nOn top of this, staking will also earn them a steady income in the form of BTCMTX, making Bitcoin Minetrix potentially one of the most profitable tokens to hold this year.\n\nThe presale has just entered its nineteenth stage, with investors able to join by going to the official Bitcoin Minetrix website.\n\nAdvantages of #BitcoinMinetrix: Convenient accessibility.

        "content": "Manta Network\u2019s Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchain Exceeds $900M in TVL\n\nManta Pacific, the native Layer 2 modular blockchain of Manta Network, has witnessed a massive increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) over the last quarter.\n\nLaunched just under four months ago, in October 2023, Manta Pacific\u2019s TVL started at a modest $10 million.\n\nHowever, it has now surged past $900 million, solidifying its position as one of the fastest-growing Layer 2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe explosive growth in TVL can be attributed to Manta Network\u2019s strategic initiative known as the \u201cNew Paradigm\u201d campaign, which saw a staggering $850 million bridged within a mere three weeks.\n\nThis influx of funds has also resulted in a substantial increase in user engagement, with over 540,000 active wallet addresses, 8.2 million total transactions with an average of 140,000 daily transactions.\n\nManta Network Resumes Work on Modular Blockchains\n\nManta Network has been gaining significant attention recently due to its efforts in the realm of modular blockchains.\n\nNotably, it became the first Ethereum Layer 2 solution to integrate Celestia\u2019s modular data availability (DA) model, an emerging industry standard.\n\nThis integration has led to an 80% reduction in costs for both developers and end users when compared to other Layer 2 solutions.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market anticipates the onset of a new bull market phase, the factors that will drive user adoption are bound to be the most cost-effective and user-friendly Layer 2 solutions that can effectively scale Ethereum.\n\n\u201cNew Paradigm captured the attention of a large community due to Manta Pacific being the only live modular Layer 2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins,\u201d Kenny Li, co-founder, COO, and core contributor at Manta Network, told Cryptonews:\n\n\u201cThis has propelled Pacific into becoming the third-largest ecosystem with over $900 million in TVL, following Arbitrum and Optimism. With this achievement comes the responsibility to continue building momentum and delivering value to our users and developers.\u201d\n\nProjects on Manta Pacific Continue to Gain Traction\n\nLi also highlighted the remarkable progress of projects within the Manta Pacific ecosystem, such as LayerBank, Shoebill, QuickSwap, and Aperture Finance.\n\nThese projects have seen their STONE and wUSDM lending pools surpass the $500 million supply mark.\n\nManta Network aims to encourage more DeFi projects to deploy on Manta Pacific, enabling them to experience similar levels of success.\n\nFurthermore, the Manta Pacific roadmap includes the implementation of zkEVM via Polygon CDK and a continuous effort to reduce gas fees through its integration with Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\n\u201cThis makes Manta Pacific a preferable choice for projects that want to offer great experiences to their users and we are already seeing an influx of projects wanting to deploy immediately.\u201d\n\nAs reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now has a market share of 49.17% among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share."
