        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Remained Institutional Safe Havens Amid 2022 Chaos: Report - Milk Road",
        "content": "Leading crypto exchange Bybit has analyzed trader behavior during the wild market swings since 2022. Their asset allocation research explores how different groups shifted holdings across coins, stablecoins, and alt tokens as prices whipsawed.\n\nWith crypto buffeted by crises like Terra\u2019s collapse and FTX\u2019s implosion, traders employed strategies aligning risk profiles and sentiment. However, significant differences emerged between institutions, wealthy individuals, and retail investors.\n\nKey Takeaways from Bybit\u2019s Asset Allocation Analysis report:\n\nInstitutions kept half in Bitcoin and Ethereum combined.\n\nRetail piled into stablecoins, while institutions redeployed them.\n\nBitcoin holdings diverged greatly between groups in September.\n\nEthereum interest waned after an initial spike around the Merge.\n\nAltcoin exposure steadily declined as institutions avoided risks.\n\nInstitutional Players Take Advantage of Chaos\n\nBybit\u2019s data underscores retail traders\u2019 vulnerability in markets increasingly driven by big money. Institutions stuck firmly to blue-chip crypto assets, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as extreme volatility ravaged many altcoins and tokens.\n\nAccording to the report, 45% of institutional traders\u2019 crypto holdings sat in stablecoins as a tempering influence on volatility. Nevertheless, they readily redeployed some of that buffer into what they viewed as relatively safe havens like Bitcoin and Ethereum during periods of optimism.\n\nThis ability to rapidly shift allocation allowed institutions to capitalize on temporary upswings and market green shoots while protecting capital from flash crashes.\n\nIn contrast, retail investors consistently held higher stablecoin levels, with most of their non-stablecoin allocation locked in more speculative plays.\n\nInstitutional investors spiked Bitcoin exposure in September\n\nFor example, when looking at the percentage of their portfolios held in actual Bitcoin, institutions and wealthy traders spiked exposure in September as sentiment improved temporarily.\n\nBut at the same time, retail barely nudged above year-to-date lows in BTC allocation hit during the summer doldrums. Institutions rapidly capitalized on periodic market optimism, while retail traders suffered forced liquidations.\n\nInstitutional investors kept 50% combined in Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAccording to Bybit, outside the 45% stablecoin allocation, institutions kept 50% combined in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBybit also noted plunging interest in altcoins around Ethereum\u2019s major Merge upgrade. Institutions barely nibbled other tokens despite occasional retail trader surges.\n\nEthereum holdings have dropped since Shapella\n\nEarlier this year, the percentage of ETH holdings increased in anticipation of Shapella. However, despite Ether maintaining a stable price after Shapella in April and May, the rate has declined across most traders. An unusual surge in the holding percentage of institutional investment in Ethereum has been observed since September.\n\nNature of stablecoin holdings\n\nHistorical patterns indicate that during bullish markets, retail traders tend to reduce their stablecoin holding percentage. Conversely, in directionless or bear markets, they tend to increase it.\n\nIn contrast, INS holders display a decrease in stablecoin percentage during bearish markets and an increase in bullish markets, suggesting adept market timing by institutional investors.\n\nSeptember witnessed a notable drop in stablecoin holding percentages, coinciding with a significant rise in BTC and ETH holding percentages.\n\nThe report comes at a time when Bitcoin and Ethereum are surging in value in comparison to the past 18\u201319 months. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin is up by 144% year-to-date and 19.7% in the last 30 days. BTC briefly surpassed the $42,000 level before falling to its current price of $41,508.\n\nEthereum is not far behind, as it has surged by 76.2% year-to-date. ETH is up by 21.3% in the last 30 days and has breached the $2,200 level after quite some ups and downs. However, it remains uncertain as to whether this is the beginning of another bull market or just any other sell-the-news event in anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF."

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nIf, as Yakovenko believes, Ethereum can one day house all of Solana\u2019s data, what would be the point in doing so?\n\nFrom DeFi to NFTs and beyond, the notion that Ethereum is here to stay has been vital for its success. Other blockchains may be more efficient, but none can compete with Ethereum\u2019s network effect and expected staying power. Embracing Ethereum interoperability could therefore help Solana and others like it endure too.\n\nBenefits Of Interoperability\n\nWith Solana\u2019s founder even abandoning the Ethereum killer myth, Solana-Ethereum interoperability holds enormous promise for Web3 builders and developers.\n\nAlready, new platforms like NeonEVM are realizing the kind of \u201coverlapping features\u201d described by Yakovenko. Launched this year to bring Solana\u2019s superior processing power to Ethereum smart contracts, for decentralized app (dApp) developers, NeonEVM promises the best of both worlds.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f NEW WEBINAR ALERT \u26a1\ufe0f In this episode we take a deep dive into blockchain interoperability \u2013 and who else better to discuss this topic with than our friends at @deBridgeFinance !

        "content": "Ethereum price jumped above the $2,100 level and cleared $2,200. ETH is gaining pace and might surge further above the $2,220 level.\n\nEthereum is showing a lot of positive signs and recently cleared the $2,200 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $2,190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its rally if it clears the $2,220 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 5%\n\nEthereum price remained well-bid after it settled above the $2,000 level. ETH gained bullish momentum and cleared the $2,120 resistance. The bulls even pumped it above the $2,200 level, like Bitcoin above $40,000.\n\nA new multi-month high was formed near $2,229 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,147 swing low to the $2,229 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $2,190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,220 zone.\n\nThe first key resistance is near the $2,250 level. The next resistance sits at $2,320. A clear move above the $2,320 level could send the price toward the $2,450 resistance zone.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance is near $2,500, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,650 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,800 level.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,220 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,190 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $2,165 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,147 swing low to the $2,229 high. The main support is now near $2,120. A downside break below $2,120 might start a steady decline.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Weekend - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a weekend it has been in the crypto world. Three of the world's largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC 1.36%), Ethereum (ETH 0.93%), and Dogecoin (DOGE 4.39%), have seen impressive rallies, with a few key psychological thresholds broken through. As of noon ET, these three tokens are up 5.8%, 6.4% and 6.4%, respectively, since Friday at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nGiven the rapidly changing economic backdrop and volatility we've seen in everything from bond yields (discount rates) to alternative asset prices, it's wroth diving into what's catalyzing these moves today.\n\nWhat's driving this rally?\n\nBitcoin's rally to more than $42,000 per token in early trading this morning represented the largest level the megacap cryptocurrency has seen since early 2022. Interestingly, this move in Bitcoin has been correlated to a surge in the price of spot gold, which recently broke through a record high of $2,100 earlier today, as investors appear to be increasing their bets that inflation could pick up.\n\nSinking bond yields and heightened geopolitical concerns appear to be driving investors to alternative assets, such as Bitcoin, propping up the entire sector today. Additional interest continues to form around Bitcoin due to its upcoming halving event, which is anticipated to take place in 2024, as well as capital inflows from incoming spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe direction Bitcoin moves often informs how Ethereum performs on a given day, and certainly some of Ether's recent rise can be attributed to this bullish narrative forming in alternative assets. However, Ethereum has also benefited from some token-specific catalysts worth pointing out. Most notably, Mantle has rolled out a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum's main network, suggesting that the Ethereum staking markets could become more decentralized. Ethereum's price has surged above $2,200 per token at the time of writing, marking a high not seen since mid-2022 as well.\n\nFinally, Dogecoin's rally appears to be closely correlated to the broader move in the overall sector, with speculators and traders continuing to focus on this meme coin as a way to play the crypto sector's momentum in either direction. This correlation can be seen in the liquidation data for Dogecoin, with roughly $2 million of perpetual futures contracts liquidated yesterday, one of the largest spikes we've seen in recent months.\n\nAre these cryptos worth buying into at year end?\n\nFor investors seeking diversification or are particularly interested in hedging some of their equity exposure with alternative assets, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain top of mind (in addition to gold, of course) as ways of both generating better alpha (higher returns) during bull markets, and potentially providing some downside protection via these assets' lower beta (lower correlation moves) in down cycles.\n\nThat said, the 2022 bear market highlighted some of the risks of putting cryptos in the same bucket as other alternative assets. Gold and other commodities performed much better than crypto last year, so betting on these digital assets as any sort of hedge against uncertainty is still a strategy that's unproven (considering the world's first crypto, Bitcoin, was conceived post-great financial crisis).\n\nOverall, these three tokens certainly appear to reflect a growing consensus that some sort of soft-ish landing is ahead. While I'm not as certain as many of the top economists and talking heads that such a landing can be achieved, it's possible. And for those looking for a way to ride any positive momentum right now, these three assets are certainly in high demand.\n\nI'm remaining cautious on crypto until there's more clarity, but I can also certainly see why investor positioning is favoring these assets right now."

        "content": "What Is Chainlink?\n\nChainlink (LINK) is a cryptocurrency and technology platform that enables non-blockchain enterprises to securely connect with blockchain platforms. Chainlink is middleware that connects blockchain-based smart contracts with external data, such as baseball scores or stock prices. Chainlink's LINK currency pays Chainlink network operators and collateralizes the network's smart contract agreements.\n\nChainlink is a decentralized oracle network or blockchain abstraction layer. Chainlink uses blockchain technology to securely enable computations on- and off-chain, supporting what it calls hybrid smart contracts and its cross-chain interoperability protocol.\n\n\n\nThe Chainlink blockchain is hosted on the Ethereum platform, which uses the proof-of-stake operating protocol. In addition, Chainlink is an open-source blockchain project, meaning anyone can view the project's code and contribute.\n\nKey Takeaways Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects blockchains with off-chain data.\n\nChainlink uses hybrid smart contracts to integrate on-chain code and off-chain data infrastructure.\n\nChainlink tokens\u2014called LINK\u2014serve as currency to pay Chainlink network operators for retrieving and preparing off-chain data and performing computations.\n\nUnderstanding Chainlink\n\nThe Chainlink blockchain can support the secure sharing of inputs, outputs, and computations. Some features of Chainlink include:\n\nSupporting decentralized data feeds : Data from many sources can be securely collected and processed for hybrid smart contracts.\n\n: Data from many sources can be securely collected and processed for hybrid smart contracts. Providing verifiable sources of randomness : Applications such as games that require cryptographically secured randomness can use Chainlink.\n\n: Applications such as games that require cryptographically secured randomness can use Chainlink. Enabling automation : Chainlink smart contracts can automate critical functions and event-driven tasks for enterprises.\n\n: Chainlink smart contracts can automate critical functions and event-driven tasks for enterprises. Supporting cross-blockchain interoperability: Chainlink can connect blockchain platforms to support the exchange of messages, tokens, and specific actions.\n\nChainlink is a blockchain-based decentralized oracle network that was launched in 2017. Oracles are networking tools that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby allowing smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs originating from the blockchain.\n\nThough traditional oracles are centralized, Chainlink decentralizes the process of moving data on and off blockchains through \"hybrid smart contracts.\" LINK tokens are used to reward Chainlink network operators for retrieving data from off-chain feeds, formatting data into accessible formats, and performing off-chain computations.\n\nThe Chainlink decentralized oracle network is a system of nodes that adhere to set protocols. Node operators are required to stake\u2014lock a specific number of\u2014their LINK tokens. Node operators set their own fees based on demand for the off-chain resource they provide.\n\nChainlink node operators with the largest stakes are the best positioned to earn LINK rewards.\n\nBecause Chainlink allows blockchains to exchange data with off-chain systems in a decentralized and tamper-resistant way, the Chainlink oracle network has many use cases. Chainlink has been used to fairly distribute non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gamify personal savings, and facilitate recalibrations of cryptocurrency token supplies, among other applications.\n\nChainlink was created by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, who authored a 2017 white paper with Ari Juels. The network launched in 2019. LINK is an ERC-20 token, meaning that it is compatible with other currencies and smart contracts supported by the Ethereum platform.\n\n\n\nHow Does Chainlink Differ From Ethereum?\n\nThe Chainlink network is, in some ways, a complement to the Ethereum network and other blockchains. Chainlink can facilitate secure communications between Ethereum projects and various off-chain data. Because Chainlink's LINK token is built on the Ethereum platform, LINK is compliant with the Ethereum platform's protocols.\n\nEthereum tokens can be used to spend on purchases, facilitate smart contracts, and pay validators for operating the Ethereum network. Chainlink tokens have only a single use case, which is to pay node operators in the Chainlink network.\n\nThe proof-of-stake mechanism rewards network participants for placing a freeze on the ETH they \"stake\" or put up as collateral for the chance to earn rewards.\n\nGoals of Chainlink\n\nChainlink aims to continue to grow by expanding its support for blockchain environments and facilitating new use cases for hybrid smart contracts. Because significant stores of data and records are not yet maintained within blockchains, Chainlink may have countless opportunities to connect blockchain networks with off-chain information.\n\nIn 2021, the Chainlink network secured more than $75 billion of value as it grew to include over 1,000 projects. Chainlink has a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, of which about 557 million have been issued (as of December 2023).\n\nWhat Can I Buy With LINK? LINK cryptocurrency is used to incentivize Chainlink node operators rather than being designed for everyday purchases. These network participants, tasked with securely transferring data to and from blockchains, are paid in LINK.\n\nWhy Is Chainlink Popular? The Chainlink decentralized oracle can connect many types of data with various blockchains, creating many potential applications for Chainlink. Chainlink could help to integrate blockchain technology with many industries and business functions.\n\nIs Chainlink Made by Oracle? Oracle Corp. (ORCL) is a computer technology company specializing in database management. Chainlink is not affiliated with Oracle Corp. Chainlink refers to itself as a decentralized oracle network, with the \"oracle\" being a broad-based group of intermediaries that connect blockchains with off-chain information systems.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nChainlink is a blockchain project designed to connect different networks and protocols together through oracles. Oracles are networking tools that allow cross-network communication. The project's goal is to provide support for all blockchains, facilitating data movement globally between blockchains.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a resurgence, marking its best performance since May 2022. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading digital assets, have breached significant price levels. Bitcoin [BTC] surpassed $41,000 and Ethereum [ETH] reached $2,200. The cumulative effect of this rally has elevated the total crypto market cap to an impressive $1.54 trillion, setting a high for 2023. Amidst this fervor, institutional investors are playing a crucial role in shaping the market dynamics.\n\nSource: ETF Trends\n\nBitcoin Dominance and Institutional Enthusiasm\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2023, institutional traders have exhibited a notable increase in their Bitcoin holdings, nearly doubling their positions. By September, half of their assets were denominated in Bitcoin, a trend driven by positive market sentiment and heightened anticipation regarding the potential approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This stands in stark contrast to the lower Bitcoin holdings observed among retail traders, a phenomenon possibly attributed to their higher leverage levels, as highlighted by Bybit\u2019s research.\n\nAltcoins Face Institutional Skepticism\n\nThe same report from Bybit Research suggests that institutional traders and large holders of Bitcoin, commonly referred to as whales, are adopting a skeptical stance toward altcoins. Despite a brief surge in altcoin holdings in May, there has been a general decline in these assets, particularly since August. This decline is more pronounced among institutions, signaling a cautious approach toward the inherent volatility associated with altcoins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Rollercoaster Journey\n\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has witnessed fluctuating fortunes. Data reveals a consistent decline in Ether holdings since the Shapella upgrade of the Ethereum network. However, a noteworthy exception occurred in September, when institutional traders displayed renewed interest, coinciding with positive market sentiment surrounding ETF news. Despite this, the overall trend indicates a decrease in Ether holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Back To Spotlight Amid Ethereum\u2019s Poor ETF Performance\n\nComparing Performance: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum\n\nThe year-to-date performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum paints an interesting picture. The Bitcoin price has surged by approximately 140%, showcasing its resilience and attractiveness to investors. In contrast, Ethereum has experienced an 87% increase, reflecting a robust but comparatively less spectacular performance.\n\nIn an October report, K33 Research conveyed a significant shift in asset allocation stance, advising a pivot back to Bitcoin. This shift was influenced by Ethereum\u2019s prolonged slump against Bitcoin since July 2022 and a lukewarm response to the newly launched futures-based Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: ETF Rally: Ethereum is a Better Buy Than Bitcoin, Analyst Says\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing a dynamic interplay of factors, with institutional investors taking center stage. While Bitcoin enjoys heightened institutional enthusiasm, Ethereum faces headwinds amid fluctuations and a changing market sentiment. The cautious approach towards altcoins further underscores the complexities inherent in navigating the diverse cryptocurrency market. As institutional players continue to shape the trajectory of the crypto space, their preferences and sentiments will likely have a lasting impact on the broader market dynamics."

        "content": "The crypto analyst who runs the YouTube channel Crypto Capital Venture says he remains extremely bullish on Bitcoin and the wider crypto market, but cautioned viewers not to get overly excited amid the latest price surge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bullish. I\u2019m so bullish,\u201d the analyst, who goes by the name Crypto Capital Venture, stated in a live YouTube video on Sunday.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been watching my YouTube channel, you know, this is, if we go to the Bitcoin chart zoomed out, you know that on the weekly, on Bitcoin chart, come maybe January, the beginning of this year, January, 2023, I was saying the worst of it is over, 2022.\n\nThe analyst believes, based on studying past market cycles, that 2022 marked the bottom of the latest crypto bear market. He says Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies appear poised to enter their next bull cycle, which he predicts could see prices explode to new all-time highs.\n\nThat year before the recession, that\u2019s based off of decades and decades of macroeconomic data, right? And so that has played out really well. And we\u2019re getting very close to the next bull market. We really are. In terms of where we are this cycle, you can just see it.\n\nYou might also like: Analyst sees potential XRP breakout\n\nThe analyst explained that similar price spikes have occurred in past market cycles, only to be followed by sharp pullbacks. The analyst says he would not be surprised to see Bitcoin revisit lower support levels around $30,000 to $35,000 in the coming weeks.\n\nThe analyst highlighted some key differences with this market cycle, including growing institutional interest and the possibility of SEC approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF in 2023. In his view, these developments could fuel dramatically higher prices both before and after Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event in spring 2023.\n\nThe analyst remains upbeat on the long-term outlook, stating multiple times that he expects this bull cycle to bring \u201cthe most fun we\u2019ve ever had\u201d tracking the crypto markets. For now, though, he preaches exercising patience and discipline amid the volatility.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Peter Szilagyi, the team lead of Ethereum, has expressed frustration over his alma mater's lack of interest in providing opportunities for students to collaborate with Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Szilagyi explained that he had always felt a lack of genuine interest when he returned to his old university to deliver talks about Ethereum.\n\nHe stated that the students appeared to be more focused on the price of Ethereum rather than the project itself. ETH has increased 20.10% over the last 30 days. At the time of publication, ETH's current price is $1,698.72.\n\n\u201cThe audience seems to have been stuck in the number go up aspect; and the organizers always used it as an ad campaign.\u201d\n\nOver the past years I've been asked many times to do talks at my old university about #Ethereum.

However, he claims the students are not aware of who is funding the initiative.\n\n\u201cI haven't met the students myself, but someone supposedly has. They had no clue where the grant came from,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cFigured lets see if this piqued some interest. Wrote to a bunch of old university contacts (including the person through whom I have the grant) if they could recommend some students to potentially collab on some stuff (paid).\u201d\n\nHowever, Szilagyi insists that the university neglected to respond to his emails, leaving him in the dark about the outcome.\n\n\u201cTwo [weeks] later, zero effs, not even a response,\u201d he declared.\n\nHowever, recent reports suggest a growing demand for crypto and blockchain courses in universities.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price rallies toward key resistance but is ETH\u2019s strength sustainable?\n\nOn Feb. 24, Cointelegraph reported that major companies are helping to drive demand for crypto education.\n\nIn recent years, several blue-chip firms including Oracle, Amazon, and Google, have actively hired those with crypto and blockchain knowledge to help develop blockchain products.\n\nIt was also noted that there is an increase in interest from information systems students to learn about decentralized applications.\n\nIn more recent news, France has now opened the Institute of Crypto-Assets.

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Rejection As Bulls Liquidate $3.5 Million In Positions! Is ETH Price Set For A Correction? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past several hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a downturn following their recent highs at approximately $42,000 and $2,300. Analysis of on-chain data indicates that short-term investors are taking this chance to sell their holdings and exit the market with gains. Despite this, strengthening support levels suggest that Ethereum\u2019s price is poised for a recovery and likely to resume its upward trend.\n\nETH price faced resistance slightly under $2,300, leading to a wave of sell-offs by investors eager to secure their profits from the recent rally. According to Coinglass data, short-term traders sold off more than $3.5 million in long positions following the price\u2019s failure to maintain its upward momentum. Consequently, ETH\u2019s value dipped just below the immediate Fibonacci retracement levels.\n\nIn a recent statement by Santiment, a prominent on-chain analytics company, it was noted that Ethereum\u2019s market value has surged, reaching $2,250 for the first time in over one and a half years. This significant milestone brings an increase in open interest and long positions in the Ethereum market.\n\nSantiment highlighted that this trend is indicative of a growing sense of FOMO traders. While there is potential for further price increases, on-chain data cautioned that the market is also facing increased risk of a correction. This is primarily due to traders engaging in increasingly leveraged positions driven by greed, which could lead to greater market volatility and potential corrections.\n\nDespite the recent dip, the downturn appears to be a temporary setback, as the price of ETH showed a strong refusal to fall further and bounced back quickly. The long-short ratio has surged past 1, currently trading at 1.2012, indicating that 55% of holders are now anticipating a rise in price. On the other hand, bears are putting up a strong resistance, with 45% holding short positions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther recently experienced a strong recovery from its 23.6% Fib channel after sellers failed to plunge the price below $2,200, showing that buyers are actively defending this price level. However, buyers are facing resistance to push the price beyond $2.3K. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,217, surging over 3% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nLooking forward, the bulls will attempt to drive the price towards the significant overhead resistance at $2,464, a crucial level to monitor in the short term. A successful break through this resistance could complete an ascending triangle pattern, a bullish indicator. The completion of this pattern could set a target price around $2,800.\n\nOn the flip side, the 20-day EMA serves as a critical support level. If the price falls below this, it will signal a weakening of the bullish momentum. Such a break could potentially lead to a decline towards the crucial $2,000 mark."

        "content": "Ethereum has exploded through critical resistance levels in recent days, surging over 9% in the last week to peak above $2,250. The powerful rally comes as on-chain data reveals a frenzy of accumulation between $1,900-$2,100, leading analysts to believe this zone will now become the support floor for Ethereum\u2019s next leg up.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum price surged past $2,200, up over 9% in the past week\n\n43.8 million ETH were purchased between $1,900-$2,100 recently per on-chain data\n\nThis price zone could now become a support level per analyst Ali Martinez\n\nNext key price targets for Ethereum are $2,600, then $3,000\n\nSolana also seeing bullish momentum, up 13% past week and 236% past 3 months\n\nAccording to data aggregation site IntoTheBlock, 43.8 million ETH were scooped up by 5.85 million addresses within the narrow price channel between $1,900 to $2,100 in recent weeks. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests this intense period of accumulation will turn the price range into a solid support zone for Ethereum moving forward.\n\nThe rally has already powered Ethereum past the $2,150 threshold needed to confirm the bull market is back in full swing according to Martinez\u2019s previous analysis. With prices consolidating above $2,190 and bullish sentiment surging across crypto markets, analysts eye the next key price levels for Ethereum at $2,600 and then $3,000 in short order.\n\nFueling optimism around Ethereum is the parabolic trajectory of so-called \u201cEthereum killer\u201d Solana, which has gained over 236% across the last three months. Solana recently passed $64 and could be establishing a new price floor in the $50 range. The stunning Solana breakout may ignite a similar euphoria around Ethereum as investors pile back into the smart contract platform.\n\nBitcoin also crossed over the momentous $40,000 mark this week after adding 11% across the last seven days. Some analysts attribute Bitcoin\u2019s rise to building anticipation around the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US. An SEC decision could set the stage for billions in institutional inflows. But regardless of the catalyst, the reawakened bullish exuberance appears to be spilling over to the wider crypto sphere.\n\nWith Ethereum trending upwards after its decisive move past $2,000, piercing above $2,600 would firmly signal the next bull market is underway. A subsequent breach of $3,000 would confirm the breakout as Ethereum vies to surpass its all-time high near $4,850. For crypto investors, this week may mark the turning of the tide back into a rising sea of green."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price is on a tear, consolidating within a bullish technical formation that promises more gains if sustained.\n\nETH could rise 5% to convert the $2,300 resistance level into a support floor before continuing its upward trajectory.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated upon a daily candlestick close below the $2,143 support level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been consolidating within an ascending parallel channel since the broader market turned bullish around October 18, pushing north with key drivers including speculation of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launching in the market.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price breaks past $2,000 as BlackRock hints at filing for spot Ether ETF\n\nEthereum price eyes 5% rise above the $2,300 support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is trading with a bullish bias, sustained by an ascending parallel channel. This technical formation promises and delivers more gains for the asset as long as it remains within its confines. However, based on the current outlook, the largest cryptocurrency by trading volume looks ready for a breakout after one attempt already.\n\nTechnical indicators show that Ethereum price still has some upside potential, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) inclined north at 69 to show momentum is still rising. Its position below 70 is good, suggesting ETH is still not overbought nor ripe for a correction.\n\nSimilarly, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in positive territory with green histogram bars. This points to a strong presence of bulls in the Ether market and could bode well for Ethereum price, depending on how the bulls play their hands.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ethereum price breakout above the upper boundary of the chart pattern, confirmed by a flip of the $2,300 resistance level into a support level. This would set the tone for Ether to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics support Ethereum price bullish outlook\n\nMultiple on-chain metrics support the bullish thesis for Ethereum price, including the dwindling deposit transactions and the volume of exchange inflows. As a spike in deposit transactions would indicate a rise in short-term selling pressure, the absence thereof shows investors do not have the intention to sell.\n\nThis outlook is corroborated by dwindling exchange inflows, suggesting investors are not moving their ETH holdings to exchanges. There is no effective intention to sell in the near future.\n\nETH Santiment: Deposit transactions, exchange inflows\n\nFurther, the Tether (USDT) stablecoin market capitalization is rising, suggesting fresh capital inflow into the Ether market, interpreted as the intention to buy. The ensuing buying pressure could inspire a prolonged uptrend for Ethereum price.\n\nETH Santiment: USDT market capitalization\n\nConversely, if selling pressure increases, possibly as investors start booking early profits after such a striking climb, Ethereum price could pull south. In such a directional bias, ETH could lose the confluence support between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,143. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nFurther south, Ethereum price could extend the fall, potentially going as low as the $2,029 support before a foray into the supply zone turned bullish breaker. A decisive candlestick close below the midline of this zone at $1,935 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently displayed remarkable bullish behavior as the price broke through a critical resistance level. The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) has risen sharply today, hitting a new 2023 high of $2,250 as the cryptocurrency market continued to trend higher toward a successful year-end.\n\nThe recent strong upward trend in Ethereum aligns with Bitcoin\u2019s continuous attempt to break above $41,000, which it did today. As of the time of writing, the price of bitcoin was $41.437.\n\nAnalysts say the approval of a BlackRock spot ether instrument would result in an influx of institutional capital into Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network globally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Surge\n\nThe most recent charts show an upward trajectory that has many analysts and investors upbeat about the cryptocurrency hitting the coveted $3,000 barrier in the upcoming weeks or months.\n\nAs this transpired, a crucial on-chain trade statistic reveals that, just 24 hours prior to the most recent price breakout, Ethereum 2.0 stakers made an unexpected $330 million move.\n\nETH Staking Flows. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn December 2, investors pulled out a massive 169,220 ETH (about $337 million) from ETH 2.0 beacon chain Proof of Stake contracts, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\nInterestingly, since the Ethereum Shapella Upgrade enabled withdrawals in April 2023, this is the second-highest staking withdrawal amount.\n\nResilient Rebound And Bullish Market Signals\n\nToday, when the price of Bitcoin broke beyond the coveted $41,000 barrier, the cryptocurrency market is starting to feel more optimistic again.\n\nThe price of ETH recovered from the psychologically critical $2,000 threshold in response to this positive change, showing an 8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,250.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,244.7 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe classic sign of a bull market is a sequence of higher lows and higher highs, which is what we observe when we look at Ethereum\u2019s daily chart. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages served as dynamic resistance, but the price has now overcome both.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of lower yields, cryptocurrency has been going pleasantly higher, along with Gold,\u201d crypto data firm Amberdata stated in a newsletter on Sunday.\n\nIn a note, Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst at Metalpha, stated that there is increasing market expectation for a rate reduction in the coming year.\n\nInvestor optimism on the potential for Bitcoin ETF applications from significant asset management firms is also growing.\n\nShe states:\n\n\u201cThis is an official declaration of a bull run, and there may be additional price increases in the upcoming weeks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, laws may also have an impact on Ethereum\u2019s price in the future; although favorable developments may encourage investment, harsher laws may provide risks. Important factors also include investor sentiment and the state of the economy.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if ETH will overtake Bitcoin in market valuation; this will depend on things like adoption rates and network improvements. Right now, Bitcoin is in the lead with a far larger market capitalization.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The asset\u2019s market cap rose to $270 billion with a market dominance of 17.3%.\n\nETH price, whale activity and total open interest \u2013 Dec. 4 | Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour trading volume also registered a 15% hike, surpassing the $11 billion mark.\n\nAccording to data provided by the market intelligence platform Santiment, the number of wallets holding between 0.1 and 1 ETH reached a 14-week high of 3.35 million, a level last seen in mid-August.\n\nYou might also like: Attorney recommends SEC disbar attorneys over misconduct\n\nOn the other hand, the number of whale wallets consisting of between 100 and 1,000 ETH, per Santiment, has been constantly declining since early March \u2014 currently standing at 40,779 unique addresses.\n\nMoreover, Santiment data shows that ETH\u2019s total open interest (OI) has been constantly rising since Nov. 26. ETH\u2019s total OI rose from $4.4 billion on Dec. 3 to $4.43 billion at the time of writing, per the market intelligence platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s whale activity surged as the price hike came. According to Santiment\u2019s data, the number of whale transactions consisting of at least $100,000 worth of ETH rose by 4.3% over the past 24 hours \u2014 rising from 3,343 trades on Dec. 3 to 3,484 unique transactions at the reporting time.\n\nThe bullish momentum in ETH comes as the asset\u2019s supply turned deflationary amid a decrease in validator participation. According to a crypto.news report, the number of Ethereum validators exiting the network has been declining, causing a slow token issuance rate.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously pointed out the network\u2019s staking and decentralization problems. Buterin stated that the issues making the Ethereum blockchain look centralized will be addressed in the forthcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

That\u2019s a stablecoin issued by Societe Generale FORGE. The transaction on the public Ethereum blockchain is part of a new joint experiment. In July AXA IM was a judge in SocGen Forge\u2019s tokenization hackathon.\n\nCoinVertible isn\u2019t designed as an average stablecoin, but instead for institutional usage. As in this case, there\u2019s a need for trusted on-chain settlement assets.\n\n\u201cThe aim of this initiative, carried out in collaboration with Societe Generale \u2013 FORGE, was to enable us to experiment the use of a stablecoin as a settlement asset to purchase a digital bond,\u201d said Laurence Arnold, Head of Innovation and Strategic Initiatives. \u201cOur ultimate objective is to optimise our existing processes by adopting the most advanced technologies, so we can offer the best possible services to our clients.\u201d\n\nSocGen\u2019s first digital green bond\n\nMeanwhile, the digital bond reports the carbon footprint of the security token issuance infrastructure on chain. Societe Generale issued a \u20ac10 million bond, with AXA IM taking half and Generali Investments the balance. It\u2019s a three year, senior preferred unsecured bond.\n\nDespite the stablecoin\u2019s launch in April, this is the first real use of it. The original stablecoin had zero transactions and was burned in October and updated to a new contract to support instant settlement. AXA IM\u2019s purchase of the stablecoin and transfer in exchange for the bond took place on Friday. SocGen Forge holds \u20ac10 million of the stablecoin, with another \u20ac500,000 issued to an unknown wallet last week.\n\nSince Friday there have also been some small transactions involving the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nAXA IM previously participated in the European Investment Bank Ethereum bond that was issued on Ethereum via SocGen FORGE\u2019s infrastructure. In March the French regulator AMF granted AXA IM its digital asset license. SocGen FORGE received its first license in September 2022 and an expanded version this July.\n\nUpdate: added details re bond amount and Generali"

        "content": "The quest to quantify blockchain decentralization has led to various metrics, with the Nakamoto Coefficient being one of the prominent measures. However, in the recent listings of blockchains by their degree of decentralization, Cardano was notably absent from the top ranks, a position that has sparked curiosity and debate within the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano is often distinguished from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains due to its unique network structure and operational mechanics. Unlike Ethereum, which runs on the EVM, allowing for interoperability and similar structures across various networks, Cardano employs a different approach with its Ouroboros consensus algorithm.\n\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, but it diverges from the standard PoS mechanisms. It is designed to achieve consensus in a more energy-efficient and scalable way. This dedication to a scientific philosophy in its protocol development sets Cardano apart, which may contribute to why it is often considered separately from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nThe distinctiveness of Cardano's architecture is complemented by its layered structure. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL) operate independently, which differentiates its operational functions from those of other blockchains where these layers are typically intertwined.\n\nCardano's network also emphasizes a community-driven approach to governance and development. The project's catalyst funds and the Voltaire phase, which aims to introduce a fully decentralized decision-making process, are testaments to its commitment to a high degree of decentralization, albeit not necessarily captured by the Nakamoto Coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano's method of staking and block production involves a randomized process for electing slot leaders, which is different from Ethereum's process. This adds another layer of complexity when comparing the two networks based on the number of entities that can collectively shut down or control the network, as the Nakamoto Coefficient attempts to measure."

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) joins the Bitcoin market rally past $40,000. At press time, ETH is trading 2.54% up at a price of $2,212 with a market cap of $266 billion. With this move, ETH has also extended its weekly gains to more than 9%.\n\nEthereum Mega Rally to $3,500?\n\nReports suggest that Ethereum\u2019s mega price rally shall continue going ahead amid its recent breakout past $2,200.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that the current Ethereum (ETH) price surpassing $2,000 presents a potentially favorable buying opportunity. Martinez points to data provided by IntoTheBlock, indicating that a substantial volume of tokens, specifically 43.8 million ETH, were acquired in the range of $1,900 to $2,100 by 5.85 million wallets.\n\nThis data leads Martinez to propose that this particular price range may evolve into a significant support level for Ethereum in the years to come. Hence, Martinez asserts that it may not be too late for investors to consider entering the Ethereum market.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez further anticipates a promising trajectory for Ethereum (ETH) if the cryptocurrency achieves a consistent weekly candlestick close above $2,150. In such a scenario, Martinez envisions the potential for an exciting uptrend in the price of ETH.\n\nMartinez outlines specific targets for Ethereum, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could rally towards $2,600, with the possibility of reaching even higher levels, potentially soaring to $3,500. This analysis further points to a bullish outlook for Ethereum in the coming period.\n\nWhat Happens to the ETH Price In December?\n\nIn the recent surge, Ethereum\u2019s price exceeded the critical resistance level of $2,133, indicating a potential for further upward movement driven by buyers. Although experiencing a minor intraday decline of 0.5%, a potential retest of the previously surpassed resistance holds significance. Confirming this level as new support could affirm the buyer\u2019s capability to maintain elevated price levels.\n\nIn a long-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum, it becomes evident that both cryptocurrencies have experienced significant momentum since mid-October. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery stands out, showcasing a more robust performance marked by a consistent pattern of achieving higher highs and lows.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum blockchain continues to make key progress while slashing its energy use by a staggering 99% in the latest sustainability report."

        "content": "A crypto analyst has explained how the range around $2,000 could become a major Ethereum support base for years, making it not too late to buy ETH right now.\n\n43.8 Million Ethereum Was Acquired Between $1,900 And $2,100\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about why Ethereum could still be worth getting into at this point. The analyst has cited data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock to explain this, referring to the on-chain acquisition distribution of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe data for the cost basis distribution of the asset | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nIn the above graph, the dots represent the number of investors or addresses who bought their coins within the corresponding price range. Naturally, the larger the size of the dot, the more is the density of holders who bought inside the range.\n\nIt appears that out of all the price ranges that ETH has visited in its entire history, the $1,900 to $2,100 one hosts the cost basis of the largest number of holders.\n\nETH was just recently consolidating inside this range, and as trading occurred inside it, the investors slowly gained their cost basis there, which is why the range has now swelled so large.\n\nNow, what relevance does this range have for Ethereum? To understand this, how investor psychology works must first be known. To any investor, their cost basis is a particular price level, as their profit-loss situation can flip when the asset\u2019s spot price retests it.\n\nBecause of this reason, the holder might be more likely to show some kind of move when this retest takes place. If the investor had last been in profits, they might expect the same level to be profitable again, so they may just buy more.\n\nA few investors doing such buying won\u2019t make the market budge at all, but if a large number of investors bought inside the same tight range, the levels might just end up providing support to Ethereum should it make a retest.\n\nThe $1,900 to $2,100 buyers are obviously in profits, so this range, which hosts the cost basis of 5.85 million addresses who acquired 43.8 million ETH there, could show a major buying reaction if ETH dips towards it. Ali explains, \u201cthis range could become a significant support level for years ahead. So, it\u2019s not too late to get in on ETH!\u201d\n\nIn another post yesterday, the same analyst had posted the Ethereum weekly chart, noting that if ETH could secure a sustained candle close above the $2,150 mark, the asset could be set for some exciting uptrend.\n\nETH may be breaking out of the triangle | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nAs is visible from the chart, the ETH weekly price could be breaking above an ascending triangle pattern. \u201cTargets in sight? We could be looking at ETH marching towards $2,600, and possibly even soaring to $3,500!\u201d says Ali.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has enjoyed some fresh bullish momentum during the past few days as it has now soared above the $2,200 mark.\n\nLooks like the price of the asset has been going up recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is back on track with its mission to ensure that Ether is deflationary following a significant increase in the burn rate. Several factors are said to have contributed to this milestone, including voluntary exits by validators.\n\nOver 106,000 ETH Burned In The Last 30 Days\n\nAccording to data from Ultra Sound Money, over 106,000 ETH have been burned in the last 30 days. In that same period, only just over 70,000 ETH have been issued. This has caused a significant decrease in Ethereum\u2019s supply, with it being down by over 35,000 ETH.\n\nThis is a welcome development, as the disparity between the burn and issuance rate hasn\u2019t always been this obvious. That led to concerns as to whether ETH was truly deflationary or not. It also began to seem like the London Hard Fork wasn\u2019t effective. Ahead of the Merge, Ethereum introduced this upgrade in its efforts to make ETH deflationary.\n\nETH investors are sure to be delighted with the fact that the token has once again become deflationary. Such development could propel ETH\u2019s price to new heights. Moreover, it comes at a time when the market is preparing for an imminent bull run. As such, this macro factor, alongside other ones, places it at the forefront to be one of the biggest gainers.\n\nETH price recovers above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFactors That Have Contributed To The Ethereum Deflationary Status\n\nA report by Glassnode provided insights as to why Ethereum is deflationary once again. One of them happens to be the fact that the number of validators onboarded has slowed in recent weeks. Instead, Ethereum has an increasing number of validators exiting the ecosystem. This development has ultimately caused ETH issuance to slow.\n\nThis trend of exits notably began at the start of October. This seems to be when investors actually began to take full advantage of the Shanghai upgrade that had taken place in April. Before October, the exiting event is reported to have been at an average of 309 validators per day. That increased to 1018 validators per day at the start of October.\n\nMeanwhile, the burn rate during this period is said to have increased significantly due to the growing network activity. The increase in network usage has led to higher gas fees. The daily amount of transaction fees burned through the EIP1559 protocol has also increased as a result. The accumulated fees burned between October and November are reported to have reached 5,368 ETH.\n\nEthereum is flying high at the moment, and this could be partly due to its recently achieved status. At the time of writing, the crypto token is trading at around $2,240, up by over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from CryptoTV, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The crypto markets are experiencing a notable uptick as Bitcoin (BTC) surpasses the $40,000 mark for the first time in 18 months, accompanied by Ethereum (ETH) breaching $2,200. These milestones come amidst a subdued but widespread rally in the crypto space. Bitcoin's resurgence has been attributed to optimistic sentiments fueled by dovish comments from U.S. central bankers and the anticipation of a potential approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nEthereum, too, has witnessed a similar resurgence, trading at $2,205, marking a significant rise over the past 24 hours. While most top-10 cryptocurrencies recorded smaller gains, the BNB coin, affiliated with the Binance exchange, saw a minor decrease of about 0.1% in the past day. These developments signify a positive trajectory for major cryptocurrencies after a period of consolidation.\n\nIndustry Executives Forecast a Bull Run with $100,000 Bitcoin in 2024\n\nExecutives within the cryptocurrency industry are signaling the commencement of a new bull run, projecting fresh all-time highs for Bitcoin in 2024, potentially exceeding $100,000. This optimism is underpinned by several factors, including the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and the upcoming bitcoin halving scheduled for May 2024. The resolution of significant industry issues, such as the FTX case and Binance settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, is seen as a positive development that could further bolster market confidence.\n\nWhile acknowledging the speculative phase, industry leaders believe that the focus will shift towards technological advancements and real-world problem-solving as the sector evolves.\n\nKeep Reading Kraken Unveils New Platform for Institutional Clients amid ETF Boost\n\nPositive Developments and Potential Catalysts\n\nThe conclusion of the FTX case and Binance settlement is seen as a turning point, drawing a line under issues that have plagued the crypto market. Two key developments are contributing to the positive outlook: the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF and the upcoming bitcoin halving in 2024. The approval of an ETF is perceived as a significant milestone, indicating bitcoin's mainstream acceptance and attracting traditional investors. The halving, which occurs every four years, is expected to contribute to a new rally, given its historical impact on bitcoin's supply dynamics.\n\nBold Predictions for Bitcoin's Future\n\nSeveral institutions and analysts have made bold predictions for Bitcoin's future. Standard Chartered reiterated its April price call, forecasting that bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, driven by the approval of multiple ETFs.\n\nAnd while projections can greatly vary, predictions such as these align with a positive macroeconomic environment, anticipating support from monetary policy and geopolitical factors.\n\nAs the industry anticipates potential upward momentum, market participants are closely watching key levels, such as $38,000, which is viewed as a critical threshold. Some suggest that a breakout beyond this level could pave the way for a rally to $45,000 to $48,000. However, caution is advised, as the success of the rally is contingent on regulatory decisions, particularly regarding the approval or rejection of the ETF, which could significantly impact market dynamics.\n\nConclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape in Anticipation\n\nIn conclusion, the recent milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with optimistic forecasts for a bull run, indicate a renewed sense of confidence in the crypto market. As the industry moves beyond recent challenges, stakeholders are optimistic about the transformative potential of key catalysts such as ETF approvals and the bitcoin halving. However, participants remain vigilant, recognizing the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape and the potential impact of regulatory decisions on market trends."

        "content": "Investors seem content with the current performance of major cryptocurrencies led by prominent assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other leading altcoins have not been sidelined, including tokens like Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Polygon, and more.\n\nEthereum price extended the rally from the previous week over the weekend, with a spillover on Monday rising 3.3% to $2,229. The last 30 days were extremely bullish for the leading smart contracts token, cumulatively achieving a 21% ascent.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSeveral factors are driving Ethereum price rally including the fear of missing out (FOMO), attributed to the likely approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.\n\nThe ability to uphold higher support levels, starting with $2,000 cannot be overemphasized. It assures traders of the uptrend\u2019s longevity and the possibility of Ethereum price blasting to $3,000 before the end of the year.\n\nRecommended for you: Coinbase Stock Price Surges 7.25% In Tandem With Bitcoin, Buying COIN Now?\n\nEthereum AUM Weekly Inflows Hit $30 Million\n\nWeekly inflows into assets under management (AUM) products totaled $176 million in the previous week, according to the latest report by CoinShares. This underscores the growing risk appetite among investors, rising to a 10-week sum of $1.76 billion\u2014the highest level since October 2021 when Bitcoin futures ETFs launched in the US.\n\nEthereum recorded at least $31 million in inflows while Bitcoin saw weekly inflows reaching $133 million. Investors also pushed funds into Solana products which saw $4.3 million in weekly inflows.\n\nThe bullish trend will likely continue as more investors focus on the impact of Bitcoin spot ETF approval possibly in January in addition to the generally up-trending crypto market.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How Soon Can Bulls Close Gap To $3k\n\nEthereum holds above a new support formed at $2,200 as it consolidates gains from the weekend. A buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is backing the uptrend as momentum behind the token increases.\n\nIn case of a correction, support at $2,100 and $2,000 will come in handy but if nothing drastic occurs and changes the technical structure, dips would be brief and serve as opportunities to collect more liquidity for incoming breakouts.\n\nKey milestones moving forward would be to break resistance at $2,300 and the subsequent hurdle at $2,500. FOMO could then drive the price to $3,000 and provide a path for Ethereum to reclaim all-time highs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s position above all three bull market indicators; the 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue), the 50-day EMA (red), and the 200-day EMA (purple) is another validation for the bullish theory.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) entering the overbought region (70 and above), the ongoing uptrend is strong and unlikely to snap. However, traders should be alert and watch out for sudden pullbacks. These would manifest with the RSI falling back into the neutral zone.\n\nRelated Articles"

The last time ETH open interest was noted to be higher than it is now was in November 2022.\n\nThe major open interest data was recorded from Binance, Bybit, and OKX of $2.56 billion, $1.56 billion, and $1.32 billion respectively. As the price soared, traders started taking short positions.\n\nAdditionally, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of Ethereum can also be seen rising from $21 billion in October to $32 billion currently.\n\nAmid these, a lot of whale movement could have been tracked on Ethereum. According to Lookonchain data, in the last six hours, a savvy trader successfully sold 2,850 $ETH (valued at $6.35M) at $2,230, pocketing approximately $457K.\n\nThe trader, expert at Ethereum trading, has executed 25 trades in the past year, achieving success in 20 of them\u2014where the selling price exceeded the buying price. The cumulative profit from these transactions has surpassed $3M.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Lists LUNC, IOTA, & Other Spot Trading Pairs As Terra Classic Price Rallies\n\nCan ETH Price Go Beyond $2.3K?\n\nLooking at the current rally, Ethereum sees a lot of green candles within the previous week. Starting from the Ethereum ETF optimism to Vitalik\u2019s view on overhauling the Ethereum staking model, ETH went through a lot.\n\nAt the press time, Ethereum (ETH) price was trading at$2,223.19, reflecting a notable 3% uptick in the last 24 hours and an impressive 10% surge over the past week. The 24-hour trading volume for ETH is a substantial $24.4 billion, underscoring robust market activity.\n\nComing to the Greed and Fear Index, the indicator shows a 76-point mark, signaling a prevalent sense of greed among investors. This indicates that the current market sentiment is bullish, suggesting a prevailing appetite for risk.\n\nHowever, amid the bull rally, a lot of Ethereum whales have pulled out their stakes, leaving the short position at around $22 million dominating the current long position.\n\nAlso Read: Whale Transfers 24 Mln XRP Amid Price Jump, What\u2019s Next?"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nThe year 2023 has marked a shift in the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Despite Ethereum\u2019s substantial dollar value growth of 88%, it has significantly underperformed compared to Bitcoin, being down by 25% against the lead digital asset. The ratio currently sits at a precarious 0.053, teetering near year-to-date lows.\n\nThis trend invites speculation as to whether the crypto landscape may soon witness a further dip in Ethereum\u2019s performance. The BTC-ETH Dominance metric, an oscillator that tracks the macro outperformance trends between Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides some relevant insights. It gauges the Bitcoin Market Cap\u2019s dominance over the combined market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum, normalized around a long-term mean using a 0.765 factor.\n\nHigher values and uptrends point towards Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum, while lower values and downtrends signal Ethereum\u2019s superior performance. Currently, we are technically in an era of Ethereum dominance, with the metric at -0.016, which is the lowest level since Ethereum dominance began in May 2021. Traditionally, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during bull markets, raising the question: Could this be the first bull market where Bitcoin outpaces Ethereum?"

Ethereum, on the other hand, appears to be lagging.\n\nDespite its respectable gains, Ethereum's price increase stands at 10.09% for the same period, trailing behind Bitcoin's more robust performance.\n\nThe rally behind Bitcoin's impressive performance has been partly attributed to speculation around interest rate cuts, which has fueled the most recent rally.\n\nThis widespread market optimism suggests that investors are gaining confidence in the face of regulatory clarity and the resolution of high-profile criminal cases within the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin's growing dominance\n\nBitcoin's market dominance has reached a significant milestone, surpassing the 51% mark. This means that over half of the total market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space is now attributable to Bitcoin alone.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are valued at $814 billion and $267 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEthereum's market dominance often sees a notable increase during bull markets due to growing speculation and appetite for riskier cryptocurrencies."

Discover SCENE\n\nRising tides lift all ships\u2014apparently even those of the battered, beleaguered, and oft-eulogized NFT market.\n\nAs top altcoins including Ethereum and Solana continue to steadily pump, largely on the winds of Bitcoin\u2019s tremendously persistent, now weeks-long price rally, NFT collections associated with those blockchain networks now appear to be along for the ride.\n\nPudgy Penguins, for example, an Ethereum NFT collection and longtime bear market favorite, has jumped 74% in USD floor price in the last week alone, according to NFT Price Floor. Floor price refers to the lowest listed price for a single NFT in any given collection. Trading volume on Pudgy Penguins has also shot up 394% this week, per CryptoSlam, to nearly $7.5 million worth of NFT sales.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Pudgy Penguins has enjoyed better fortunes during the ongoing crypto winter than many other Ethereum NFT collections\u2014largely thanks to the project\u2019s prioritization of mainstream partnerships and other IP tie-ins\u2014this week\u2019s gains are distinct. It currently costs $21,289 worth of ETH to buy the cheapest Pudgy Penguin NFT on offer. Before last month, the highest floor price the collection ever reached was just north of $9,000 worth of ETH.\n\nOther Ethereum NFT collections have similarly shot up amidst the crypto market\u2019s tentative comeback. The USD floor price for Azuki, the popular anime-inspired NFT series, is up 28% since Thursday, to $14,803 a pop. Dominant Ethereum NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks have spiked 31% and 17% since Thanksgiving, respectively, in that same metric.\n\nEthereum NFT project Milady Maker also appears to have benefited tremendously from the market\u2019s current mood\u2014USD floor price for the controversial collection has spiked 79% in the last week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s steady price increase over the last few weeks, also, can only account for a portion of these good fortunes: Since Turkey Day, the cryptocurrency has climbed just 7.7%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe NFT rebound doesn\u2019t appear relegated to just Ethereum, either. On Solana, several NFT collections are seeing massive upswings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMad Lads, which has remained Solana\u2019s buzziest NFT project since launching earlier this year, is up 52.6% in the last week\u2014to an eyebrow-raising $10,219 floor price at writing, per Solana Floor. While the project has certainly benefited from Solana\u2019s impressive rally over the last month, it has also gained attention for the perks holders receive in connection to the Backpack app, and the company\u2019s soon-to-launch crypto exchange of the same name.\n\nBut as with Ethereum, no single project-specific factor appears to be driving recent gains for NFTs on Solana. The trend appears decidedly market-wide.\n\nIn the last week, Solana NFT collection Claynosaurz has shot up 62% in floor price; trading volume for the series soared 324% in the same period.\n\nFloor prices for the Solana NFT collection Chads have pumped eight times over, from $44 to $359, in the last seven days. In that period, Chads has seen $357,935 worth of trading volume\u2014that\u2019s up 12,914% from the week prior.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Thus, a recent breakout from the range barrier sets the ETH price to further rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Data Indicates Roadblock Ahead\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Hit $3000?\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would set a directional uptrend\n\nThe rising price could face intense supply around $2250.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nCoinciding with the Bitcoin price ascent over the $38,000 mark, a renewed sense of optimism has begun to permeate the crypto market. Responding to this positive shift, the ETH price rebounded from the psychologically significant $2,000 mark, registering a 7.8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,153.\n\nDuring this rally, the Ethereum price surpassed the immediate resistance of $2,133, suggesting that buyers are poised to drive the price even higher. Despite a modest intraday loss of 0.5%, a retest of this breached resistance could confirm its role as a new support level, underpinning the buyer\u2019s ability to sustain higher price levels.\n\nHowever, with only a 3.5% increase, the ETH price is approaching a significant resistance level formed by the wedge pattern. Historical trends indicate that this trendline has often led to increased selling pressure and notable price declines.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive breakout above this barrier is crucial for confirming a more robust uptrend. Should the Ethereum price successfully navigate this challenge, its price could potentially soar by 50%, reaching around $3,400.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nLong-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals that both cryptocurrencies gained considerable momentum since mid-October. However, the Bitcoin price has demonstrated a more substantial recovery, characterized by a consistent pattern of higher highs and lows. On the other hand, the ETH price has faced some challenges, particularly noticeable supply pressure around the $2,200 mark.\n\nBollinger band: The uptick in the Bollinger band indicator reflects that buyers are aggressive and ready to buy ETH at a higher price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: a bullish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) line, accentuates a recovery sentiment return in this asset."

        "content": "One of the founding minds behind Solana Labs has expressed his disagreement with the phrase labeling the Solana network as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nIn a Dec. 2 post on X, Anatoly Yakovenko said he doesn\u2019t envision a scenario where Solana (SOL) flourishes at the expense of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) demise.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1731025584271274244?s=20\n\nSince its official introduction in 2020, Solana\u2019s inherent attributes have led many to hail it as an Ethereum killer, a moniker also attributed to renowned blockchains like Cardano (ADA), Tezos (XTZ), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (MATIC).\n\nYakovenko, however, labels the term \u201cEthereum killer\u201d as \u201clame\u201d, arguing that despite the similarities between Solana and Ethereum, the latter won\u2019t be eclipsed by the former.\n\nYakovenko expressed concern over the growing tension, which he likened to a \u201ccold war,\u201d between Ethereum and other blockchain protocols, including Solana. He argued that such hostile narratives hinder the overall growth of the shared digital ecosystem.\n\nThe Solana co-founder views the connection between his blockchain and Ethereum as a path to shared growth and advancement.\n\nYou might also like: Solana reaches 18-month highs amid dominating short positions\n\nAlthough blockchain technologies like SOL and ETH, with their similar features, may appear to be in direct competition, Yakovenko insists that one\u2019s success does not necessitate the other\u2019s failure. He reinforced his stance with the concept of Pareto efficiency, explaining that technologies can share features and compete without causing harm.\n\nHe also spoke enthusiastically about the advancements in blockchain technology, notably danksharding, an Ethereum scaling solution aimed at increasing transactional capacity by providing more storage for roll-up transactions.\n\nHe sees a future where such technology could accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data, further reinforcing his belief in technological coexistence.\n\nAt one point, the Solana network, developed to provide smart contract functionalities akin to the Ethereum network, outperformed the Ethereum mainnet in terms of speed and power efficiency, courtesy of its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system.\n\nAt that time, Ethereum utilized the more power-hungry proof-of-work (PoW) consensus method and could only process approximately 30 transactions per second, a fraction of Solana\u2019s more impressive 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin NFT collection triggers surge in Ethereum gas fees\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Mantle, the DAO-led web3 ecosystem, today unveiled its Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP) as a key addition to the Mantle Ecosystem, offering users a novel way to engage with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) validator network, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nThe Mantle LSP is a permissionless and non-custodial Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking protocol, functioning on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle. It stands as the second core product of the Mantle Ecosystem, following the Mantle Network L2. Mantle posits that the introduction of Mantle Staked Ether (mETH), a value-accumulating receipt token, is a pivotal step in their protocol.\n\nMantle detailed that the genesis of Mantle LSP began with a proposal in a Mantle forum on July 14, 2023. Following the acceptance of the Mantle Governance Proposal MIP-25, the staking of Mantle Treasury ETH was sanctioned, leading to the phased deployment of Mantle LSP. This process culminated in the protocol\u2019s full operational launch on Dec. 4, transitioning it into a Permissionless Mode.\n\nMantle LSP distinguishes itself by offering instant and sustainable rewards. Users staking ETH receive mETH, a token embodying their staked value and accumulated rewards, while also unlocking additional yield opportunities within the Mantle Ecosystem. Mantle states that the ETH to mETH exchange rate is deterministically calculated, thus mitigating the impact of stake size on slippage. Furthermore, mETH is available for trade on various exchanges, with its pricing governed by market dynamics.\n\nMantle emphasizes that their protocol underscores a commitment to user experience, security, and yield optimization. Mantle states its LSP features a streamlined architecture, focusing on the ETH to mETH conversion process on L1, and avoids complexities associated with other PoS tokens and chains. The protocol\u2019s design incorporates robust risk management strategies, including non-custodial core smart contracts and off-chain services that impose strict risk limits. Additionally, Mantle LSP\u2019s security framework involves dividing responsibilities among various roles, ensuring the safeguarding of staked ETH within smart contract addresses.\n\nWith the launch of Mantle LSP, Mantle intends to enhance its DeFi offerings by exploring the adoption of mETH across various applications within its ecosystem and beyond. This expansion aims to bolster the utility and efficiency of mETH, contributing significantly to Mantle\u2019s growth in the DeFi space.\n\nThe broader Mantle ecosystem, anchored in Ethereum technology, now includes the Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solution, Mantle Governance, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and Mantle Treasury, one of the largest on-chain treasuries. The ecosystem is facilitated by the Mantle token (MNT), which serves as a product and governance token."

        "content": "Mantle has recently unveiled its liquid staking protocol (LSP) on the Ethereum mainnet. This move comes after their successful deployment of a Layer 2 network. Mantle\u2019s protocol introduces a non-custodial system allowing users to stake Ethereum (ETH) through validator nodes. In return, participants receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH), representing their stake. This approach offers a fresh perspective on network staking, aiming to decentralize the process significantly.\n\nChallenging Major Stakeholders\n\nA vital aspect of Mantle\u2019s strategy is to address the growing concentration of staked ETH in the hands of dominant providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Binance. Mantle\u2019s chief strategist, Jordi Alexander, highlights the issue stemming from a feedback loop driven by name recognition and user preference. Mantle counters this by promoting mETH in the Liquid Staking and DeFi (LSDfi) ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe goal is to provide diverse options for users and improve capital efficiency to sustain yields. Mantle\u2019s DAO, following the MIP-25 governance proposal, has commenced staking ETH from its treasury. This move adds to its $80 million in ETH staked with Lido Finance.\n\nMantle\u2019s Financial Footprint\n\nGiven its substantial financial footprint in the crypto market, mantle\u2019s entry into the liquid staking arena is noteworthy. With assets amounting to $470 million in ether and an additional $200 million in stablecoins, Mantle\u2019s approach could significantly impact the decentralized finance landscape on the Ethereum network. Their strategy represents a shift towards a more inclusive and decentralized staking environment.\n\nAs a result, despite opening the day in a bearish trend, Mantle (MNT) has gained positive momentum in the last 24 hours. During the rally, bulls drove the MNT price from a low of $0.5406 to a 6-month high of $0.5677 before a slight drop. At press time, MNT was trading for $0.5651, a 4.61% increase over the previous day.\n\nMNT/USD 1-day price chart (source: CoinGecko)\n\nMNT\u2019s market capitalization and 24-hour trading volume increased by 4.26% and 30.59%, respectively, to $1,767,894,161 and $133,598,064. This price and trading volume increase implies that investors and traders have grown interested in and confident in the staking approach. As more people participate in Mantle\u2019s decentralized staking ecosystem, the bullish trend is anticipated to propel MNT\u2019s price upwards.\n\nRead Also: Binance Lists LUNC, IOTA, & Other Spot Trading Pairs As Terra Classic Price Rallies"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been blowing past several resistance levels recently. It is currently surging vertically, and the market participants are optimistic that a new bull market has begun.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nThe daily chart shows that since the price broke above the 200-day moving average around the $1,800 level and the large bullish flag pattern, the market structure has shifted bullish once again. The $2,000 and $2,150 resistance levels have been broken, and the market is currently targeting the next resistance zone at the $2,500 price mark.\n\nYet, the relative strength index is entering the overbought region, and a short-term pullback or consolidation might be near.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart demonstrates more details about the recent Ethereum price action. ETH has been forming a rising wedge pattern around the $2,000 mark but has broken past its higher boundary with ease. Consequently, the market has rallied aggressively and is currently trading above $2,200.\n\nYet, with the relative strength index showing a clear overbought signal and the last few 4-hour candles demonstrating weakness in bullish momentum, a pullback toward the $2,150 support level is expected in the coming weeks.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nFunding Rates\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has risen rapidly over the last few weeks, pushing past the $2,000 level. In the current situation, analyzing the futures market metrics can provide beneficial insights for investors.\n\nThis chart demonstrates the funding rates, one of the most useful metrics for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Positive funding values indicate that the longs are more aggressive. Conversely, negative values are associated with more dominance by the short sellers.\n\nAs the chart depicts, the funding rates are printing highly positive values with the recent surge in price. These values are similar levels previously seen during the $69K all-time high range. Therefore, investors should be cautious as a pullback or even a reversal looks very likely in the short term."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 networks achieved a significant milestone in November 2023 surpassing a total value locked (TVL) of almost $15 billion within their contracts, as reported by blockchain analytics platform, L2Beat.\n\nThe list of Ethereum layer-2 networks includes:\n\nArbitrum One\n\nOptimism, Base\n\nPolygon zkEVM\n\nMetis\n\nand various others.\n\nBefore June 15 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum layer-2 networks was less than $10 billion, and the combined TVL had been decreasing since reaching a peak of $11.8 billion in April 2023.\n\nStarting from June 15 2023, there has been a positive growth in the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum layer-2 networks. By October 31 2023, these networks had reached a new high of nearly $12 billion in combined TVL. The trend continued, surpassing the $13 billion TVL mark on November 10 2023 and reaching nearly $14.8 billion at the time of the latest data.\n\nThe number of such networks continues to increase as well as providing different options and advantages to users. The latest is Mara, the Africa-focused crypto startup, which is set to also launch its highly anticipated Ethereum layer 2 chain, Mara Chain.\n\nAccording to Metis decentralization coordinator, Elena Sinelnikova, Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees during the bull market left an indelible impact on users, leading to a desire for alternatives when demand started to come back.\n\n\u201cAt the time of bull market, Ethereum at peak times was very nonscaleable, which meant that transactions were slow and very expensive because of the bull market. It would be hundreds of dollars just in transaction fees for one transaction, so therefore it was not sustainable.\u201d\n\nAnother factor contributing to the success of layer 2 networks during the bear market is the effective marketing efforts by their development teams. Successful marketing has led to increased user activity, attracting more participants and contributing to higher yields within layer 2 networks.\n\n\u201cThey are deploying capital to attract new users and to attract new business into DeFi,\u201d Sinelnikova stated.\n\n\u201cDeFi people from all ecosystems, they always go where there are big yields, and this is just naturally happening, and is the nature of business.\u201d\n\nHowever, while layer-2 solutions have gained popularity for their scalability enhancements over the last year, they often introduce a trade-off in decentralization, insiders contend.\n\n\u201cAt the execution layer, where transactions are processed, centralized sequencer nodes are employed, raising concerns about potential censorship or government interference. This centralized aspect in layer-2 implementations challenges the core principles of decentralization and trustlessness that have underpinned the blockchain space,\u201d said Kelsey McGuire, Chief Growth Officer for layer-1 network, Shardeum.\n\nMcGuire anticipates that competition from layer 2 solutions will drive enhancements to layer 1 protocols, resulting in improved throughput and functionality for the foundational blockchain layers.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n__________________________________________\n\n__________________________________________"

        "content": "Ethereum will skyrocket in price should BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF gain the SEC\u2019s approval, according to analysts. This will result in more than 10x growth based on its current price.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF Token presale recently hit $2m as analysts provide 10-100x price predictions.\n\nUnprecedented Institutional Captial Anticipated as Key Price Driver\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a notable spike in November when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled down on its crypto efforts, filing for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be listed on Nasdaq, opening the door to a broad new audience previously deterred from buying ETH for technical, security, or liquidity reasons.\n\nThis would propel cryptocurrency to a legitimate investment opportunity, even for traditional investors. As such, it is no surprise that Ethereum\u2019s price is rising in anticipation, currently at $2.09K, up 15% in the last month.\n\nYet, some analysts are significantly bullish on where Ethereum could be headed in the upcoming market cycle.\n\nIn a breakdown on TheStreet, prominent analyst Austin Arnold said, \u201cThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, is now backing both Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d suggesting this is of monumental importance for the assets\u2019 future.\n\nHe then considered BlackRock\u2019s assets under management (AUM), how much it may allocate to the ETH ETF, and how this could impact the asset\u2019s market cap.\n\nArnold then discussed a bull case following the ETF approval, contemplating Ethereum could climb to highs of $41,000. However, he stated, \u201cI do not see Ethereum getting that far.\u201d\n\nInstead, the analyst sees a more realistic prediction being $28,000, or $10,000.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s $28,000, $45,000, $10,000, I\u2019d be happy with anything, but I\u2019m a long-term holder,\u201d Arnold concluded.\n\nOne of the factors that he highlighted was the difference in Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s structure, tokenomics, and utility. He explained, \u201cOne\u2019s digital gold, it\u2019s aiming to be a store of value. While Ethereum is like digital oil, used to power a global, decentralized supercomputer, build apps. Just like a car needs gasoline to be able to run, Ethereum is the gas that makes the system work.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also referenced Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism, which makes the token deflationary by destroying a small part of each transaction fee. Coupled with the incoming ETF liquidity inflows, Arnold believes this could significantly bolster its price.\n\nHowever, he understands there is a ceiling to how far it can go in the next market cycle. \u201c$10,000 ETH is the most realistic scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nThis represents less than a 5x gain from its current price. While this is a significant return for those with large portfolios, it is unlikely to render sufficient returns for those with limited financial resources.\n\nOne alternative with a lot of upside potential is Bitcoin ETF Token, a new trending presale that has raised over $2.1 million in three weeks amid the BlackRock hype.\n\nStake-to-Earn Bitcoin ETF Token ICO Hits $2M Milestone\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is a compelling new project that rewards holders in line with key Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nThe project has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned as Bitcoin ETFs reach five main targets, creating a sense of scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) when the hype is highest.\n\nIt also features a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each milestone. This incentivizes people to hold longer and ensures explosive price action following the project\u2019s IEO.\n\nThese factors make Bitcoin ETF Token deflationary, introducing the scarcity principle into the project, which has been a key driver for Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic price action since its launch in 2009.\n\nAnother exciting factor is its staking mechanism, rewarding its community and incentivizing users to lock up their tokens, further limiting the available supply.\n\nHolders can garner a 118% staking APY, but they must be quick because this decreases as more users stake their tokens.\n\nThe project has experienced significant success lately, with top analysts providing massively bullish predictions. Jacob Bury speculates it will 10x after its launch, while Crypto Boy believes it could 100x.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge: Bull Run Continues Beyond $2,000, But There's Silver Lining - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has seen its price substantially soar past the $2,000 threshold. This milestone is a significant psychological level for traders and enthusiasts alike, signaling a continuation of the bullish trend for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, upon closer analysis, the momentum underpinning this rally appears less robust than in previous surges, painting a picture that is cautiously optimistic with a silver lining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Bitcoin's dominance rises, it seems to absorb much of the market's momentum, leaving altcoins like Ethereum to trail in its wake. This dynamic is evident in Ethereum's price movements, which, while positive, lack the explosive energy seen in past bull runs. The subdued momentum could be attributed to a range of factors, including the market's hesitant stance on DeFi platforms, which have not regained the explosive popularity they enjoyed in previous cycles.\n\nThe DeFi sector, which is largely built upon Ethereum, has shown weak positions amid regulatory scrutiny and a global downturn in investor appetite for riskier assets. This has undoubtedly played a role in tempering Ethereum's ascent, as the network's intrinsic value is closely tied to the success and innovation within its ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the burgeoning NFT market provides a glimmer of hope. As interest in NFTs revives, Ethereum stands to benefit from increased transaction volumes and renewed enthusiasm for its blockchain, which underpins much of the NFT market. The potential of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which aims to reduce the volatility of transaction fees, also bodes well for the network's future utility and investment appeal.\n\nLooking ahead, the anticipated upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which promises improved scalability and energy efficiency, could serve as a bullish catalyst for ETH's price. Furthermore, the gradual recovery of the NFT space and persistent innovation within the DeFi sector suggest that the current rally could gain fresh momentum, even if the pace at this moment seems tempered.\n\nXRP remains suppressed\n\nXRP has recently shown signs of a breakthrough, but the rally appeared to lack the conviction seen in its cryptocurrency counterparts, such as Bitcoin. The market movement for XRP has been tepid at best, with the asset struggling to enter a significant and sustained rally.\n\nIn the shadow of Bitcoin's impressive surge past the $40,000 mark, XRP's ascent presents a rather underwhelming narrative. As Bitcoin broke numerous resistances, XRP's attempt at a rally seemed too tentative, which might be a bearish signal for the asset that has failed to gain any positions.\n\nTechnical analysis of XRP's chart reveals its struggle to maintain upward momentum. After a spike that captured the market's attention, the price action has since been contained, with XRP facing resistance that it seems unable to break decisively. The moving averages, typically a sign of potential future movement, have converged in a narrow band, suggesting a lack of strong market direction and investor indecision.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI), a measure of market momentum, remains in a neutral zone, neither overbought nor oversold, underscoring the absence of a clear trend. This indecisiveness in the market is compounded by XRP's volume metrics, which have not displayed the surge required to back a robust rally, further solidifying the notion that the recent price action is uninspired and lackluster.\n\nMarket sentiment toward XRP is between cautious and bearish, reflecting concerns over ongoing regulatory challenges and market positioning. While XRP has a loyal community and a firm standing among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, its recent performance suggests a bearish phase.\n\nWithout a significant catalyst or change in market dynamics, XRP may continue to languish in its current range, overshadowed by the more dynamic movements of its peers like Bitcoin."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price continued its remarkable rally this week as demand for cryptocurrencies continued surging. The coin surged to a high of $2,260 on Monday, its highest point since May 2022. It has had a spectacular rally after bottoming at $881 in June last year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s surge has also had an impact on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has over $6 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund has moved from having a discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) to having a premium of about 2%.\n\nThis performance is primarily because most investors believe that the SEC will also approve Ethereum ETFs. While the SEC is expected to approve a Bitcoin ETF, the challenge is that the agency views Ethereum as a financial security because of its staking features. As such, it might reject an ETH ETF just as it has done so for BTC several times in the past.\n\nEthereum and ETHE prices have jumped in line with the ongoing Bitcoin price surge. Bitcoin has rallied to over $40,000 as demand for the coin rises. Investors are waiting for the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and spot ETF approval. There is also growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in the coming months.\n\nEthereum also has a dominant role in the blockchain industry even as competition from layer-1 networks like Avalanche and Solana rose. It is also competing with other layer-2 networks like Base, Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum.\n\nFeatured Broker Looking to invest?

Ad\n\nData by CryptoSlam shows that the total sales of Ethereum NFTs jumped by 120% in the past 24 hours to over $24 million. Solana sales came in second at over $5 million while Mythos Chain stood at over $793k. The number of Ethereum buyers dropped to 10,346 in the same period.\n\nAre you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis?

It generated over $9.1 million in fees in the past 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the outlook for Ethereum is likely strong since it has the biggest market share in key industries like DefI, gaming, and NFTs.\n\nThere are also positive fundamentals that could push ETH price much higher. US inflation has retreated, leading to many analysts to predict that the Fed will start cutting rates in the first half of 2024. Also, the crypto fear and greed index has moved to 75 while the US dollar index has retreated.\n\nEthereum price forecast\n\nCopy link to section\n\nETH chart by TradingView\n\nTurning to the daily chart, we see that the ETH price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few weeks. The coin has risen in the past five straight days and managed to cross the key resistance point at $2,140, the highest in April and November.\n\nEthereum price is being supported by the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic have all pointed upwards, pointing to high momentum.\n\nTherefore, the outlook for Ethereum price is bullish, with the next level to watch being at $2,500 followed by $3,000."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nAnalyst Tom Crown has expressed a bullish outlook on Litecoin (LTC), noting its potential to gain traction amid the current market developments. Crown opened up about the impact of rising transaction fees within Bitcoin (BTC) and shared an interesting analogy using a South Park reference to illustrate the transaction queue.\n\nIn an interview with The Paul Barron Network, he pointed out that Litecoin\u2019s transaction fees are currently low, making it an attractive option for users seeking efficient transactions. Crown said that Litecoin historically served as a useful bridge for transferring value between different assets, especially during times of congestion in the Bitcoin network.\n\nHowever, despite the positive sentiment, Crown acknowledged that Litecoin\u2019s price chart does not fully reflect the current market conditions. While he sees a strong macro view for Litecoin, the coin is currently struggling on the charts. Crown discussed key support levels around $76 and suggested that Litecoin might present a compelling entry point for spot or long positions.\n\nCrown expressed a level of optimism for Litecoin\u2019s potential upside, even speculating on a return to near $100 over the next few months. He acknowledged the challenges but remained hopeful about Litecoin\u2019s future performance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential and the Anticipation of an ETF\n\nSwitching focus to Ethereum (ETH), Crown discussed the growing anticipation of an Ethereum ETF, following the trend set by Bitcoin.\n\nHe mentioned that the introduction of an Ethereum ETF could attract new investors and potentially lead to positive price movements. Crown analyzed Ethereum\u2019s chart, pointing out a flat top building around $2,100 and a series of higher lows, indicating potential upward momentum.\n\nRegarding price predictions, Crown suggested that if Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s move to $48,000 to $50,000, Ethereum could reach levels around $2,700 to $3,200.\n\nHe stressed the importance of maintaining the pattern of higher lows and indicated that Ethereum\u2019s performance might outpace Bitcoin during specific market phases."

        "title": "Ethereum and Solana Prices See Further Gains as This New Altcoin Also Gains Momentum - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin is currently edging toward $40K, leading many altcoins to yield impressive gains and even outperform the market leader.\n\nTwo of those are Ethereum and Solana, up 2.98% and 2.71%, respectively.\n\nETH Hits Yearly High While SOL Nears Resistance\n\nEthereum is priced at $2,167 and has just created a new local high as its uptrend continues. The move has generated significant excitement, causing its trading volume to spike 27% in the last day.\n\nCrypto analyst Wolf recently said, \u201c$ETH is consolidating above an 18-month ascending triangle weekly resistance.\u201d\n\nThe analyst speculates that this will be followed by a decisive breakout, stating, \u201cThe clock is ticking for the bears.\u201d\n\nX commentator Neil is also significantly bullish, recently warning against shorting Ethereum at its current level.\n\nThe trader tweeted, \u201cPeople asking me for entries to short $ETH and altcoins here,\u201d he continued, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me, $ETH just closed its highest 4hr candle over a 2 year long resistance, and you want to short?\u201d\n\nEvidently, Ethereum\u2019s recent breakout is driving tremendous optimism among analysts.\n\nBesides its bullish price chart, another factor potentially influencing Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment is that ETH has turned deflationary again.\n\nA recent tweet by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlighted that the growth rate of Ethereum\u2019s validator set has slowed down, reducing the ETH emissions alongside it.\n\nConsequently, the network\u2019s burn mechanism is outpacing emissions, rendering ETH deflationary.\n\nMeanwhile, the market is also optimistic about Solana as it approaches its resistance after a meteoric rise in the past months.\n\nCrypto analytics company Cryptonary recently published a Solana trading theory, suggesting that \u201cSOL shorts are at risk.\u201d\n\nThe deep-dive tweet notes that open interest is up, but funding is down. Cryptonary proposes that this translates to strong shorting activity and increases the chances of a short squeeze.\n\nA short squeeze is a forced liquidation of short (or sell) positions as the asset\u2019s price rises, causing it to go even higher.\n\nThe tweet says that if Solana breaks $61, it could ignite a short squeeze, pushing it to potential highs of $80.\n\nSolana\u2019s price has risen since the analysis, currently at $63.54. This puts it in an advantageous position to pump based on Cryptonary\u2019s accord.\n\nAnother crypto that analysts are bullish on is Bitcoin Minetrix. It is currently undergoing a presale, meaning investors can still get in at a discounted price before it launches on exchanges.\n\nRevolutionary Bitcoin Minetrix Token Also Looks Bullish as ICO Nears $5M\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is a compelling new cryptocurrency that enables anyone to earn free Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform.\n\nIt works by users staking $BTCMTX for mining credits, which they can burn on the platform for cloud mining power.\n\nThe project simplifies Bitcoin mining through its decentralized and secure cloud mining solution. It is beginner-friendly and much easier and faster to get started than traditional Bitcoin mining.\n\nAs such, its presale has enjoyed significant success, raising over $4.6 million in just two months.\n\nTop analysts are rallying behind the project\u2019s novel use case. No Bs Crypto recently speculated that it could produce over 100x gains after it launches on exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Wrubel explained why he is bullish to his 310K YouTube subscribers.\n\nOne of the project\u2019s main advantages is that the $BTCMTX token holds significant utility since users require it for staking, which will translate to high demand potential.\n\nFurthermore, its supply-side tokenomics are also promising, with most tokens being locked for staking and rewards paid out in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.\n\nThis creates optimal supply and demand dynamics, leading to significant price appreciation potential.\n\nInvestors can buy the Bitcoin Minetrix presale for $0.012, but they must hurry because its price will rise in three days.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, it supersedes the Ethereum mainnet regarding speed and energy efficiency thanks to its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain implemented the energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The network also processed only about 30 transactions per second, compared to Solana\u2019s record of 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nDue to its inherent features, the Solana network has been lauded as an ETH killer since its official launch in 2020. The term has also been used to describe some popular blockchains such as Cardano, Tezos, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\nSolana has also introduced toolsets to onboard developers from the Ethereum network into its ecosystem. In July, Solana Labs launched Solang, a compiler enabling developers familiar with Ethereum\u2019s programming language (Solidity) to write smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.\n\nDescribing the expression as \u201clame,\u201d Yakovenko argued that even though Solana and Ethereum have similarities, the latter will not be overshadowed by the initial.\n\nSolana Ranks Among Best Performing Cryptocurrencies\n\nAmong the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s SOL emerged as the best performer. Maintaining its ranking as the sixth-largest crypto by market capitalization, SOL has soared by over 220% in the last three months alone. These metrics supersede crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nGoing from as low as $17.9 to as high as $65.2, market experts suggest that the cryptocurrency will likely surpass the $70 price mark as active addresses increase.

        "content": "Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko made a post on the X app warning the public about sparking a cold war between Ethereum (ETH) and other protocols including Solana (SOL) which are generally referred to as \u2018ETH Killer\u201d\n\nSOL and ETH Can Co-Exist\n\nIn Yakovenko\u2019s opinion, pushing such narratives against Ethereum is lame as it harms the ecosystem. He suggested that protocols could coexist without challenges or threats of killing each other.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cPareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies,\u201d the Solana co-founder said.\n\nFurthermore, Anatoly expressed positivity in a future where \u201cDanksharding,\u201d a technology that allows blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks, will have enough bandwidth that accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data. To put it in perspective, danksharding is an Ethereum rollup scaling method where transactional throughput is expanded through the provision of additional storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s statement on Ethereum underscores the fact that SOL and ETH can coexist and even overlap without any inconveniences.\n\nSolana Founder Douses ETH Rivalry Push\n\nDespite the growing industry eulogy for Solana, Yakovenko has warned the community members against instigating unhealthy rivalry with the Ethereum protocol.\n\nThis was when MakerDAO Co-founder and CEO Rune Christensen announced plans to fork the protocol\u2019s NewChain on the Solana blockchain, away from Ethereum. The news sparked some reactions from Solana proponents who saw the transition as a battle of the best.\n\nYakovenko immediately pointed out that it was a general win for open source. \u201cI really hope that people in the Solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIn October, one Ethereum community member identified as jebus.eth tried to take a jab at Solana by referring to it as a \u201cCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don\u2019t understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Solana co-founder was quick to respond to him, emphasizing the fact that his protocol is a pursuit of an entirely stateless digital realm, where unhindered communication and transactions flow freely among the people, liberated from the control of capitalist middlemen and government surveillance."

        "content": "Loading... Loading...\n\nCryptocurrency Ethereum ETH was launched in 2015 and has become the second most valuable asset in the crypto sector over time. Here's a look at how an investment in Ethereum could turn you into a millionaire in the future, with the price trading higher over the last week.\n\nWhat Happened: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the cryptocurrency with a white paper released in 2014. Buterin's goal was to add scripting to make it easier for application development and to set up binding contracts.\n\nEthereum launched on July 30, 2015. During its first calendar year, Ethereum traded between $0.42 and $1.39.\n\nThe addition of Ethereum to cryptocurrency exchanges helped lead to increased value and interest from investors. On Coinbase, Ethereum became the second cryptocurrency to be added to the platform, following Bitcoin.\n\nMajor events like the fork of Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum Classic ETC/USD and the surge of interest in Ethereum based non-fungible tokens helped propel Ethereum further. A record sale of a Beeple NFT created interest in NFTs and Ethereum.\n\nEthereum hit an all-time high in November 2021, a time when many cryptocurrencies experiences their top levels.\n\nThe year 2022 brought several bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies and sent the price of Ethereum lower. The year also brought on the Ethereum merge that took the cryptocurrency from being a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Ethereum\n\nBecoming an Ethereum Millionaire: With Ethereum trading well below its all-time high, here's a look at what an investor would need to do today to become a future millionaire based on the cryptocurrency.\n\nIf Ethereum returns to an all-time high of $4,891.70, a holder would need to have 204.43 ETH to be a millionaire.\n\nToday, the 204.43 ETH can be purchased for $456,338.87. This represents the cost today to become a future millionaire if Ethereum can return to all-time highs.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Ethereum will go up in 2023 or in the future. Over the last seven days, Ethereum is up 12% and hitting new 52-week highs. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum is up over 80% year-to-date in 2023.\n\nRead Next: 5 Things That May Surprise You About Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Spanish officials detained Alejandro Cao de Benos, a Spanish aristocrat.\n\nHe allegedly enlisted Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions.\n\nSpanish officials detained on Thursday a pro-North Korea political activist aristocrat accused of aiding North Korea in circumventing international sanctions through crypto, according to a statement by the Spanish police.\n\nAlejandro Cao de Benos, the founder of advocacy group Korea Friendship Association, was indicted last year by US authorities for allegedly recruiting Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to unlawfully provide crypto services to North Korea.\n\n\u201cSuch accusations are totally false. There is not a single piece of evidence that proves that I hired or solicited the services of Virgil Griffith,\u201d Cao de Benos said in a public statement posted Sunday on X.\n\nThe police said investigation for his location began in mid-October, when the agents received a tipoff from Interpol indicating that Cao de Benos could be in Spain.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCao de Benos was released after a one-day detention.\n\n\u201cIt is a disgrace that the US empire abuses Interpol and Spain to carry out what is purely political persecution,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum researcher Virgil Griffith\n\nGriffith, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, was arrested in 2019 after a trip to North Korea to allegedly consult the regime on how to use crypto to evade international sanctions.\n\nHis keynote speech at the Pyongyang conference allegedly contained information on how to bypass sanctions, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut Griffith\u2019s advocates and his legal team have argued that the presentation did no more than recapitulate widely available information, which could be readily accessed online.\n\nGriffith\u2019s lawyer said that the trip was \u201cthe culmination of Virgil\u2019s unique and unfortunate curiosity and obsession with North Korea.\u201d\n\nHe received a 63-month prison sentence last year after pleading guilty to a charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The act forbids US citizens from exporting goods, services, or technology to North Korea without a licence from the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nHis lawyer told the Wall Street Journal that Griffith was \u201csincerely remorseful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Emms dodges the bullet\n\nBritish national Christopher Emms was also charged last year, alongside Cao de Benos, with the conspiracy to help North Korea access crypto. He had attended the same conference as Griffith.\n\nIn June, Emms said he received political asylum in Russia.\n\nAppearing on Russian state media RT yesterday, Emms called Cao de Benos\u2019 detention \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and said the \u201cUS government doesn\u2019t like when someone stands up to them.\u201d\n\nEmms told Blockworks last year that Cao de Benos contacted him through LinkedIn and invited him to the conference in Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cI did the typical crypto bro thing: I googled it. I checked the Foreign Office website as a UK citizen. I checked the UN website and I didn\u2019t see that speaking at a conference in North Korea was breaking any laws,\u201d Emms said.\n\nThe North Korea trip was \u201cincredibly naive,\u201d Emms said, but \u201cthe way we [the crypto industry] approached things was so different than we would right now. There was a lack of clarity on so many things.\u201d\n\nCrypto: North Korea\u2019s \u2018treasure sword\u2019\n\nNorth Korea calls crypto its \u201ctreasure sword,\u201d according to David Maxwell, senior fellow at the think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, who spoke with DL News in April.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s crypto arm known as Lazarus Group has stolen at least $3.4 billion in crypto since emerging in 2007, according to calculations by DL News.\n\n\u201cAll the money [the North Korean hackers] cash out goes to fund their missile programme,\u201d Erin Plante, vice-president of investigations at Chainalysis, told DL News in April. A report by Recorded Future last week said that North Korea loots enough crypto to fund almost half of its military budget.\n\nLast year, Lazarus hacked a record a $625 million in crypto, raiding the web3 game Axie Infinity.\n\nThat attack, said Plante, was \u201ca turning-point event where suddenly the US National Security Council cared and wanted to hear about it.\u201d"

        "content": "Mon 04 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nThis is the bombshell in the crypto sphere: Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana, has just made an unexpectedly mild statement regarding the Ethereum blockchain. While the two projects are often depicted as fierce competitors, Yakovenko sought to ease tensions during a notable address.\n\nA Crypto Plea for the Harmony of Blockchains\n\nContrary to all expectations, Anatoly Yakovenko has publicly taken a stand against the tendency to portray projects like Solana or Polkadot crypto as \u201cEthereum killers.\u201d A label well known to cryptocurrency enthusiasts to designate the potential successors to the Ethereum giant.\n\nYet, according to Yakovenko, such characterizations harm the entire crypto ecosystem, fomenting pointless rivalries between the various protocols. The Solana boss is thus calling for more collaboration, arguing that there\u2019s no need for one project to fail in order for another to thrive.\n\nA rather harmonious vision, especially when you know how intense the competition is in the crypto Wild West!\n\nETH is here to stay, according to the founder of Solana\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. In his diatribe, Anatoly Yakovenko goes so far as to pay tribute to the technical advances made by Ethereum, proving once again that he does not see it as an enemy to be taken down.\n\nThus, the founder of Solana even says he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about a future where both protocols would coexist peacefully. As evidence, he commends the efforts by Ethereum to scale its network through solutions like \u201csharding.\u201d\n\nThis cools the hopes of those who saw Solana as an Ethereum \u201ckiller\u201d! Because according to Yakovenko, not only is harmony possible between the two blockchains, but they are destined to prosper together.\n\nIn the end, Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s message marks a turning point in the crypto universe. By advocating accord over pointless confrontation, the Solana leader paves the way for a more mature approach to competition.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether his peers will follow such an exemplary lead. But it\u2019s reasonable to hope that this outstretched hand to the king Ethereum will contribute, if not to full reconciliation, then to calming tensions that are all too often counterproductive for the crypto ecosystem as a whole.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the week in great form, with BTC soaring past $41,800 and ETH trading above $2,200.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm around these two cryptos continues to ramp up due to optimism around institutional adoption and more favorable regulation.\n\nWith altcoin season now looking imminent, all eyes are turning to hot new projects like Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), which has raised over $4.7 million ahead of its exchange debut.\n\nBitcoin Rockets Past $40k as Spot ETF Hopes Build\n\nBitcoin has reclaimed the symbolic $40,000 level for the first time since April 2022, soaring nearly 6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis new high marks a stellar comeback for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, now up over 151% year-to-date.\n\nFueling this impressive rise is mounting optimism that a spot Bitcoin ETF may soon be approved in the US, with over a dozen proposals pending before the SEC.\n\nMajor players like BlackRock and Grayscale have reportedly met with regulators recently to iron out details.\n\nBullish projections also support this positive narrative \u2013 with Matrixport predicting that Bitcoin will hit $60,000 by April 2024.\n\nMatrixport also forecast that BTC could top $125,000 by the end of next year, citing historical trends around Bitcoin halvings.\n\nWith the next halving set for April 2024, there\u2019s a growing belief among traders that Bitcoin could continue climbing in the coming months.\n\nEthereum Trades Above $2k as Buying Pressure Ramps Up\n\nEthereum is also riding high, trading above $2,200 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nETH has gained over 22% in the past month, buoyed by the same tailwinds boosting Bitcoin and other altcoins.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s price spike also comes as excitement builds around a possible spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US.\n\nJust last week, the SEC opened public commentary on Fidelity\u2019s proposed rule change to list a spot Ethereum ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nThe filing argues that US investors lack regulated and safe exposure to ETH, forcing them into riskier alternatives.\n\nETH\u2019s price has responded positively to this development, as investors bet an ETF greenlight could boost institutional investment in the token.\n\nMany investors point to the futures ETFs that were approved in 2021 as a precedent, suggesting that the regulatory environment may be turning more favorable.\n\nAs such, expectations are mounting that 2024 could be the year that Ethereum finally cements itself as a mainstream financial asset.\n\nTrending Bitcoin Minetrix Token Introduces Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine Concept\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum continue surging, a new altcoin is also capturing the crypto community\u2019s attention \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nThis unique project introduces the concept of Stake-to-Mine, allowing users to earn BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt represents a groundbreaking model that requires no expensive mining equipment, instead letting users earn cloud mining credits to redeem for hash power.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix has already raised over $4.7 million in its ongoing presale, demonstrating the massive interest in this project.\n\nInvestors are also being drawn to Bitcoin Minetrix due to its high staking yields, which currently exceed 127% APY.\n\nAs the first project to debut Stake-to-Mine, Bitcoin Minetrix has obtained notable endorsements from crypto influencers.\n\nFor example, YouTuber VoskCoin, who has over 617,000 subscribers, released a video review of Bitcoin Minetrix, highlighting its potential as a game-changer in the crypto mining space.\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix platform has even been audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult, which confirmed the integrity and security of its smart contracts.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin halving potentially leading to further price increases for BTC, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Stake-to-Mine mechanism could become even more attractive to investors.\n\nDue to this, BTCMTX looks well-positioned to become a breakout star in the altcoin space as investors seek innovative ways to gain BTC exposure and tap into mining profits.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Just a over month ago, the cryptosphere resembled a post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nThe FTX FTT/USD fallout, regulatory headwinds and global economic tremors had left investors cowering under a blanket of fear.\n\nBitcoin BTC/USD, the once-mighty digital messiah, was dethroned, its price unceremoniously down below $20,000. Altcoins, once vibrant ecosystems, lay dormant.\n\nBut amidst the despair, whispers of hope began to flicker.\n\nA small band of crypto pundits, refusing to succumb to the prevailing pessimism, dared to predict a coming resurrection.\n\nThey were ridiculed and dismissed. Yet, today, those voices echo with the triumphant thunder of a market reborn, roaring back to life, each green tick a vindication of their audacious pronouncements.\n\nLet's take a moment to commemorate these modern-day Oracles and revisit their pronouncements.\n\nStandard Chartered: Leading the charge were the analysts at Standard Chartered.\n\nIn late October, amidst the smoldering ashes of FTX, they boldly reaffirmed their April prediction: Bitcoin hitting the six-figure mark by 2024's end.\n\nTheir gospel?\n\nA potent cocktail of a potential a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval and institutional investors finally warming up to the digital gold rush.\n\nMatrixport: Standard Chartered wasn't the only one raising the hallelujah chorus.\n\nMatrixport, a crypto financial services Goliath, upped the ante, predicting Bitcoin's ascent to $56,000 by year-end and a mind-boggling $65,000 by early next year.\n\nTheir conviction stemmed from the belief that the FTX saga and Binance's regulatory truce had cleansed the air, paving the way for a laser focus on blockchain's revolutionary potential.\n\nTim Draper: The ever-optimistic venture capitalist, Draper remained unfazed by the market's nosedive. In November, he doubled down on his $250,000 Bitcoin prophecy by 2025, citing the likes of Tesla Inc TSLA and Microsoft Corp MSFT embracing the crypto as a testament to its inevitable mainstream adoption.\n\nAlso Read: Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson Holds Bitcoin, Ether, Sushiswap, Uniswap In Her Portfolio\n\nSamson Mow: The CEO of crypto firm JAN3, took a victory lap into the future, predicting Bitcoin's potential to breach the $1 million mark within the next five years.\n\nHis reasoning?\n\nBitcoin's inherent scarcity and its potential to dethrone gold as the ultimate store of value.\n\nMike Novogratz: The Galaxy Digital CEO is the Bitcoin evangelist who was singing the praises for a $500,000 target in five years.\n\nHis melody?\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell found \u201chis central banking superpowers,\u201d he said.\n\nARK Invest: Cathie Wood's ARK Invest remained steadfast in her unwavering belief in the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.\n\nShe maintained her unwavering optimism that Bitcoin's value could soar to astounding heights, potentially reaching between $1 million and $1.5 million in the foreseeable future.\n\nBrian Armstrong: Even the ever-cautious Coinbase Global Inc Inc. COIN CEO conceded the possibility of a \"significant rally\" in the near future.\n\nArmstrong's reasoning? Institutional FOMO (fear of missing out) and a flight to quality towards established players such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThese are just a few of the many who dared to hope when all seemed lost.\n\nTheir predictions, while not engraved in stone, serve as a beacon of faith in the inherent resilience and boundless potential of the cryptosphere.\n\nAs we move forward, it will be a thrilling spectacle to witness whether their targets are met, and if their optimism paves the way for a golden age of mass adoption and groundbreaking innovation.\n\nRead Next: El Salvador's Bitcoin Success: President Bukele Weighs Next Steps After $3.6 Million Profit\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Mantle Launches Non-Custodial Liquid Staking Protocol on Ethereum\n\nEthereum layer-2 project Mantle has announced the launch of its new liquid-staking protocol, Mantle LSP.\n\nIn a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter), the proejct said Mantle LSP will allow users to deposit ETH and participate in network staking through validator nodes.\n\nThe introduction of the staking service represents Mantle\u2019s expansion following the deployment of its Layer 2 network.\n\nThe concept of liquid staking, which enables users to free up their capital from staked assets, has gained popularity on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this has resulted in a concentration of ETH stakes with major providers like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance.\n\nMantle aims to address this issue by offering a wider range of solutions.\n\nThe protocol originated from a proposal in the Mantle governance forum in July 2023 and has since undergone an alpha phase in October, followed by a permissionless phase to broaden access and participation.\n\nWith the launch of Mantle LSP, users can stake ether and receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH) as a token representing their stake.\n\n\u201cThe concentration of ETH staking is a result of network effect through a feedback loop of increasing name recognition and use case,\u201d said Jordi Alexander, Chief Alchemist at Mantle.\n\n\u201cBy focusing on mETH\u2019s adoption in LSDfi both in the Mantle ecosystem and beyond, and its capital efficiency in maintaining the highest sustainable yield, Mantle LSP intends to be a part of the solution by creating more options for users.\u201d\n\nSince merging with BitDAO in May 2023, Mantle has accumulated one of the most significant community treasuries in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAccording to DeepDAO, its treasury includes assets worth $470 million in ether and over $200 million in stablecoins.\n\nButerin Expresses Concern About Staking Concentration\n\n\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also joined the cult of those voicing concer regarding the concentration of power among Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking providers.\n\nLido, a prominent liquid staking pool, currently controls over 32% of the staked ether on Ethereum, with holdings distributed across different validators.\n\nAlongside Rocket Pool, Lido is a significant player in the ecosystem, but Buterin highlighted the need for more robust safety mechanisms.\n\nButerin proposed exploring additional solutions to enhance the safety and decentralization of liquid staking.\n\nAs reported, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of Ethereum.\n\nThe rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.\n\nRocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit rule.\n\nHowever, Lido Finance has decided not to commit to the self-limit rule.\n\nBack in June, the project put forward a proposal to impose a limit on Lido\u2019s maximum stake.\n\nLess than one half of one percent of the votes cast were in favor of the self-limit rule, while those holding more than 99% of Lido\u2019s governance tokens, LDO, voted for the protocol to not hold back on its growth.\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest staking provider, holds only an 8.7% market share, according to data from Dune Analytics."

        "title": "Price Prediction: Ethereum's (ETH) Upside Capped at $2,500, Pepe (PEPE) to Soar in December, Everlodge (ELDG ... - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nThe year is fast coming to an end, and traders are hoping to end it on a high note. According to analysts, Ethereum (ETH) is set for a downturn, while Pepe (PEPE) will ride a bullish wave in December. Meanwhile, Everlodge (ELDG), an up-and-coming project at the intersection of real estate, blockchain, and AI, is tipped for a 5,000% upside.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Potential Decline\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been in a consolidation phase for the majority of the week, with no directional bias. However, according to an analyst, we might be seeing a price correction, which largely depends on Bitcoin\u2019s price movement.\n\nAccording to FXStreet, Ethereum\u2019s top-down analysis suggests an upside capped at $2,500. They predict the Ethereum price might slide to $1,933 and $1,829 levels. But this is dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s price correction.\n\nThis Ethereum price prediction hasn\u2019t been met with much enthusiasm, though, as many remain bullish. The Ethereum price today is trading around the $2,000 level, albeit with rapid fluctuation.\n\nPepe (PEPE): Bullish December?\n\nPepe (PEPE) has grown in popularity since its launch. Following its explosive growth, it is one of the leading tokens in the memecoin ecosystem. Its meme appeal, deflationary nature, and no-tax policy capture investor interest.\n\nRecently, Changelly Blog made a promising Pepe coin price prediction. According to the news outlet, it will be a bullish December for the memecoin. The Pepe price was predicted to peak on December 30 with a 10% increase.\n\nThe Pepe coin price is currently at $0.000001085. Its bullish December price outlook makes it one of the altcoins to watch out for in the coming weeks.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Aiming for 5,000% Rally\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is a new player in the crypto landscape. That isn\u2019t all. It stands at the intersection of blockchain and the real estate sector. It will also leverage AI tools to ensure the best real estate experience.\n\nGiven the above, there has been a massive surge of interest in its ongoing presale. It is currently in the seventh round, and a token costs only $0.025. According to analysts, the price will soar by 5,000% after launch. This positions it as a more compelling investment than Pepe or Ethereum.\n\nHey, Lodgers! \ud83c\udfe1\n\n\n\nDo you know? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWith $ELDG, enjoy the warmth of passive income, monthly surprises, and exclusive club access.\n\nPlus, who can resist sweet discounts?\n\n\n\nDive into a token that feels like home. \ud83d\udc99\n\n\n\nJoin the presale: https://t.co/kIufYkD05d#Presale pic.twitter.com/9yzt5hZhul \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) September 26, 2023\n\nIts unique contribution to the crypto landscape is a property marketplace. This will allow fractional investment in luxury properties and vacation homes\u2014the first of its kind. With as little as $100, users can partially invest in and own villas and vacation homes in highly sought-after areas.\n\nIts blend with AI further makes it appealing. The AI tool will monitor and scan global property prices in all territories. This will provide an up-to-date snapshot so that users can make informed decisions.\n\nThe AI tool can be used to predict and discover emerging and undervalued property markets. Two years ago, it was Dubai, which the tool would have predicted. In summary, Everlodge seeks to improve the real estate experience, including lowering income barriers ($100) and ensuring users make profits.\n\nFor more information about Everlodge (ELDG) please visit their website.\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."
