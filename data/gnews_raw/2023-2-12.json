        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says that Ethereum is destined to reach a five-figure price in the next crypto bull market, and that some of ETH\u2019s biggest rivals will outperform.\n\nIn a new interview teaser with Altcoin Daily, Pal says that Ethereum will probably present the best risk-adjusted returns moving forward, but that plenty of other competing altcoin projects could still post higher gains.\n\n\u201cETH is the money of the internet. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lose that. But, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best performer. Because we\u2019re going to push use cases elsewhere for innovation.\n\nWe\u2019ve got things like Sui coming. Aptos hasn\u2019t been fully utilized yet. We need to see the network effects. Solana, I think they\u2019re aiming for the broadest adoption by making it a consumer-friendly place, to onboard normies. That\u2019s very powerful. If they get that right\u2026 and their work with people like Meta and stuff like that \u2013 Instagram \u2013 is very interesting. That\u2019s super amazing.\n\nPolygon, amazing group, what are they doing? They\u2019re onboarding a lot of people. They\u2019ve got a lot of throughput, super interesting.\n\nSui hasn\u2019t even come on to the market yet, and that is faster, incredible team, stuff like that, so there\u2019s a lot going on here. But ETH is the easiest way because it\u2019s probably got the least risk.\u201d\n\nThe macro expert says that he has a rough price target of about $10,000 for ETH, though he\u2019s not a fan of price predictions.\n\n\u201cI hate doing it but, I don\u2019t see any reason why it\u2019s not above $10,000. I see no reason at all why it\u2019s not above $10,000 so that\u2019s a decent upside from here.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,525.\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The crypto market did not respond well to the SEC's attack on crypto exchange Kraken as Ethereum fell on Monday. Photo: Dado Ruvic/Reuters (Dado Ruvic / reuters)\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) dropped 9% in value on Monday, after crypto-exchange Kraken agreed to end its crypto staking for US customers and pay $30m (\u00a324.9m) to settle a Security Exchange Commission (SEC) charge.\n\nThe crypto market did not respond well to the SEC's attack on Kraken, as the announcement brought an end to the climb of bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum since the beginning of 2023.\n\nPaxos, which partners with Binance to issue the BUSD stablecoin (BUSD-USD), has also been told by a New York regulator to halt the minting of new coins, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap has digested the latest regulatory attacks on the industry by falling 1.6% in 24 hours to $1.05tn, according to Coingecko.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEthereum dropped 9% in the past seven days to $1,483, while bitcoin fell 6.2% to $21,537.\n\nWatch: US Senator: 'Digital assets will be as big as the internet itself' | The Crypto Mile\n\nThe decent into the red began in earnest last Thursday when SEC chair Gary Gensler announced he would be charging Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale of its \"staking as a service\" program.\n\nKraken, which is the third largest crypto-exchange in the world after Binance and Coinbase (COIN), had been offering staking services for at least half a dozen crypto tokens, including ethereum. The exchange advertised annual returns of as high as 21% on some staked instruments.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nGensler said: \"Today the SEC charged Kraken for the unregistered offer and sale of securities through its staking-as-a-service program. Whether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries must provide the proper disclosures & safeguards required by our laws.\"\n\nGensler released a video to explain to the US public why the SEC is taking such a strict stance against platforms that offer staking services.\n\nToday @SECGov charged Kraken for the unregistered offer & sale of securities thru its staking-as-a-service program.\n\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries must provide the proper disclosures & safeguards required by our laws. \u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) February 9, 2023\n\nWhat is 'staking' and how does it relate to Ethereum?\n\nIn the case of ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in the world, you need 32 ether to create your own staking node and receive \"staking rewards\" in the same currency. This is called Solo Staking.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, most people do not have 32 ethereum to create a node on their own. But, they can instead use a centralised cryptocurrency exchange that offer \"staking as a service\" options.\n\nIn this process they hand over their crypto tokens to the centralised crypto exchange where the tokens are then pooled together and used to help validate transactions on the blockchain. The exchange gets a percentage of the blockchain's staking reward, and so does the customer.\n\nRead more: What is the digital pound and when can you expect it?\n\nThe SEC wants crypto exchanges to register these financial instruments as securities before offering them to customers. This is because staking has risks that are not being articulated to the customer, the SEC said.\n\nOn Saturday Gensler told Andrew Sorkin of the New York Times: \"Investors need to know what Kraken, or any other exhange, is doing with these staked tokens, are they trading against the tokens, or borrowing against those tokens, are they using them for theur own purposes?\"\n\nReferring to November's implosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, Gensler said: \"We have seen this in the crypto field before\".\n\nGensler has said on numerous occasions that the only digital asset that he believes is not a security is bitcoin, which he has conceded should be under the observation of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nIn his interview with Sorkin, Gensler added: \"What kraken was doing was asking the American public for their coins, and saying that they will give them a return of between 4% and 21%.\"\n\nGensler cited the Howey Test which is used in the US to discern the difference between investing in a security or a commodity, like copper or wheat.\n\nHe said: \"The problem with Kraken was that they were not disclosing to the investing public the risks that they were entering into.\n\nRead more: Crypto: Will UK banks adopt CBDCs and stablecoins?\n\n\"We have a basic bargain in the United States since the 1930s, you can take whatever risk you want, companies like Kraken can offer investment contracts and investment schemes, but they have to have full, fair and truthful disclosure.\n\n\"This puts the investors in a better position, that's are basic bargain. Kraken where not compliing with that basic law.\"\n\nHe said that the charge against Kraken \"should put everyone on notice who operates in the crypto marketplace\".\n\nHe added: \"When these exchanges take you tokens to put them in staking pools and if that exchange goes bankrupt, the customer stands in line at the bankruptcy court.\n\n\"There is a saying in crypto, not your keys not your coins. Those other platforms who offer staking should take note of this and seek to come into compliance and do the proper disclosures, and registration and the like.\"\n\nWhat is a security?\n\nIn the US, a security is a tradable financial asset, including debt and equity securities (common stocks), and derivatives like forwards, futures, options, and swaps.\n\nThe Howey Test in the US is a method of differentiating between a security and a commodity.\n\nIt is is used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an \"investment contract\" and is subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIt applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction and determines if there is an \"investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\"\n\nThis is important for assessing blockchain and digital currency projects, as some cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may meet the test's definition of an \"investment contract.\"\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the national authority regulating financial markets in the UK, and its definition of \"security\" in the Handbook includes equities, debentures, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates, units, pension schemes, investments, and anything on the Official List.\n\nWatch: Kraken ending its crypto staking services for US customers, former SEC attorney weighs in\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has now made at least two substantial contributions to help the victims of last week\u2019s devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria.\n\nThe 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck on Feb. 6. Its death toll has now risen to 33,000 \u2014 one of the world\u2019s worst in decades.\n\nOver the week, the Ethereum co-founder has been one of many actively donating Ether (ETH) to support relief efforts in Turkey. His latest donation was on Feb. 12 for 50 ETH, or approximately $77,000, sent to Anka Relief, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield.\n\nAnka thanked the Ethereum co-founder for his largesse and said that crypto donations had been flowing since the first day.\n\n\u201cSince day 1 of the disaster, we witnessed donations piling in the wallets of a handful of major NGOs. Great that they have attracted and will be attracting more funds,\u201d said the organization.\n\nWe want to thank @VitalikButerin for donating 50 ETH ~$75k to Anka Relief, a crypto aid fund & community to support T\u00fcrkiye after the recent earthquakes. https://t.co/kGwXSGWL8J\n\n\n\nDive into the thread below to better understand our mission and ops\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/92CkxevI5e \u2014 Anka Relief (@AnkaRelief) February 12, 2023\n\nAnka provided a list of crypto wallets than can be used for donations. The Web3 relief support organization has also spearheaded the Ukraine DAO project to raise crypto donations to support efforts in the besieged country.\n\nThe latest donation adds to another 99 ETH that Vitalik sent in support of earthquake victims. On Feb. 11 the vitalik.eth address sent around $150,000 worth of ETH to Ahbap, a nongovernmental and nonprofit organization dedicated to relief efforts in Turkey.\n\nAhbap has also provided several crypto addresses for various tokens it can accept as donations.\n\nTo date, it claims to have received $4.3 million in crypto donations, with stablecoins being the most popular tokens sent. According to Etherscan, the Ahbap wallet contains 409 ETH, worth $622,000 at the time of writing.\n\nOn Feb. 10, London\u2019s Financial Times reported that crypto donations had been pouring in from across the globe. More than $10 million in crypto had been sent by companies, with Binance alone donating $5 million in support of Turkish relief efforts.\n\nBinance also announced $100 in BNB (BNB) airdrops to those in the hardest-hit areas last week.\n\nRelated: The Web3 community responds to Turkish\u2013Syrian earthquake tragedy\n\nOn Feb. 7, just a day after the devastating quake, Cointelegraph reported how the Web3 community was coming together to arrange crypto donations for NGOs and support.\n\nIt is not the first time crypto has been used for earthquake relief donations. In 2015, Bitcoin donations were sent to relief organizations following a massive quake in Nepal."

        "content": "ETH bears are losing momentum after a strong pullback in the last few days.\n\nETH exchange balances reach 4-year lows as outflows continue.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency just concluded the week with a sizable bearish pullback. There is more directional uncertainty as a result, but multiple indicators and metrics may offer some much-needed clarity.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETH worth today?\n\nFor perspective, ETH\u2019s $1534 price tag represents a 9% pullback within the last five days.\n\nA couple of things to note about the price action- The pullback puts it within the 50% RSI level and the bears seem to have lost most of their momentum at this level. In addition, the outflows indicated by the MFI are leveling out.\n\nMore importantly, ETH\u2019s 50-day Moving average recently crossed above the 200-day MA from below, forming a golden cross. The latter is a bullish sign, hence this may yield bullish expectations among investors.\n\nDo ETH bulls have a chance to regain dominance?\n\nSome of ETH\u2019s on-chain metrics are leaning in favor of bullish expectations. The latest Glassnode alerts reveal that the cryptocurrency has been flowing out of exchanges. ETH\u2019s balance on exchanges tanked to a 4-year low of 18,946,696.667 ETH.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Balance on Exchanges just reached a 4-year low of 18,946,696.667 ETH Previous 4-year low of 18,948,275.315 ETH was observed on 11 February 2023 View metric:https://t.co/1dCpD2ey8E pic.twitter.com/45yugPfDec \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) February 12, 2023\n\nMost of the ETH flowing out of exchanges is likely headed into DeFi. This may explain the total value of ETH locked in ETH 2.0 deposit contracts just soared to a new ATH.\n\nThis is important because it confirms that ETH holders are more confident in allowing their coins to stay in DeFi. A sign of a favorable shift towards longer-term expectations.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 15,792,103 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/Ydzv8JmVY5 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) February 12, 2023\n\nAssessing the level of ETH demand in the market\n\nThe supply of ETH held by the top 1% of addresses registered a slight increase in the last few days.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of ETH addresses holding over 1,000 coins grew slightly in the last three days as opposed to the downside registered since the start of February.\n\nThis confirms that the bears are no longer in control and the taps causing sell pressure are running dry. But what about the demand situation on the derivatives side of things?\n\nWe did see a drop in open interest in the second half of last week but it is now pivoting in favor of the upside.

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of Feb. 13 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nAfter hints that it was on the verge of breaking into a strong bullish season, the cryptocurrency market has fallen back again to reside in the red over the past week. Investors may be unhappy that the market has still failed to break resistance levels, but at least some tokens have been performing unusually well.\n\nThis week, we focus on Oasis Network (ROSE), Mina (MINA), Hedera (HBAR), Lido DAO (LDO), and Rocket Pool (RPL). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Oasis Network\u2019s ROSE token was one of the biggest gainers this week, with a price increase of 35%, probably thanks to stronger open interest.\n\nThe MINA coin also made a sizable jump, of 32%, likely due to improvements in decentralization and security at the Mina network.\n\nHBAR's price went up 21% after Dell joined its governing council. The network\u2019s ecosystem also has been experiencing growth.\n\nThe LDO token's price increased by 16% amid rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may ban staking services offered by centralized crypto platforms.\n\nThe Ethereum staking-focused RPL token also rose, by 15%, as the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in March gets closer.\n\n\n\nOasis Network (ROSE)\n\nOne of the biggest gainers of the week, the ROSE token of the Oasis Network, possibly benefited from multiple developments within its ecosystem and network. The primary reason for the price bump of about 35% might be the fact that the team on Feb. 2 released its roadmap for 2023, which described launches and improvements. There has also been a sharp increase in open interest, reaching nearly $30 million at Oasis.\n\nOasis Network is a scalability and privacy-focused network built using the Cosmos software development kit (SDK), which is a set of software tools and programs used by developers to create applications. The ROSE token is now priced at around 0.072 cent after beginning last week at 0.055 cent (see chart below).\n\n\n\nROSE (TradingView)\n\nMina (MINA)\n\nMina (MINA) was the next big gainer this week, with the token rising by about 32% to trade at around 93 cents. (see chart below). The price might have been boosted by the launch in late January of a proof of concept that would allow anyone to run a web node on a browser. A proof of concept is an exercise in which work is focused on determining whether an idea can be turned into reality. The effort may eventually allow anyone to run a lightweight node to help run blockchain applications across Web3 and mobile devices.\n\nThe effort is a part of Mina\u2019s overall ethos of increasing accessibility and being the \u201cworld\u2019s lightest blockchain.\u201d The network makes use of the novel zero-knowledge proofs technology to power its smart contracts.\n\n\n\nMINA (TradingView)\n\nHedera (HBAR)\n\nHeder\u2019s HBAR price increased by roughly 21% after it said that Dell Technologies (DELL) would join the Hedera Governing Council. Dell will run its own node, build its own application, and help automate distributed ledger technology.\n\nHedera\u2019s ecosystem has also posted growth in recent weeks, including the launch of a non-fungible token (NFT) series called Ashfall NFT. It also publicized the arrival of a metaverse fund valued at $1 million that focuses on Africa\u2019s creative industry. The HBAR coin is now valued at about 0.081 cent, after being priced at 0.069 cent last week (see chart below).\n\nHBAR (TradingView)\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nThe price of Lido DAO (LDO) gained by about 16% as users flocked to non-custodial means of staking Ether. Lido is a liquid staking platform for Ethereum and similar assets.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong recently tweeted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may consider banning staking for retail investors. In reaction to that, crypto users have flocked to self-custodial ETH staking services. LDO now stands at about $2.27. It was priced at about $2.04 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nLDO (TradingView)\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) advanced about 15% in price as Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade in March approaches. The Shanghai upgrade for the Ethereum network is a hard fork that will let holders of ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, unstake the assets for the first time, giving them greater access to their holdings. This week, the RPL token is valued at around $41.06 (see chart below).\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will be a major milestone for the Rocket Pool network, which is a staking service for Ether that recently crossed $1 billion in total value locked in. Crypto users have increasingly locked funds into Ethereum and are eager to be able to unstake some of those assets."

        "title": "How to Bridge to Ethereum Layer 2s - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Say goodbye to high gas fees and slow transactions. This step-by-step guide will show you how to bridge your assets and enjoy faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum suffers from a very good problem to have: it\u2019s popular.\n\nBut with so many people using it and many applications being built upon it, users pay the price, literally. High network congestion drives up transaction costs and makes it difficult for the network to scale.\n\nThat\u2019s where layer-2 blockchains come in.\n\nA layer\u20132 blockchain is a protocol built atop a layer-1 blockchain such as Ethereum. They borrow the L1\u2019s security attributes and help reduce congestion (and fees) by ferrying transactions off the mainnet in bulk. After executing the transactions, L2s submit a compressed version of their blocks back to the mainnet.\n\nThus, L2 scaling solutions offer the security of Ethereum with fees that shouldn\u2019t burn through your savings. They\u2019re ideal for most regular users, who are overpaying for security they don\u2019t practically need; L2s are less expensive and almost as secure as Ethereum. Here is how you can start using the L2 ecosystem.\n\nStep 1: Choose an L2 for You\n\nThe L2s operating on Ethereum today differ in how they commit to Ethereum. Users can make the most of L2s by understanding their benefits and associated tradeoffs:\n\nZK rollups: Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups scale Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and submitting a lightweight validity proof (calculated off-chain) on the Ethereum chain to finalize the transaction batch. Instead of a trash compactor, it\u2019s a transaction compactor that frees up space on the network. One benefit of ZK rollups is that transactions finalize almost instantly. But users pay the price for this (though fees are still lower than they\u2019d typically be on Ethereum). Two popular scaling solutions, StarkNet and Loopring , use ZK-STARKs and ZK-SNARKs, respectively. Polygon is also working on a ZK-based scaling solution called zkEVM .\n\nOptimistic rollups: Optimistic rollups work similarly to ZK rollups by batching transactions and executing them on the L2 instead of on Ethereum. However, to keep fees low, they assume transactions are valid unless someone proves otherwise. Other users can submit fraud proofs during a challenge period that lasts around a week. The downside is that transactions don\u2019t become final until the challenge period ends, so users must wait to move their funds directly from the rollup back to Ethereum. Arbitrum and Optimism are two popular optimistic rollups on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to L2s, there\u2019s one other type of scaling solution worth knowing about:\n\nSidechains: Sidechains are not technically L2s because they do not inherit Ethereum\u2019s security. Instead, they operate with separate validators and consensus processes but connect to the Ethereum chain via a two-way bridge. While very scalable, their bespoke security setups may leave them vulnerable to centralization. Polygon PoS is a popular sidechain.\n\nSelecting a specific scaling design can be overwhelming. In addition to factors such as throughput and fees, users must also consider ease of use and their comfort level with security. Bridging across all L2s follows similar steps, but we have used Arbitrum One to illustrate the steps below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Ethereum Wallet\n\nBefore you can start using an L2, you must first set up your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask is the most popular online wallet for the Ethereum ecosystem, but you may also use others, such as WalletConnect. (The steps below will use MetaMask.)\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, install MetaMask on your preferred device and create a wallet by setting a password and securely copying the seed phrase. You now have an Ethereum account!\n\nNext, head into your MetaMask settings and add your destination network.\n\nNote that when you add another L2 network, Metamask will do so under the same public address. Add sufficient ETH into your Ethereum wallet to cover the desired amount and gas, which is the unit of transaction fees on the Ethereum network. The gas cost rises as traffic on the Ethereum network increases, and is known to cost anywhere between a few dollars and a few hundred dollars. Because the gas is unaffected by the value of the tokens you transfer, we\u2019d advise transferring all the funds you expect to use on the L2 in one go. It\u2019s the difference between paying a transaction fee just once or a similarly sized fee every time you transfer.\n\nStep 3: Start Bridging\n\nYou have two general choices for bridging. You can use the official gateway (in this case, Arbitrum) or select a third-party bridge such as Multichain or Celer. (Third-party bridges sometimes offer competitive fees and broader network options.) Gas fluctuates frequently, so double-check gas charges before submitting the transaction to ensure you pay the expected amount. If gas gets too high, you can either wait for it to cool down or pay the premium. Once final, the transaction becomes immutable.\n\nAn Arbitrum transaction sample\n\nArbitrum vs. Ethereum fee comparison\n\nStep 4: Verify the Transaction on Etherscan\n\nEtherscan is a blockchain explorer. Since the genesis block, it has stored all publicly available information like gas, block time, and transaction hash for all Ethereum transactions. To make sure your transaction went to the L2, enter the address.\n\nEtherscan sample\n\nStep 5: Use the L2\n\nLayer\u20132 networks are brimming with activity these days. From DeFi to the metaverse, nearly every mainstream application on Ethereum is compatible with leading L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Trade tokens on Uniswap, buy NFTs on OpenSea, or do whatever you would otherwise use Ethereum for \u2014 only with cheaper transactions.\n\nDapps on Arbitrum | Source: DefiLlama\n\nPro tip: If you like to try out new or experimental applications, keep in mind that they could be malicious or untested. Minimize the risk of losing your funds by spreading them across multiple addresses.\n\nYou can manage multiple addresses on MetaMask\n\nStep 6: Head Back to Ethereum\n\nMoving funds back to Ethereum is optional. Some users secure their L2 earnings by sending them to Ethereum, while others never return. If you do choose to bridge back to Ethereum, follow the same steps as before, this time with the L2 as the sender chain.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions can be nearly as secure as Ethereum at a fraction of the cost. Users can make the most of L2s by finding a rollup design that suits their needs.\n\nL2s are so crucial to the Ethereum ecosystem that an entire phase of the Ethereum improvement roadmap is dedicated to making them more efficient and economical. Dubbed \u201cthe Surge,\u201d this next phase will boost the utility of L2s by enabling transactions to become final in under a second."

This upcoming network upgrade has the potential to take Ethereum to new heights and change the game for crypto investors.\n\nBut, what exactly is this upgrade, and how will it impact the Ethereum price?\n\nLast September, the long-awaited merger of the Beacon Chain with Ethereum (The Merge) was finally accomplished, and it was a huge moment for the crypto community. This upgrade was highly anticipated for years and set the foundation for Ethereum 2.0 a fully scalable Layer1 blockchain for the Web3. Despite the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, Ethereum still needs more scalability.\n\nThis is where the Shanghai Upgrade comes in. This upgrade will pave the way for introducing sharding, which will finally make Ethereum scalable. The Hard Fork is scheduled for mid-March and will allow Ethereum validators and investors to withdraw their staked Ethereum (ETH) from the Beacon Chain for the first time since its introduction in December 2020.\n\nWith around 16.4 million ETH, or approximately one-seventh of all Ethereum, currently locked on the Beacon Chain, worth a total of $26 billion, the Hard Fork has the potential to have massive implications for the entire Ethereum ecosystem and, ultimately, the price of ETH.\n\nGet Ready to Unlock the Power of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade!\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is constantly evolving, and the latest update from the Ethereum community is no exception. The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is a big step forward for the future of the Ethereum network, and it\u2019s about to make a big impact.\n\nAt the heart of the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade is EIP-4895, a proposal that will unlock the 16.4 million ETH that\u2019s currently locked up on the Ethereum network.

If you look at the list of applications that were in the Ethereum Whitepaper, and you look at the applications that are popular today, the big thing that\u2019s in the second list and not the first is NFTs.\u201d\n\nInstead, Vitalik had foreseen smart contracts shaping finance, resulting in the current spark in decentralized finance, and other fortes.\n\nAt the moment, decentralized finance protocols, including Lido Finance, MakerDAO, and Uniswap, are among the top dApps with billions in total value locked (TVL).\n\nUniswap, for example, has dominated the decentralized swapping of tokens, recently introducing the support of NFTs. During the interview, Vitalik said the launch of Uniswap in late 2018 ushered in the era of DeFi. By early 2020, DeFi TVL rose to above $1b for the first time.\n\nOther noteworthy applications in DeFi include MakerDAO, which was reported to be one of the most active DAOs, together with Optimism DAO. The protocol has impacted how users can lend and borrow digital assets without including the services of a third party.\n\nAs an industry, DeFi protocols control over $48b of different assets in protocols launched in several blockchains, including in Ethereum, the BNB Chain, Cardano, Polygon, and others.\n\nNFTs are core to crypto\n\nAmid the expansion of DeFi, gaming, metaverse, and other applications in Ethereum and smart contracting platforms is the rise of NFTs. NFTs allow users to create unique assets which, like fungible tokens, can be transferred in public chains. In Ethereum, NFTs mostly comply with the ERC-721 standard. However, depending on what its creators want, it can be designed to adopt other NFT standards, including ERC 1155.\n\nNFTs have found application in various spheres, including DeFi. For instance, Uniswap v3 uses liquidity NFTs, while gaming and metaverse platforms integrate NFTs to reward players.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Around $321 million of Wrapped ETH (wETH) was stolen.\n\nAccording to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the hacker\u2019s associated wallet has become active once again, moving $46 million worth of crypto assets.\n\nThis was made up of around 24,400 Lido Finance-wrapped Ethereum staking token (wstETH), worth approximately $41.4 million, and 3,000 Rocket Pool Ethereum staking token (rETH), worth about $5 million, which was moved to MakerDAO.\n\nThe hacker appears to be seeking yield or arbitrage opportunities on their stolen loot as the assets were exchanged for 16.6 million DAI, PeckShield reported.\n\nThe MakerDAO stablecoin was then used to buy 9,750 ETH priced at around $1,537 and 1,000 stETH. These were then wrapped back into 9,700 wstETH.\n\nOn Feb. 10, an on-chain sleuth observed that the hacker was \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d\n\nHowever, the price of Ether (ETH) has since fallen below those levels over the past few hours. At the time of writing, ETH was down 2.6% on the day at $1,505, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAt the time of the transfers, stETH prices depegged from Ethereum and climbed as high as $1,570. At time of writing, they were trading 2.4% higher than ETH at $1,541. Furthermore, wstETH also had depegged and risen to $1,676, 11.3% higher than the underlying asset.\n\nRelated: Crypto exploit losses in January see nearly 93% year-on-year decline\n\nThe latest funds movement comes only a few weeks after the hacker moved another $155 million worth of Ethereum to a decentralized exchange.\n\nOn Jan. 24, 95,630 ETH was sent to the OpenOcean DEX and then subsequently converted into ETH-pegged assets, including Lido\u2019s stETH and wstETH."

        "title": "Infura is to blame for MetaMask's violation of the crypto spirit - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Censorship resistance is the foundation of crypto, so for many cryptocurrency purists, the Nov. 23 announcement by ConsenSys, the New York-based company behind the leading Ethereum browser wallet, informing its 20 million MetaMask users that their IP and wallet addresses would be collected was simply a gross violation of the crypto spirit.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, ConsenSys first reacted by saying the data collected would only be retained for seven days and then that it had updated the MetaMask features to allow users to opt out of Infura. However, the question remains: Have they done enough to establish crypto resistance?\n\nWhile many may be OK with MetaMask tracking users\u2019 wallets and IP addresses, many more of us are not because blockchain is supposed to be about decentralization and giving people the power to control their data and their finances without intermediaries \u2014 such as banks and governments.\n\nRelated: Are we still mad at MetaMask and ConsenSys for snooping on us?\n\nFor the sake of a healthy debate, let\u2019s say we are fine with MetaMask tracking users\u2019 wallets and IP addresses in certain acceptable instances. Those reasons could be in the case of a malicious attack. The information gathered by the Infura protocol could help track down the criminals involved.\n\nPerhaps, more importantly for ConsenSys, the \u201cspying\u201d could have more to do with official regulations, such as Know Your Customer laws, Anti-Money Laundering laws and financing terrorism.\n\nHowever, the reasoning behind the decision to \u201cspy\u201d or end MetaMask user privacy features is highly concerning \u2014 and even a bit frightening \u2014 because it clearly contravenes the crypto spirit.\n\nControl and ownership back to users\n\nThe crypto spirit centers on putting people back in control of their assets so they can do what they with them and when they wish and have ownership over their data so they can participate in the decentralized economy, such as the machine economy, by monetizing their information.\n\nInfura is mainly to blame for violating the crypto spirit by tracking users\u2019 IP and Ether (ETH) wallet addresses while advising MetaMask\u2019s users to spin up a whole new Ethereum node or to use a different node provider if they are so concerned over lnfura\u2019s intrusions.\n\nSo MetaMask says \"Just don't use Infura\" - so let's see how easy MetaMask makes it to \"not use Infura\".\n\n\n\nPart 1 - Installation:\n\n\n\nThe first two screens are straight forward here. They seem to provide a clear privacy policy, that's good. pic.twitter.com/9HqLo4h18U \u2014 Chase Wright (mysticryuujin.eth ) (@mysticryuujin) November 25, 2022\n\nSuppose Infura (or any other API provider) holds users\u2019 IP and ETH addresses. In that case, it can quickly locate the user\u2019s home and tie it back to all the ETH assets and on-chain transactions users have made. That is quite scary.\n\nContradictory intrusions\n\nThat raised a fascinating debate among the crypto community. While the Ethereum blockchain provides censorship resistance, API providers such as Infura, which provide access to the Ethereum blockchain, are not obligated contradictorily to be censorship resistant.\n\nThat represents a considerable risk for users of MetaMask or, for that fact, any other wallet, such as these Ethereum API nodes, because it makes them vulnerable to censorship without any prior notification or warning.\n\nRelated: Coinbase is fighting back as the SEC closes in on Tornado Cash\n\nAnd then came Alchemy and MyEtherWallet, which tried to \u201ccash in on MetaMask users\u2019 concerns,\u201d only to surface as two crypto wallet solutions that also track user data.\n\nIt is true that anyone can send Bitcoin (BTC) to anyone \u2014 even if the police or government doesn\u2019t approve. However, if BTC were not censorship-resistant, those authorities could seize or block that Bitcoin. Crypto was created with censorship resistance in mind because we need and cherish our right to privacy.\n\nIt is also ironic. Blockchain developers have racked their brains to design the chain to be censorship resistant. However, the API node provider \u201chijacks\u201d the original intention and silently changes it, and all the while, the potential victims \u2014 users \u2014 are not informed of the modifications.\n\nIn light of Infura\u2019s violations of the \u201ccrypto spirit,\u201d here are two considerations.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts should continue monitoring API providers and notifying communities when they behave unethically\n\nMonitoring from the public is required, as done by the two whistleblowers via their Twitter accounts.\n\nMetaMask and other wallets must inform users immediately and clarify the terms of their privacy. For example, they should tell users they are using Infura, which does not ensure their privacy 100%. That, arguably, was not done properly or in a sufficiently overt manner in November.\n\nBuilders of decentralized applications (DApps) should be responsible for notifying people that an API node in use is not secure or censorship-resistant to raise awareness.\n\nWhat type of technology can address this concern soundly?\n\nAPI node-as-a-service makes it simple for non-tech users to spin up API nodes for their wallets. That should be as easy for both users and developers alike as purchasing a VPN service.\n\nIn math we trust. Technology always fights for freedom on behalf of people. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently posted an \u201cIncomplete Guide to Stealth Addresses,\u201d which does not require new technology. However, if implemented on Ethereum, they partially address the privacy violation concerns raised by Infura. People can still locate a user\u2019s house using Infura, but not their on-chain transactions or assets.\n\nRaullen Chai is the co-founder and CEO of IoTeX.

According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the donations were directed to Anka Relief, a Web3 relief support group that also organised the Ukraine DAO project. The latest donation adds to another 99 ETH that Vitalik sent in support of earthquake victims.\n\nWhile highlighting the current support by Buterin, Anka praised the efforts of the Ethereum co-founder for his generosity and said \u201cSince day one of the disaster, we have witnessed donations piling in the wallets of a handful of major NGOs. Great that they have attracted and will be attracting more funds.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of continuous help from the crypto industry, a report from Etherscan, a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, suggests that the Ahbap wallet contains 409 ETH worth $622,000. It further claimed to have received $4.3 million in crypto donations, with stablecoins topping the chart.\n\nCrypto industry offering help\n\nThe Financial Times of London reported late last week that donations in cryptocurrency have been flooding in from all across the world. Companies had sent more than $10 million in cryptocurrency, with Binance alone offering $5 million to help the nation.\n\nPrior to this, cryptocurrencies have also been used for earthquake relief donations and to help with war efforts in Ukraine. The devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015 marked the maximum support in the form of donations in Bitcoin to relief organisations."

Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of reds and greens across the board. The Render Token (RNDR) became the top gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 13 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.01 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.49 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $21,828.45, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.09 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 18.75 lakhs.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price today\n\nETH price stood at $1,518.99, marking a 24-hour dip of 0.88 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 1.32 lakhs.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) price today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour loss of 0.17 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.08179.

Bitcoin's value dipped below $22,000 following the US-based Kraken crypto exchange's decision to halt its staking service and pay a $30 million fine to the SEC for not registering the service. The current trading price of Bitcoin, near its support level of $21,770, is bearish, and if the trend continues, it could fall to $21,500 by the end of the week. Currently, Bitcoin does not show any signs of a midterm price recovery.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cThe Crypto market is feeling the impact of global regulations. Liquid staking token prices surged after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Kraken reached a settlement which clarified that staking as a technical service will continue in the US but with more transparency around tokens going into the staking pool, to prevent fund misuse. Bitcoin\u2019s price fell due to the SEC verdict that Kraken will cease its US operations. Ethereum\u2019s price went down by almost 1.6 percent.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin price drops below $21,750, downtrend could continue with potential to reach $21,200. If the price breaks below this level, further declines may occur with the next support level at $20,600. Despite the current decline, with support from the 200-day EMA, there may be an opportunity for another top if the market holds above $20,300.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cOver the weekend, there was significant growth observed in certain subsectors of the cryptocurrency market. However, the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating and charging Paxos for their involvement with the BUSD stablecoin, which highlights the increased regulatory scrutiny that the industry may face in the coming year. Despite the challenging global regulatory environment, there seems to be a shift in the commentary surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in India. Previously, there had been some suggestions to ban cryptocurrencies, but recent comments from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicate a more accommodating stance. It is expected that the regulation of cryptocurrencies will eventually be a coordinated effort by governments worldwide. However, India's initial stance during the G20 summit was to ban cryptocurrencies, as opposed to exploring the possibility of a coordinated regulatory framework.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market had a busy weekend as BTC is looking for a new support level. The macroeconomic factors are swinging the prices across the crypto market which include regulatory uncertainty and higher-than-expected December consumer prices. BTC is trading close to the $22,000 level while ETH is exchanging hands at the $1,516 level. The next FOMC meeting is the next big event for the digital asset market for which investors are eagerly waiting.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Ethereum's Next Upgrade: Shanghai, Is It Time to Sell or HODL? - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Discover the exciting news of the upcoming Ethereum next upgrade, Shanghai. What could be in store for investors in this upcoming milestone?\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is about to undergo its next major upgrade, known as the \u201cShanghai upgrade\u201d.\n\nThe upgrade is highly anticipated, and for good reason: it will allow for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum. This means that Ethereum holders will soon be able to take their assets off the Ethereum blockchain and do with them as they please.\n\nBut what does this mean for the Ethereum market? Will the ability to withdraw Ethereum cause a massive sell-off, or will holders continue to HODL their assets, confident in Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential?\n\nLet\u2019s explore it in this article.\n\nThe Merge Upgrade\n\nThe last time Ethereum underwent a significant upgrade was September\u2019s \u201cThe Merge\u201d, when Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. This upgrade hit all major news sites \u2013 and for good reason. The Merge signified a massive accomplishment with Ethereum\u2019s roadmap.\n\nThe Merge source: Cryptonewz\n\nThis upgrade was a massive technical achievement, but one important functionality needed to be included: withdrawals. This has left many Ethereum holders with staked assets that they cannot access. But the Shanghai upgrade will change all of that, finally allowing for the withdrawal of staked Ethereum. The exact date for the upgrade has not been set yet, but it is expected to take place next month with speculated massive implications for the currency\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Shanghai Upgrade\n\nAlthough the Shanghai upgrade is not as technically challenging as The Merge, it is still highly impactful.\n\nNot only is it an important milestone in the development of Ethereum, but its ramifications will be felt across the entire cryptocurrency market. Some people predict that the ability to withdraw Ethereum will lead to a massive sell-off, as people cash in on their staked assets.\n\nNext year the Shanghai Hardfork for #Ethereum is slated to take place on March. 15,3 Mio #ETH will be unlocked. So can this cause a MASS SELL-OFF event for Ethereum, the leading Smart contract platform????????? pic.twitter.com/vCAOaUSN8l \u2014 CryptoMo (@CryptoMo) December 19, 2022\n\nHowever, the argument holds for price increases as well. Staking will become attractive for investors due to its increased liquidity. This can potentially improve its demand, driving up Ethereum prices.\n\nSo, what should Ethereum holders do? The answer to this question is definitely not an easy one.\n\nMore importantly, this event should be seen as a giant win for the entire crypto industry. The Shanghai upgrade enables ETH investors to react accordingly to market demands and reduces artificial factors that affect Ethereum. The choice is ultimately up to each individual, and it is important to do your own research and make an informed decision.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade is sure to have a significant impact on the Ethereum market and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Regardless of your decision, it\u2019s important to keep your eyes peeled on the future developments of this significant moment in cryptocurrency history.\n\nStay tuned for more crypto news."

        "title": "11 Ways To Make Money With Ethereum in Nigeria - Business Post Nigeria",
        "content": "You\u2019re probably familiar with Bitcoin, but have you heard of Ethereum? Ethereum is a decentralised platform for building and running applications and is quickly becoming one of the hottest investment opportunities in the crypto space. If you\u2019re looking for ways to make money with Ethereum in Nigeria, you\u2019ve come to the right place. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore 11 ways to get started and make the most of your investment.\n\nImagine this: You\u2019re scrolling through your social media feed, and you come across a post from a friend who made a ton of money with Ethereum. They tell you about this fantastic platform they used to invest in decentralised applications and make a fortune. You\u2019re intrigued but also a bit sceptical \u2013 you\u2019ve heard of cryptocurrencies, but you have no idea how they work.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how I felt when I first heard about Ethereum. But, being the curious person I am, I decided to do some research and learn all about it. And let me tell you, I was blown away by what I discovered. Ethereum is a game-changer, and I want to share everything I learned with you.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll break down Ethereum in a way that\u2019s easy to understand so you, too, can take advantage of its potential to make money. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or just looking to expand your investment portfolio, this article is for you. So, sit back, grab a cup of coffee, water, tea or anything you want, and get ready to learn about the fantastic world of Ethereum and the different ways you can make money from it!\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a pretty cool platform. It\u2019s decentralised, which means it\u2019s not controlled by any government or corporation. It\u2019s also open-source, which means anyone can use and build on it. Basically, it\u2019s a platform for creating and running smart contracts and decentralised apps (dApps).\n\nSo what are smart contracts? Think of them as computer programs that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. For example, you could use a smart contract to automate the exchange of money, property, or other assets between two parties. No need for a middleman!\n\nEthereum uses its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) to power its network and execute transactions. And to keep everything secure, it uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake, which is more energy-efficient than other methods.\n\nIn terms of dApps, Ethereum is a pretty big deal. It\u2019s home to many decentralised apps, from games and social media to financial applications. And you can even create decentralised organisations (DAOs) that run on code rather than relying on a central authority.\n\nSo, that\u2019s Ethereum in a nutshell! It\u2019s a pretty innovative platform helping shape a more decentralised and open internet.\n\nSo, how can you make money from this cutting-edge cryptocurrency? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWays To Earn Passive Income In Nigeria With Ethereum\n\n1. Trading Ethereum:\n\nOne of the most straightforward ways to make money with Ethereum is trading. The basic idea is to buy low and sell high. You\u2019ll need to find a reputable crypto exchange that supports Ethereum., and create an account. From there, you can buy Ethereum using Nigerian Naira (NGN) or another cryptocurrency and hold onto it until you think the price will go up. Then, you can sell it for a profit.\n\nKeep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can change quickly. It\u2019s important to understand market trends and do your research before making any trades. Consider using stop-loss orders to minimise your risk and protect your investment.\n\nTo get the most out of your investment, you must sell your Ethereum on the best crypto trading platform, Breet app. Breet is an OTC crypto trading app in Nigeria where you can convert Ethereum to Naira and withdraw your funds directly to your Naira bank account within seconds for no extra charge. Get started by downloading Breet today, and enjoy a seamless trading experience.\n\n2. Staking Ethereum:\n\nStaking is another way to make money with Ethereum, and it\u2019s a lot less risky than trading. Staking means holding onto your Ethereum and helping to secure the network by participating in consensus. In return, you\u2019ll earn rewards in the form of new Ethereum. The more Ethereum you stake, the more you\u2019ll earn.\n\nTo start staking, you\u2019ll need a minimum amount of Ethereum in a wallet that supports staking. You can choose a staking provider or use a decentralised platform like Rocket Pool or Stakefish. Staking is an excellent option if you\u2019re looking for long-term investment and passive income.\n\n3. Participating in decentralised Finance (DeFi):\n\nDecentralised finance, or DeFi, is a growing sector of the Ethereum ecosystem that allows you to earn interest and yield on your Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. DeFi protocols like Aave, Compound and Yearn Finance allow you to deposit your Ethereum and earn interest, similar to a savings account. You can also earn yield by providing liquidity to DeFi exchanges, such as Uniswap or Balancer.\n\nDeFi is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, so it\u2019s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved. Make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your investment.\n\n4. Crypto Lending:\n\nCrypto lending is another way to earn passive income with Ethereum. You can lend your Ethereum to borrowers and earn interest on your loan. This can be a great option if you have a large amount of Ethereum that you don\u2019t need to sell right away.\n\nSeveral platforms offer crypto lending services, such as Nexo, BlockFi, and Celsius. Keep in mind that crypto lending is a relatively new and untested market, so it\u2019s essential to do your research and understand the risks involved.\n\n5. Mining Ethereum:\n\nMining is the process of creating new Ethereum by solving complex mathematical problems. The more computing power you have, the more Ethereum you can mine.
