        "title": "ZK-Rollups: Unravelling Ethereum's Scalability Issues - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Zk-rollups have long been touted as the ultimate solution to Ethereum\u2019s woes. As blockchain and crypto adoption enjoy exponential growth worldwide, scaling solutions are needed to ensure the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform can handle millions of users.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs and rollup technology aim to boost transaction throughput in the Ethereum ecosystem, but there are still a lot of questions about how zk-rollups work.\n\nIn this quick guide, we\u2019ll be simplifying the complex jargon around zk-rollup solutions and making sure that you don\u2019t have zero knowledge about zero-knowledge.\n\nWhat\u2019s Wrong with the Ethereum Blockchain?\n\nSince the earliest days of Ethereum, every blockchain network has struggled to overcome a single concept: How to solve the Blockchain Trilemma. Coined by Vitalik Buterin, the Blockchain trilemma dictates that the perfect blockchain successfully balances decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nDecentralization \u2013 In the true spirit of blockchain, the perfect network is fully distributed. The network is self-sufficient and governed by its users, with miners and validators owned and operated independently worldwide. Bitcoin is a perfect example of decentralization in action.\n\n\u2013 In the true spirit of blockchain, the perfect network is fully distributed. The network is self-sufficient and governed by its users, with miners and validators owned and operated independently worldwide. Bitcoin is a perfect example of decentralization in action. Scalability \u2013 The perfect blockchain is fast and affordable, making it effective and efficient for all users, regardless of the size of their wallet. Low gas fees and fast transactions are the norm, rather than a unique feature.\n\n\u2013 The perfect blockchain is fast and affordable, making it effective and efficient for all users, regardless of the size of their wallet. Low gas fees and fast transactions are the norm, rather than a unique feature. Security \u2013 The perfect blockchain is safe. No one can break into your wallet by force, transactions are protected by complex cryptography, and the correct distribution of tokens prevents hackers from taking control of the network with a 51% attack.\n\nEven with dozens of Layer-1 blockchains competing daily, the blockchain trilemma remains unsolved. The irony of the trilemma is that balancing all three options is impossible because engineers always need to sacrifice one option to achieve the others.\n\nTake Solana, for example. Solana is often considered the fastest and most affordable blockchain available. The network boasts over 4,000 transactions per second (TPS), costing a single transaction less than a penny. Solana is also secure and just as safe as any other leading chain.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana suffers from the final point of the trilemma, decentralization. The network is often criticized for constant outages due to centralized points of failure. Solana\u2019s strength and resources came from venture capitalists, who hold a somewhat heavy allocation of SOL tokens.\n\nDespite being the leading Layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform in the crypto industry, Ethereum has difficulties overcoming the blockchain trilemma.\n\nEthereum Scalability\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever used the Ethereum mainnet at peak traffic, you\u2019ll know that scalability is not Ethereum\u2019s strength. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Ethereum transaction costs were completely out of control. While basic send-and-receive transactions were around $20-30 each, more complex DeFi token swaps or NFT mints often cost over $100 each.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts.\n\nTransaction fees and throughput are undoubtedly the biggest issues facing Ethereum scaling. During high congestion periods, dApps on the Ethereum network become almost unusable. In many cases, the transaction fee for buying an NFT costs more ETH than the NFT itself. These scalability issues make blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) inaccessible.\n\nUntil these problems are solved, cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption will struggle to onboard the masses. Thankfully, there are plenty of different ways for Ethereum to become the global powerhouse we know it has the potential to be.\n\nSome of the most revolutionary Ethereum scaling solutions are ZK and optimistic rollups.\n\nWhat are Rollups?\n\nRollups help reduce network congestion on the Ethereum main chain. They take computation and state-storage off-chain process transaction data on other blockchains and then send it back to the main chain. Essentially, rollups allow the network to \u2018roll up\u2019 a batch of transactions into one cost-effect transaction. This means users can enjoy the security of the Ethereum layer while benefitting from the cheaper gas fees and faster throughput of Layer-2 networks, like Polygon or Arbitrum.\n\nRollups aren\u2019t the only Ethereum scaling solutions out there. Alternative methods include sharding, sidechains, and state channels. While these are all viable solutions, Buterin himself is most bullish on rolllups and believes that they\u2019ll be an integral part of Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nRollups are typically divided into two groups, optimistic rollups, and zk-rollups. The main difference between the two is how they verify transactions. Optimistic rollups rely on fraud proofs to validate transaction data, while zk-rollups use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).\n\nOptimistic Rollups\n\nAs the name suggests, optimistic rollups are, well, optimistic. Adopting an \u2018innocent-until-proven-guilty\u2019 approach, optimistic rollups assume that each transaction in a rollup is valid. The network all users a set period, usually around a week, to resolve disputes around fraudulent transactions.\n\nBy optimistically assuming that every transaction is valid, the network doesn\u2019t have to devote excess time and computation to confirming transactions are accurate. Some of the most popular Layer-2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, use this technology to settle off-chain transactions before sending them back to the Ethereum main chain.\n\nZK-Rollups\n\nZk-rollups use complex cryptography called a zkproof to ensure that all rollup transactions are valid without sharing sensitive information about the transactions themselves. They rely on cryptographic proof and submit validity proofs to smart contracts on Ethereum instead of assuming that all transactions are valid.\n\nThis means that all zk-rollup transactions can be processed off-chain, while also reducing the amount of transaction data shared, making them focused on privacy. Moreover, because they don\u2019t need to wait a week for fraudulent transactions to be contested, zk-rollups are considered a much faster and superior technology to Optimistic rollups.\n\nThe most common zk-proofs we see in cryptography are zk-snarks and zk-starks. Simply put, these systems allow users to prove that they know vital or sensitive information, such as transaction data, without publicly revealing the data.\n\nExamples of a few zk-rollup projects include Starknet and Immutable X.\n\nPros and Cons of Zero-Knowledge Rollups\n\nZk-rollups have made significant progress in addressing Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. They\u2019ve introduced faster and more affordable transactions secured on the main chain and made DeFi more accessible than ever. That being said, they\u2019re far from a perfect solution.\n\nAdvantages of Zk-rollups\n\nValidity proofs ensure that off-chain transactions are correct before being secured on the main chain.\n\nIncreased transaction throughput and low gas fees.\n\nTrustless cryptographic proofing ensures security is enforced by code instead of relying on validators, as we see with optimistic rollups.\n\nUsers can withdraw funds from zk-rollups without experiencing the week-long delays common on optimistic rollups.\n\nDisadvantages of Zk-rollups\n\nZero-knowledge rollups and proof systems are complicated to build and deploy.\n\nYou need specialized hardware to produce validity proofs, making them a centralization risk.\n\nZk-snark proof systems rely on an established, trusted setup for ongoing use. If misused, this setup is a security risk.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever hopped between the most popular blockchain networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain or Avalanche, you\u2019ve probably noticed that many dApps and wallets have a similar interface and user experience. This is thanks to a convenient technology called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM.\n\nIn its purest form, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is a database and machine state for interacting with Ethereum accounts and contracts. Developers use the EVM to build and deploy dApps on the Ethereum network, as well as by users who interact with these applications using their crypto wallets.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about EVMs is that they\u2019re not Ethereum-exclusive. Many other blockchains run their own EVM, which makes it possible for Ethereum-based dApps and tools to be easily ported over and deployed on other networks.\n\nFor example, many decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap on the Binance Smart Chain or Quickswap on Polygon were created using Ethereum smart contracts. See the similarities between UniSwap and PancakeSwap\u2019s UI?\n\nEach respective network\u2019s EVM makes it possible to write Ethereum-based code and applications and replicate them on other networks. This makes blockchain development between EVM-compatible chains far more interoperable and gives developers and users greater flexibility.\n\nzkEVM\n\nAs the name would suggest, a zkEVM uses ZK technology and proofing within an Ethereum Virtual Machine. Most importantly, they support smart contract development on zk-rollups, giving these powerful scaling solutions greater utility. Without a zkEVM, zk-rollups would be limited to simple transactions like basic send and receive functions.\n\nEssentially, a fully functional zkEVM will bring the complete Ethereum experience, including DeFi and NFTs, to the scalable and secure environment of a zk-rollup network.\n\nAn effective zkEVM can securely process thousands of transactions per second. This is a significant improvement from the Ethereum main chain, which struggles to clear more than 20 TPS.\n\nThe zkEVM Race\n\nCompetition within the zkEVM field is tense, with some of the biggest names in the crypto space, like Polygon, hustling to be among the first to deploy a functional zkEVM. The Polygon team has had their eyes set on a zkEVM for some time after purchasing the Hermez Network for $250M back in 2021.\n\nPolygon has since launched a zk-rollup solution named Polygon Hermez in mid-2022. While this represented a key milestone in the zk-rollup sector, Polygon Hermez is limited to simple token transactions, such as sending and receiving payments.\n\nThe Polygon zkEVM is expected to launch in 2023 and will bring greater utility and smart contract support to their zk-rollup scaling solution.\n\nOther projects like Matter Lab\u2019s zkSync are leading contenders to release the world\u2019s first zkEVM, alongside notable competitors like Starknet and Scroll.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile zk-rollups are arguably more scalable and secure, Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum attract more users and process more transactions than other Layer-2 scaling solutions. However, this could change with the launch of the first zkEVM, which will bring greater utility to zk-rollups.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe Ethereum network is ill-prepared to accommodate growing adoption and an influx of new users. Zk-rollup scaling solutions and zkEVMs will make blockchain technology and cryptocurrency far more accessible than before and drive mass adoption worldwide.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Since September 2022, traders have started withdrawing ETH from exchanges.\n\nSince the completion of the Merge network upgrade six months ago, the quantity of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value, has been steadily decreasing across exchanges. In September 2022, the Ethereum network went through a significant upgrade that consisted of switching from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network during an event that was referred to as the Merge.\n\nThe quantity of accessible ETH that is now languishing on exchanges continues to decrease, as shown by on-chain data that was published by the cryptocurrency analytics company Santiment. Since the Merge, the amount of ETH available on exchanges has decreased by 37%. It is a positive indicator when there is a consistent decrease in supply on exchanges. This is because there is less ETH accessible on the market for buying and selling.\n\nBefore the Merge, there were a total of 19.12 million ETH worth $31.3 billion trading hands on exchanges in the month of September. As of the second week of February, the number had dropped to 13.36 million ETH, which corresponds to a value of $19.7 billion.\n\nA significant portion of the Ethereum supply is now being shifted into self-custody, while the Shanghai upgrade is drawing near and many traders choose staking as an investment strategy instead. The next version for Ethereum, known as Shanghai, is expected to release in the month of March. Stakeholders and validators will be able to remove their holdings from the Beacon Chain after the Shanghai hard fork, which will combine more upgrade suggestions for network advancements and enable for this functionality.\n\nAt the now, 14% of the entire supply, or 16 million ETH, is staked on the Beacon Chain. This amounts to nearly $25 billion at the prices that are currently in effect, and it is a significant quantity that will gradually become liquid following the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nSince it became deflationary after the London upgrade, the total quantity of ETH on the market as a whole has also decreased, in addition to the ongoing decrease in the amount of ETH stored on exchanges. The fee-burning mechanism that was first implemented as part of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 is where the deflationary model can be found.\n\nSince the London upgrade in August 2021, a total of 2.9 million ETH has been burnt, which would have had an equivalent value of around $4.5 billion in today's currency."

Is this ascent an indicator of things to come? Or will the whale accumulation result in dumping before the Shanghai upgrade?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH witnesses brief surge\n\nEthereum gained 3.45% on 17 February, according to a daily period analysis of the cryptocurrency. According to additional research into that trading period, it peaked at $1,721 before ending trade at $1,694.\n\nIt was five months since ETH\u2019s price had last reached the $1,700 range during that trading period. Its price was roughly $1,694 at the time of writing.\n\nFurthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that ETH was in a bull trend because its line was above the 60 mark. The price movement was also noted above both the long and short Moving Averages (blue and yellow lines). Therefore, the asset\u2019s price moving above the (MAs) suggests a good price move and may also point to a possible future uptrend.\n\nShark and whale hold on\n\nRecent data from Santiment showed that whale and shark addresses were still tightly clutching onto their ETH bags. The graph shows that whale and shark addresses with 100\u2013100,000 ETH still retained close to 47% of the entire supply of ETH. Furthermore, the absence of a sell-off following the most recent price increase suggested that investors anticipated further price increases.\n\nIn addition, an examination of the supply owned by the top addresses revealed that the addresses at the top had been on an accumulating binge. For most of January, the graph showing the quantity held by the top addresses as a proportion of the overall supply of Ethereum was rising. It has now leveled off, but at the time of writing, it was at 123.\n\nVolatility incoming?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will be the next big thing for the cryptocurrency sector. In March, users can withdraw more than $16.5 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) off the blockchain. The Merge was the last significant improvement to the network; however, it had little effect on the price of Ethereum.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will affect the supply and demand of ETH, whereas the Merge was a purely technological development with no apparent economic consequences. However, because of the long-term and short-term nature of the upcoming development, it has the potential to affect the ETH price significantly.\n\nWhen staked ETHs are released, it is unknown how the shark and whale addresses will respond. But if they, too, decide to sell their assets, ETH\u2019s value will plummet. So, in terms of Ethereum\u2019s price movement, March will be a crucial month."

        "content": "Staking is when you commit your crypto assets to a blockchain to support the network and validate transactions. In return, you receive crypto rewards.\n\nThis is only an option with cryptocurrencies that confirm transactions using a model called proof of stake. To process transactions, these cryptocurrencies choose validators who have staked their own crypto. The validator checks a block of transactions, adds it to the blockchain, and receives a staking reward for their contribution. Examples of cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake include:\n\nYou can stake crypto on your own without a staking service, but it's not quite as easy. You'll need to store your crypto in a blockchain wallet, and you'll also likely need to join a staking pool with other crypto investors. Staking platforms, on the other hand, allow you to stake your crypto in a few clicks. This is also a big advantage if you're not comfortable storing your cryptocurrency.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that \"staking\" is often used as a catch-all to cover any way you earn rewards on your crypto. For example, some people refer to crypto lending programs as staking. They're not, but crypto lending can also be an effective way to earn crypto rewards, so we've included lending programs on our list of staking platforms.\n\nREAD MORE: What Is Staking in Crypto?\n\nAre there fees for crypto staking?\n\nCryptocurrency staking fees depend on the staking method and cryptocurrency you choose. Many platforms don't charge any staking fees, but there are some that do. You can find this information on the platform's fees page.\n\nIf you decide to stake crypto without using a platform, you will most likely need to join a staking pool. These pools are made up of groups of investors who pool their crypto for a better chance of earning rewards. Most staking pools charge a pool fee. This amount can vary, but anywhere from 2% to 5% is common."

        "content": "NFT marketplace aggregator Blur.io has surpassed Uniswap, OpenSea, and Etherum transactions as the top ETH burner over the past 24 hours.\n\nData shared by Access Protocol CEO Mika Honkasalo from Ultrasoundmoney highlighted that over 252 ETH was burned as a result of Blur.io activity between Feb. 18 and Feb. 19. Furthermore, the two contracts identified by Ultrasoundmoney combined to a total of 310.7 ETH compared to 239.39 ETH and 177.8 ETH from Uniswap and OpenSea, respectively.\n\nHowever, when Uniswap V2 and V3 contracts are combined, Uniswap burned a total of 328 ETH, narrowly pushing Blur.io off the top spot.\n\nBlur.io\n\nBlur.io is an NFT marketplace aimed at \u201cpro traders\u201d with the ability to sweep the floor of multiple marketplaces from one dashboard. Blur gained notoriety through its airdrop campaign in late 2022 and has since seen a meteoric rise in popularity.\n\nAnalytics platform DappRadar placed Blur.io at the top of its leaderboard for volume over the past 24 hours as activity rose 41% to hit $114.34 million traded.\n\nEthereum burn mechanics\n\nA base fee is paid by the sender of an ETH transaction and then burned to reduce the overall supply of ETH. This burn mechanic reduces the overall supply of ETH over time with the implication of increasing its scarcity and potentially increasing its value.\n\nBurning the base fee, introduced in EIP-1559, also helps create a more stable fee market on the network. As the base fee is dynamically adjusted based on network congestion, burning the fee helps to ensure that the fee market remains stable and that fees do not become excessively high or volatile.\n\nBurn by sector\n\nBlur.io is also closing in on a 30-day timeframe which sees Uniswap and OpenSea top the charts with a combined 14,273 ETH burned in the past month. In addition, Blur.io was responsible for burning 3,012 ETH across the same period.\n\nFurthermore, the NFT sector took up 23% of the burned ETH over the past 30 days with 18,666 ETH. Comparingly, the DeFi sector took the majority at 32%, with a total of 25,403 ETH burned. However, in the past 24 hours, NFT transactions have burned 549 ETH, and DeFi burned 690 ETH.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that both the NFT and DeFi sectors are significant contributors to ETH burn activity, with the Blur.io marketplace emerging as a new notable player in the space.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "After facing a bit of selling pressure on the Fed rhetoric, the crypto market is showing signs of recovery again. The Ethereum price (ETH) is up by 3% in the last 24 hours shooting past $1,700 levels for the first time in five months.\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum price is currently at the highest level since the merge event in mid-September 2022. As per on-chain data provider Santiment both \u2013 shark and whales \u2013 have been holding their ETH supplies strongly. It notes: \u201cshark & whale addresses holding 100-100K $ETH still hold nearly 47% of the supply\u201d. The same cohort of investors has also accumulated nearly 2 million ETH since November 5th.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Ahead of Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade scheduled for the next month of March will introduce withdrawals for more than 16.5 million ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade is likely to change the ETH supply and demand dynamics in the market and thus traders are expecting Ethereum price volatility going ahead.\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade, $25 billion worth of ETH will be available for withdrawals as well as sale in the open market. Besides, the staking yields for ETH are also likely to decrease after the upgrade. Thus, there\u2019s a possibility that traders would unstake their coins and instead move the capital to other coins that offer better yields.\n\nIn his recent podcast interview, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also shared further developments in the Ethereum roadmap. According to him, the main thing to focus on currently is sharding.\n\nWith sharding, Ethereum will build a system that supports more transactions than a single node can verify. Thus, it would improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain considerably.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s roll-ups centric roadmap seeks to focus on making the Ethereum blockchain friendly to people willing to build Layer 2 scaling solutions that could easily plug into Ethereum for security.\n\nIntern Notes on The Network State Podcast #1 ft @balajis & @VitalikButerin \u2013 How the $200B idea was born \ud83d\udca1\n\n\u2013 Rising issues of censorship & privacy\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\ud83d\udea8\n\n\u2013 Vitalik's secrets to leveling up his game (you dont want to miss this) Here're 6 takeaways from the 117 mins podcast pic.twitter.com/FLTMoRbakl \u2014 Whospay Intern (@whospay_intern) February 16, 2023"

        "title": "Ethereum vs Cardano 2.0: What Is The Differences ? - ClearTax",
        "content": "Over the years, users have compared Ethereum and Cardano because they have similar features. Both blockchains run smart contracts and have a range of decentralised finance applications for their users. Developers can use both these blockchains as they come with features that are quite similar.\n\nHowever, there are a few key areas where they differ. Let\u2019s find out more about how these two cryptos differ.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Top parameters\n\nLet\u2019s look at the following parameters to highlight the differences between Ethereum and Cardano. These include:\n\nConsensus mechanism\n\nEthereum currently uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to validate transactions on its network. In this process, validators or miners use high-powered ASIC computers to find the correct nonce and validate a blockchain block.\n\nMiners can add new blocks in roughly 12 seconds on this network. This mechanism ensures that Ethereum works in a decentralised manner and all members agree on things like the order of transactions and account balances.\n\nEthereum uses an algorithm called Ethash for its mining operations. This algorithm makes miners participate in a race of trial and error to find the correct nonce to validate a block. A miner can only add a block on the network when they find a valid nonce. They achieve this by downloading and running the full dataset through a mathematical function. The dataset generates a target mixHash that is below the target nonce.\n\nThe mining difficulty set by the blockchain will determine how easy it is for miners to get a valid nonce for validating the block. This entire process though complex makes the network difficult to hack, and malicious users do not get to double-spend their coins.\n\nCardano uses the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to power its blockchain. Here, the validators, known as stakers, need to stake or invest a certain amount of tokens on the blockchain to get a chance to win validation rights for a block. The higher your stake, the chance you will get the right to validate the block.\n\nThe PoS algorithm that Cardano uses is called Ouroboros. It divides time into epochs and slots. Epochs are overarching time frames, while the slots are 20-second increments within the epochs. The algorithm chooses a random slot leader among each slot, choosing the block that will be added to the blockchain. On Cardano, you can add a new block every 20 seconds.\n\nThere are two types of blocks that you can add to the Cardano blockchain:\n\nMain block\n\nIt contains all transaction-related information, software update proposals and a list of votes for these updates.\n\nGenesis block\n\nThis block contains a series of main blocks and lists all the slot leaders associated with the epoch.\n\nWhen the epoch ends, the leaders of the previous slot elect the slot leaders of the next epoch. Each slot leader performs a \u201ccoin tossing act\u201d to randomly choose the next slot leader.\n\nIf you compare both mechanisms, you will see that both have pros and cons. The PoW mechanism is very energy intensive, and you need much computation power to start mining. However, in the case of the PoS mechanism, you need high initial investment to add a stake. Ethereum 2.0 will use the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism when it releases in future.\n\nToken, transaction speed and transaction fees\n\nEther (ETH) is the main cryptocurrency powering Ethereum. When miners validate a block, they get newly minted Ether as block rewards. Ethereum does not have a limit on its supply. Its supply is set to increase at a fixed rate of 4.5% yearly. Ethereum transaction speeds can range from 15 seconds to five minutes. On some days, transactions take longer to validate due to network load. The transaction fee of Ethereum at the time of writing is 0.729 USD.\n\nThe native coin of Cardano is ADA. For every successful block, slot leaders get newly minted coins as rewards. Unlike Ethereum, Cardano has a limited supply of 45 billion. The transaction speeds of Cardano are approximately 250 per second. The transaction fee of Cardano at the time of writing is 0.16 USD.\n\nNodes\n\nEthereum mainly uses a set of three nodes to run its operations. They are:\n\nLight nodes\n\nThese nodes use limited, shortened data from the blocks. They synchronise with the full blocks to ensure accuracy.\n\nFull nodes\n\nCompared to light nodes, full nodes carry more blockchain data and history. They can also display historical data when commanded.\n\nArchive nodes\n\nThese nodes hold the entire history of the blockchain, that is, the transaction data and history from all the previous blocks.\n\nEthereum also uses two more nodes for its functioning. They are Mining nodes and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The mining nodes belong to the miners on the network, and the EVM nodes are responsible for providing a runtime to execute smart contract code.\n\nCardano uses three nodes to function. They are:\n\nEdge nodes\n\nThese nodes are responsible for creating crypto transactions.\n\nmCore nodes\n\nYou can use these nodes to stake ADA tokens and participate in blockchain governance.\n\nRelay nodes\n\nThe function of these nodes is to send information between mCore nodes and the public internet.\n\nHistory and vision\n\nFounded on 30 July 2015, Ethereum was the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, who was one of the co-founders. He considered this network as a \"world computer\" that anyone could use to launch and run an application.\n\nHe started the Ethereum Foundation, which sold 72 million ETH at a crowd sale. At that time, the valuation of this amount was $18 million.\n\nDevelopers like Jeff Wilke, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson and Joseph Lubin made notable contributions that made Ethereum what it is today.\n\nEthereum aims to use blockchain technology for decentralising products and services in an array of use cases other than just money.\n\nLaunched on 27 September 2017, Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. It aims to be a third-generation blockchain project and wishes to solve the issues that Ethereum users face. Its high scalability, energy-efficient consensus mechanism and lower transaction fees make it an attractive alternative to Ethereum.\n\nUnlike Ethereum, which has reached a stable place in the blockchain market, Cardano is still growing and is yet to reach its full potential. At the time of writing, the market cap of Ethereum is $132,321,750,953, and that of Cardano is $14,290,667,586. If you want to invest on either of these platforms, conduct thorough research and find the current market trends."

        "content": "Despite encountering a bug in the latest Shanghai release for the Geth EL client, Ethereum developers have agreed to proceed with the launch of the Shanghai upgrade on the Sepolia test network later this month.\n\nThe bug was discovered on February 16th during the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) call #155, which the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Tim Beiko chaired. The bug affected the Geth EL client and was discovered during testing on the Zhejiang test network.\n\nEthereum Developers to Implement Changes to Protocol\n\nThe Geth (EL) client team has since issued a fix for the bug, which caused nodes to fail to download and initialize blocks with zero withdrawals and transactions.\n\nDuring the ACDE call, representatives of the Nethermind and Erigon (EL) client teams confirmed that they would double-check the logic for handling empty blocks in their latest releases to ensure that they were not vulnerable to the same bug. In addition, the developers agreed to exclude zero blob transactions from the mempool and Ethereum protocol.\n\nThe developers discussed how the protocol and mempool should handle transactions formatted as blobs that do not contain any data and ultimately agreed to ban zero blob transactions from the protocol in their implementation of EIP 4844 for the Cancun upgrade.\n\nDespite these issues, developers are committed to launching the Shanghai upgrade on the Sepolia test network on February 28th. To achieve this, client teams must cut new releases for Shanghai by early next week, and all client teams have confirmed they can do so.\n\nFurthermore, developers will begin testing the circuit breaker mechanism of MEV-Boost software in the coming weeks. Additionally, the Ethereum Nimbus (CL) client team is making progress on updating Ethereum EL block headers to an SSZ format, with two main approaches currently being considered.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum protocol is constantly evolving, and its developers are working hard to make it even better. While bugs and issues are to be expected along the way, developers remain committed to moving forward and delivering the Shanghai and Cancun upgrades, which are critical to the continued success of Ethereum.\n\nRelated Reading | Polygon (MATIC) Sees 65% Surge in Trading Volume \u2013 Here\u2019s Why"
