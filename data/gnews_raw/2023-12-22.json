        "title": "Inscriptions craze proves stark contrast between Ethereum rollups - Blockworks",
        "content": "The advent of zero-knowledge proof-based Ethereum rollups represents a significant advance in blockchain scalability and efficiency.\n\nOver the past week, their ability to handle a spike in transaction volumes was put to the test with the fad-like phenomenon of inscriptions hitting various EVM-based networks in sequence.\n\nOne aspect unique to zk-rollups, such as zkSync, StarkNet and Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, is their ability to amortize the cost of generating validity proofs across many transactions. Therefore, unlike many blockchains, they actually get cheaper to use as they scale.\n\nRead more: Zero-knowledge rollups get cheaper with scale\n\nInscriptions refer to various forms of data, typically metadata of tokens or NFTs, written to blockchains in a way which can be more cost-effective than smart contracts, as they require less gas.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been a surge in the use of inscriptions on a variety of networks \u2014 not just Ethereum layer-2s but also Avalanche and Solana \u2014 mainly for speculative trading of low-value assets. This trend has led to network congestion and operational disruptions that have kept protocol developers busy finding ways to mitigate their impact.\n\nIn some cases, those disruptions have been severe \u2014 Avalanche\u2019s EVM-compatible C-chain, for instance, saw the cost of transactions spike tenfold, as inscriptions were briefly responsible for over 30% of all gas consumed.\n\nPercentage of gas attributable to inscriptions, Avalanche in red. Source: Hildobby | Dune analytics\n\nZK magic\n\nTo understand why proving costs on zk-rollups decrease with rising transaction volumes, it\u2019s crucial to delve into the mechanics of zero-knowledge proofs and the architecture of these rollups.\n\nZk-rollups utilize cryptographic methods, such ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), to validate transactions off-chain before submitting them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis batching reduces the number of transactions that need to be processed on-chain, significantly lowering gas fees. As the number of transactions in a batch increases, the cost per transaction decreases, showcasing economies of scale.\n\nZkSync Era, currently the largest rollup by total-value locked (TVL), upgraded its original SNARK-based prover to one based on STARK proofs, called Boojum, on Dec. 4. It can theoretically handle 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) \u2014 though in practice has yet to see a tenth of that. For reference, Ethereum mainnet averages around 15 TPS.\n\nOptimistic rollup Arbitrum, whose 2021 mainnet launch gave it a first-mover advantage, has by far the most TVL at $2.4 billion.\n\nBoth networks were impacted by booming inscriptions activity within a couple days of each other \u2014 which accounted for about 60% of all transactions over the past week on the pair.\n\nThe phenomenon provided a real-world experiment in Ethereum rollup scaling.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nBoth suffered downtime, but transaction fees on Arbitrum spiked, while zkSync\u2019s went down.\n\nTransaction fee comparison between zkSync and optimistic rollups. Source: growthepie.xyz\n\nThe cost of using zkSync has been in a clear downtrend since the Boojum upgrade was completed earlier this month. The network currently has the lowest transactions costs among all layer-2s, competitive with the fees users pay on optimistic rollups.\n\nBut the response to a surge in demand underscores the efficacy of zero-knowledge rollups in upscaling Ethereum\u2019s throughput.\n\nBy compressing data and processing transactions in batches, many more transactions can fit in a single proof to be verified on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA researcher at venture firm 1kx, known as 0xtaetaehoho, noted on X that the network posted 5,566 proofs on Dec. 17, more than double the total pre-Boojum, and did so at a lower cost to the network.\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe traffic did cause problems for zkSync\u2019s RPC services and block explorer, however, prompting Matter Labs to post an extensive thread of lessons learned.\n\n\u201cThis weekend served as an important stress-test and a big milestone on the way of bringing Ethereum to the next billion people,\u201d the developers said.\n\n\u201cFor nearly 14 hours straight, the network handled ~150 TPS \u2014 peaking at 187 TPS \u2014 with an average [transaction] cost of ~$0.12.\u201d\n\nOther Ethereum scaling solutions, such as Polygon\u2019s POS chain, also handled the extra traffic well, even with much higher volumes.\n\nAccording to Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal, the network notched 18 million transactions per day, while gas fees maxed out at the MATIC equivalent of $0.10, which he called \u201cthe result of months of effort on EVM parallelisation (BlockSTM) and multiple other hardforks which resulted in reduced reorgs and better performance.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM has yet to see a significant surge in inscriptions-related traffic, but technical lead Jordi Baylina told Blockworks the reduction in proving costs seen in recent months means it\u2019s \u201cnot the limiting factor for transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you compare the [proof] cost with data availability cost, for example, or even the cumulative fee for the inclusion of the transaction, it is much, much lower,\u201d he said.\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 head of business development, Marco Cora, sees a future of \u201ca little bit of chaos and disintegration, a lot of experimentation, but one in which the best technical solutions will emerge.\n\n\u201cEverybody is doing fantastic work \u2014 all our \u2018competitors,\u2019 they are actually super commendable,\u201d Cora told Blockworks. \u201cEventually we will all figure out what\u2019s the best, and we will all converge there.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Cora says is not in doubt is that zero-knowledge tech is the future.\n\n\u201cPretty much everybody seems to have agreed\u2026Optimism has said it very explicitly, and Arbitrum I think has said it implicitly now that they are looking at it,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Crossroads as Solana Gains Ground in Smart Contract Dominance - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the once-revered pioneer in smart contract platforms, now finds itself at a crucial juncture as Solana (SOL) makes significant strides in the domain.\n\nOver the past week, the cryptocurrency community has been abuzz with discussions sparked by Solana\u2019s 800% YTD price surge and the ecosystem\u2019s impressive growth, with some speculating about its potential to surpass Ethereum. The ongoing debate revolves around scalability, transaction fees, and the fundamental shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) that Ethereum made.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s troubles seem to compound, with the ultra-sound money narrative faltering as Ether (ETH) faces a 30% decline year-to-date against Bitcoin (BTC). Simultaneously, it\u2019s losing ground to Solana on the smart contract front, as highlighted by popular trader Rip Vanwinkle on Saturday via X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAccording to Vanwinkle, Ethereum\u2019s move from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) was a betrayal of its initial principles. In the tweet, he argued that the transition aimed at enriching founders and insiders by enabling them to stake ETH and profit from fees that would otherwise be burned as gas. This transition, according to him, undermined Ethereum\u2019s core purpose as a gas token and challenged the principles of decentralization.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently acknowledged the need for improvements, noting they are actively working on the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. This upgrade intends to address scalability and transaction fee issues by implementing a PoS consensus mechanism. However, the success of this transition remains uncertain, leaving Ethereum vulnerable to the growing popularity of Solana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is important to note that Solana\u2019s appeal lies in its scalability and cost-effectiveness for smart contracts. Despite lacking complete decentralization, users prioritize low fees and fast transactions over absolute decentralization.\n\nMeanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed a surge in smart contract platform tokens, with Solana and Avalanche closing in on Ethereum and Binance Coin (BNB). Notably, in terms of value, Solana has experienced a 67% surge in the past month, positioning itself as the closest contender to Ethereum which is up only 11%.\n\nAdditionally, as highlighted by ZyCrypto, Solana\u2019s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) trading volumes surpassed those of Ethereum for the first time in history this week, holding consistently for three days. Digital asset platform Coinchange has even predicted that this trend could extend to the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi in the near future.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s fate in this evolving landscape remains uncertain as it grapples with internal challenges and external competition. It thus remains to be seen whether Ethereum can maintain its dominance as a smart contract platform."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, BitMex founder Arthur Hayes took to social media to reveal a bold prediction regarding the future price of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes, known for his insightful market analyses, confessed to having received a divine message during meditation, leading him to make significant changes in his cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\nIn a cryptic post, Hayes humorously claimed to have received guidance from a higher power, jokingly attributing it to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. The message allegedly urged him to divest from Solana (SOL) and express his admiration for Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFam ... I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nTaking heed of this celestial advice, Hayes reportedly sold his Solana holdings and doubled down on Ethereum, predicting a surge that would propel the cryptocurrency to an impressive $5,000. This announcement follows Hayes' earlier call predicting Solana's price to reach $100, a forecast that has proven accurate, with SOL recently peaking at $99.6.\n\nRotation\n\nHayes' decision to pivot from Solana to Ethereum may be rooted in his assessment of the market dynamics. While Solana has outperformed Ethereum in recent weeks, with a staggering 350% surge since mid-December, Hayes seems to believe that ETH has more room for growth.\n\nComparing the two cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's performance appears lackluster in the short term, showing nearly 10 times less growth than Solana during the same period. Despite trading at yearly highs, the percentage increase in ETH's value pales in comparison to the meteoric rise of SOL."

        "title": "Exclusive: NY financial regulator approves Paxos expansion to Solana, allowing for its first stablecoin issuance beyond Ethereum - Fortune",
        "content": "The leading stablecoin issuer Paxos has received regulatory approval to expand its products to the Solana blockchain, which it plans to launch on Jan. 17, 2024.\n\nWith peers including Circle and Tether vying for critical market share, the expansion is a major step for Paxos, which touts its relationship with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS).\n\n\u201cPaxos is the most regulated stablecoin issuer in the world,\u201d Walter Hessert, head of strategy at the firm, told Fortune in an interview. \u201cWe are the only company that has been issuing regulated stablecoins at scale\u2014period.\u201d\n\nStablecoin wars\n\nCofounded by financial veteran Charles Cascarilla, Paxos became the first crypto firm to receive a trust charter under the new digital asset regulatory regime implemented by DFS in 2015. To this day, DFS remains the sole U.S. financial regulator to implement a comprehensive framework for crypto, which has attracted a number of leading companies, including Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nPaxos received DFS approval to issue its first stablecoin in 2018, which it called Paxos Standard, rebranding the token to USDP in 2021. Stablecoins are a type of crypto token pegged to an underlying asset\u2014in this case, the U.S. dollar. Unlike the other leading USD-pegged stablecoins Tether and Circle\u2019s USD Coin, Paxos only issues USDP on Ethereum owing to restrictions from DFS.\n\nPaxos has argued that its commitment to working directly with DFS on issuance, rather than operating outside the framework of a financial regulator, sets it apart from competitors. While Tether is often critiqued for its offshore, opaque operations, Circle also presents itself as following U.S. regulatory standards, although it does not issue USDC under DFS supervision. As a result, Circle offers USDC across more than a dozen blockchains, including Tron, which has come under fire in recent months for facilitating illicit finance.\n\n\u201cFrom a growth perspective, you\u2019d like to issue across every single chain,\u201d Hessert said. \u201cCircle and other players can issue on to other protocols, but no one knows who\u2019s overseeing it\u2014or what their process is.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Paxos\u2019s approach helps gain trust with its partners, including major financial players like MercadoLibre, PayPal, and Mastercard, that customer protections are in place.\n\nEven so, Paxos has had its missteps. One of its first stablecoins, BUSD, was issued in partnership with leading crypto exchange Binance. After reports surfaced that Binance was creating a synthetic version of the stablecoin with questionable reserves, DFS ordered Paxos to stop issuing the token. As Fortune later reported, over 95% of Paxos\u2019s revenue came from that partnership.\n\nHello, Solana\n\nPaxos received a \u201cnon-objection\u201d from DFS to expand USDP from Ethereum to Solana, after what a spokesperson described as an \u201cextensive and exhaustive review,\u201d although the firm declined to specify how long the process took.\n\nWhile Hessert declined to say what type of information DFS required for the Solana expansion, citing the confidential supervisory process, he said it involved an internal risk framework built by Paxos to assess the blockchain and its processes, including its compliance protocols.\n\nFirst launched in early 2020 with the promise of increasing transaction speeds and reducing costs compared with Ethereum, Solana became one of the most popular blockchains before taking a major hit last year owing to its association with Sam Bankman-Fried. While its native token, SOL, is still far off from its all-time high of about $260, it has gained substantial traction over the past month.\n\nHessert said Solana\u2019s speed and cost relative to Ethereum will make it an attractive option for Paxos\u2019s partners, who aim to implement stablecoin in use cases from cross-border remittances to payments for goods and services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually going to start to see this new wave of adoption be enabled in ways that we haven\u2019t seen in stablecoins yet,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nFor now, Paxos\u2019s highest-profile project is its new stablecoin PYUSD, issued in partnership with PayPal. Hessert said he imagines that firms like PayPal will want to expand to Solana. Paxos\u2019s first Solana-based offering will be USDP, which has a market cap of just $370 million, compared with nearly $25 billion for USDC and nearly $94 billion for Tether.\n\nA spokesperson for PayPal declined to comment.\n\nHessert said Paxos hopes to gain approval to issue stablecoins across other layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains, although he declined to provide specific examples."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ether (ETH) could rally above $2,500 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) last approached the $2,400 resistance on Dec. 9 but failed to break through, resulting in a retest of the $2,120 support level. This time, investors are gaining confidence in surpassing this level, venturing into territory not seen since May 2022, before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. On Dec. 22, Ether stood out with a 4% increase, while Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) remained primarily unchanged.\n\nWhile the spotlight is on the exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative as the primary driver of recent cryptocurrency gains, there are several reasons supporting Ether\u2019s price surge that could potentially push it above $2,500 before the expected ETF approval in mid-January, although the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might take until March.\n\nEthereum network DApp volumes and protocol fees\n\nRather than attempting to predict the future, which is a challenging task in the fast-paced cryptocurrency industry, it\u2019s more prudent to analyze recent trends influencing the demand for Ether using decentralized applications (DApps) activity as an indicator. One can start by examining DApp volumes, as some sectors do not require a large total value locked (TVL), such as nonfungible token marketplaces, games, layer-2 bridges and social networks.\n\n7-day DApp volumes per blockchain in U.S. dollars. Source: DappRadar\n\nEthereum DApp volumes reached $27.8 billion in the last seven days, marking a 14.2% increase on the previous week. This growth was driven by a 21% gain in Uniswap and a 52% gain in Balancer volumes. In contrast, BNB Chain\u2019s volumes for the same period stood at $4.5 billion, while Arbitrum amassed another $5 billion. Most notably, Ethereum was the only blockchain among the top six to experience a volume increase in the past seven days.\n\nTo provide some perspective, Solana (SOL) would need to increase by 12 times to reach half of Ethereum DApps\u2019 current transaction volume. In general, 20% of users account for 80% of the volume, which holds for DApps. Given Ethereum\u2019s first-mover advantage and substantial treasury for ecosystem development support, the odds do not favor a flipping in the short to medium term.\n\nFurthermore, no other blockchain can match Ethereum\u2019s protocol, which generated $95.4 million in fees in the last seven days, excluding Bitcoin, which is not a direct competitor in the DApp ecosystem. Aside from incentivizing network security, this data indicates significant potential for increased activity following future updates, including \u2019DenCun\u2019 scheduled for January, which aims to enhance processing capacity and reduce costs.\n\nEthereum spot ETF approval is not priced in according to derivatives markets\n\nThe eventual approval of the Ether spot ETF will set Ether apart from other cryptocurrencies in terms of regulation.

The Ether futures premium, measuring the difference between two-month contracts and the spot price, has reached its highest level in over a year. In a healthy market, the annualized premium, or basis rate, typically falls within the 5% to 10% range.\n\nEther two-month futures premium vs. spot markets. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe current 13.5% Ether futures annualized premium suggests that traders are not taking the spot Ether ETF approval for granted. During widespread excitement, this indicator tends to exceed 20%, driven by increased demand for leveraged long positions, causing price distortions relative to the spot market. This data implies the potential for a positive price impact in case of approval, whether in January or March.\n\nBased on Ethereum\u2019s network activity, Ether investors should not yield to the pressure from contenders gaining momentum, at least not until these contenders pose a genuine threat in terms of volumes and deposits. Furthermore, the ETH derivatives indicator provides clear guidance that professional traders are bullish despite Ether\u2019s price nearing its highest level since May 2022. This suggests that investors are confident in Ether\u2019s ability to break above $2,500.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price surged in December due to potential ETF approval and BlackRock's entry into the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nAnalysts predict Ethereum's continued growth in 2024, potentially reaching $5,000, driven by factors.\n\nTechnical indicators like RSI and MACD support a positive outlook for Ethereum's future growth.\n\nIn December, Ethereum surged past the $2,100 mark, driven largely by the growing expectation of the SEC\u2019s potential approval of the Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This awaited ETF decision stirred optimism throughout the crypto market.\n\nFurther accelerating Ethereum\u2019s growth, BlackRock, a major asset management firm, declared its intent to enter the Ethereum ETF space. Interestingly, in November, Ethereum\u2019s growth rate outpaced that of Bitcoin, with a 13% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 8%.\n\nHere are the exciting predictions for ETH in the year 2024.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2024: Predictions for Ethereum\n\nMany analysts and experts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s prospects in 2024. Notably, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has shifted his focus from the rising Solana (SOL) to Ethereum, despite Solana\u2019s recent 350% surge. This move underscores Hayes\u2019 confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for sustained growth and innovation in the crypto sector.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s trading value stands at $2,275.86, reflecting a daily increase of 2.84% and a monthly rise of 14.45%. Such consistent growth has led to predictions that Ethereum could potentially reach $5,000.\n\nFam \u2026 I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nAlso Read: SEC Postpones Ruling on Ethereum ETFs, Opens Door for Public Input\n\nThings are Looking Up!\n\nHayes\u2019 shift in perspective provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory, especially when compared to his earlier prediction of a $100 value for Solana. His analysis points to Ethereum\u2019s ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake model and the promising ETF opportunities as key drivers for its anticipated growth. These factors highlight Ethereum\u2019s resilience and potential to play a significant role in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nRead More: Ethereum (ETH) Price Set To Hit $3500: Analyst Maps Buy Levels\n\nIn summary, Hayes\u2019 recent actions emphasize Ethereum\u2019s increasing importance and its potential to influence the crypto market in the upcoming years. If Ethereum continues its positive performance from 2023 into 2024, reaching the $5,000 mark could be a realistic possibility. Technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), further support a positive outlook for Ethereum\u2019s future growth.\n\nReady to ditch your SOL for ETH?

        "content": "The following is a guest post from John deVadoss, the Co-founder of InterWork Alliance.\n\nAct One: From a Crisis, A New Institution Emerges\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the United States Housing and Economic Recovery Act, intended to address the subprime mortgage crisis (which had precipitated the then ongoing Global Financial Crisis), was formally signed. Two weeks later, on Monday, August 18, 2008, the domain bitcoin.org was registered.\n\nBy November 2008, Quantitative Easing was in action, and the United States Federal Reserve had started buying mortgage-backed securities. In January 2009, the code for Bitcoin was released as open-source, and by March 2009, the Federal Reserve held close to two trillion US dollars of bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury notes.\n\nSuppose the goal was to beta-test digital currency at scale towards disintermediating secondary and tertiary financial institutions by directly linking citizens and a central bank. In that case, Bitcoin has been a spectacular success, heralding the upcoming era of CBDCs. If the goal were to make the common man conversant with digital currencies and their usage, Bitcoin would have succeeded remarkably.\n\nA revolutionary breakthrough when it was released, Bitcoin is many things to many people: a virtual currency, a new kind of money, a store of value, and the promise of freedom. But, more than anything, Bitcoin is a new monetary institution for the digital age. Bitcoin has demonstrated that digital monetary institutions are the future; it has done its job by moving the goalposts from why to when.\n\nSome see in Bitcoin and its pseudonymous creator(s), a Robin Hood-type legend, a Zorro-like hero, or a populist protagonist standing up against the system. It is not for me to deconstruct the thematic illusions, but as the old adage goes, the truth is bound to make you smile when it arrives.\n\nAct Two: The Rise of a Monolith and its Discontents\n\nBitcoin begat Ethereum, a 21st-century application platform to rival any of Silicon Valley\u2019s so-called enterprise-grade, global-scale platforms. And the Ethereum team did it all in the open, on with a crew of mostly volunteer developers spanning time zones and political and geo-political boundaries, long before working from home was a thing, shepherded by the genius of their founders and core developers.\n\nWhy Ethereum? Contrary to popular perception, Bitcoin is more than an application; it is more than the collection of technical capabilities that comprise the network and certainly more than a token. It is an institution, a self-governing institution. But it is not a platform. Bitcoin, when it was released, had a level of scripting extensibility, but it was not yet ready to enable developers to build new instances on top of it.\n\nEthereum, with its vision of being the world\u2019s computer, set out to create the definitive decentralized platform abstraction, a blockchain with built-in Turing-complete programming support, allowing developers to write smart contracts and to create decentralized protocols, services, and applications. And by any measure, the Ethereum project has been stunningly successful.\n\nProgrammable money, fiat-backed stablecoins, and the digitization of real-world assets are but some of how Ethereum has reshaped the world of monetary policy. Lending/borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and insurance are some of the financial domains in which Ethereum has helped rewrite the rules for historically highly intermediated products.\n\nAs a result of its extraordinary success, scaling has turned out to be a critical issue for the Ethereum project; it is worth noting that its scalability issues result from the project\u2019s prioritization of decentralization and security over scale. Scaling enhancements are anticipated to address network congestion and reduce transaction costs; Ethereum\u2019s gas fee problem has been a recurring theme.\n\nThere are two primary ways to scale the Ethereum network: on-chain and off-chain. On-chain refers to enhancements to the base layer and modifications to the network. Off-chain refers to the use of a separate network(s) (so-called Layer 2) to process transactions; Layer 2 networks may choose to emphasize scale over decentralization and security as they can benefit from the base network\u2019s strengths in these areas.\n\nNow, here is where things became very interesting. The so-called \u201con-chain\u201d proponents appear to be reluctant to let go, while the \u201coff-chain\u201d exponents appear to be eager to innovate. This is the classic saga of a maturing platform: how much loose coupling? How much composability? And on the other side, how much to enshrine on-chain before it becomes a net detractor for innovation?\n\nFor obvious reasons, Ethereum does not want to end up primarily as a reconciliation ledger for other Layer 2 networks and roll-ups, but at the same time, a monolithic approach imposes limits on a platform and its ecosystem and impacts a platform\u2019s ability to continue to grow its developer base. Things came to a head when Ethereum did its Merge update to Proof of Stake from Proof of Work.\n\nTrust is now a facet of staking and not mining anymore; was the value now more in the tokens and with the stakers? Or did it still lie in the underlying capabilities? And for how long? Could they be swapped out with newer, more innovative capabilities? And this leads to Act Three.\n\nAct Three: A New Economic Platform Advances\n\nEthereum begets EigenLayer, a first-of-a-kind economic platform.\n\nIn retrospect, it may appear linear, but it was genius, a first-class paradigm shift. The world may not be different with a change of paradigm, but the developer now works in a different world as they say, with a new mental model. We will look back and see a distinct transformation between decentralized applications in the Pre-EigenLayer era and those in the Post-EigenLayer era.\n\nAnd it was the Merge, with the shift to PoS that enabled EigenLayer to reframe the decentralized application model; PoW has no notion of negative incentives, but with PoS, while validators may earn rewards, their stake may also be slashed for misbehavior. With the advent of PoS, EigenLayer is able to programmatically bootstrap and scale Ethereum\u2019s trust model to guarantee economic security for a host of new protocols and services.\n\nDevelopers can secure their services without the need to create their validators, or to launch tokens, etc. The promise of loose coupling can now be extended to economic abstractions by creating markets for decentralized trust. A fascinating three-act play thus far, it remains to be seen what act four portends.\n\nJohn deVadoss is a co-founder of the InterWork Alliance, and he serves as on the Governing Board of the Global Blockchain Business Council."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is well-positioned for gains versus Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming weeks, based on favorable ETH/BTC technicals and bullish divergences.\n\nETH/BTC nears falling wedge breakout\n\nOne of the main reasons behind a potential ETH/BTC rally is its prevailing falling wedge pattern.\n\nA falling wedge is a classic bullish reversal pattern that forms when the price creates lower highs and higher lows with two converging trendlines. It\u2019s resolved after the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises to a level at a length equal to the maximum distance between the upper and lower trendlines.\n\nAs of Dec. 22, ETH/BTC is trending inside a similar pattern, eyeing a break above its upper trendline. Depending on the breakout point, the pair could rise toward the 0.056\u20130.059 BTC area by New Year\u2019s, up 6\u201313% from current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, veteran trader Peter Brandt disagrees, arguing that the aforementioned falling wedge pattern could be a descending triangle, a bearish indicator. Descending triangles are considered bearish continuation patterns in downtrends, which ETH/BTC has been in for the past 15 months.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: Peter Brandt/GenesisFT\n\nSo Brandt suggests that a break below the falling wedge\u2019s lower trendline could push the ETH/BTC pair down toward 0.044 BTC, down 8.5% from current price levels.\n\nBullish divergence on weekly chart\n\nLonger-time fram charts, however, suggest the possibility of a rebound by New Year\u2019s and during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor instance, Ether\u2019s price is forming lower highs while its relative strength index (RSI) is making higher lows on the weekly chart, indicating bullish divergence. This discrepancy suggests that the downward momentum is weakening, and a potential reversal to the upside may be imminent.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the price also treads near a support confluence comprising a multiyear ascending trendline and the 0.048\u20130.052 BTC area.\n\nRelated: Does Bitcoin's dominance drop hint at full-blown altcoin season?\n\nThis confluence limits ETH/BTC\u2019s downside prospects in the coming weeks, enabling a rebound toward the 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near 0.057 BTC by New Year\u2019s \u2014 also the falling wedge target mentioned above.\n\nConversely, the bears will try to pull the ETH price down below the support confluence, which will risk crashing it to 0.036 BTC, a historically significant resistance level between August 2018 and September 2020.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular blockchain sleuth that tracks large cryptocurrency transfers and shares their details on Twitter/X with the community, Whale Alert, has reported that an ancient Ethereum wallet has come back to life after staying inactive for nearly nine years.\n\nDormant whale stirs, holding thousands of ETH\n\nThe aforementioned source spotted a pre-mine Ethereum address with 11,640 ETH worth $26,489,720 has awakened after 8.4 years, which means that it was last used in late 2014 after the Ethereum team finished raising money via its initial coin offering.\n\nSo far, the whale has transferred 500 ETH to a freshly created wallet.\n\nMeanwhile, this transaction sparked a heated discussion within the cryptocurrency community. They suggested various explanations for this whale awakening particularly now, mostly leaving sarcastic comments or assuming it could be \"paper hands.\"\n\n\ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 \ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 11,640 #ETH (26,489,720 USD) has just been activated after 8.4 years!https://t.co/k9g7OmWl2r \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 23, 2023\n\nOver the past month, several Ethereum wallets got activated after years of dormancy, selling massive amounts of ETH. In early December, the second most popular cryptocurrency Ethereum staged a rise of a whopping 10%, retaking the $2,377 price level, so many whales apparently decided to start selling their ETH stashes bought during the Ethereum ICO.\n\nBy Dec. 10, however, Ethereum made a rebound, losing the 10% it had gained, and then soared again, adding 7.38% by now. At the time of this writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $2,285. Despite all the market turbulence, the coin has managed to hold above the $2,200 level; even though it dipped a few times well below it, it is still holding above $2,000.\n\nArthur Hayes expects ETH to reach $5,000\n\nIt has been reported that BitMEX founder and its former CEO Arthur Hayes has sold his Solana (SOL) stash and bought an undisclosed amount of Ethereum. He also shared that he expects Ethereum to skyrocket to the $5,000 price mark without specifying when, at least approximately.\n\nWhile Hayes just bought ETH, an anonymous whale, according to a tweet by smart money tracker @lookonchain, has made a 433x profit on trading ETH, earning approximately $1 million. They sold 1 ETH to acquire 293.8 million OMNI and then disposed of it, gaining 176 ETH. They now hold 155 million OMNI left in their wallet and a profit of $1 million made within a single day."

I received a message from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik. So I dumped SOL and bought more ETH.\n\nETH = $5,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,332 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHayes makes it clear he is rooting for Solana to continue to dip against Ethereum (SOL/ETH).\n\n\u201cGet Down!!!!\n\nETH = $5,000.\u201d\n\nSOL/ETH is trading for 0.04100 ETH ($95.63) at time of writing.\n\nHayes also shares his thoughts on the possible approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the differences between a so-called cash redemption model versus an \u201cin-kind\u201d model.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETFs cash or in-kind creation what\u2019s important?\n\nIn-kind is simpler and cleaner for the fund, as the fund doesn\u2019t have to direct the trading of BTC, but it means BTC can be sourced from anywhere. Cash is more complicated, but it hands big power to the fund. The fund trading desk will have bigly power to direct what should be large trading flows of BTC.\n\nGiven the \u2018made in America\u2019 political zeitgeist, you can bet only politically connected brokers and exchanges will be used as counter-parties to buy and BTC for the fund. It will be interesting to observe how the market microstructure changes if at all.\n\nWill price discovery move from East to West? Will the most important time to trade be Monday-Friday at 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when the creation/redemption window closes? This is going to open up juicy arbitrage opportunities for those who can trade on both American and non-American BTC exchanges.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "How to use the Polygon Bridge - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Polygon Bridge facilitates seamless asset transfers between different blockchain networks, enabling users to navigate diverse ecosystems and leverage decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities.\n\nWhat is the Polygon Bridge?\n\nPolygon blockchain is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. The Polygon Bridge is a cross-chain interoperability channel assisting interchain communication between different blockchains to Ethereum and vice versa.\n\nThe Polygon Network also provides resources for developing scalable decentralized applications (DApps). Polygon enables the quick and easy deployment of DApps to well-known DeFi platforms such as SushiSwap, Aave and Curve.\n\nSince Polygon transactions are faster and cheaper than Ethereum transactions, users and DApp developers opt for digital asset migration via the Polygon Bridge. But how fast is the Polygon Bridge? While the Ethereum network can handle 14 transactions per second (TPS), the Polygon Bridge facilitates up to 65,000 TPS.\n\nHow does the Polygon Bridge work?\n\nPolygon Bridge operates on a trustless, dual-consensus architecture to maximize efficiency and decentralization. It uses a single-token architecture and allows arbitrary state transitions on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechains.\n\nThe Polygon network has two bridges \u2014 the Plasma Bridge and the proof-of-stake (PoS) Bridge \u2014 to validate transactions. The cheapest way to bridge Ether (ETH) to Polygon is via the PoS Bridge.\n\nThe Plasma Bridge utilizes Ethereum Plasma\u2019s scaling technology to enhance transfer security. It can handle transfers of native tokens such as Polygon\u2019s MATIC (MATIC) and some Ethereum tokens, such as ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nOn the other hand, the PoS Bridge relies on a PoS consensus for its network security. While withdrawals may take time to confirm, Polygon processes deposits instantly. Users can use the PoS Bridge to transfer most ERC tokens and Ether. For the PoS Bridge, withdrawals can take from 45 minutes to three hours, while for the Plasma Bridge, it can take up to seven days.\u200b\n\nTokens will continue circulating if they cross over the Polygon Bridge since the circulating supply of the token will not change. In short, when a user transfers tokens from the Ethereum network to the Polygon network, they remain locked.\n\nThe number of tokens created on the Polygon network will equal those created on the Ethereum network (token wrapping). Polygon will burn the pegged tokens while bridging the tokens back to Ethereum, unlocking the tokens on Ethereum.\n\nWhy use Polygon Bridge\n\nDue to its widespread use, Ethereum often faces considerable network congestion from the substantial volume of transactions. The Polygon sidechain provides a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum transactions, making it easier, faster and cheaper to access the network and transfer crypto assets between platforms.\n\nMoreover, Polygon Bridge\u2019s utility lies in enhancing interoperability, reducing transaction costs and accelerating transaction speeds, thereby providing users with a more efficient and cost-effective means of transferring assets across networks. Additionally, it opens up opportunities for utilizing diverse DApps and accessing various financial services available on both the Ethereum and Polygon chains.\n\nHow to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon via the PoS Bridge\n\nA user needs a compatible crypto wallet to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon. Polygon supports several wallets, chiefly MetaMask, Coinbase, Bitski and Venly. In this article, we\u2019ll be using the MetaMask wallet to explain below the step-by-step process of using the Polygon Bridge:\n\nStep 1: Click the \u201cPolygon Bridge\u201d icon to log in to the Polygon wallet suite.\n\nStep 2: Connect to the MetaMask crypto wallet by scanning the QR code with your smartphone.\n\nStep 3: Click \u201cConnect\u201d on the smartphone to confirm the connection.\n\nStep 4: Once you\u2019ve successfully linked to the wallet, the page will redirect you to the Polygon Bridge interface.\n\nStep 5: Click the \u201cBridge\u201d button on the left to transfer assets from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon.\n\nStep 6: Select a token to use for the bridge by clicking its name. After entering the desired amount, click the \u201cTransfer\u201d icon. Deposits take about seven to eight minutes.\n\nStep 7: Carefully review all the transaction details, including the token transfers and estimated cost, before clicking \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\nStep 8: Verify the deposit\u2019s estimated gas fees, and if you\u2019re satisfied, click \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\nStep 9: In the MetaMask wallet, you can review the transaction\u2019s details, but you must click \u201cConfirm\u201d to sign and approve the transfer.\n\nStep 10: You have to wait for the tokens to appear in your Polygon wallet. The transaction can be tracked by clicking on \u201cView on Polygonscan\u201d in the MetaMask wallet.\n\nHow to bridge MATIC tokens from the Polygon network to the Ethereum blockchain via the PoS Bridge\n\nBefore transferring assets between the Polygon PoS Bridge and the Ethereum blockchain, users must map tokens between the platforms using the Polygon Token Mapper.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, follow these steps to use the PoS bridge, utilizing MetaMask:\n\nStep 1: On the \u201cBridge\u201d interface, click \u201cWithdrawal.\u201d\n\nStep 2: You must choose the token you want to transfer to the Ethereum network.\n\nStep 3: You can click the \u201cSwitch Bridge\u201d option beside the \u201cTransfer Mode\u201d to choose a compatible transfer bridge, although the PoS Bridge will automatically select the default option for transferring tokens from Polygon to Ethereum. In this case, choose the PoS Bridge.\n\nStep 4: Enter the desired amount and click \u201cTransfer.\u201d\n\nStep 5: Click \u201cContinue\u201d after reviewing the transaction\u2019s details.\n\nStep 6: Review the \u201cTransfer Overview\u201d prompt and projected gas fees. If the charges are acceptable, click \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the transaction details once again and click \u201cConfirm\u201d if satisfied.\n\nStep 8: Sign and approve the transfer to the Polygon Bridge MetaMask wallet. Ensure all the details are correct before clicking the \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\n\nStep 9: The transfer progress will appear. The withdrawal process could take up to three hours to allow PoS validators to verify the transaction.\n\nStep 10: Click \u201cContinue\u201d to transfer the assets to the MetaMask wallet. After logging in to the wallet, click \u201cImport Tokens\u201d after the validation and completion of the withdrawal.\n\nHow to bridge MATIC tokens from the Polygon network to the Ethereum blockchain via the Plasma Bridge\n\nTo bridge MATIC tokens from the Polygon network, users should initially integrate the Polygon network into their wallet. If using MetaMask, access the wallet, incorporate Polygon, or utilize the Polygon Wallet interface to integrate MetaMask.\n\nThen, follow the steps below to bridge MATIC to Ethereum through the Plasma Bridge:\n\nStep 1: Navigate to the \u201cBridge\u201d interface and select \u201cWithdraw.\u201d Select \u201cMatic Token\u201d from the drop-down menu, enter the amount, and click \u201cTransfer.\u201d The system automatically chooses Plasma Bridge when clicking \u201cTransfer.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Read the notification labeled \u201cImportant.\u201d The interface will display the transaction\u2019s estimated gas fee. Click \u201cContinue\u201d if the gas fee estimate is satisfactory. Double-check the transaction details.\n\nStep 3: A MetaMask pop-up will appear, asking you to approve the transaction. When you click \u201cConfirm,\u201d the transfer will commence.\n\nStep 4: Wait for the checkpoint as validators confirm the transaction. This may take three hours.\n\nStep 5: Unlike the PoS Bridge, this transfer requires a second confirmation on arrival at the \u201cCheckpoint.\u201d After the second confirmation, click \u201cContinue\u201d to start the mandatory seven-day \u201cChallenge Period.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Once the \u201cChallenge Period\u201d ends validating the transaction, select \u201cContinue\u201d to claim and send the MATIC tokens to the MetaMask wallet.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the Plasma Bridge also works with ERC-721 tokens.\n\nBenefits of utilizing the Polygon Bridge for cross-chain transactions\n\nUtilizing the Polygon Bridge for cross-chain transactions offers a spectrum of advantages. It presents a cost-effective and rapid solution, minimizing transaction fees and congestion experienced on the Ethereum network.\n\nWith seamless interoperability, it facilitates smooth asset transfers across diverse blockchains, amplifying accessibility to decentralized finance opportunities. The bridge enhances scalability by mitigating network bottlenecks and empowering users with faster transaction speeds.\n\nMoreover, it fosters a secure environment, leveraging the robustness of Polygon\u2019s architecture to ensure the integrity of cross-chain transactions. Overall, the Polygon Bridge stands as an efficient, economical and secure conduit for navigating between blockchain networks, enabling a more inclusive and streamlined decentralized ecosystem.\n\nRisks of utilizing bridges for cross-chain transactions\n\nThere are risks associated with using cross-chain bridges in decentralized ecosystems. These bridges might have security flaws that expose assets to risks such as network intrusions or smart contract exploits. Complexities in interoperability may cause delays in transactions, inconsistent chains or even the loss of assets in transfers.\n\nMoreover, depending on several networks makes one more vulnerable to network congestion or problems associated with it, which can affect transaction costs and speeds. The dynamic nature of blockchain technology and regulatory uncertainties present additional obstacles that could impact the functionality of cross-chain bridges.\n\nIn some cases, bridges may face liquidity issues, making it difficult to move large amounts of assets quickly. When conducting cross-chain transactions, users must be cautious, recognize these risks, and take appropriate precautions, just like with any newly developed technology.\n\nThe future of cross-chain bridges\n\nThe future of cross-chain bridges appears promising, poised for evolution and integration across diverse blockchain ecosystems. Improvements in interoperability, smooth asset transfers and network friction reduction are expected to be the main areas of focus.\n\nMoreover, technological innovations have the potential to simplify user experiences, lower costs, and introduce more efficient protocols. In addition, anticipate more security measures to strengthen these bridges and guarantee dependability and trust when transferring assets.\n\nCross-chain bridges will be essential in promoting cooperation, opening up decentralized finance applications, and increasing the opportunities for users to easily engage across multiple blockchains as the blockchain landscape develops."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum reclaims a crucial resistance that suggests the bulls continue to hold a tight grip over the rally\n\nThe bulls who appear to be in control are believed to trigger a fine upswing that could lead the price a step closer to its ATH\n\nThe bulls appear to have slowly conquered the crypto markets as the prices of the popular tokens have been rising consistently. As the Bitcoin price maintains a sideways trend, the altcoins gain traction as the Ethereum price regains bullish momentum. With a rebound from the interim lows at $2,100, the second-largest token validated a bullish divergence, and by surpassing the crucial resistance, it invalidated a bearish scenario for a while.\n\nThe bears had frozen the levels at $2257 as the price constantly failed to clear these levels. Although the price marked the daily highs above $2330, it is facing some bearish heat, which is preventing it from rising above the average bands of the rising parallel channel. As the price trades above the support, the possibility of a bullish breakout emerges. Moreover, the technicals also support the bullish claim that a rally towards $2500 could be imminent.\n\nAs seen in the chart, the ETH price is testing the immediate upper resistance zone between $2312 and $2337. If the price closes the day\u2019s trade within or above the price zone, then the price could reach the neckline of the double-bottom pattern. With this, a bullish breakout may be followed as the RSI is bullish and the TSI is closer to flashing a buy signal. Moreover, the buying pressure has coiled up, which suggests the token will maintain an ascending trend for a long time.\n\nThis trade indicates a rise beyond the pivotal resistance level of $2386.82, which has to be held firmly by the bulls. This could lead to an extended bullish upswing beyond the crucial resistance at $2529.78, which may invalidate a bearish trend. Now that the markets are approaching the end of the year, volatility is expected to rise. This may result in a bullish start for the year 2024, which may transform into a bull run to reach $3500 during the first quarter."

        "content": "A prophetic message prompted Hayes to dump SOL for ETH .\n\nHayes predicts huge Ethereum price appreciation .\n\nSolana\u2019s price and DEX volume have strong momentum.\n\nSolana\u2019s ties to FTX and its disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried led many to believe the project was finished. However, 2023 has been Solana\u2019s year of redemption, particularly from late Q3 onwards, as SOL spiked higher to post an 830% year-to-date gain. Yet BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has waded in to \u201cforetell\u201d that now is the time to ditch Solana in favor of Ethereum.\n\nDump Solana Sayeth the Lord\n\nHayes announced dumping Solana in favor of Ethereum, citing a message from God as the basis for this call. The humorous tweet poked fun at Solana\u2019s history with FTX while glorifying \u201cArchangel Vitalik\u201d as the bringer of an imminent $5,000 ETH price.\n\nFam \u2026 I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nMany of the replies mimicked Hayes\u2019 humorous style, conferring religious connotations back, including one X user who took a dig at Ethereum\u2019s unaffordable network costs by commenting, \u201cThe Lord does not support such gas fees. Blasphemy I say.\u201d Similarly, Pepe maximalist \u201cz\ud83d\udc38\u201d implied that Hayes had misinterpreted God\u2019s 5,000 figure as the incoming ETH gas price, not a future ETH price.\n\nthis is the gwei \u2014 z\ud83d\udc38 (@degenharambe) December 22, 2023\n\nCommon themes throughout were the interpretation of Hayes\u2019 tweet as a sign to stack more SOL and to trade the token long, as well as accusations that Hayes is attempting to manipulate the market.\n\nAlthough Hayes conveyed a tongue-in-cheek message to dump Solana for Ethereum, looking at the data suggests the momentum is with Solana.\n\nEthereum Killer?\n\nData posted by SOL data aggregator platform Step Finance showed that Solana\u2019s 24-hour DEX volume had exceeded Ethereum\u2019s, plus all of its layer 2s combined, indicating strong momentum within the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, as noted by \u201cThe Crypto Cat,\u201d the SOLETH trading pair saw a massive uptick from around 0.011 to as high as 0.041 during this quarter. The Crypto Cat commented that this marks a remarkable turnaround from the recent past when his feed was filled with commentary that Solana \u201cwas the worst trash in existence.\u201d\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nHayes has a history of making bold price predictions and attention-grabbing statements on crypto X .\n\nEthereum \u2019s market cap valuation is seven times greater than Solana \u2019s.\n\nSolana has been criticized for frequent outages, but the network has had 100% uptime since late February.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile cloaked in humor, Hayes\u2019 tweet underscores the monumental difficulty crypto projects face when trying to unseat Ethereum\u2019s dominant network effect, particularly its vast developer ecosystem. Nonetheless, Solana appears to have shaken off its negative image, demonstrating that investors can forgive when prices increase.\n\nRead about Solana\u2019s remarkable rise in market cap valuation here:\n\nSolana Overthrows XRP, Adding $5B Market Cap in a Single Day\n\n\n\nFind out about PancakeSwap\u2019s plan for \u201cultrasound\u201d CAKE here:\n\nPancakeSwap Proposes Hefty Cut to CAKE Token Supply"

        "content": "Solana has had one of the best price journeys this year, increasing an outstanding 665% since January. The cryptocurrency has particularly done well in the last quarter of the year, registering price gains that were practically absent for the majority of the year.\n\nThis week, SOL flipped BNB to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency and second-largest altcoin by market cap. At this rate, Ethereum\u2019s spot may be next.\n\nSolana\u2019s Impressive Growth\n\nSolana\u2019s price movement this year has been nothing but surprising, and it has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. At the same time, Solana\u2019s blockchain has grown in different metrics. The growth can also be simultaneously linked to various airdrops in Solana-based projects and the Solana Saga Phone which gave out 30 million BONK tokens, a Solana meme coin, for each new owner of the phone. As a result, Solana overtook XRP in market cap rankings for the first time ever, with the latter having a 1.82% price decrease in a 7-day timeframe.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token, SOL, recently reached a yearly high of $99, helping the network to also briefly overtake BNB in terms of market cap. According to data from Coinmarketcap, SOL\u2019s 24-hour trading volume increased by over 33% to over $5.86 billion.\n\nHowever, Solana has since undergone a price correction and is now trading at $91. On the other hand, BNB\u2019s price growth has been slow this year, with the crypto only registering a 9% gain in the past 365 days.\n\nAt the time of writing, BNB is trading at $269, a 22.7% decrease from its yearly high of $348. Solana is now at loggerheads with BNB and it is only a matter of time until it fully overtakes and claims the position of the 2nd largest altcoin.\n\nSOL price recovers above $93 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCan Solana Catch Up With Ethereum?\n\nThe question now is whether Solana can catch up to Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network. While Ethereum still dominates in the DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts space, Solana is continuing to acquire a growing share of the industry.\n\nIn particular, activity on Solana has been on par with Ethereum in the past few weeks, with the chains now rivaling in terms of DEX volume, NFT volumes, active addresses, transaction count, and stablecoin transfers. According to on-chain analytics platform Artemis, total SOL trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $1.5 billion in the past 24 hours, its highest so far this year.\n\nSource: Artemis\n\nSolana is currently trading at $91, up by 17% in the past seven days, and is on its way to breaking the $100 price level again. If the current pace of price growth continues, we could see Solana revisiting its current all-time high of $259 in the first half of 2024.\n\nHowever, Solana still has a long way to go to match Ethereum\u2019s network effects and price. Ethereum\u2019s total market cap currently stands at $278.3 billion, $244 billion more than Solana\u2019s $39.4 billion market cap.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price rallied by over 85% in 2023 \u2013 a similar increase in 2024 places the target above $4,000.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF approval will be a key catalyst for a price rally and also set a precedent for ETH ETF approvals in Q2 and Q3 2024.\n\nEthereum mainnet is expected to undergo the sharding upgrades, starting with Dencun, which will introduce proto-danksharding.\n\nInvestors and traders alike are anticipating ETH price to rise in order to book profits before Q2 2024.\n\nEthereum price increased considerably in 2023, recovering about a third of the crash from December 2021 to May 2022. However, the remaining two-thirds of this crash is expected to be recovered in 2024 owing to multiple factors.\n\nETH investors have a lot to look forward to throughout the year as events such as spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Dencun (sharding) update, and spot Ethereum ETF decision will be taking place, which are expected to be bullish catalysts. However, the lack of institutional investors' interest might act as a barrier to this growth and keep ETH from reaching $4,000.\n\n2024 Fundamental outlook: Ethereum price to witness growth from spot Bitcoin ETF approval\n\n2024 is expected to kick off the bull run that the crypto market has been waiting for since June 2022. Ethereum price, along with the rest of the market, is set to witness bullishness owing to one single factor \u2013 the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOver a dozen investment fund managers, including the likes of BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, have applied for ETFs. The initial outcome was not positive as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exhibited skepticism, but following Grayscale's win, sentiment changed.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the asset manager in the lawsuit filed against the SEC for rejecting the request to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. This imbued confidence in the market, and the deadline for the final decision is expected to arrive by January 10, 2024.\n\nBitcoin spot ETF update\n\nAs Bitcoin price rallies, Ethereum will fulfill its role as the \"Silver to BTC's Gold\" and likely push other altcoins to rally as well.\n\nFurthermore, this approval will also set a precedent for Ethereum spot ETFs, which asset managers are already eyeing. VanEck, ARK Invest, and BlackRock, among three others, have already applied for a spot ETH ETF. Grayscale, too, filed to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these applications have strong odds of approval, too, since they would be similar in design and structure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, their final deadline is between May and August 2024, giving investors time before they can get their hands on the investment products.\n\nEthereum spot ETF filings\n\nThat said, following the spot BTC ETF approval, ETH ETFs will see much less friction in acquiring a green light from the SEC. This will be the driving factor for the continuation of the Ethereum price rise in Q2 2024.\n\nThe Surge after the Merge\n\nDuring a recent Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the future of the blockchain. Referencing the Merge, Buterin stated that the chain is only 55% complete and has a long way to go.\n\nThe next four stages, as noted by Buterin, will be The Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The first of these four \u2013 The Surge \u2013 will introduce sharding on Ethereum.\n\nSharding is a key scalability solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network's capacity to process transactions and execute smart contracts. This is done by splitting the network into smaller, more manageable chains called shards.\n\nEthereum Sharding structure\n\nThese shards are individual components of the Ethereum network itself. Each shard operates as an independent blockchain with its own set of smart contracts. These chains can process transactions and execute smart contracts independently, reducing congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe main goals of Ethereum developers with the sharding update are as follows:\n\nScalability: As the Ethereum network continues to grow, it faces significant limitations in transaction throughput and processing capacity. Sharding introduces a parallel processing approach, allowing multiple transactions and smart contracts to be processed simultaneously across different shards. Crosslinking: Shards communicate with each other through crosslinks, which are references to the state of one shard included in another shard's block. Crosslinking helps maintain consistency and integrity across the entire Ethereum network. Increased opportunities for validators: Validators participate in the consensus process by proposing and validating blocks on individual shards. Validators are chosen to propose blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they lock up as collateral in the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nIn the sharding update, the beacon chain will play a crucial role as well. The beacon chain was the first Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which acts as a separate blockchain that coordinates the overall network and manages the consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Stake). This chain will be used to coordinate communication between the shards.\n\nThe process of implementing sharding will begin with the Dencun upgrade. Set to be executed in Q1 2024, the upgrade will bring proto-danksharding to the network. Proto-danksharding will act as the scaffolding for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding, which is a crucial part of the Surge.\n\nDencun upgrade will also optimize the Ethereum gas fees, which has been a prevailing issue for users. Throughout 2023, Ethereum layer-2 chain\u2019s fee per transaction has averaged $0.02 to $0.21, whereas Ethereum mainnet transaction fees have averaged $4.86.\n\nEthereum and layer-2 chains\u2019 gas fees\n\nAs these updates are set to arrive in Q1 and Q2, with many of them expected to be deployed by May-June, they will likely act as the bullish catalyst of the second half of 2024.\n\n2024 Technical Outlook: Ethereum price could see $4,000\n\nEthereum price over the past year had a good run, rising by more than 85%. While Q1 proved to be a good quarter for the altcoin, the growth halted, and ETH largely consolidated throughout Q2 and Q3, struggling to breach the $2,000 mark.\n\nHowever, in Q4, Ethereum price began rallying again, mostly owing to expectations surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which also led to many investment funds filing for spot ETH ETFs. During this duration, ETH shot up by 51% to end the year at around $2,200, which is the present trading price.\n\nThus, if throughout 2023 ETH rose by over 85% despite the bearish market conditions, a similar rally or even a larger one can be expected out of a bullish year in which ETF approvals are expected, network developments are implemented, and Bitcoin halving will take place.\n\nETH/USD 1-week chart\n\nIf ETH repeats 2023\u2019s performance in 2024, the target for next year will be at over $4,000. The price indicators also suggest a bullish outcome despite the slight correction in the past few weeks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just exited overbought, coinciding with the pullback witnessed over the last week, whilst the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the zero line, showing the uptrend is accompanied by strong bullish momentum.\n\nAlthough the receding green bars do suggest that the bullishness is waning at the moment, some pullback before bullish momentum regains strength is common in longer timeframes, and this can be observed during the past bull runs as well.\n\nFurthermore, ETH has observed the 50, 100 and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) as support, which is a bullish indication since the last time this happened was in July 2020. At that time, ETH ended up scoring a 1,577% rally from $288 to $3,928, a feat that will not be replicated in 2024.\n\nNevertheless, despite the bullish indications, one should remember that the recent rally has caused the Ethereum price to be overbought on RSI, and investors might attempt to book profits in the first half of 2024 again. This falls in line with historical movement where ETH lived in the overbought zone (RSI above 70.0) for about six months before initiating short-term corrections in June 2021.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nThe prospect of investors selling their holdings to realize profits is also evident from the on-chain metrics, which suggest investors may book profits if the Ethereum price shoots up. Nevertheless, ETH would still be expected to remain above the $2,500 mark until Q2, after the corrections, the ETF hype subsides, and the market moves on to the Ethereum network upgrades.\n\nProfit-taking will bring corrections, but traders remain bullish\n\nOn-chain metrics can be used to analyze investors' behavior and make predictions about future price activity. One of the most important on-chain metrics is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric is an indicator used to assess the average profit/loss of investors who purchase an asset. It can provide clues as to when investors might begin taking profits and selling their holdings, leading to pullbacks in price.\n\nThe quarterly and yearly MVRV ratios are the most useful for long-term analysis. The 90-day MVRV ratio measures the average profit/loss of investors who purchased an asset in the past three months, and the 365-day MVRV ratio measures the same over the last year.\n\nFor Ethereum, the 90-day MVRV sits at 15.25%, which indicates that investors who purchased ETH in Q4 2023 are sitting at 15.25% profit. Similarly, the 365-day MVRV ratio is presently at 24.18%, suggesting that those who purchased throughout 2023 are, on average, witnessing 24.18% profits.\n\nInterestingly, considering both the timeframes, it is evident that these investors are likely to be tempted to sell their holdings soon to realize profits. This could most certainly trigger a sell-off. As seen in the chart, when MVRV hits 9% to 34% on the yearly time frame and 7.8% to 31% on the quarterly time frame, ETH has undergone considerable corrections. Hence, this area is termed a danger zone.\n\nEthereum MVRV ratio\n\nApart from investors, the traders are also seemingly bullish. This inference is derived from the funding rates, which show an increasing trend. Such a trend suggests that long positions are gaining dominance, indicating a prevailing bullish market sentiment.\n\nAs can be observed on the chart below, the last time funding rates plunged into negative, i.e., short traders gained dominance, was back in March 2023. Since then, the rates have largely been positive, which means people are betting on a rise. This is solely being done with the intention of selling for profits.\n\nEthereum funding rate\n\nSo, considering these conditions, the bull run that starts due to spot Bitcoin ETF hype, followed by the sharding update, will likely urge investors to sell and realize profits. However, long-term holders will refrain and wait until the bull run flips and ETH begins witnessing a downtrend.\n\nWatch out for institutions\n\nOne key factor that might act as a headwind to Ethereum price reaching the target of $4,000 is the lack of institutional interest ETH has been witnessing. Year to date, the crypto asset only managed to rake in $19 million, which is far lower than Solana's $146 million worth of inflows and astronomically less than Bitcoin's $1.7 billion.\n\nEthereum's year-to-date institutional flows\n\nIf this trend continues in 2024 as well, ETH might struggle to capitalize on the rest of the bullish cues since institutions are expected to drive the next bull run, and lack of interest from them may not play in Ethereum's favor.\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarize the outlook for Ethereum in 2024, the best advice is to sit on holdings, wait and gain. A bullish year for the broader crypto market and a bullish year for ETH investors is the forecast. But that does not mean the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold is completely immune to bearish outcomes.\n\nWhile an increase to $4,000 is possible, it is not a certainty since regulatory changes and unprecedented crashes plague the crypto market. Furthermore, considering the performance in 2023, ETH has not necessarily been the favorite asset of institutional investors. This lack of interest, if noted in 2024 as well, could act as an opposing force on ETH's potential growth.\n\nThus, it is advised always to do your own research and make the most ETH-ducated decision."

ETH could reach $2,500s, and some alts could have the last pumps. After this, a full reversal to new lows is likely over the next few weeks\u2026\n\nI believe new lows are still to come before the real bull market begins.\u201d\n\nThe trader elaborates on his reasoning in a thread about why \u201cwe might still see new lows over the coming months.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with BTC on HTF (high timeframe). We have seen a bullish trend during 2023. Many think that this is the start of a new bull market, but in my opinion, this is a corrective move. Now the price is at a major resistance zone. Confirmations are on the chart.\u201d\n\nHe uses the Elliott Wave theory, which attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology that is manifested in waves. The Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave \u201cABC\u201d corrections.\n\n\u201cBTC EW (Elliott Wave) perspective: the bearish trend during 2022 was an impulsive move that broke the 2020-2021 bull market trend. Now, the move from the $16,000 low looks like a corrective move (wave B/X). This move tends to be followed by another impulsive move (wave C/Y).\u201d\n\nLooking at Ethereum, the trader predicts that ETH could decline as low as $550 after facing resistance at around the $2,600 level.\n\n\u201c[ETH] has broken a key level and the next major resistance is $2,500-$2,600. It has a lot of liquidity below that should be taken eventually. The bearish confirmation would be a clean break below $2,000-$2,100.\u201d\n\nHe suggests other altcoins are surging from an inflow of money from Bitcoin sales, which he says often indicates a market correction is coming soon.\n\n\u201cMoney is flowing from BTC to altcoins. This usually happens during the last phases of a bullish trend. Some altcoins could pump more, but the trend is overextended and reaching to an end. When OTHERS (altcoins index) reaches the green zone, we should see a strong correction.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The increase in ETH tokens on the exchange platform is significant in comparison to the past three months, seen in the chart below. Mounting selling pressure could push ETH price lower.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges noted a considerable increase between December 21 and Saturday. As ETH reserves in exchange wallets climb, there is more Ether available to sell, typically increasing the selling pressure on the altcoin .\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Ethereum: Why a price move to $2.5K is a good prediction - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH accumulation has been increasing, suggesting a move toward $2,500.\n\nMarket participants are not convinced that the coin is about to jump.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Santiment, active addresses on the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain have been rising. As of 18th December, the 24-hour active addresses was 395,000.\n\nBut at press time, the metric has climbed to 512,000. Active addresses measure daily interaction and speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the increase suggests that there are more market participants involved in ETH transfers. Like the active addresses, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain volume also increased.\n\nAt the time of writing, the volume was 13.02 billion. The rise in active users and volume implies a surge in network activity on the blockchain\n\nETH\u2019 season to switch states\n\nAlso, this could be a bullish sign for ETH\u2019s price. For a while, ETH has come under intense criticism for its inability to replicate Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] form. Likewise, ETH has also been unable to outperform many other altcoins.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that ETH will not have its season.\n\nOne reason for this assertion is the number of new ETH wallets created. Based on Glassnode\u2019s data, new addresses on Ethereum have been growing.\n\nThis indicates a surge in traction which could translate to a positive move for the price action. On a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis, ETH\u2019s value has increased by 84.11%.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency has been stuck between the $2,000 and $2,300 levels for some time. A look at the ETH/USD daily chart showed that a bullish thesis could soon be validated.\n\nThis was because of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). At press time, the 20-day EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50-day EMA (yellow).\n\nThis position is bullish and could be termed a buy/long trend. So, traders may need to desist from opening short positions.\n\nBut the Awesome Oscillator (AO) revealed that ETH\u2019s bullish season may not happen in a few days. At the same time, it may not be far away.\n\n$2,500 or nothing\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO had formed red bars. However, the red bars were decreasing in height, suggesting a weak bearish momentum.\n\nAlso, the increase in the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator means a move to $2,500 could be possible in the short to mid-term.\n\nIn the meantime, market participants are not all bullish on ETH. This was indicated by the Weighted Sentiment.\n\nAt press time, the Weighted Sentiment was -1.736. This negative reading is a confirmation of the bearish bias most market players have.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nConsidering ETH\u2019s circulation, on-chain data showed that it decreased to 242,000. This decrease implies that the number of ETH engaged in transactions has reduced compared to the hike on the 20th of December.\n\nPrice-wise, the drop in circulation suggests low selling pressure for ETH. So, it may be unlikely to see a nosedive in ETH\u2019s value soon."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The recent volatility in the crypto market takes a bullish turn this week as market sentiments show optimism for the nearing deadline of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision to spot Bitcoin ETF Thus, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum(ETH) has been rising for the past three days, reclaiming the recently lost support of channel pattern and 20-day EMAs. Will this counterattack push the Ether price to $2500?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Eyeing Rally to $2,700 Amid Strong Exchange Outflows\n\nadvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s Why the Next Leap Could Push ETH to $2500\n\nThe ETH Price reentering the channel pattern should offer buyers with additional support to rally.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price hints a strong bounce is likely\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $16.4 Billion, indicating a 22% gain.\n\nThe last ten weeks\u2019 recovery in Ethereum price can be traced using a rising channel pattern. The lower trendline of this channel offered strong pullback support to buyers, assisting them in prolonging the recovery trendline.\n\nHowever, amid the third week of sell-off in the crypto market, the ETH price gave a bearish breakdown from the pattern\u2019s lower support. This lost surge was expected to surge selling pressure and trigger an aggressive correction.\n\nHowever, the buyers made a counterattack with a higher volume and reentered the channel pattern. With an intraday gain of 4.5%, the ETH price is now trading at $2341 and marked the prior breakdown as a bear trap.\n\nThus, the traders with sellers with tight stop loss may face forced liquidation and pour additional buying orders into the market. If the coin price manages to show sustainability above the reclaimed support, the buyers may drive a 10% rally to revisit the upper trendline near $2500.\n\nFunding Rates Surge Signals Confidence in a Climb to $2,500\n\nThe recent upward trend in Ethereum has been accompanied by a noteworthy increase in Ethereum Funding Rates, indicating a widespread expectation among traders for further gains, with a target of $2,500 in sight. Data from Coinglass, a prominent tracker of cryptocurrency derivatives, shows that the ETH Funding Rates surged to an impressive 0.045% last Friday. This increase in funding rates signals that traders are leaning bullish on the asset, willing to pay a premium to hold long positions. This optimistic sentiment can create a self-reinforcing effect, as the higher funding rates may attract more traders to enter long positions, expecting the price to climb\n\nBollinger Band: The narrow range in the Bollinger Band indicator reflects increasing volatility in the market.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The daily ADX slope at 24% hints the buyers have enough steam to lead a further rally."

        "content": "BitMex founder Arthur Hayes has revealed that he is diverting his interest toward Ethereum (ETH) while disclosing a bold prediction for the crypto asset.\n\nArthur Hayes Doubling Down On Ethereum\n\nArthur Hayes recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his optimism and prediction about the future of Ethereum, and the post has since caused quite a stir in the entire cryptocurrency community.\n\nRenowned for his perceptive market analysis, Hayes claimed to have had a revelation on ETH during one of his meditations, and this prompted him to significantly alter his cryptocurrency holdings. He sarcastically asserted in the X post to have gotten the direction from the Lord.\n\nFollowing this supposed heavenly direction, Hayes allegedly sold his Solana holdings and increased his stake in Ethereum. In addition, he has predicted a spike that would take the price of the cryptocurrency asset to an astounding $5,000.\n\nHe further conveyed his love and appreciation for Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Hayes called Vitalik an Archangel while doing so.\n\nHayes\u2019 evaluation of the market dynamics might have played a role in his choice to divert from Solana to Ethereum. In another X post, Arthur Hayes shared a chart of Ethereum to back up his predictions. The crypto exchange founder has urged the crypto community to \u201cget down\u201d on the digital asset.\n\nThe BitMex founder\u2019s projections come after his previous call, in which he predicted that Solana\u2019s price would hit $100. Hayes\u2019 prediction has appeared to be almost accurate, as the digital asset\u2019s price has recently reached a peak of $99.\n\nSince mid-December SOL has been demonstrating a rally, increasing by an astounding 350%. Despite the fact that Solana is displaying an upward trajectory, Hayes seems to think that Ethereum still has the potential to outperform SOL.\n\nGlassnode Co-Founders Give Next Target For The Crypto Asset\n\nJan Happel and Yann Allemann, cofounders of Glassnode and collectively known on X as Negentropic, have highlighted the next target for Ethereum. According to the cofounders, the next target for ETH is $2,500 and has urged the community to keep an eye on this level.\n\nNegentropic asserted that the asset reaching the $2,500 target will be triggered by market enthusiasm. Another target identified by the founders is $2,700, which ETH will attain by continuous ambitious push.\n\nThe co-founders also highlighted a support level at $2,100, which was once a resistance level but now a key zone. However, Negentropic pointed out that the level has now turned out to be critical for short-term rebounds. In addition, they asserted that if ETH ends up breaching the support level, it might activate the 50-Day EMA.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,307, indicating a 1.30% increase in the past 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased by 19% to $16,690,793,321, its market capitalization has increased by 1.31% to $277,454,559,883.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Messari\u2019s latest newsletter posits that the industry is witnessing crypto\u2019s adolescence, emphasizing that smart contract blockspace is becoming a commodity.\n\nCEO Ryan Selkis acknowledged 2023 as Ethereum\u2019s best year yet, citing its status as the strongest network in terms of community size and revenue generation through fees. However, he suggested that the crypto industry is still in its \u201cadolescence\u201d while asserting that smart contract blockspace is evolving into a commodity, implying a paradigm shift in the way developers approach blockchain platforms.\n\nBullish Case for Ethereum\n\nA significant point raised in Messari\u2019s report is the expected decentralization away from Ethereum by developers. The market intelligence company predicts that most developers will lean towards the lowest cost and highest performance blockchains, interacting with the second-largest blockchain primarily through rollups and bridges \u2013 a shift that aligns with Ethereum\u2019s long-term explicit direction.\n\nContrary to the narrative of Ethereum losing its prominence, Selkis outlined a bullish case for the blockchain network. The exec highlighted Ethereum\u2019s long-established network reliability, a liquid ecosystem, and a staggering $300 billion market cap \u2013 ten times higher than its nearest smart contract network competitor.\n\nSelkis emphasized that Ethereum\u2019s maturity becomes a key factor in attracting rollup and app developers, ensuring the platform remains a significant player in the evolving blockchain ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s potential success in 2024 could be closely tied to how traditional finance (TradFi) embraces the platform. According to Messari, Ethereum, with its clean and environmentally friendly narrative, is positioned as an attractive option for Wall Street. Selkis anticipates a fast follow-up of an ETF for Ethereum, similar to the trend observed with Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s appeal to traditional financial institutions becomes more evident with a net deflationary supply and an annual fee generation of around $300 million, the report detailed.\n\nMessari\u2019s annual report characterized Ethereum as a \u201cChaotic Good\u201d as it continued to thrive on volatility and chaos. While Bitcoin is often considered a bet against bankrupt central banks, Ethereum, according to Selkis, represents a bet against morally bankrupt investment banks. This depiction underscored Ethereum\u2019s adaptability in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nSolana: Back From Dead\n\nSolana emerged as the crypto industry\u2019s comeback player of the year, defying skepticism following the FTX collapse last fall. The ecosystem experienced a remarkable resurgence, marked by a rapid stream of new product releases, a surge in on-chain liquidity, and increased availability of developer tools.\n\nNotable tech upgrades, including local fee markets, QUIC, and stake-weighted QOS, contributed to a significant reduction in Solana\u2019s downtime compared to 2022.\n\nThe focus in 2024 will be on:\n\nPerformance enhancements via Firedancer and Sig.\n\nThe development of light clients through Tinydancer.\n\nThe deployment of the token-22 standard, which extends Solana token functionalities."

Known for his insightful market analyses, Pal\u2019s projection could signify a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026\n\n\n\nI think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nRead on for more insights.\n\nThrowback to 2021: A Year of Market Dynamics\n\nPal\u2019s forecast draws from past events, notably the 2021 bull run. During this period, Bitcoin initially had a dominant position. In February 2021, Bitcoin reached $44,000, while Ethereum was at a comparatively lower $1,400. However, by the end of that year, Ethereum\u2019s value surged by 245%, overshadowing Bitcoin\u2019s 45% growth.\n\nPal believes this shift in 2021 might be a sign of what\u2019s to come.

Even as Bitcoin\u2019s value remains strong at $44,000, Ethereum has seen a notable growth, rising by 4.83% in the last 24 hours to reach $2,336. This rise, coupled with a slight 0.27% dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value, has sparked discussions about Ethereum\u2019s potential leadership in the upcoming bull run.\n\nPal\u2019s insights go beyond just comparing prices. He emphasizes factors like liquidity and business cycles, highlighting their impact on cryptocurrency trends. As economic cycles change, so does investor behavior, affecting assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Regains Strength: Breaking This Barrier May Lead the ETH Price To $3,500\n\nVaried Perspectives: Pal vs Brandt\n\nWhile Pal is optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, not everyone shares his view. Peter Brandt, an experienced trader, predicts Ethereum might drop to $650. Yet, Pal\u2019s stance, grounded in historical data and current trends, offers a brighter outlook for Ethereum supporters, setting the stage for an intriguing 2024 in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nClassical chart patterns in price charts are not sacred \u2013 they fail to perform according to the textbooks all the time\n\n\n\nBut, if the rising wedge in Ethereum $ETH complies with the script, the target is $1,000, then $650\n\n\n\nI shorted ETH on Friday \u2014 I have a protective B/E stop pic.twitter.com/76CciT3PE5 \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 18, 2023\n\nRead More: Ethereum (ETH) Price Set to Dominate \u2013 $5,000 in 2024?"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH) has continued its steady climb of the last couple days, jumping 4% in 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency is now trading for $2,324, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmong the latest news: Ethereum core developers yesterday solidified plans to roll out DenCun\u2014the next upgrade for the network\u2014on testnets beginning in January. This next round of updates will introduce proto-danksharding and so-called data \"blobs.\"\n\nIn really simple terms, they new features are meant to significantly reduce high gas fees and improve the network's capacity. ETH's newly buoyant price was enough to convince crypto trader Peter Brandt to reverse his prediction that Ethereum was barreling towards an \"immediate price collapse.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrong opinions, weakly held\n\nWhen circumstances change, my opinion changes\n\nMy recent appraisal of $ETH called for immediate price collapse - that has not happened\n\nI have withdrawn my bearish outlook based on chart structure. @CointelegraphMT pic.twitter.com/Pb2fUsuiAn \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 22, 2023\n\nThe positive sentiment extended to Ethereum scaling solutions, as well.\n\nOptimism (OP) has jumped by 27% in the past day. The token behind the Ethereum scaling solution is currently the best-performing cryptocurrency, priced in at $3.06. And Arbitrum (ARB), the token behind the protocol which aims to speed up transaction times and cut fees on Ethereum, is up 19% in 24 hours, and is now trading hands for $1.35.\n\nOf the major coins and tokens, Polygon's MATIC is doing well, surging by more than 8% in the past day. It is now priced at $0.84.\n\nMeanwhile Solana (SOL) is still surging, albeit at a slightly less blistering pace than it has been.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been flirting with a $100 per coin price, having jumped 2% in the past day. In fact, it was briefly the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap when it inched past Binance's BNB exchange token. As of this writing, BNB has a market cap of $41.7 billion and is holding onto its edge over SOL's $40.6 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThere's been a big DeFi shift happening, as NFT and meme coin traders have flocked to Solana to chase BONK and Dogwifhat. In fact, BONK last week got a listing on Coinbase\u2014an honorific that sets it apart from a lot of other meme coins.\n\nAnd just two weeks ago, NFT trading volume on Solana edged past Ethereum. But as of this writing, Ethereum had reclaimed its spot with $11.7 million worth of NFT trades in the past day compared to Solana's $10.6 million. The biggest contributors to NFT volume on the Ethereum network in the past 24 hours have been the Pudgy Penguins, Moonbirds, and Azuki collections.\n\nEven so, SOL has been on a persistent climb over the last two months, as big money investors eye-up the asset. This time last year, it was expected to take a nosedive due to its proximity to collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its now-convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nOver the past week, it has been the winner out of the top digital assets by market cap\u2014and has jumped by 28%.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) may be lying flat\u2014it hasn't budged in the past day\u2014it has climbed 4% in seven days and over 20% in the past month.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Ethereum price surged significantly in the past day, crossing the $2,300 mark once again. Ether outperformed Bitcoin in this growth. Looking ahead, there\u2019s speculation that Ethereum might hit an all-time high in the coming weeks or months, potentially surpassing the $5,000 mark after Bitcoin halving. Will ETH reach the $5000 mark? Let\u2019s take a look at this Ethereum price forecast article in more detail.\n\nHow has the Ethereum price moved in recent days?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has seen a significant increase again in recent days, especially just one day ago. The ETH value increased by more than 4% during this time.\n\nThe price of Ethereum today is $2,291.83, and in the last 24 hours, it went up by 1.03%. The total value of all Ethereum in circulation is $275.44 billion, and it makes up 16.50% of the entire cryptocurrency market. The recent trading activity in the last day reached $25.55 billion.\n\nThe highest price Ethereum has ever reached was on November 10, 2021, when it reached $4,867.17. Its lowest price ever was on October 21, 2015, at $0.420897. After reaching its highest, the price went down to a low of $897.01, and then it went up again to $2,408.42.\n\nRight now, people are generally optimistic about the future price of Ethereum, and the Fear & Greed Index is at 70, indicating a sense of greed among investors.\n\nThe total number of Ethereum coins currently in circulation is 120.18 million. In the past year, 2.19 million new Ethereum coins were created, resulting in a yearly supply inflation rate of -1.79%. Ethereum is currently ranked #1 in the Proof-of-Stake Coins category and #2 in the Layer 1 category based on market cap.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH SPOT<\u2014\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Is there going to be a price explosion after the Bitcoin halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving is scheduled for April 2024 and there\u2019s a high probability that the first Bitcoin Spot ETFs will get approval in the US even before that. This approval could not only boost the price of Bitcoin but also impact the Ethereum price positively. In recent weeks, it has been observed that the price of Ethereum tends to rise shortly after Bitcoin experiences an increase.\n\nThis suggests the possibility of a significant surge in Ethereum\u2019s value during the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, there is speculation that this uptrend may prompt discussions about the introduction of an Ethereum ETF. Rumors circulating over the past few weeks even hint at plans by BlackRock, a major investment management company, to explore the creation of an Ethereum ETF.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH SPOT<\u2014\n\nCan Ethereum price rise to $5,000 after halving?\n\nIf the current bullish trend in the crypto market persists and the introduction of Bitcoin Spot ETFs has a notably positive impact on prices, there\u2019s a potential for a substantial and rapid increase in the Ethereum price within the first 3 to 4 months.\n\nOver the past year, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable performance, with an impressive 87% increase in its price. This surge has not only outpaced a majority, precisely 57%, of the top 100 cryptocurrencies but has also positioned Ethereum as a standout performer in the market.\n\nThe consistent upward trajectory is further highlighted by the fact that Ethereum is currently trading above its 200-day simple moving average, a key indicator of sustained positive momentum. Remarkably, in the last 30 days, Ethereum has experienced 19 green days, accounting for a significant 63% of the observed period, underscoring the prevailing bullish sentiment.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is also hovering near its cycle high, hinting at the potential for further gains. Additionally, Ethereum boasts high liquidity, substantiated by its substantial market cap. Moreover, the negative yearly inflation rate of -1.79% contributes to its appeal as a deflationary asset, potentially attracting long-term investors.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, these factors collectively suggest a favorable outlook for Ethereum, hinting at the possibility of continued growth and positive price developments in the near future.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin Halving, there\u2019s a possibility of reaching a new all-time high in 2024, and the $5,000 mark is within reach. With increasingly optimistic forecasts in recent weeks for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, it\u2019s conceivable that the Ethereum price could hit $5,000 in 2024.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH SPOT<\u2014\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum?\n\nBitget stands out as a viable platform to purchase Ethereum.

Additionally, BitMEX founder forecasts ETH to hit $5,000 per coin, which would be a new all-time high. In the last bull cycle, ETH touched an all-time high of $4,868 but failed to reach this round psychological level. But considering the current bullish outlook and the chances of an ETF approval for Bitcoin, the chances Ethereum price rises to $5,000 is high.\n\nHayes is not alone in his support for Ethereum; reports from JP Morgan analysts also have a similar view on Ether and indicate that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the long run. Raoul Paul agrees with this outlook. He states in his recent tweet,\n\nI think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024\n\nRead more: Ethereum price likely to outperform BTC says JP Mor gan report, but short-outlook remains flat despite ETF hype\n\nEthereum price to reach new yearly highs soon\n\nEthereum price is currently showing strength on the 4-hour chart as it has breached a short-term downtrend and signals a potential run-up. This recent breakout has strength, considering that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) have both flipped above their respective mean levels.\n\nThis development indicates that the bullish momentum is on the rise, which further supports the bullish thesis.\n\nAdditionally, the month of December is quite well-known for the Santa Rally, which is a historical tendency for stock markets to experience a rise in prices during the last trading week of December and the first few trading days of January. It is often observed as a period of increased buying activity fueled by factors like holiday cheer, investor optimism and so on.\n\nAll in all, investors can expect Ethereum to overcome the $2,160 to $2,403 range and tag the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $2,552. This move would constitute a near 11% gain from the current level of $2,295.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price breaches the range low of $2,160, it would invalidate the bullish thesis by producing a lower low. In such a case, ETH could revisit the $2,100 support level.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Annual Forecast: Spot ETF and sharding to drive ETH beyond $4,000 in 2024"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nSince blockchain was introduced to the world in 2008, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have consistently dominated the market. As a crypto investor, you most likely have one or both of these tokens in your portfolio. However, it is time for investors to explore Borroe Finance ($ROE), a new crypto token that can deliver ROI like BTC in 2011 and ETH in 2016. Keep reading to see expert forecasts and opinions on these tokens.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBTC Maintains $40K \u2013 $45K in December\n\nOn December 14, crypto expert and Researcher Chris Blec drew attention to the gradual centralization of Bitcoin\u2019s mining process. According to Blec, Foundary USA and AntPool jointly control 55% of Bitcoin\u2019s global hash rate, requiring all their miners to complete a KYC registration. Bitcoin was initially meant to be fully decentralized, and this mining centralization process may pose future problems for the crypto community.\n\nThis discussion came when Bitcoin miners and investors are counting down to the April 2024 BTC halving. BTC sold for $43,950 on December 9, and a week later, BTC lost 3.76% and sold for $42,315. Analysts say BTC will likely range till the end of the year before turning bullish. Therefore, BTC may trade for $50,000 in Q1 2024, thanks to an influx of beginner cryptocurrency investors looking to benefit from a likely surge.\n\nInvestors Bet on Borroe Finance to Deliver Triple-digit ROI in 2024\n\nDeFi companies find it hard to meet their short-term liquidity needs due to a lack of credit from financial institutions. Luckily, Borroe Finance aims to solve this problem by providing an AI-powered fundraising platform where web3 businesses can sell their future earnings at discounted prices. Additionally, Borroe Finance ensures the safety of the fundraising process and guarantees ROI by incorporating AI risk assessment into its protocol.\n\nCurrently, $ROE is in its third presale stage, and the token is selling for $0.0175. After all presale stages conclude, $ROE will hit the mainstream crypto market and sell for $0.04. At this stage, early $ROE investors will record a massive 128.6% ROI for a start. Additionally, experts predict that $ROE will likely trade for $0.175 when $ROE inevitably becomes popular in the crypto market.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nETH Dips Amid Plans for Dencun Upgrade\n\nOn December 15, Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy, revealed that Ethereum core developers plan to launch a Goerli shadow fork to test the Cancun/Deneb upgrade with live clients. This shadow test will reveal places where improvements are needed before the Ethereum Dencun upgrade goes live on the mainnet. Experts say this Dencun upgrade will ensure Ethereum handles more transactions per time.\n\nDespite this ecosystem development, ETH lost 5.44% in the second week of December. On December 9, ETH traded for $2,355. Within a week, ETH went bearish and sold at $2,229. ETH and other top altcoins went bearish in December. However, analysts say this price reversal is temporary, and the crypto market will likely record a bull run in Q1 2024 thanks to the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Therefore, ETH will likely trade for $2,550 by January 2024.\n\nLearn more about Borroe Finance here:\n\nVisit Borroe Finance Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Borroe Finance on Twitter"

        "title": "Why Ethereum may outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH may displace Bitcoin\u2019s dominance next year, an investor pointed out.\n\nLong-term investors are confident of the altcoin\u2019s performance.\n\nAccording to Raoul Pal, Ethereum [ETH] will outperform Bitcoin [BTC] by 2024. Pal, who shared the opinion on X, noted that there could be a repeat of the 2021 cycle where BTC initially beat ETH\u2019s performance.\n\nBut nine months later, ETH was up 245% while BTC gained 45% within the same period.\n\nIt's all about liquidity and the business cycle leading the risk curve. Narrative follows. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nPal\u2019s point of view was not only his. But it was also that of Exponential Age Asset Management (EXPAAM).\n\nEXPAAM is a digital asset investment management firm co-founded by Pal, who also doubles as the CEO of Global Micro Investor. In defending his school of thought, the investors noted that:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about liquidity and the business cycle leading the risk curve. Narrative follows.\u201d\n\nThis year, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased by 92.04% while it changed hands at $2,3110. However, BTC\u2019s performance has been better, thanks to its 163.21% hike.\n\nSince there were discussions that ETH\u2019s growth potential was massive, AMBCrypto dug into the matter.\n\nIndications from the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score showed that the reading was 0.61. The MVRV Z-score has been historically effective in identifying when the market value is below the realized value.\n\nIt also shows when the realized value is above market value.\n\nSince the metric was below 1, it means the market value is far below the realized value. Therefore, buying ETH at this level has the potential to produce great returns for investors.\n\nPer price action, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) showed that ETH\u2019s value could grow exponentially in the long term.\n\nAt the time of writing, the 50 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 200 EMA (yellow). This position is termed a golden cross, and it is a bullis sign.\n\nAMBCrypto then considered Ethereum\u2019s On Balance Volume (OBV) as shown the daily chart. At press time, the OBV had increased to 11.6 million.\n\nThe OBV measures buying and selling pressure. So, the increase means that market players intend to push the price up in the short term.\n\nTherefore, the recent report that ETH may hit $2,500 soon remain valid. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) had turned negative.\n\nThe MACD reading indicate a bearish momentum. Thus, there is a chance the ETH\u2019s price drops below $2,300 before the potential run to $2,500.\n\nIn addition, the Long Tern Holder NUPL (LTH-NUPL) has moved from hope and fear into optimism.\n\nThe LTH-NUPL is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss that takes into account only UTXOs with a lifespan of at least 155 days and serves as an indicator to assess the behavior of long term investors.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETH worth today?\n\nThis position implies that the broader market believe that ETH\u2019s performance in 2024 would be better than in 2023.\n\nIf the altcoin does, then Pal\u2019s prediction may be considered concrete."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has delivered a strong performance quite in tune with the Bitcoin performance. However, it has underperformed other Layer-1 competitors such as Solana, Polkadot, and Chainlink. This has led to a new debate about whether Ethereum is dead and what future it holds.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Prominence Won\u2019t Diminish\n\nCrypto analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests that Ethereum\u2019s prominence will not diminish but rather strengthen for several reasons:\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition from PoW to PoS has garnered attention, and its true impacts are yet to be fully realized. The coming year is expected to reveal the fundamental growth of the ecosystem, making Ethereum potentially deflationary and a more enticing investment than Bitcoin. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is in the process of having a Spot ETF application, which, upon approval, could be more significant. This development opens doors for decentralized applications (dApps) built on Ethereum to be included in ETFs, potentially increasing its appeal. Van de Poppe highlights the money flow cycle, noting that Bitcoin usually takes the spotlight before halving. In this cycle, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs is expected to generate positive momentum. As money flows through market capitalizations, Ethereum is likely to be the next beneficiary.\n\nQ1 Is Always Great for ETH\n\nCrypto analyst Michale van de Poppe says that in recent weeks, Ethereum has faced negative sentiment, experiencing underperformance compared to Bitcoin. This is considered organic and natural price action, given the prevailing focus on Bitcoin before the ETF approval. Ethereum is anticipated to follow a similar pattern, and this carries various implications and reasons, particularly with the absence of distinct price action at the moment.\n\nPoppe also shares a chart showing that historically, ETH has always outperformed Bitcoin during the first quarter of the year.\n\nMichael van de Poppe anticipates a Bitcoin price range of $48,000 to $51,000 to be achieved before the awaited ETF approval. His forecast also includes a peak in Bitcoin\u2019s performance in January, prompting a swift movement of funds towards altcoins. According to Poppe, the Bitcoin dominance is likely reaching its pinnacle before the Bitcoin halving. Consequently, he suggests that the first quarter of the year will present favorable returns for investments in the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.\n\nThe #Bitcoin dominance is likely peaking pre-Bitcoin halving. That means that Q1 is going to give a great return for investments in the $ETH ecosystem. I'm positioned and ready. pic.twitter.com/Iqlxkojz4w \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 22, 2023"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe recent developments in the cryptocurrency sphere have added an extra layer of excitement. Reports suggest that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is on the brink of approving the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. This significant move, following a pivotal conference call with ETF contenders, indicates a potential catalyst for the entire crypto market. The implications extend beyond Bitcoin, potentially impacting altcoins profoundly. This article examines the current trends, key technical indicators and price forecasts for Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC).\n\nSimultaneously, the collaboration between StealthEX and Crypto Daily injects a festive twist into the crypto landscape. Going beyond providing insights into market dynamics, this partnership offers an exclusive opportunity to infuse the holiday spirit into optimal engagement within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWin Big This Christmas: StealthEX's $1,000 Festive Giveaway Awaits!\n\nGet ready to feel the holiday magic with StealthEX's thrilling $1,000 giveaway, running from December 13th to 23rd! This festive fortune is open to all.

May your Christmas be merry, lucky, and profitable!\n\nEthereum (ETH) Technical Analysis\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently on a positive trajectory, exhibiting a price range between $2,280 and $2,316.04, showcasing a notable 3.41% surge. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated remarkable growth, boasting an impressive 20% increase. An insightful look at on-chain metrics discloses that 77% of ETH holders find themselves in a profitable position at the current price, while 21% are currently experiencing losses. Notably, approximately 46% of Ethereum is held by larger investors, underscoring the considerable influence wielded by whales in the market.\n\nIn terms of technical analysis, the overall assessment is nuanced. Key indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registering at 59.72 and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) at 49.05 present neutral signals. Conversely, the Awesome Oscillator at 49.18 and Momentum at 113.38 are suggestive of a buying opportunity.\n\nCrucially, all major moving averages, spanning from the 10-day to the 200-day, align in signaling a buy recommendation. Specifically, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2106.59 crossing above the 200-day EMA at $1878.54 delivers a robust bullish signal. This upward trend is further reinforced by a noteworthy 30% surge in trading volume over the past 24 hours, affirming a strengthening market sentiment.\n\nEthereum (ETH)Price Prediction\n\nEthereum's current technical analysis from various sources indicates a strong bullish trend, with most indicators suggesting a buying opportunity. The global distribution of its transactions and the consistent increase in its market cap and trading volume reflect its robust position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn the event that Ethereum (ETH) maintains its bullish momentum, a potential test of the immediate resistance at $2347.18 appears on the horizon. A breakthrough beyond this level has the potential to propel the price to higher levels, with a notable target at $2705.38.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of the crypto market, and a bearish scenario cannot be entirely dismissed. In such a situation, Ethereum might experience a decline to the initial support at $1988.98. Failure to sustain momentum above this level could lead to a further slide, potentially reaching $1841.58. Prudent consideration of both bullish and bearish scenarios is essential for a comprehensive assessment in the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nSwap Ethereum (ETH) on StealthEX now and dive into the holiday giveaway before it's too late!\n\nSolana (SOL) Technical Analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) has recently made significant strides in the crypto realm. It has impressively flipped Binance Coin (BNB) to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is now eyeing Ethereum's position. This year, Solana has seen a remarkable 665% increase in price, particularly excelling in the last quarter. The launch of the Solana Saga Phone and the distribution of 30 million BONK tokens have contributed to this surge.\n\nAdding to Solana's growing ecosystem, Paxos, a tokenization and stablecoin platform, announced its expansion to the Solana blockchain.The move was approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). It is Paxos' first venture beyond Ethereum. The introduction of the Pax Dollar (USDP) on Solana, scheduled for January 2024, is expected to enhance the blockchain's landscape.\n\nSolana (SOL) is exhibiting a dynamic market performance, with its price fluctuating between $93.94 and $97.01, reflecting a weekly increase of 28%. This recent upswing is part of a broader positive trend observed in Solana's market behavior.\n\nIn the realm of technical analysis, Solana presents a complex picture. Key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), positioned at 76.7136, and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) at 272.4531, offer neutral signals. However, the Momentum indicator at 28.4742 and the MACD Level at 7.6669 hint at potential buying opportunities.\n\nA critical aspect of Solana's technical analysis is the unanimous buy signal from all major moving averages, ranging from the 10-day to the 200-day. This consensus among moving averages is a strong indicator of a bullish trend for Solana. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) values, particularly the 50-day EMA at $62.3539 and the 200-day EMA at $39.1178, further reinforce this bullish outlook.\n\nMoreover, the trading volume for Solana has seen a significant increase, which is indicative of growing investor interest and a solidifying market position. This surge in trading activity, coupled with the favorable technical indicators, suggests a robust and continuing upward trajectory for Solana in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Prediction\n\nSolana's recent performance and technical indicators suggest a strong bullish momentum. The blockchain's growing adoption, highlighted by significant developments like Paxos' expansion and increasing market cap, positions Solana as a formidable player in the crypto space. The nearest upside target for SOL lies at $98.3447, but given its exceptional performance, the possibility of a surge to $115.5695 cannot be discounted.\n\nIn the event of a correction, should SOL dip below its pivot point of $72.3196, there is potential for a descent to test the support level at $55.1199.\n\nSolana's impressive market performance, bolstered by strategic expansions and a strong technical outlook, positions it as a key cryptocurrency to watch.\n\nDon't miss out \u2013 exchange Solana (SOL) on StealthEX today and grab your chance at the $1,000 holiday prize!\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is demonstrating a positive momentum, approaching the $74 mark with a 10% monthly increase. This upswing is part of Litecoin's broader trend of growth and market resilience.\n\nRecently, Litecoin achieved a significant milestone by processing its 200 millionth transaction, indicating accelerated growth and a robust network. In a single day, Litecoin recorded 1.4 million on-chain transactions, surpassing the combined total of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in terms of active addresses. This surge in activity is a testament to Litecoin's increasing adoption and efficiency in facilitating transactions.\n\nThe technical analysis of Litecoin, based on data from TradingView, presents a nuanced view. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.13 and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) at -20.65 show neutral signals. The Momentum indicator at 1.0187 suggests a buying opportunity, while the MACD Level at -0.0703 indicates a sell signal.\n\nMost moving averages signal a buy, with the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) across various timeframes favoring a bullish trend. Specifically, the 10-day SMA and 10-day EMA are at $71.81306887 and $71.58604877 correspondingly, while the 100-day SMA and 100-day EMA are at $71.27299416 and $68.54520547.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Prediction\n\nLitecoin's recent performance, characterized by significant transactional throughput and growing active addresses, positions it as a strong contender in the altcoin market. The technical indicators suggest a generally bullish trend in the short term, with some caution advised for long-term investments due to mixed signals in the longer moving averages.\n\nIf Litecoin manages to sustain its momentum above the pivotal point of $72.93986016, it is plausible that the cryptocurrency could ascend to its immediate upside target at $80.25918644. Beyond this level, the next significant resistance awaits at $87.57851272.\n\nOn the downside, the support levels are identified at $68.37705921 and $65.62053388. These levels serve as crucial points where Litecoin might find buying interest, potentially preventing further declines.\n\nSwap Litecoin (LTC) on StealthEX now to be part of the festive fortune \u2013 time's running out!\n\nConclusion\n\nThe SEC's expected approval of Bitcoin ETF could be a game-changer. It could usher in a new era of institutional investment and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. the implications may be far-reaching for the entire market, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC). Litecoin's market achievements, combined with its current technical indicators, paint a picture of a cryptocurrency with strong fundamentals and potential for continued growth. At the same time, Solana's rapid growth and increasing adoption in various crypto sectors make it a significant contender in the blockchain arena. If the current pace continues, Solana could revisit its all-time high and potentially challenge Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts space. While the current outlook for ETH, SOL, and LTC is promising, the inherent volatility of the crypto market requires a balanced approach, considering both potential gains and risks.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price About To Bloom As ETHE Discount Rapidly Close: ETH To $3,500? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) prices have been languishing below the $2,500 mark despite the strong performance of other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nTaking to X on December 22, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, Ram Ahluwalia, has offered a theory on why ETH prices are likely to recover and reverse losses, possibly outperforming the world\u2019s most liquid coin, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETHE Discount Rapidly Closing\n\nTo illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount.\n\nBased on the CEO\u2019s analysis, this development suggests that institutional investors, most of whom chose to buy the regulated ETHE product by Grayscale to gain exposure in a regulated manner to ETH, are now opting to buy ETH on the spot market, not through a derivatives product.\n\nThis shift from ETHE to ETH spot, Ahluwalia added, could be explained by the \u201ccheapest-to-deliver\u201d contract theory. In the derivatives market, this theory states that a derivatives product like ETHE is the cheapest way for institutional investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset, in this case, ETH.\n\nThis is because the derivative in question, ETHE, is a futures contract that tracks the price of ETH via a regulated exchange, in this case CME.\n\nWill Capital Flow To Spot Ethereum And Lift ETH To $3,500?\n\nTherefore, based on this theory, the CEO continued that it is likely that as the ETHE discount closes, marginal flows will go to the ETH spot to capture the staking yield. For this reason, institutions are not likely to pour more funds into ETHE since \u201cbig gains\u201d are done.\n\nAs a proof-of-stake (POS) project, users can stake ETH, helping secure the network, and as compensation, Ethereum distributes a yield of around 4.3% to validators. These operators must lock at least 32 ETH to validate a block of transactions and earn block fees. Since they have to stake, they also earn a yield.\n\nAs of December 22, there were over 28.6 million ETH staked, with the reward rate or yield at 4.32%, according to Staking Rewards. Considering how staked amount and yield are correlated, the more users choose to stake physical ETH, the lower the reward rate, or yield, is.\n\nThis dynamic will now come into play as ETHE discounts close and institutions or big players rotate funds into ETH via the spot market, possibly lifting prices.\n\nLooking at the ETH price action in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand. However, a comprehensive close above $2,400 could lift ETH to $2,500 and later to $2,500 in a buy trend continuation pattern.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Ethereum & Solana to Outshine Bitcoin in 2024, Predicts Raoul Pal - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachs executive and CEO of Real Vision, has made a bold prediction about the performance of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in 2024. Addressing his one million followers on a social media platform on December 21, Pal suggested that Ethereum might replicate its 2021 bull market pattern against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) in the coming year.\n\nPal\u2019s analysis is rooted in historical data. He recalled that in February 2021, when Bitcoin first reached $44,000, Ethereum was priced at $1,400. Nine months later, Ethereum had surged by 245%, while Bitcoin had only risen by 45%. Based on this, Pal believes that Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin could be a major trend in 2024. His firm, Exponential Age Asset Management (EXPAAM), supports this view.\n\nThe analyst also anticipates more favorable macroeconomic conditions for risk assets like Ethereum, which could lead to a similar surge as seen two years ago. He emphasized the importance of liquidity and the business cycle in driving these trends, suggesting that narratives often follow these underlying factors.\n\nIt's all about liquidity and the business cycle leading the risk curve. Narrative follows. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nIn a surprising twist, Pal also believes that Solana will outperform Ethereum in 2024. Responding to a query on social media, he simply stated, \u201cNo,\u201d when asked if Ethereum could outperform Solana.\n\nNo. \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nPal\u2019s interest in Solana is partly influenced by the development of Firedancer, a new validator client for the Solana blockchain. Developed by Jump Crypto, a division of Jump Trading Group, Firedancer aims to enhance network performance within existing hardware constraints. This development is significant as Solana\u2019s network currently relies on a single validator client developed by Solana Labs. Firedancer, expected to launch on the mainnet in Summer 2024, promises to optimize network performance and add security by reducing software-induced outages.\n\nMessari, a market intelligence firm, has highlighted scalability as a critical challenge in the crypto sector. Solana\u2019s commitment to a monolithic architecture, as opposed to modular solutions adopted by other networks, is a key focus of Firedancer. Initial tests of Firedancer have shown promising results, achieving a transaction speed of one million transactions per second (TPS) with just four CPU cores, surpassing Solana\u2019s recommended 12-core setup.\n\nIf successfully implemented, Firedancer could offer several benefits, including reducing latency in the DeFi sector and enabling high-throughput Web2 applications to function on-chain. It could also enhance Solana\u2019s network resilience by introducing client diversity, mitigating risks related to software bugs.\n\n1/ Scalability is a key factor in the crypto space, with the modular approach gaining popularity. However, @Solana has taken a contrarian stance.@kelxyz_ explains how @jump_firedancer, a validator client developed by @jump_ aims to enhance Solana's monolithic approach.\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/zRc3Q5wSeT \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 6, 2023\n\nPal\u2019s optimism about Solana is further bolstered by performance charts against Ethereum and Bitcoin. He likened Solana\u2019s upward trend in these charts to a rocket ship, indicating a promising future. His enthusiasm grew after interviews with the Jump Crypto team responsible for Firedancer, learning that the new validator client would not only boost Solana\u2019s transaction speed but also fortify the security of the entire blockchain. The team behind Firedancer is focused on achieving high-frequency trading speeds, which Pal believes could be a game-changer for Solana.\n\nAlthough the exact launch date for Firedancer is unclear, Pal remains bullish on Solana\u2019s prospects. He has previously suggested that Solana could emulate Ethereum\u2019s bullish market cycle from 2021. He maintains this view, speculating that Solana could be the Ethereum of the current market cycle without diminishing the value of Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nPal concluded by stating that in the current economic landscape, the goal is to maximize gains whenever possible, and he sees Solana as a strong candidate for achieving this objective."

        "title": "Ethereum's Santa surprise: $2,500 in time for Christmas? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "As the festive season approaches, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s next big move. After a challenging period, the coin is showing signs of a significant rebound, with investors and enthusiasts eyeing the $2,500 mark as a potential milestone. The resilience of ETH, despite facing formidable resistance levels, underscores its robustness in a market known for its volatility and unpredictability.\n\nEther\u2019s Climb Against the Odds\n\nEther\u2019s journey towards regaining its lost glory has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. After struggling to breach the $2,400 resistance earlier in December, ETH retested the $2,120 support level, only to bounce back stronger. As of December 22, Ethereum recorded a notable 4% increase, standing out in a market where other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and BNB showed little to no movement.\n\nThis resurgence is not just about Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics; it\u2019s also a testament to the growing confidence among investors. The possibility of ETH crossing the $2,500 mark isn\u2019t a far-fetched fantasy but a potential reality, thanks to several underlying factors that support this bullish sentiment.\n\nThe looming exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative is one such factor, expected to drive significant gains in the cryptocurrency sector. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might delay the decision until March, the anticipation itself is fueling investor enthusiasm.\n\nDApp Activity and Ethereum\u2019s Network Strength\n\nA key factor in ETH\u2019s favor is the burgeoning activity in decentralized applications (DApps) on its network. Analyzing DApp volumes offers valuable insights into the coin\u2019s demand. In the past week alone, Ethereum DApp volumes soared to $27.8 billion, a 14.2% increase from the previous week, driven by gains in platforms like Uniswap and Balancer. This growth is particularly noteworthy as Ethereum was the only major blockchain to see a volume increase during this period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s protocol fees, excluding Bitcoin, accumulated a staggering $95.4 million in the same period, highlighting its unmatched position in the DApp ecosystem. These fees not only incentivize network security but also hint at Ethereum\u2019s potential for increased activity following future updates. The upcoming \u2018DenCun\u2019 update in January, aimed at enhancing processing capacity and reducing costs, is one such anticipated development.\n\nThe Road Ahead: ETFs and Derivatives Market\n\nThe impending Ether spot ETF approval, a distinct regulatory milestone, could further propel Ethereum ahead of its competitors. This approval, when it comes through, will mark a significant leap in terms of regulatory acceptance for Ethereum, setting it apart from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe derivatives market also provides crucial insights. The Ether futures premium, which measures the gap between two-month contracts and the spot price, is at its highest in over a year. This premium indicates that traders are cautiously optimistic but not overly bullish, as evident from the current 13.5% annualized premium. A figure exceeding 20%, indicative of widespread excitement, could lead to price distortions. However, the current scenario suggests a balanced market sentiment, with room for positive growth upon ETF approval.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network activity and the derivatives indicators point towards a robust future for the cryptocurrency. Professional traders are bullish, and the market is ripe with anticipation. As Ethereum inches closer to the $2,500 mark, the crypto world watches with bated breath, hoping for a festive surprise that could redefine the landscape for Ethereum and its investors.\n\nAt the moment, ETH is trading at $2,292, edging closer to the much-anticipated $2,500 mark. This journey, marked by resilience and strategic growth, positions Ether not just as a cryptocurrency but as a formidable player in the broader financial ecosystem. The coming weeks could very well herald a new era for Ethereum, reshaping perceptions and solidifying its status in the digital currency world."
