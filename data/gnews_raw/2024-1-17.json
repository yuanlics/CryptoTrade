        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its deadline to make a decision on Fidelity's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETH +1.17% exchange-traded fund until March 5, according to a filing on Thursday.\n\n\"The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" the SEC said.\n\nFidelity applied for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund in November, noting in its proposal a court ruling last year where judges said the SEC failed to find a coherent reason on why it should reject spot crypto ETFs when it had allowed futures-based products.\n\nThe SEC will now have more time to decide whether to approve, disapprove or institute proceedings.\n\nDelay had been expected\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC's move to delay was expected.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Fidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view,\" Seyffart wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe SEC last week authorized 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading, sparking some in the industry to wonder if a spot Ethereum ETF is next.\n\nFidelity joined fellow giant BlackRock late last year in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF. A month before those firms applied for the spot products, ether futures ETFs went live.\n\n\"The fact that they allowed listing of the futures based ETFs is enough to say they are thinking about ether the same way they are thinking about bitcoin and you can infer from that they're probably thinking it's not a security and not going to regulate it that way,\" Stuart Barton, co-founder at Volatility Shares, said last week."

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to extend gains above $2,600 and $2,620. ETH trimmed gains and might struggle to stay above the $2,500 support zone.\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase but failed to surpass $2,620.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair start another increase if the bulls protect the $2,500 and $2,470 support levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Support\n\nEthereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,520 resistance zone. ETH even climbed above the $2,550 level, but the bears were active near $2,600, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price traded as high as $2,614 and recently started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $2,550 support zone. The price traded below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,471 swing low to the $2,614 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The bulls seem to be currently active above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,471 swing low to the $2,614 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,540 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major resistance is now near $2,580. A clear move above the $2,580 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,620 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,650 zone. A close above the $2,650 resistance could start another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,540 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,500 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,470 zone. A downside break below the $2,470 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,400 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,500\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,540\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Blobs are live on Goerli.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Goerli testnet successfully forked to \u201cDencun,\u201d featuring the \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d EIP-4844 innovation.\n\nThat paves the way for two more major testnet forks, keeping on schedule, for now, a further move to Ethereum mainnet by the end of March.\n\nThe consensus coming out of Thursday\u2019s All Core Devs meeting was to prepare a new software version by mid-next week. This could be used for both the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, slated for Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, respectively.\n\nDencun\u2019s concept of \u201cblobs\u201d is a key component of the upgrade, and refers to a large piece of data that is not directly included in an Ethereum block but is instead referenced by the block.\n\nBy including extra data for transactions, Ethereum will better serve rollups that use mainnet for data availability. Rollups are expected to see around a 90% cost savings, which they will pass on to users in the form of cheaper transactions.\n\nRead more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024\n\nEven though the data in blobs is stored off-chain, the integrity and availability of this data are still maintained. Blobs are designed to be cryptographically secure, ensuring that the data they reference is immutable and verifiable.\n\nClient diversity wins the day\u2026again\n\nA minor consensus issue in the popular Prysm client caused the forked chain to encounter difficulty finalizing blocks.\n\nTerence Tsao, protocol developer at Offchain Labs, which develops the Prysm client, estimated the resulting delay at about four hours while the team patched the problem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cWhen Prysm upgraded from Capella to Deneb state, we kept the historical route empty instead of carrying it over, so this issue was fairly easy to find,\u201d Tsao told colleagues on the ACD call.\n\nThe bug didn\u2019t show up in the many Devnets (developer networks) run over the past few months because these are forked from testnets and contain insufficient history to trigger the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those very rare edge cases,\u201d Tsao said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for Goerli, because otherwise we probably wouldn\u2019t have caught it until later.\u201d\n\nPrysm now operates on less than 40% of Ethereum network nodes, so the resulting drop in validating participation rates, if it happened on mainnet, would be bad, but not catastrophic.\n\nIn fact, a similar incident occurred in May, showcasing the benefit of client diversity.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs issue final report on finality SNAFU\n\nGoerli itself is scheduled to be retired following this month. The Ethereum Foundation and other developers have been encouraging users to transition to the newer Sepolia testnet, which will serve as the primary testnet for dapp developers in preparation for Goerli to be shut down.\n\nAnother testnet, Holesky, launched in September 2023 and is intended more for infrastructure and protocol development.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Hole\u0161ky testnet launch hits a speed bump\n\nThe Prysm bug was the only major client issue observed in the wake of the fork, and one which can be easily avoided in the future according to Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, who nevertheless called it \u201ca failure\u201d that \u201cshould be caught way upstream.\u201d\n\nRyan said he intends to spend some time \u201cmaking sure there\u2019s nothing else funky on the fork boundary test.\u201d\n\nClient teams expressed no reservations about sticking to the previously outlined release and testnet schedule, pending the results of the next fork in less than two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Client teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues.

Once Dencun runs smoothly on all three testnets, the Ethereum Foundation plans to roll out the upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of Q1 2024.\n\nDencun marks the final upgrade for the Goerli testnet. Subsequently, both the client and Ethereum Foundation testing teams will discontinue support for the Goerli testnet after the completion of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, known as EIP-4844, aims to increase blockchain space for data blobs and slash layer-2 rollup fees by activating proto-danksharding. This data storage expansion should scale Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, enabling more transaction capacity without hiking gas fees.\n\nRead more: ETH developers voice concern over gas limit hike proposed by Vitalik Buterin\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but with added functionalities, such as the ability to build decentralized applications, also known as dApps.\n\nthat enables the creation and execution of smart contracts. It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but with added functionalities, such as the ability to build decentralized applications, also known as dApps. Ethereum, often referred to as the world computer , has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and even online gambling.\n\n, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and even online gambling. With its robust infrastructure and advanced features, Ethereum provides a solid foundation for the development of innovative and transparent gambling platforms.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of Ethereum, let\u2019s delve deeper into how Ethereum casinos work. Ethereum casinos leverage the power of smart contracts to offer transparent and provably fair gambling experiences. These smart contracts act as the backbone of the casino, ensuring that every transaction is secure and tamper-proof.\n\nWhen a player interacts with an Ethereum casino, they are essentially interacting with a smart contract. This smart contract contains the rules and logic of the game, eliminating the need for a centralized authority to oversee the gambling process.\n\nThe transparency of the blockchain ensures that all transactions and outcomes can be verified by anyone, providing a level of trust that traditional online casinos often lack.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum casinos is the ability to verify the fairness of the games. Traditional online casinos rely on random number generators (RNGs) to determine game outcomes. However, these RNGs are often centralized and can be manipulated by the casino operator. In contrast, Ethereum casinos use cryptographic algorithms to generate random numbers, making it virtually impossible for the casino to cheat or manipulate the results.\n\nEthereum casinos offer a higher level of security compared to their traditional counterparts. With traditional online casinos, players often have to trust the casino operator with their funds, leaving them vulnerable to hacks or mismanagement. In contrast, Ethereum casinos store funds in smart contracts, which are secured by the blockchain\u2019s robust encryption. This means that players have full control over their funds and can be confident that their money is safe.\n\nAnother exciting aspect of Ethereum casinos is the ability to earn and use cryptocurrency within the gambling ecosystem. Many Ethereum casinos have their own native tokens eg ( RollBit & Lucky Block), which can be used for betting, receiving bonuses, or even participating in the governance of the platform. This adds an extra layer of utility and value to the gambling experience, allowing players to benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum casinos offer a new and innovative approach to online gambling. By leveraging the power of smart contracts and the transparency of the blockchain, these casinos provide a secure and fair gambling environment. With the ability to verify game outcomes, enhanced security measures, and the integration of cryptocurrency, Ethereum casinos are poised to disrupt the traditional online gambling industry.\n\nBenefits of Using Ethereum in Online Casinos\n\nThere are several advantages to using Ethereum in online casinos. Let\u2019s explore a few:\n\nSpeed and Efficiency\n\nOne of the key advantages of using Ethereum in online casinos is the speed at which transactions can be processed. Unlike traditional payment methods, which may take days to settle, Ethereum transactions are almost instantaneous. This means that you can start playing your favorite casino games in no time!\n\nImagine you\u2019re sitting at home, eager to try your luck at an online slot machine. With Ethereum, you won\u2019t have to wait for hours or even days for your deposit to be confirmed. Instead, the transaction will be processed within seconds, and you can start spinning those reels right away. The fast and efficient nature of Ethereum transactions ensures that you won\u2019t miss a single moment of the gaming excitement.\n\nSecurity and Anonymity\n\nWhen it comes to online gambling, security and anonymity are of utmost importance. Ethereum casinos provide an added layer of security by leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain. Every transaction made on the Ethereum network is recorded on multiple computers, making it nearly impossible for hackers to manipulate or tamper with the data.\n\nFurthermore, since Ethereum transactions don\u2019t require you to enter personal information, your identity remains anonymous, protecting your privacy. This anonymity is especially crucial for those who prefer to keep their gambling activities private. With Ethereum, you can enjoy the thrill of online gambling without worrying about your personal information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees can quickly eat into your gambling budget. With Ethereum casinos, you can say goodbye to hefty transaction fees. Since Ethereum operates on a peer-to-peer network, the fees associated with transactions are significantly lower compared to traditional payment methods.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a frequent online gambler who enjoys playing various casino games. With traditional payment methods, you may have to pay a substantial amount in transaction fees over time. However, with Ethereum, the fees are minimal, allowing you to allocate more of your funds towards actual gameplay. This means more spins, more bets, and ultimately, more chances to win big!\n\nCriteria for Ranking Ethereum Casinos\n\nWhen it comes to ranking Ethereum casinos, we consider several factors to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Here are some of the criteria we take into account:\n\nCasino Reputation and Trustworthiness\n\nAbove all, we prioritize your safety.

We believe that trust is the foundation of any successful casino, and we want to ensure that you can play with peace of mind.\n\nAdditionally, we consider the licensing and regulatory compliance of each casino. It is important to us that the casinos we recommend operate within the legal framework and adhere to industry standards. This ensures that you are playing in a fair and secure environment.\n\nVariety of Games Offered\n\nA good Ethereum casino should offer a wide range of games to cater to all types of players.

We reach out with inquiries and assess the speed and accuracy of the responses received. We also evaluate the availability of different support channels, such as live chat, email, and phone support, to ensure that you can easily reach out for help.\n\nAdditionally, we consider the availability of multilingual support. We understand that not all players speak English as their first language, so we look for casinos that offer customer support in multiple languages. This ensures that language barriers do not hinder your gaming experience.\n\nFurthermore, we take into account the availability of comprehensive self-help resources, such as FAQs and knowledge bases. A good casino should provide you with the tools and information you need to resolve common issues on your own, without having to rely solely on customer support.\n\nBy considering all these factors, we aim to provide you with a thorough evaluation of Ethereum casinos. Our goal is to help you make an informed decision and find the perfect casino that meets your needs and preferences.\n\nAnd there you have it \u2013 our top picks for the best Ethereum casinos.

        "content": "What you'll learn The number of blockchain developers fell 24% last year.\n\nNewcomer devs accounted for a greater proportion of the exit from the blockchain developer community.\n\nBlockchain developer talent is becoming more evenly spread across the globe.\n\nA new report by web3-focused venture firm Electric Capital found a significant drop in the number of monthly active developers in the last year, with a nearly 25% decrease to 22,411 compared to 2022.\n\nDeveloper activity is often seen as a measure of value creation in the crypto space. Despite challenges like bear market conditions and the allure of the emerging AI sector, most experienced developers \u2014 those with at least a year under their belt \u00ad\u2014 remain committed to blockchain development.\n\nBut for the least experienced developers \u2014 those who have been working in crypto for less than a year \u2014 the scenario is quite different.\n\nBlockchain developer count declined last year (Electric Capital)\n\nThe report points out that the high turnover among the least experienced developers in the crypto sector is linked to the bear market\u2019s impact.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s cohort retention analysis shows shows that those developers who start their careers during a bear market are more likely to leave sooner than their counterparts who join in more stable market conditions.\n\nExperienced developers grew 16%, according to the report. This growth trend is in keeping with the steady increase in established developers who choose to remain in the industry as seen over the last five years Indeed, growth figures for the most tenured blockchain developers is up over 52% in the last five years.\n\n\u201cExperienced devs push more code: 75% of code is created by developers in crypto 1+ years,\u201d the report said.\n\nEVM chains hold sway\n\nWhile multichain development has increased 10-fold since 2015, much of that activity is concentrated in Ethereum and other blockchains that run on the so-called Ethereum Virtual Machine. That includes blockchains like Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEVM networks are similar to Ethereum and they use the same smart contract logic. That makes developers on Ethereum more likely to migrate to other EVM blockchains and vice versa. EVM blockchains account for 87% of multichain developer activity, as per the report.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains \u2014 Ethereum scaling networks that rely on the mainnet for security \u2014 saw the most crossover among developers from across all EVM networks. Developers working on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum, Starknet, and Optimism saw the greatest level of crossover in this regard.\n\nDev report 1 The majority of EVM smart contract code is first deployed on Ethereum (Electric Capital)\n\nBNB Chain and Polygon also drew from the crowd of multichain developers with roots in Ethereum. At least a third of Ethereum multichain developers deployed code on Polygon and BNB Chain.\n\n\u201c71% of contract code is initially deployed on Ethereum.\u201d \u2014 Electric Capital Blockchain Developer Report 2023\n\nEthereum the most unique\n\nEthereum stands out as the dominant player among EVM blockchains, boasting 7,864 monthly active developers, although this represents a 25% decline from the previous year.\n\nThe report highlights that the smart contract codes deployed on Ethereum last year were predominantly unique, with most not being deployed on any other EVM platforms.\n\nMoreover, 71% of EVM contracts are initially launched on Ethereum, reinforcing its role as the leading source of new on-chain logic for other networks.\n\nWhat about Bitcoin?\n\nMost blockchain development happens on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the top 200 crypto projects by market capitalisation, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for 40%, according to the report.\n\nNOW READ: Degens are so high on inscriptions they just poured $106m into a Bitcoin NFT game that hasn\u2019t even been created\n\nBitcoin has seen a notable decrease in its developer activity, with 1,071 monthly active developers currently, marking a 19% reduction from the previous year\u2019s figures.\n\nThis decline is primarily attributed to the departure of part-time Bitcoin developers and those who are involved in multiple blockchain projects.\n\nBut the report also found that developers dedicated exclusively to Bitcoin were more likely to remain engaged in the platform.\n\nWhile Ordinals caused a transaction spike on Bitcoin, it did not translate to significant developer interest, attracting only 3% of devs with most of their colleagues focused on Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling networks.\n\nThe US loses more ground\n\nAs crypto adoption spreads across the globe, so also is the distribution of blockchain development talent across the globe.\n\n\u201c74% of crypto developers live outside of the US.\u201d \u2014 Electric Capital Developer Report 2023\n\nSeven out of every 10 blockchain developers are outside North America and the United States has lost 14% of its share of the global blockchain dev market since 2018, the report said. The US now only accounts for 26% of blockchain developers compared to 40% in 2018.\n\nGlobal blockchain developer distribution continues to be more diverse with each passing year (Electric Capital)\n\nEurope and Central Asia are now the major global hub for blockchain development with 36% of devs from this report, per the report.\n\nWith more blockchain developers outside North America, the distribution of talent has undergone a meaningful shift. India and Nigeria have seen the highest growth in developer count over the last five years.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETFs: The Race Is On - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nThe bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race is on for 2024.\n\nA 24% performance differential divides the popular crypto investments, as futures-based Ethereum ETFs are up nearly 15% and the new spot bitcoin ETFs are down 9% in their first three days of trading through Jan. 16.\n\nOver that brief period, $1.2 billion has flowed from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while $740 million has flowed into new spot ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), meaning that almost $2billion has gone into the non-GBTC spot bitcoin ETFs this year. The heavy flows and trading volume partially explain the negative performance for spot bitcoin ETFs thus far.\n\nInvestors Eye SEC Approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be gaining a similar kind of investor enthusiasm as Bitcoin did in 2023, as multiple issuers, including the ETF behemoth BlackRock, Inc., have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The timetable for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Ethereum ETF takes us to May 2024, which could lead to the bidding up of Ethereum prices in the coming months.\n\nAlthough the 2024 spot bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race has only just begun, the story is setting up as the more established cryptocurrency versus the rising outsider.\n\nGBTC Outflows Impact Spot Bitcoin ETF Pricing\n\nDigging a bit deeper into spot bitcoin\u2019s poor start, $1.2 billion flowing out of GBTC pumped significant liquidity into the bitcoin ecosystem. The higher supply offset the early demand; thus, the price did not leap higher as many expected. The SEC announcement also appeared to become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nBTC\u2019s price rose more than 21% from late November through Jan. 8, peaking near $47,000 according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko data, as signs suggested increasingly that the SEC would approve at least a few of the filings (the agency approved all 11 applications). A primary reason for GBTC\u2019s huge outflows is likely its expense ratio of 1.50%, which is more than 100 basis points higher than any of the other 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on the market. Another reason is that GBTC had previously been a closed-end bitcoin trust with $29 billion in assets, and the SEC allowed it to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF last week as the new spot ETFs launched.\n\nStory continues\n\nGBTC\u2019s conversion enabled investors to sell shares. They had likely been waiting to exit the closed-end fund once they were longer locked in. Many investors bought GBTC at a discount in 2023, which was as low as 50%. and sold at par to capture gains after the conversion.\n\nClosed-end funds can be less liquid than ETFs, which are open-ended funds. The limited number of shares outstanding can result in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced liquidity for CEFs. If there aren't enough buyers, a closed-end fund can trade at a discount.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETF Race?\n\nInvestors will likely be eyeing the bitcoin halving in April. The halving will cut the reward for bitcoin miners from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, reducing the number of tokens entering the system. Observers of the digital asset space widely expect the event to boost BTC\u2019s price and bring more assets into spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin miners are lynchpins of the blockchain, helping to ensure its integrity. A month later, the SEC will decide on multiple applications for Ethereum ETFs, which could increase the price of ether, the token of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has exhibited a notable bullish trend since the second week of January. This period coincided with the much-anticipated approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that significantly contributed to Ethereum\u2019s price surge from $2,170 to $2,714. In contrast, Bitcoin displayed continued volatility during this period. As previously reported by Coingape, there was a substantial increase in whale accumulation for Ethereum in December 2023. This trend suggests that \u2018smart money\u2019 investors showed a greater inclination towards Ethereum over Bitcoin, despite a historical milestone.\n\nWill Bitcoin continue to rise as Ethereum ETF could be the next topic of investor\u2019s focus?\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Project Strength for Prolong Recovery.\n\nThe ETH price may prolong recovery until the expanding channel is intact.\n\nA falling coin price may find a surge in demand pressure $2430 and $2300 supports\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $11.03 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nThe Ethereum coin has rallied in a bullish trajectory for the past four months, where the price jumped from $1522 to a recent high of $2714, registering 77% growth. A look at the daily time frame chart shows that this recovery can be followed using two divergence trendlines which show the formation of an expanding channel.\n\nThe coin price rebounded at least thrice from both trendlines indicating the market participants took a stick on this pattern structure. In theory, this chart setup reflects increasing volatility in an asset but provides a directional trend, once price breaks from either trendline.\n\nAmid the current downturn in the market, the Ethereum price recently reverted from a $2714 high to a plunge of 7.25% to $2517. This bear within the chart range could tumble the ETH value another 8-9% to lower the trendline around $2300.\n\nSome recent insights from on-chain analytics firm Santiment indicate. In just one week, the Ethereum price dominance over Bitcoin has spiked, reaching a remarkable increase of +22.4%. The network is experiencing rapid growth, averaging 89.4K new $ETH addresses daily, with an impressive surge to 96.3K new wallets yesterday. Ethereum\u2019s presence in exchange supplies is dwindling, dropping from 8.15% to 8.10%, approaching its all-time low of 8.05%.\n\nThese developments project the ETH price is likely to rebound from a lower trendline which could surge its value past $2700 to chase the $3000 mark.\n\nETH/BTC Pair Rebounds From Crucial Support\n\nBased on the latest insights from respected analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum is showing a remarkable rebound, potentially signaling an upcoming uptrend. To firmly establish this trend, Ethereum must surpass the 0.06 BTC level. The observation of a weekly bullish divergence is a strong indicator of Ethereum\u2019s increasing momentum, suggesting we might see considerable strength in the market over the next few months.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price above daily EMAs(100 and 200) accentuates the overall trend is bullish.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI above 50% reflects the buyers having an upper hand on this asset.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "ETH\u2019s value increased above $2,600 despite the 100 ETH sell-off.\n\nDominance over Bitcoin jumped, but it could be better to wait for a pullback.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation let go of another round of Ether [ETH] on the 16th of January, data from Etherscan revealed.\n\nAccording to the details from the transaction, the Foundation changed 100 ETH to stablecoin DAI through its \u201cGrant Provider\u201d address.\n\nThough the purpose of the sale was unknown at press time, previous similar transactions suggest that it was probably a donation to a project.\n\nOver the past year, AMBCrypto revealed how the foundation sold some of its coins. But at different points, the team cleared the air that it was not liquidating its holdings unnecessarily.\n\nTrust in ETH continues to rise\n\nThis time, it does not seem like ETH\u2019s value will plummet because of the action. In fact, on the same day, the value of ETH rose past $2,600 before it later reversed below the level.\n\nHowever, there were solid reasons why we concluded that ETH would not feel the effect of the sell-off. This could be traced to a recent post by on-chain analysis tool Santiment.\n\nAccording to Santiment, 89,400 new addresses were created per day on the Ethereum network in the past week. It also mentioned that a higher number of wallets appeared on the 16th of January.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum's price dominance continues to surge against #Bitcoin's, now +22.4% in a week. During this stretch, there have been 89.4K new $ETH addresses created per day, and 96.3K wallets just yesterday.

Should this remain the same way, the chance of ETH\u2019s plunge will remain extremely low.\n\nAlso, the increase in the number of wallets created sparked conviction in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it did not end there. AMBCrypto also looked at the supply of the altcoin on exchanges and the supply outside of it. At press time, ETH\u2019s supply outside of exchanges had reached an All-Time High (ATH) of 121.31 million.\n\nConversely, the supply on exchanges got close to an All-Time Low (ATL). At press time, the percentage was 8.08%. These occurrences have helped Ethereum\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nOkay, now could be time to wait for a pullback\n\nIn the past seven days, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance had risen by 22.4% over Bitcoin. If this continues to be the case, then ETH, alongside some altcoins, would outperform BTC.\n\nHowever, an assessment of the Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) ratio preached caution.\n\nThe MVRV ratio tells whether a cryptocurrency is trading at a fair value, below it, or is overvalued. Values lower than 1 suggest that the coin is undervalued. But when the MVRV ratio is higher than 1, it suggests closeness to the local top.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, Glassnode\u2019s data showed that Ethereum\u2019s MVRV ratio was 1.67. This suggested that the market was a little overheated. However, the metric seemed to be falling, which is something that could excite investors.\n\nIf the MVRV ratio drops lower than 1.5, it could be a good entry for those looking to profit from ETH in the long term."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nEthereum continues to trade with a bearish consolidation due to Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing failures to break above the $43,000 to $44,000 range since the start of ETF trading. Despite this, Ethereum has shown notable strength compared to Bitcoin following the market correction, with various on-chain metrics signaling positive trends.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strong Dominance Against Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance continues to fall, while Ethereum\u2019s surges, as observed on charts. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has steeply dropped from 55% and it has been declining for the fifth day in a row is commonly seen as a positive sign for altcoins, potentially enabling them to outshine Bitcoin.\n\nThis trend is further evidenced by the recent data, which shows Ethereum\u2019s dominance climbing to a three-month high of over 18.5%. On-chain data provider Santiment reports a significant rise in Ethereum\u2019s price dominance relative to Bitcoin, with an increase of 22.4% in the past week.\n\nThis period also marked a notable increase in Ethereum network engagement, with the creation of around 90K new Ethereum addresses each day, showing the network\u2019s growing appeal. Particularly striking was the creation of a remarkable 96,300 wallets on January 16.\n\nEthereum is also doing a lot of network improvements recently as the newest upgrade to the Ethereum network, codenamed \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d or \u201cDencun,\u201d went live on the Goerli testnet for the first time yesterday.\n\nUpon its deployment on the mainnet, the Dencun upgrade is expected to substantially reduce transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions like Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM, among others, as claimed by developers. Additionally, this upgrade will restrict self-destruct operations and introduce new functionalities for bridges and staking pools.\n\nDue to the active network upgrades, ETH price is holding investors\u2019 confidence and it has impressively outperformed Bitcoin. According to Tradingview, the ETHBTC ratio has also skyrocketed as it now holds momentum at 0.06.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther is currently experiencing a corrective phase within a triangle pattern, with buyers aiming to maintain the ETH price above $2,450. However, bears continue to dominate as they recently plunged the price below $2,500. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,473, declining over 2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe declining 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,530 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heading toward the selling region suggest that the market momentum is leaning towards the sellers.\n\nA reversal from its present value or a rebound from the $2,400-$2450 zone would indicate a strong inclination for purchasing during dips. Under such circumstances, the ETH/USDT pair could potentially surge to break the pattern at $2,600. Surpassing this threshold might pave the way towards a retest of $2,700 level.\n\nConversely, this bullish scenario could be invalidated in the short term if the price continues its downward trajectory, falling below $2,400. Such a decline could lead the price towards the critical support zone at $2,130-$2,200."

        "title": "Ethereum Not About To Lose Its Top Layer-1 Position, Says Crypto Analyst \u2013 But Here\u2019s When It Could Be Unseated - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader doesn\u2019t believe Ethereum (ETH) could lose its top layer-1 (L1) position anytime soon.\n\nThe analyst pseudonymously known as Kaleo tells his 615,900 followers on the social media platform X that the second top-performing digital asset by market cap enjoys a comfortable edge over its multiple competitors.\n\nThe trader believes there\u2019s little chance of ETH losing its top spot in the current crypto market cycle to any L1 project. However, he says the odds of a competitor dethroning ETH could increase after two additional market cycles.\n\n\u201cGonna put this out there: for as much hate as ETH gets, I still don\u2019t expect any L1 to flip it this cycle. Doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see plenty outgain it. But over the past seven years that I\u2019ve been plugged into this space, I\u2019ve heard countless names called out as the next ETH killer. Ultimately, none of them have unseated Ethereum\u2019s place as the ultimate settlement layer, and I don\u2019t see that changing quite yet. If it were to happen, I think we\u2019re two cycles away from seeing it take place.\u201d\n\nThe trader also updates his outlook on Ethereum and other digital assets, suggesting a possible crypto market cooldown before Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) halving event in April, when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started to contemplate this a bit more and think there\u2019s a solid chance we don\u2019t see an ETH run quite yet, and I\u2019m fine with that. I got caught up in the narrative that other L1s were having solid pumps, so ETH had to. In all honesty, we\u2019re probably closer to July of 2019 in the ETH cycle than we are December 2020. We haven\u2019t even had the halving yet, so there\u2019s no need to really jump the gun and get too bullish too fast.\n\nA bit more cool off in the market wouldn\u2019t surprise me, and honestly would be incredibly healthy. It\u2019d give you a chance for incredible entries on alts that you thought you missed over the past several months before the real bull market starts. If somehow we\u2019re still sent endless green candles in the short term, I obviously wouldn\u2019t hate that either, but I\u2019m prepared to be patient.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,481 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But once this problem was fixed through a patch, the network came back up.\n\nThe goerli fork finalized! :Dhttps://t.co/LIa3d4Ml5H\n\n\n\nAfter the fix was patched in, the validators came back online and the chain started finalizing again.

It will also limit self-destruct operations and allow for new bridge and staking pool features.\n\nThe fork was implemented at approximately 6 am UTC, according to Ethereum developer Tim Beiko. About 20 minutes after this post, Beiko announced that the network had undergone a \u201cchain split\u201d due to a lack of finalization. Terence.eth later revealed that the Prysm implementation of Ethereum contained a bug causing it to fail to sync with the other nodes. Once the bug was discovered and patched, the network began running smoothly again, according to Jayanthi.\n\nJayanthi claimed that the quickly implemented solution was a testament to the power of the team\u2019s debugging systems. \u201cI do want to mention that we went from fork -> issue -> triage -> fix -> finality in under 4h,\u201d Jayanthi stated. \u201cThe debugging apparatus has gotten great!\u201d\n\nAccording to Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, its next big moment will be Jan. 30, when it is slated to be implemented on the Sepolia testnet. Holesky testnet will follow on Feb. 7. The team has not yet announced a date for the upgrade to be implemented on the mainnet."

        "content": "The sentiments around Ethereum look to be very bullish at the moment as the second-largest crypto token by market cap has seen its dominance surge against Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s rise against the flagship crypto token is also significant, as crypto analyst Jaydee recently suggested that it could usher in the altcoin season.\n\nBullish Predictions For Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted the fact that Ethereum broke out from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. According to him, the crypto token has its eyes on the $3,400 price level despite the short-term volatility. Backing Ali\u2019s analysis, crypto analyst Mayne shared their belief that $3,400 remains a viable target for ETH\u2019s price.\n\nInterestingly, Mayne hinted that \u201cETH betas\u201d could run alongside ETH when this significant price surge begins to happen. These ETH betas include tokens like the native tokens of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 networks Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nCrypto analyst Ash Crypto also offered a bullish prediction for ETH\u2019s price while commenting on the state of the market. He remarked that money was currently flowing from Bitcoin to Ethereum and that it shouldn\u2019t be long before the latter trades above $3,200.\n\nETH trading above the $3,000 price level looks to be the consensus going by these predictions. The CEO and founder of MN Trading, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, had before now suggested that ETH was also going to rise above $3,000 on its way to $3,500. Then, Poppe boldly claimed that this price prediction would materialize in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto analyst ColdBloodedShill stated in a recent X post that ETH is likely planning for higher prices as long as it remains above $2,400. The $2,400 price range looks to be an important support level as ETH looks to break out. Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital also highlighted that price range ($2,495 specifically) as he noted that there will be an eventual breakout as long as ETH holds above that level.\n\nETH bulls struggle at $2,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nConviction On Ethereum Getting Stronger\n\nMarket intelligence platform Santiment recently revealed that the number of new ETH addresses is on the rise as Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin. 89.4 thousand addresses are said to have been created daily during this stretch. This represents a significant increase from late last year, when 70.4 addresses were created daily in early November.\n\nSantiment also added that ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges had reduced drastically to 8.10%, almost getting close to its all-time low (since the opening week of trading) of 8.05%. Such a development usually suggests that ETH holders are looking to hold for the long term as they move their holdings to self-custody.\n\nFeatured image from TechRadar, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Backs Down: Ethereum Steals The Spotlight With Surge In Market Dominance - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Amidst the lull in the realm of Bitcoin, Ethereum emerges as a trailblazer, confidently charting its course. While the crypto king takes a breather following its ETF approval, Ethereum, undeterred, is experiencing a surge in both price and dominance, propelled by an influx of new users and the prevailing trend of self-custody.\n\nRecent data from Santiment vividly illustrates Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy. The platform\u2019s price dominance, reflecting its market share in comparison to all other cryptocurrencies, has witnessed a remarkable surge of 22.4% within a mere week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Remarkable Surge: Growing Community, Strong On-Chain\n\nThis surge is not merely a passive spectacle; Ethereum is actively attracting an astonishing 89,400 new addresses on a daily basis, with an unprecedented 96,300 joining the Ethereum community in a single day.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThis momentum is not solely about acquiring new participants; it\u2019s about retention. Ethereum\u2019s exchange supply, representing the quantity readily available for sale, is approaching its historical low of 8.05%. This shift signals a notable move towards self-custody and staking, mitigating the immediate risk of a substantial selloff and fortifying Ethereum\u2019s price floor.\n\nThe on-chain strength witnessed translates into tangible market action. Following a brief dip that tested the $2,500 support, Ethereum not only stabilized but turned this once-resilient level into a launchpad.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,556 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAnalysts are now setting their sights on the $2,700 barrier as the gateway to unlocking a potential price surge, with FOMO (fear of missing out) traders anticipated to join the rally. Beyond this juncture, the horizon appears boundless, with $3,400 emerging as an enticing target.\n\nCaution Amid Excitement: Ethereum\u2019s Unpredictable Trajectory\n\nYet, amid the excitement, an air of caution permeates the volatile crypto landscape. A breach below the \u201chammer\u201d formation that materialized on Monday holds the potential to send Ethereum plummeting towards the 20-Day EMA (exponential moving average) at approximately $2,300.\n\nTraders are poised on tenterhooks, meticulously monitoring these crucial levels to decipher the forthcoming trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nOne undeniable truth emerges: Ethereum is casting off the shadow of Bitcoin and carving out its unique path. With an increasing dominance, a fervent user base, and a focus on self-custody, Ethereum is laying the groundwork for future expansion.\n\nWhether it attains the envisioned $3,400 pinnacle or steers towards an alternate destiny, one certainty prevails\u2014Ethereum is an influential force, and its narrative is only in its nascent stages.\n\nHistory repeating itself.#Bitcoin dominance peaking before the halving and potentially marking a cycle top. Altcoins are likely to outperform coming period. pic.twitter.com/ox36x2M5NG \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 15, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, in order to bolster Ethereum\u2019s increasing dominance over Bitcoin, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the founder and CEO of trading company MNTrading, observed that Bitcoin was falling behind Ethereum in terms of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a post on X dated January 12, he included the following graphic with the caption, \u201c#Bitcoin dominance peaking before the halving and maybe signifying a cycle top.\u201d It\u2019s conceivable that altcoins will perform better in the near future.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "What Is Immutable? The Ethereum Network for Crypto and NFT Games - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nImmutable X is a layer-2 scaling network built on top of Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. Developed by the Web3 firm Immutable via tech created by StarkWare, Immutable X uses the native ERC-20 token IMX and hosts a number of different blockchain games on its network like Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Illuvium, and Ember Sword, to name a few.\n\nWhile Ethereum proponents argue that its mainnet is among the most decentralized and secure of all cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s also historically suffered from high gas fees and long waits to make transactions. This has long caused friction with NFT creators like those behind the CryptoKitties, who once clogged the mainnet with their digital cats and made it virtually unusable.\n\nBecause NFTs\u2014unique blockchain tokens that signify ownership\u2014are currently so essential to blockchain games, it\u2019s unfeasible for most game developers to build on the Ethereum mainnet. That\u2019s where layer-2 solutions like Immutable X come in, plus Immutable is expanding with another new zkEVM scaling network ahead. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Immutable platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nImmutable X is a gaming-focused protocol that\u2019s built atop the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s security, but with the speed and lower transaction costs of a layer-2 scaling network. In other words, it provides additional benefits on top of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Immutable X\u2019s whitepaper, the network allows users to make transactions with zero gas fees. This is partly possible due to Immutable X\u2019s use of StarkWare\u2019s ZK rollup technology which bundles transactions and can enable over 9,000 NFT transactions per second.\n\nWho created Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is the main Web3 firm behind the Immutable X protocol. The company is part blockchain developer and part game publisher, as Immutable developed the NFT card-battling game Gods Unchained and is publishing the action role-playing game Guild of Guardians.\n\nPer Crunchbase data, Immutable has raised nearly $280 million in funding from 32 investors as of January 2024, with firms like Tencent, GameStop Digital Ventures, King River Capital, and the now-defunct Alameda Research investing.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nImmutable X supports all Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Users can also create an Immutable Passport to transact on the network. Immutable Passport is designed to be a streamlined and more approachable crypto wallet for gamers, plus it provides a unified identity across games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe protocol itself sits on top of the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for Immutable X to leverage the mainnet\u2019s decentralization and security for finalizing transactions. But because Immutable X uses ZK rollups, its transactions on its layer-2 network are still able to be fast and cost-effective.\n\nImmutable has built multiple REST application programming interfaces (APIs), meaning they are APIs that adhere to a specific set of architectural standards. Immutable\u2019s REST APIs mean that transactions can consist of an API call, which takes less time than engaging with a protocol directly via a smart contract.\n\nWho's using Immutable X?\n\nA number of different NFT marketplaces and game developers have chosen to offer their products and services on ImmutableX. In June 2022, Immutable Ventures established a massive $500 million fund to invest in Web3 gaming projects being built on Immutable X and to also provide various developers with grant-based funding.\n\nRarible, Mintable, NFTrade, TokenTrove, OKX, and Kinguin are NFT marketplaces that use Immutable X. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop also launched its NFT marketplace on Immutable X in 2022, but has since discontinued its own crypto wallet and has said that it will shut down its marketplace in February 2024.\n\nGames like IMVU, Guild of Guardians, Habbo, Cross the Ages, Undead Blocks, Ember Sword, Planet Quest, Gods Unchained, WAGMI Defense, and Tiny Colony are building their Web3 elements on Immutable X.\n\nAs the world of Web3 gaming heats up, Immutable X faces competition with other blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum Nova, Sui, and Solana to offer a fast and seamless gaming experience.\n\nWhat is Immutable zkEVM?\n\nImmutable is developing more than just Immutable X as its Ethereum gaming platform expands. In March 2023, the firm announced that it is working with competitor Polygon to develop a new Immutable zkEVM scaling network that combines Polygon zkEVM technology with Immutable\u2019s gaming platform.\n\nA number of games have already announced that they\u2019ll be using the Immutable zkEVM, from MetalCore to Shardbound and Elemental Knights. According to an Immutable blog post, the zkEVM network provides native compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, potentially making it easier for developers to port over from EVM chains and utilize an array of third-party tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Immutable platform grows, the IMX token has become the most valuable gaming token as of this writing, with a market cap of nearly $2.7 billion. That makes it the 37th largest overall cryptocurrency by market cap according to data from CoinGecko, as of January 17, 2024.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Bitcoin might be down 9% this week, but Ethereum continues to remain very bullish as it trades inside a rising price channel.\n\nThe number two ranked cryptocurrency is now up by a strong 10% this week, while the majority of the top-10 other tokens take a nosedive.\n\nThe narrative behind an incoming $ETH ETF next is primarily driving markets higher.\n\nWith Ethereum on the move, traders are turning their attention back to ERC-20 tokens in the hopes of profiting from the ecosystem\u2019s bullish sentiment.\n\nEthereum Remains Bullish Inside Rising Price Channel as Traders Predict $3,000 $ETH Next.\n\nEthereum is up by a strong 10% this week as it currently trades above $2,530.\n\nThe cryptocurrency remains bullish as it trades inside a rising price channel, with traders predicting a break toward the upside will result in a run toward the $3,000 level.\n\nEthereum also saw a sudden surge in volume, which is helping it outpace Bitcoin this week.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has pulled back from last week\u2019s highs after failing to break the combined resistance provided by the upper angle of the range and a 1.272 Fib Extension at $2,640.\n\nLooking ahead, the first level of resistance lies at $2,640. If the buyers can continue to break above the upper angle of the price channel, then resistance is expected at $2,770 (1.414 Fib Extension) and $2,800.\n\nIf the bulls can clear higher resistance at $2,950 (1.618 Fib Extension), they will be free to attempt $3,000.\n\nWhat ERC-20 Tokens Are Traders Buying for Profit?\n\nWhile Ethereum started to see a surprising move upward, traders are now turning their focus back to ERC-20 tokens, believing they can provide significant profits.\n\nIn particular, $SPONGE is turning heads as it attracts over $4 million into its staking contract for its V2 upgrade, slated to bring the first 100x meme coin return in 2024.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) also gains momentum after crossing the $8.5 million fundraising milestone.\n\n$SPONGE Sees an Incredible $4 Million in Staked Assets As Traders Ready Themselves For V2 100x Return\n\nSpongebob Token ($SPONGE) has now seen the total amount of $SPONGE staked in its V2 contract rise past the $4 million level, demonstrating the building hype behind its v2 upgrade.\n\n$SPONGE was one of the hottest trending meme coins in 2023 after providing a 100x return following its fair launch in May 2023.\n\nThe cryptocurrency managed to amass a combined social following of 30,000 people as top exchanges like Gate.io and MEXC rushed to list the token.\n\nThe project is back with its V2 incarnation, aiming to reproduce the 100x return in 2024.\n\nThe exciting thing is that $SPONGE isn\u2019t hosting a typical presale. Instead, it\u2019s utilizing a stake-to-bridge, which requires $SPONGE holders to staker their V1 tokens to be allocated an equivalent amount of the V2 upgrade.\n\nThe stake-to-bridge utility is the only way to get positioned in V2. If you don\u2019t own $SPONGE V1, you can purchase it through the project\u2019s website and have it automatically staked for the V2 upgrade.\n\nAll $SPONGE V1 locked in the smart contract will be permanently locked to facilitate the transition to the V2 token.\n\nThe project has been audited by SolidProof, bringing security to investors.\n\nOverall, $SPONGE has already shown its capabilities in 2023 with a 100x surge and is back to repeat its success in 2024.Buy and Stake $SPONGE Today\n\n$BTCMTX Raises An Enormous $8.5 Million In Stake-to-Mine Presale\n\nBitcoin MInetrix ($BTCMTX) is another token turning heads as the presale crosses the $8.5 million milestone.\n\nThe significant backing clearly demonstrates that investors are touting Bitcoin Minetrix as a disruptive force in the cloud mining sector ahead of the next Bitcoin block halving.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix intends to make it easier for everyday users to mine Bitcoin without trusting centralized entities.\n\nThe project introduces a novel stake-to-mine concept that lets users buy and stake $BTCMTX tokens to start cloud mining Bitcoin.\n\nParticipants are doubling their passive income, with one source coming from mining returns and another from staking rewards.\n\nThose currently staking are earning an impressive 76% APY on their holdings.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix essentially tokenizes the cloud mining sector, putting the control back into the hands of the miners, who won\u2019t have to worry about being short-changed on potential earnings or being locked into long-term contracts.\n\nThose interested in the token can purchase it during the presale for $0.0128.\n\nBuy $BTCMTX Today.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price has lost approximately 5% in valuation within the past 24 hours, making it one of the top losers in the crypto industry for the day. Further, the market displays a constant bearish movement, suggesting a strong bear power.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price traded in a closed range between $20.32 and $21.94 for a period, following which the bulls gained momentum and the price broke out of the range. However, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $23.45.\n\nTradingView: ETC/USDT\n\nAfter this, the price traded between $21.94 and $23.45 for about a week. As the bears overpowered the bulls, the ETC price recorded a correction of approximately 15% in valuation.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded in a consolidated range between $18.77 and $21.94 for a brief period. The bulls regained momentum, resulting in the Ethereum Classic price jumping over 42% in valuation within a day.\n\nAfter facing rejection at $31.23, the price has been constantly trading under a descending channel pattern, indicating a strong bearish influence in the market.\n\nWill ETC Price Regain Value?\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a neutral trend, suggesting weak buying and selling pressure in the market. Further, the averages show a constant decline, suggesting an uncertainty in the future price action of the coin.\n\nIf the market regains value, the ETC price will test its resistance level of $29 soon. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the Ethereum Classic price to attempt to test its upper resistance level of $31.23 in the coming days.\n\nConversely, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $25.04. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $23.45."

        "content": "Last month, our feature in The Protocol highlighted how the blockchain design principle of \" intents \" was gaining ascendancy among developers on the industry's cutting edge. This week our Sam Kessler is back with a scoop on how the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, from the Ethereum developer Consensys, has quietly deployed a version of an intents-based routing mechanism that could revolutionize how users interact with blockchains.\n\nWe've also got:\n\nA post-mortem on Ethereum's unexpectedly ugly Dencun upgrade on the Goerli test network.\n\nReactions to Vitalik Buterin's proposed \"gas limit\" increase.\n\nJob cuts at NEAR Foundation as new CEO Illia \"Black Dragon\" Polosukhin goes to work.\n\nHighlights from this week's Protocol Village column on blockchain project updates, featuring Taiko, Chainlink, Hedera, Lagrange and Hacken.\n\nNetwork news\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. (CoinDesk)\n\nMOORE IS MORE. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , the de facto high priest of the world's largest smart-contracts blockchain, tossed out last week on a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" that it would be \"reasonable\" to raise the network's \"gas limit\" \u2013 a very technical way of referring to the amount of transactions that can get jammed into each new block . He suggested an increase to \"40M or so,\" implying a 33% increase over the current limit of 30 million gas. (Yes, for the underinitiated, a unit of gas, in this context, is just\u2026 a gas .) The main reason this is now possible, according to Buterin, is Moore's law \u2013 the observation that computing power seems to double every year . That's relevant because of the amount of data that it takes to store Ethereum's \"state\" \u2013 the complete record of the blockchain's history; as computers become more powerful, they should theoretically be able to handle the higher transaction capacity \u2013 potentially helping to reduce fees for end-users. \"There appears to be a constructive willingness to explore this topic further,\" analysts at Coinbase Institutional wrote. But some members of the Ethereum community have raised yellow flags. P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum developer, tweeted that such an increase could slow the network's \"sync time.\" Galaxy Research's Christine Kim wrote in a weekly newsletter that \"larger blocks would certainly increase block propagation latency and potentially result in a higher number of missed blocks. \" Marius van der Wijden, an Ethereum software developer, estimated that the network's state is currently around 87 gigabytes (GB), and growing at 2 GB per month. That would put it at 111 GB in a year and 207 GB in five years. In an era where a 1 terabyte thumb drive can be bought on Amazon.com for $19.99 , it doesn't sound too terribly daunting. \"The problem here is not the size itself,\" van der Wijden wrote. \"Everyone will be able to store that amount of data. However, accessing and modifying it will become slower and slower.\" One thing there seems to be some agreement on: It's worth waiting a bit to observe the impact of the upcoming \" Dencun \" upgrade on the network, which will introduce a new way of storing data as \"blobs,\" effectively providing a capacity increase .\n\nStory continues\n\nBLACK DRAGON BREATHES FIRE: Just two months after NEAR Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin took over as CEO of the supporting NEAR Foundation, he announced drastic cuts last week in the organization's workforce \u2013 impacting 35 colleagues, or a 40% reduction. According to Polosukhin, the decision came after a \"thorough review of the foundation's activities,\" resulting in feedback that \"the foundation has not always been as effective as it could be.\" Polosukhin noted that the financial picture remains sound, with over $285 million in \"fiat\" or government-issued currencies and 305 million NEAR tokens \"worth over $1B,\" along with $70 million of investments and loans. Referred to in the foundation's communications as the \" Black Dragon ,\" Polosukhin may be under pressure to breathe new life into the alternative layer-1 blockchain, which ranks 32nd among networks based on the much-watched metric of total value locked, or TVL, according to DeFi Llama . Notably NEAR is trying some fresh strategies, pivoting last year to serve as a \" data availability \" network and cutting a deal with restaking pioneer EigenLabs to create a \" fast finality layer \" for Ethereum layer-2 networks.\n\nONE BETTER THAN TWO: The Binance-incubated BNB Chain ecosystem has announced a plan called \" Fusion \" that will see the original BNB Beacon Chain decommissioned while reinforcing the primacy of the sister BNB Smart Chain. According to a statement on the open-source software platform GitHub, the proposal will help to \"overcome legacy services and technical debt, enabling faster iteration and development.\" According to the newsletter Wu Blockchain , \"BNB Beacon Chain is set to exit the stage within the next six months.\"\n\nALSO:\n\nImage tweeted early Wednesday by Ethereum's Tim Beiko with the comment,\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live on the Goerli test network early Wednesday but failed to finalize in the expected time. Developers expect the apparent issues to be fixed in the coming days. These likely occurred due to low participation and validators not upgrading parts of their software that would have helped with finalization.

Taiko , developing a so-called type-1 zkEVM to help scale the Ethereum blockchain, announced the launch of \"Katla,\" its alpha-6 testnet, according to a message from the team: \"Katla is laying the foundation for Taiko's mainnet launch in 2024.\"2. Parallel Network has officially launched on mainnet and is open to developers, according to the team , claiming to be the first layer-2 network on Arbitrum Orbit to go live. \"It is also the first non-custodial omni-chain margin protocol, which allows liquidity to be pooled across multiple chains and makes it immediately available on the Parallel Network.\"\n\n3. Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to make it easy for users to transfer USDC across chains, according to a press release. Developers can now build cross-chain use cases via CCIP that involve cross-chain transfers of USDC, including payments and other DeFi interactions, the statement said.\n\n4. The Hedera Council announced its newest member, the electronics maker Hitachi America, Ltd. (Hitachi). According to the team: \"Hitachi aims to begin creating proof-of-concepts for end-to-end supply chain and sustainability solutions on Hedera in the next year.\"\n\n5. Lagrange Labs, developer of a blockchain proving system based on zero-knowledge cryptography, has integrated its light client protocol, Lagrange State Committees (LSC), for the Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle, according to the team . LSCs \"are a ZK light client protocol for optimistic rollups (ORUs), designed through combining Lagrange\u2019s ZK MapReduce Coprocessor and EigenLayer restaking. Each state committee borrows security from Ethereum by dual staking, both through EigenLayer restaking and with the rollup\u2019s native token.\"\n\n6. Hacken, a blockchain security auditor, has introduced an open-source Rust library for code coverage generation for WASM-based protocols, according to the team: \"Code Coverage utilities are crucial for automation testing to ascertain the thoroughness of code examination. Without it, some critical components can remain untested. While it is available for Ethereum-based projects, WASM-based protocols don't have it. Wasmcov by Hacken is already integrated into the Radix ecosystem, which enables all Radix-built projects to utilize code coverage measurement. The next protocol to get it will be NEAR. The rest can set it up manually.\"\n\nSee the entire Protocol Village list from this past week here.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s Secret \u2018Intents\u2019 Project Could Radically Change How Users Interact With Blockchains\n\nMetaMask has quietly rolled out a limited version of its new routing tech into the new Smart Swaps feature. (MetaMask, modified by CoinDesk)\n\nMetaMask, the most popular crypto wallet on Ethereum, is testing a new \"transaction routing\" technology that's likely to have major ramifications for how value flows through the second-biggest blockchain network.\n\nCoinDesk learned of the new technology from developers briefed on the plan, and key details were subsequently confirmed by officials with MetaMask's parent company, Consensys.\n\nThe effort capitalizes on a concept known in blockchain circles as \" intents \" that is rapidly gaining momentum, potentially leading to a radical shift in how people interact with blockchains: Rather than specifying how they want to get something done (e.g. \"sell X tokens on Y exchange for Z price\"), blockchain users may only need to specify what they want the outcome to be (e.g. \"I want the best price for my tokens\").\n\nThe \"what\" versus \"how\" distinction might seem subtle, but it's a big departure from how MetaMask and other crypto wallets worked originally \u2013 as neutral, relatively simple pieces of software for connecting users to blockchains. The goal with the new tech is for users to get better execution on their transactions and improved ease of use, but intent-based programs ultimately represent a big shift to where \u2013 and to whom \u2013 value flows on blockchains.\n\nThe new technology is being built by Special Mechanisms Group (SMG), a blockchain infrastructure firm that MetaMask owner Consensys purchased last year.\n\nRead the full story by Sam Kessler here\n\nMoney Center\n\nFundraisings\n\nRenzo , an interface for the liquid restaking protocol EigenLayer , has raised $3.2M, according to the team: \"Maven11 led the Renzo seed round which also saw follow-on investments from Figment Capital, SevenX, IOSG and Paper Ventures.\"\n\nHashKey Group , which operates the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has \u201cnearly\u201d met its $100 million fundraising target, the firm said Tuesday. HashKey announced the fundraising round in August, shortly after it won a license from Hong Kong\u2019s security regulator to offer retail crypto trading . The firm did not disclose the investors in the round and now claims a valuation of $1.2 billion post-raise, giving it \u201cunicorn\u201d status.\n\nBitfinity Network , a Web3 infrastructure firm, announced it has successfully secured over $7 million in funding from notable backers, including Polychain Capital and ParaFi Capital, advancing its mission to establish off-chain infrastructure for Bitcoin and Ordinals.\n\nDeals and Grants\n\nPush Protocol , the communication protocol of Web3, recently concluded their Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) developer tour in India, according to the team: \"During the hackathon, Aditya Bisht successfully solved one of its hardest coding challenges belonging to the Ethereum Foundation \u2013 quantum proofing the Ethereum Network. Bisht's creation of an account abstraction smart contract effectively conceals public keys, enhancing the network's defense against quantum decryption.\"\n\nThe Hedera and Algorand ecosystems have joined to Form DeRec Alliance. (DeRec stands for \"decentralized recovery.\") According to the team: \"Entities from across the Hedera and Algorand ecosystems including the HBAR Foundation, Algorand Foundation, Hashgraph Association, Swirlds Labs, and DLT Science Foundation, along with industry partners The Building Blocks and BankSocial, are partnering to develop a new interoperability recovery standard which will simplify the recovery & adoption of crypto and other assets.\"\n\nSui , a layer-1 blockchain, is getting DePIN and DeWi through a groundbreaking partnership with Karrier One, according to the team: \"The deal also includes strategic investment from Sui to fuel the expansion of Karrier One\u2019s global footprint and deployment on Sui. The technical integration will feature DePIN services powered by the Sui blockchain and the launch of a Karrier One Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) network token on Sui.\"\n\nData and Tokens\n\nAmong Major Layer-2 Networks, ZkSync Era Has the Cheapest Average Transactions\n\nWe finally got around to reading Messari analyst Seth Bloomberg's excellent report out a few weeks ago titled, \" The Onchain Economics of ZK Rollups .\" It provides a good snapshot of the competition between major Ethereum layer-2 networks as 2023 closed out. The report reinforced the oft-repeated observation that \"Data publishing (or data availability) generally remains the highest on-chain cost for rollups\" \u2013 thus underscoring the significance of Ethereum's upcoming \"Dencun\" upgrade, which is supposed to lead to drastic reductions in those expenses. But there are different ways to handle the data, of course, and the zkSync Era project stands out in that it \"only posts state diffs to Ethereum,\" while most rollup networks \"publish the full rollup transaction data.\" Per the report: \"In simple terms, publishing state diffs means that if two users send ETH and other tokens to each other multiple times, only the net differences in their account balances need to be published to Ethereum instead of the full transaction history between the two users.\" The upshot? ZkSync Era has the lowest average transaction costs, at 18 cents, seen as a nice bargain compared with Polygon zkEVM's 45 cents.\n\nCalendar"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Deployed Successfully on Goerli Testnet\n\nEthereum's core developers have taken a significant step towards improving the network's scalability with the deployment of the Dencun upgrade on the Goerli testnet on January 24, 2024, at around 1:35 a.m. ET. However, the upgrade faced issues in the validator clients' ability to sync with each other.\n\nParithosh Jayanthi, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, later announced that the fix was patched in and the Dencun fork on Goerli was finalized. In preparation for this transition, the development team has opted for a phased approach, initially implementing the upgrade on various testnets.\n\nThe successful deployment on the Goerli testnet marks the first phase of a gradual rollout, with subsequent implementations planned for the Sepolia and Holesky testnets before the final mainnet release in Q1 2024.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces EIP-4844, a novel transaction mechanism known as ephemeral blobs or proto-danksharding. This approach allows Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data, reducing storage demands and lowering transaction costs. By reducing transaction costs, EIP-4844 will make it more affordable to use Ethereum dApps and Layer 2 solutions.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, bringing the network closer to enhanced scalability and lower transaction costs. The phased rollout approach minimizes risks and allows for thorough testing, ensuring a successful transition to the upgraded network.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "A recent conversation with Vitalik Buterin on X platform sheds light on a few important topics regarding L2 networks \u2013 the main scalability tool for the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core, an L2 solution is a secondary framework or protocol built atop the Ethereum blockchain, designed to increase transaction capacity and speed without compromising the security provided by the main chain, known as layer 1 (L1). This conversation is vital because it helps users understand the types of solutions available and their respective tradeoffs.\n\nYeah I agree with this. I called them \"security-favoring\" vs \"scale-favoring\" here, but we can probably come up with better terms (\"strong L2\" vs \"light L2\" perhaps?)https://t.co/oSPZkB3Xo3 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin participated in a discussion clarifying that \"L2s\" encompass both rollups and validiums. The distinction is important for users to grasp the different security and scalability features. Rollups are \"security-favoring\" solutions that bundle or \"roll up\" transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain.\n\nThis process allows for high security, as the L1 blockchain directly secures them. In contrast, validiums are \"scale-favoring,\" designed to boost capacity by storing data off-chain but with proofs still on-chain, offering slightly less security for much greater scalability.\n\nThe distinction is nuanced but significant. While rollups are more expensive due to the data being posted on-chain, they offer higher security. Validiums, on the other hand, provide a cheaper alternative, with a slight tradeoff in security. Buterin suggests that the terminology should reflect these differences without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he proposes terms like \"strong L2\" for rollups and \"light L2\" for validiums to help users navigate their choices better.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin also points out that the architecture of L2 solutions is not strictly about security levels. He previously attempted to categorize these layers but recognized that there is a significant \"intermediate space\" between rollups and validiums, further complicating the classification."

        "content": "Arbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d according to a Nansen analyst, but investors are concerned about its upcoming $2 billion token unlock.\n\nArbitrum, the leading scaling solution for Ethereum, has captured roughly half of the entire rollup market share, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen in a research report published Thursday.\n\nRollups are designed to help users transact faster and more inexpensively on the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain and batching a collection of transactions before posting them to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\n\nWith $11.47 billion in locked value in its smart contracts, Arbitrum has captured about 48% of the entire rollup market share.\n\nArbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d Nansen research analyst Sandra Leow said in the research report. Notably, growth in daily transactions and monthly revenue has been impressive. Despite Ethereum surpassing it in daily transactions, Arbitrum averages 600,000 to 900,000 transactions per day, outpacing its rollup rival, Optimism, the second largest rollup with over $5.5 billion in locked value, per L2Beat.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s revenue trajectory has been consistently upward since Sept. 2023, Leow noted. Last month, Arbitrum generated revenue of $11.9 million, its highest monthly earnings to date.\n\nConcerns About Upcoming Token Unlock\n\nThe outlook is not all sunny for Arbitrum, however. Some crypto investors see risks in Arbitrum due to its upcoming token unlocks which will free up a massive amount of ARB.\n\nToken unlocks refer to the release of frozen or locked cryptocurrencies. Ideally, token unlocks are gradual to prevent large-scale sell-offs by early investors. But Arbitrum is about to have a \u201cheavy unlock,\u201d explained Charles Storry, co-founder of crypto index platform Phuture, to Unchained on Telegram.\n\nRight now, Arbitrum has a very small circulating supply of 1.275 billion ARB, only 12.75% of its total token supply. However, in about two months, 1.11 billion ARB \u2014 87% of its circulating supply \u2014 will be unlocked.\n\nAfter the March unlock, which is valued at over $2 billion, Arbitrum will begin monthly unlocks for the next three years, according to its governance documents.\n\nPositive Catalysts\n\nSeveral catalysts may increase positive sentiment among the Arbitrum community, however, according to Nansen\u2019s Leow. The first is a recently passed proposal about the implementation of a staking mechanism, which would let token holders lock their ARB in exchange for rewards.\n\nThe second is Arbitrum\u2019s short-term incentive program (STIP), which allows protocols such as GMX and Camelot to apply and receive grants as a means to boost on-chain activity.\n\nThe third is EIP-4844, which \u201cis a big step forward in Ethereum\u2019s Rollup-centric roadmap,\u201d because it reduces the cost of rollups by 10-20x, wrote Leow. While investors have expressed bearish remarks about ARB\u2019s price, \u201cgenerally people are more closely monitoring EIP-4844 (blobs) in the Ethereum Dencun upgrade,\u201d Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, said to Unchained over Telegram.\n\nRead More: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Live on Testnet After Bug Delays Finalization\n\nThe last catalyst revolves around Arbitrum Orbit, which allows developers to create new chains atop Arbitrum\u2019s layer 2 rollup. According to Leow, the main benefit of Arbitrum Orbit is that it allows the use of tokens native to the chains atop Arbitrum as compensation for gas, which would \u201climit sell pressure of the said token.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite investor concerns over imminent token unlocks and the ARB token\u2019s underperformance, ARB is strategically positioned as a frontrunner in the optimistic rollup sector, commanding nearly half of the total market share in rollups,\u201d Leow said.\n\nARB, the governance token for Arbitrum, is currently trading at $1.91, down roughly 14% in the past seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor for Unchained."

        "title": "Ethereum Proto-Danksharking Successfully Live on Goerli Testnet - Blockonomi",
        "content": "The Dencun upgrade, one of the major upgrades in the Ethereum blockchain, went live on January 17, successfully integrating proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to the Goerli tesnet. This testnet deployment will set the stage for the next upgrades on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets and the final launch on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDespite encountering hurdles, the Dencun upgrade has successfully deployed on the Goerli testnet.\n\nParitosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at Ethereum Foundation, confirmed the implementation in an X post: \u201cGoerli forked and blobs are now enabled on the testnet!\u201d He also monitored a live stream that showcased the upgrade.\n\nAs the implementation took place, it hit unexpected roadblocks, including a potential \u201cchain-split\u201d as there were issues with syncing between clients. Jayanthi noted that the Goerli fork failed to reach consensus and finality due to the low participation of Prysm validators, reportedly 80% being online at launch.\n\nEthereum Evolves\n\nTerence, a maintainer of Prysm, an Ethereum consensus layer client, said that this issue could be attributed to the lack of software upgrades and a software bug.\n\nTo wit, \u201cThe participation is low (~80%). Losing finality requires approximately 10% of validators to be offline. Being offline could be due to operators not upgrading a piece of software (and there are multiple)\u2026or a software bug.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jayanthi said within a few hours that the issue was fixed and validators were back online, successfully reaching finality.\n\nOne thing to note is that the Goreli testnet will stop running within one to three months after the Dencun upgrade is successfully implemented. Following this decision, the Ethereum Foundation acknowledged that this would moderately affect the network\u2019s stability.\n\nStill, it would be a good opportunity for them to check the delays and security when many validators get reduced, similar to how they got rid of Ropsten and Rinkerby as Ethereum continuously achieved important progress.\n\nLower Transaction Costs Coming Soon?\n\nDencun is one of the major upgrades of the Ethereum network, following the Merge and Shanghai. The upgrade is expected to introduce a number of improvements to Ethereum, such as reducing the cost of storing transaction data and storage demand, improving the cross-chain design, and changing the blocks\u2019 data structure, among others.\n\nDencun also aims to significantly reduce transaction costs for Optimism Rollups like Arbitrum or Optimism, attracting more users and enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nBefore its finalization on Goreli, the development team had initially implemented Dencun on multiple testnets to check for possible problems. If Dencun operates smoothly without major bugs in all these testnet environments, the activation on the mainnet will be planned and scheduled within Q1/2024.\n\nWith the successful implementation, all eyes are set on Ethereum\u2019s price movement during the year\u2019s first quarter. Layer 2 protocols will also be in the spotlight since the Dencun upgrade is expected to bring major benefits to these protocols.\n\nAt the press time, Ethereum is trading at around $2,500, down 2.35% in the last 24 hours. The decline followed a report of the Ethereum Foundation engaging in the sale of ETH through over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. Notably, the team conducted a transfer of 100 ETH (equivalent to $253,000) to address 0xd77, receiving 253,000 DAI in return.\n\nWhile ETH is a leading token, it will have to fight with other blockchains going forward. SOL, for example, is getting attention, and this could make it a real threat to ETH in the coming years.\n\nThroughout 2023, the organization reportedly liquidated 2,262 ETH at an average price of $1,609 per ETH. These divestitures are often observed preceding market declines, drawing attention within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nDespite these sales, the Ethereum Foundation maintains a substantial ETH portfolio. On-chain data indicates total ETH assets amounting to $886 million, comprising $806 million in ETH and $79.81 million in WETH. Additionally, they possess around $500,000 in stablecoins and $15,000 in Binance Coin (BNB)."

        "content": "Santiment\u2019s on-chain data recently signaled a notable bullish momentum for XRP (XRP). Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) rollercoaster performance in Q4 2023 and its upcoming Spiral Hard Fork adds complexity to the crypto landscape.\n\nYet, NuggetRush (NUGX) emerges as a standout altcoin, blending cryptocurrency, physical mining, and gold mining into a P2E NFT gaming platform.\n\n>>Visist NuggetRush Presale<<\n\nXRP (XRP) Bulls to Gain Momentum? Santiment On-Chain Data Signals Optimism\n\nOn January 14, 2024, Santiment on-chain data showed a significant bullish bias toward XRP (XRP). Bitcoin (BTC) had its historic moment in the past week after the SEC approved its exchange-traded funds that have been pending for many years.\n\nOn that note, sentiment toward large-cap assets remained optimistic, with a focus on them after the ETF approvals. On that note, traders have discussed the possibility of XRP ETF approvals.\n\nSantiment highlighted that XRP sentiment and discussion rates have surged to the highest levels since May 2023. That was when XRP social discussions increased weeks before the July 11 ruling, which stipulated that XRP was not a security.\n\nSeveral notable figures in the crypto space have speculated about the altcoin\u2019s possibility of having an ETF approved. Investors might be more ready to buy XRP due to fear of missing out, but so far, this doesn\u2019t seem to have pushed the prices higher.\n\nAt the time of this writing, XRP is trading at a 5% loss for the past 7 days.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) Rollercoaster Q4 2023 Performance, Anticipation and Concerns Surrounding Spiral Hard Fork\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) performed well in Q4 2023, surging from $16.36 to $22.69 in December, a 36.19% increase. Nonetheless, Ethereum Classic (ETC) dropped to where it currently trades at around $25 on January 18th.\n\nThe Spiral Hard Fork, expected to go live on January 31, 2024, increases considerations for this market\u2019s participants. This upgrade aims to enhance compatibility and guarantee technical improvements for Ethereum Classic (ETC). However, experiences with hard forks in crypto have caused market uncertainties.\n\nInvestors and traders will approach ETC cautiously since the Ethereum Classic transition needs participants, including those in crypto mining and exchanges, to update software to adopt these changes. Future market sentiment around Ethereum Classic (ETC) might be influenced by possible challenges or uncertainties linked to the upgrade.\n\nBut, after the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum Classic (ETC) awakened. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was trading at $27.03 on January 14, up 36.93% in that week. It has since retraced slightly, as mentioned above.\n\nUnlocking Adventure: NuggetRush (NUGX) Dominates Blockchain Gaming with Innovative P2E and NFT Integration\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) blends cryptocurrency, physical world artisanal mining, and gold mining into a play-to-earn (P2E) NFT gaming platform. The integration of these elements rewards NuggetRush (NUGX) players with valuable in-game items and creates a thrilling gaming experience.\n\nSince it is a community-driven blockchain game, NuggetRush (NUGX) attempts to enable users to generate passive wealth. The game sets up a mining network and challenges players to operate successful mining businesses as they enjoy rewards.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) lets players start with a small amount of land and simple equipment. They must navigate the digital space, looking for collectibles offered as financial rewards.\n\nBesides earning potential, NuggetRush (NUGX) enables players to experience an enjoyable and realistic gaming adventure. It blends physical mining experience with strategic land discovery, thinking, and the fun of collaborating on mining tasks with the other players.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) players earn by trading in-game collectibles like character NFTs and RUSHGEMs on its marketplace. Notably, NuggetRush has recorded massive success, selling over 155 million NUGX tokens and raising more than $1.8 million.\n\nCurrently, NuggetRush (NUGX) has almost completed round 4 of its presale, valued at $0.015. Round 5 is coming up, and the token will surge to $0.018, assuming the round is successful.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "We\u2019ve analyzed multiple Ethereum mining apps for Android to help you understand why using them probably isn\u2019t the best idea and why any app claiming to offer \u201cEthereum mining\u201d is misleading.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t want to leave you empty handed, so we\u2019ll also be featuring 5 Ethereum apps for Android that will enable you to earn ETH passively through staking.\n\nAre Ethereum mining apps for Android legit?\n\nThe short answer is no. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is secured through staking, and not mining. This has been the case since September of 2022, when an upgrade called The Merge removed the network\u2019s old Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and introduced a new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEven if Ethereum still used mining, no mobile phone on the market today would be powerful enough to mine it profitably.\n\nTherefore, any app that claims to provide Ethereum mining services is misleading at best and an outright scam at worst.\n\nWe were able to find 5 apps on the Google Play store that claim to be providing Ethereum mining or Ethereum cloud mining services. While the majority of these apps have a solid rating of 4 stars or more on the surface, a closer look at the reviews makes it obvious that the majority of 5-star reviews are not genuine. Meanwhile, there are a lot of genuine reviews with a 1-star rating that suggest the apps are not actually mining Ethereum. In some cases, the apps are even trying to convince users to buy another product.\n\nFor example, there are a lot of complaints from users saying that the app requires them to purchase a particular cryptocurrency wallet app before they can withdraw the ETH rewards they have supposedly earned.\n\nIf someone is asking you to pay to use a cryptocurrency wallet, that is a major red flag \u2014 legitimate cryptocurrency wallets, even those offering the most advanced features, can be downloaded for free. In fact, we haven\u2019t been able to find a single legitimate cryptocurrency wallet that is not completely free to use (apart from the fees blockchain networks charge for transactions).\n\nBest Android apps for earning Ethereum rewards\n\nThe bottom line is that you should avoid all apps that claim to be offering Ethereum mining. However, there are apps that will allow you to earn ETH passively, by giving you access to Ethereum staking. Please keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to already own some ETH if you want to earn additional ETH through staking.\n\nBinance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\n- The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature Kraken - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\n- A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\n- Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\n- The best Ethereum wallet overall Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\n1. Binance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\nBinance is a leading cryptocurrency exchange that lists hundreds of different crypto assets and provides a diverse suite of services for crypto investors. This also includes Ethereum staking \u2014 if you have ETH, you can stake it on Binance to passively earn rewards.\n\nIf you stake ETH through Binance, you will receive WBETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH. The conversion rate between WBETH and ETH gradually increases in favor of WBETH through the time to reflect the rewards earned by the ETH Binance is staking on behalf of its users.\n\nIf you wish to get your ETH back, you can simply redeem your WBETH tokens and receive ETH in return. The amount of ETH you can earn this way is determined by the size of your stake (bigger is better) and the duration of your stake (longer is better).\n\nEarn ETH on Binance\n\n2. Kraken Pro - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating for more than a decade and has built a strong reputation for keeping its users\u2019 fund safe even though many other exchanges have lost their customers\u2019 fund to hacks.\n\nIf you have ETH, you can stake it via the Kraken Pro app to benefit from staking rewards. Unlike Binance, which uses a token to represent staked ETH, the process on Kraken is more straightforward as there is no such token involved. However, the downside of Kraken\u2019s approach is that users can\u2019t get any liquidity from their staked ETH unless they unstake their coins.\n\nEarn ETH on Kraken\n\n3. Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\nCoinbase is a reputable crypto exchange that\u2019s known as one of the best crypto platforms for beginners. Coinbase provides an Ethereum staking service which allows ETH holders to earn additional rewards on their coins passively.\n\nUsers on Coinbase have the option to wrap their staked ETH coins and receive cbETH tokens. These tokens can be redeemed (or \u201cunwrapped\u201d) for ETH, but can be useful to still access the liquidity associated with your staked ETH.\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-term ETH holder that wants to put your idle coins to work, staking through Coinbase is certainly an option worth considering.\n\nEarn ETH on Coinbase\n\n4. MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\nThe previous ETH staking options we\u2019ve covered in this article are all facilitated through centralized cryptocurrency exchanges which stake users\u2019 ETH on their behalf. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some options to stake Ethereum in a more decentralized manner using on-chain liquid staking protocols.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with MetaMask, an extremely popular Ethereum wallet that also offers an Android app version. MetaMask offers a convenient staking option within the MetaMask portfolio feature that allows users to easily stake their ETH through liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nThe added benefit of using MetaMask instead of a cryptocurrency exchange is that you remain in control of your private keys and don\u2019t have to trust anyone but yourself to keep them safe.\n\nGet MetaMask\n\n5. Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\nTrust Wallet is a very popular all-purpose crypto wallet that is available both as a browser extension or as a standalone desktop application.\n\nOne of Trust Wallet\u2019s biggest strengths is that it supports a truly impressive selection of cryptocurrencies, as it\u2019s not just limited to EVM-compatible blockchains. You can also use Trust Wallet to store Bitcoin, XRP, Solana and many other popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrust Wallet has a user-friendly interface designed to cater to both beginners and experienced users. Navigating the wallet is easy, allowing users to seamlessly view their portfolio value in their preferred currency, monitor their transaction history, and effectively manage multiple wallets.\n\nYou can use Trust Wallet to securely hold your ETH and use it in liquid staking protocols to earn staking rewards. Just like MetaMask, Trust Wallet is also a non-custodial wallet, which means that you control your own private keys.\n\nGet Trust Wallet\n\nThe bottom line\n\nHopefully, this article helped explain why there are no legitimate Ethereum mining apps available on the market. However, there are still ways to earn ETH using an Android app. For example, you can stake your ETH coins through a cryptocurrency exchange app or use an Ethereum wallet app to stake your coins via protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nIf you want to learn more on the topic of earning crypto with your phone, make sure to take a look at our list of the best crypto mining apps for Android."

While there is optimism around the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC, investors are cautioned about the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets and advised to conduct thorough research as Ethereum remains 51% below its all-time high of $4,878 from November 2021.\n\nThe stage is set for Ethereum (ETH), the digital powerhouse and the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, as it strides confidently into 2024. After a promising kickoff, ETH\u2019s price trajectory is the talk of the town, especially as it flirts with the $2,376 mark. With eyes set on the sky-high potential of $2,500, everyone\u2019s asking: can ETH really keep its momentum and soar to new heights in 2024?\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ascent in 2024: A Look at the Potential Highs\n\nThe initial days of 2024 have been kind to Ethereum, marking a rise for three consecutive days.\n\nWith the current price hovering around $2,376, Ethereum seems to be priming for a breakout.\n\nExperts are watching closely as another price surge could push Ethereum to the $2,500 mark.\n\nChangelly\u2019s Rosy Forecast for Ethereum in 2024\n\nChangelly, a leading on-chain metrics and price prediction firm, has a rosy outlook for Ethereum\u2019s performance in 2024.\n\nThe firm\u2019s forecast suggests Ethereum might see a significant upward trend in the market.\n\nAn impressive price target of $3,988 for ETH is set for the year, promising a potential 65% increase from its current standing.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price Trajectory\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC could positively impact Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nHowever, a setback in the Bitcoin ETF\u2019s approval might drag Ethereum\u2019s price down alongside Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors are reminded to approach the volatile cryptocurrency market with caution and conduct thorough research before investing.\n\nInvestment Implications and Market Volatility\n\nA $10,000 investment in Ethereum today could potentially grow to $16,500 if the predictions hold true.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market\u2019s notorious volatility means returns could swing drastically, promising high rewards or significant losses.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum trades at $2,376, marking a slight increase in the 24-hour trade window.\n\nDespite the current optimism, Ethereum still trails by nearly 51% from its all-time high of $4,878, achieved back in November 2021.\n\nAs Ethereum carves its path through 2024, the crypto community waits with bated breath.

        "content": "While the Bitcoin price has been consolidating largely post-ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) has been making strong upside moves, thereby closing the gap with BTC. At press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.44% up at a price of $2,564 with a market cap of $308 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Price Dominance\n\nAccording to insights provided by on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s price dominance has experienced a notable surge against Bitcoin, marking a +22.4% increase over the past week. This period has witnessed the creation of 89.4K new Ethereum addresses per day, further underscoring the platform\u2019s growing traction. Notably, a staggering 96.3K wallets were created just yesterday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to these on-chain activities, Santiment\u2019s data reveals a significant trend in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, nearing its All-Time Low of 8.05%. This movement toward self-custody and staking implies a reduced risk of an imminent selloff, presenting a more favorable scenario compared to concerns arising from a rising supply on exchanges. These on-chain dynamics shed light on Ethereum\u2019s current market strength and its potential implications for future price movements.\n\nETH Price Action Going Ahead\n\nIn the recent trading session on Tuesday, Ethereum price initially experienced a slight pullback, testing the crucial $2,500 level. Notably, this level had previously served as significant resistance but now appears to be providing substantial support for the cryptocurrency. The price action suggests Ethereum\u2019s attempt to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nThe $2,700 level emerges as a key threshold, representing the upper boundary of the short-term trading range. Analysts consider this level crucial, and a breakthrough could set the stage for a potential market surge, with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) traders likely to join the rally. Beyond $2,700, the Ethereum price could further rally all the way to $3,400.\n\nConversely, a downside scenario could unfold if the second-largest crypto by market cap breaks below the hammer formed during the Monday session. In such a case, the cryptocurrency might see a downward movement toward the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), situated around the $2,300 level. Traders are closely monitoring these critical levels, anticipating potential shifts in Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory."

The fund which is currently valued at approximately $25 million, comes with an allocation of 400 million COTI tokens.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the long run, it would offer support to projects from developers who are interested in contributing to the growth and success of the COTI ecosystem by researching, developing, and building within COTI V2. As such, COTI is geared up to start inking strategic partnerships with interested parties. Soda Labs, a leading player in cryptographic Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is the first project to receive funding.\n\nPrecisely, Soda Labs will focus on leading research that is targeted at expanding practical applications for garbling protocols, to ensure a secure and scalable privacy network for COTI users. Dr. Avishay Yanai, one of the co-founders of Soda Labs, confirmed the company\u2019s previous effort toward innovation in the garbling circuit protocol. Therefore, the alliance with COTI is a stepping stone towards reaching its goal.\n\nCOTI Aims to Accelerate Ethereum Privacy\n\nThe plan to advance into a Layer-2 network that encourages Ethereum privacy has been ongoing for many months but it was not until a few weeks ago that COTI commenced the gradual release of the upgrade. COTI\u2019s CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen stated that the Ethereum privacy-centered fund marks a monumental step for the firm.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this fund by the COTI Foundation is integral in driving both the adoption of COTI V2 and the development of applications within the ecosystem,\u201d Bar-Geffen added.\n\nCOTI looks forward to making more meaningful connections in the coming months that support its newly launched Ethereum privacy vision. One of COTI\u2019s plans for the future is the addition of a developer\u2019s grant program distributed amongst milestones. This will contribute significantly to the holistic growth strategy of the COTI V2 ecosystem. This strategic move from COTI is likely to improve Ethereum adoption and integration in the long run."

        "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have been trading in a \u201chigh-risk zone.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit\u201d metric has suggested a potential upcoming market shift.\n\nThe data hasn\u2019t prophesied a crash, but the red flags are unmissable.\n\nThe three biggest cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP \u2013 are currently flashing warning signs, according to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment. The indicator raising eyebrows is the \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit,\u201d which tracks the percentage of a cryptocurrency\u2019s circulating supply currently sitting in profit.\n\nOn-Chain Data Suggests Caution\n\nWith all three major coins exceeding their historical averages in this metric, concerns are mounting that a mass selloff could be on the horizon. Investors often take profits when their holdings are in the green, and with a large portion of the supply currently profitable, the temptation to sell may become irresistible.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have averaged between 55% and 75% of their supply in profit. All three sit above this range, firmly within what Santiment defines as the \u201chigh-risk zone.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 #Bitcoin (83%), #Ethereum (84%), and #XRPLedger (81%) have their respective supplies in historically high risk profit levels compared to their averages that hover in the 55%-75% range dating back to 2018. #Crypto can absolutely still climb due to more exposure from pic.twitter.com/ADmMcl5zhO \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 18, 2024\n\nWhile external factors like increased exposure from ETFs could still push prices higher in the short term, Santiment emphasizes that a drop below 75% supply in profit would be a \u201cgreat signal,\u201d indicating continued long-term growth.\n\nCurrently, 84% of Ethereum\u2019s supply and 83% of Bitcoin\u2019s are in the green, with XRP trailing slightly behind at 81%. Historically, these figures have often preceded significant selloffs, as investors holding profitable positions become more likely to cash out.\n\nWhile this data doesn\u2019t guarantee an imminent crash, it does raise a red flag for investors. With a large portion of each asset\u2019s supply already in profit, the potential for a mass selloff is heightened. This is especially true if broader market conditions turn sour or negative news specific to any of the three cryptocurrencies emerges.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThey posit that, as facilitated by ETFs, institutional interest might steer prices upward despite the elevated profit percentages.\n\nNot every instance of high-profit percentages has resulted in significant selloffs as the crypto market is influenced by multifaceted factors, making it challenging to predict a uniform outcome based on this metric.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe current high levels of \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit\u201d suggest a heightened risk of price corrections for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. While not a definitive prediction of a downturn, this metric is a valuable indicator for investors to watch as they navigate the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo learn more about the impact of Bitcoin ETFs facing a ban in Singapore and the eligibility concerns surrounding it, dive into the details here:\n\nBitcoin ETFs Banned in Singapore Over Eligibility Concerns\n\n\n\nCurious about the Howey Test facing scrutiny as a judge challenges the SEC\u2019s interpretation?

This surge in Inscriptions contributed to a concurrent increase in gas usage on the network.\n\nThe influx of addresses, attracted to the network through Inscriptions, could positively impact Ethereum by enhancing its overall activity and engagement.\n\nInscriptions made up 77% of Ethereum txs for a few hours yesterday, a first for the L1 src: https://t.co/q6ZUx8QT6v pic.twitter.com/vDoflH0ko2 \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) January 15, 2024\n\nHowever, amidst this positive development, Ethereum could face a challenge in the form of significant staked ETH redemptions.\n\nAccording to an X (formerly Twitter) post, the start of January saw the largest staked ETH redemption since the Shanghai Upgrade. Notably, a substantial 656,200 ETH was fully withdrawn.\n\nEven though the unstaking was a result of the behavior of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment, this withdrawal could potentially impact Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem and affect market dynamics.\n\nLast week was the largest staked ETH redemption (Excl.

In the next 24 hours, the Dencun upgrade will be deployed on the Goerli testnet. This upgrade introduces blobs to the testnet which is also known as \u201cprotodanksharding.\u201d\n\nThis introduction aims to reduce Layer 2 transaction fees, which can help Ethereum in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nGoerli is forking this Wednesday (or Tuesday night, for parts of the world!).

Over the last 24 hours, ETH experienced a decrease of 0.28%.\n\nDespite the price decline, the MVRV ratio continued to grow. This signaled that a significant number of addresses were holding profitable positions.\n\nWhile this might incentivize some addresses to sell their ETH, potentially impacting the price negatively, the Long/Short difference provided a contrasting perspective.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe growing Long/Short difference suggested a higher number of long-term holders compared to short-term holders.\n\nLong-term holders, being less likely to sell, can contribute to price stability and resilience in the face of short-term market fluctuations."

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nThe founder of the decentralised mining network and software development platform Ethereum Vitalik Buterin shared his insights about Ethereum layer 2 of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVitalik shared pivotal points regarding L2 networks which are considered as main scalability tool for the Ethereum Network.\n\nDebate About L2 Layer\n\nThe L2 layer on the Ethereum blockchain is a collective term for an Ethereum scaling solution that manages transactions off Ethereum layer 1 while still taking benefit of the robust decentralized security of Ethereum layer 1. Layer 2 is a different blockchain that extends Ethereum.\n\nL2 solution is designed to improve transaction capacity and pace without compromising on the security which is facilitated by the main chain layer1. This proves to be beneficial for the users as it helps users to understand the types of solutions available for their respective issues.\n\nVitalik engaged in a debate which was about \u201cL2s\u201d encompassing both rollups and validiums. The users need to understand the different security features where rollups are \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d solutions that bundle or \u201croll up\u201d transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain. This methodology enables high security, as the L1 blockchain instantly secures them.\n\nComparatively, rollups are a bit expensive due to their ability to its data on-chain which provides higher security on the other hand Validiums provide an inexpensive alternate option to rollups. The founder of Ethereum Vitalik has suggested that terminology should reflect these distinctions without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he suggests terms like \u201cstrong L2\u201d for rollups and \u201clight L2\u201d for validiums to enable users to guide their choices better.\n\nVitalik also cleared that the whole process of L2 solution is not only about security as both rollups and Validiums have \u201cintermediate space\u201d."

        "title": "Could MetaMask's Secret Project Shake Up Ethereum? - CoinDesk",
        "content": "There is a secret project going on over at Meta mask and it could shake up how Ethereum works. I'm intrigued. So joining us right now is deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols. Sam Kessler. Sam. So nice to see you. Good to see you. It's been a little while. I miss the hash days. We all do. We all know R I pr IP. All right. Tell us, tell us about the secret project, what's going on. Yeah. So Meta Mask, which is um one of the biggest crypto wallets, the biggest crypto wallet by far on Ethereum um is um putting together this secret project where they're changing the way that the app works. So conventionally, um when you're using a crypto wallet and when you're transacting on a Blockchain, more generally, what you do is you submit a transaction. So you want to trade some tokens, you'll go to unis swap, a decentralized exchange or sushi swap, another decentralized exchange and you go to one of these, you choose the, the specific specific exchange you want to go to. You say, hey, I want to sell these tokens. You find the specific price that you're gonna sell those tokens at you don't want to go above this price below this price. You specify a bunch of different things, bless you. You specify a bunch of different things. And then um what you end up doing is um submitting a a transaction um that you know, does what you specified, but now me mask and a bunch of other programs that are kind of following. Um Well, that metamask is more than one following are are switching to this idea of intents where instead of having to submit a specific transaction, what you do is you submit a general intent. The idea like, hey, I just want to sell a token, um get me the best price and then meta mask behind the scenes through some mechanism that they're putting together and that's what this news is about. Um you know, figures out how to route your transaction to get or, you know, route a series of transactions to accomplish what you want to accomplish. Um I know that's like kind of a AAA jumble of a lot of different things, but hopefully that at a high level um explains it. So what does that mean for the end user folks who are interacting with meta mask? Yeah, so I mean, the two big benefits are first user experience. Now, you don't have to, you know, suss out exactly what the best venue is for a given action on a Blockchain. There's a million different ways to do different things and you know, you don't have to do any of that leg work anymore. Um Meta mask can handle it for you in the future as this stuff rolls out. And the second thing for end users. Um So it's user experience, but the second thing is just price um fees. Um you know, all of those things that people are typically mindful of. Meta ma can take care of, they can help you avoid mev bots maximal extractable value. You can look that up. But the idea of people in the Ethereum ecosystem front running your transactions, they'll help you avoid that. They'll help you get the cheapest gas, they'll help you, you know, find the best route for your transaction. Maybe you should arbitrage a bunch of weird ways to get a better price for your tokens. I mean, this is like one example, but there's a bunch of ways where uh uh ostensibly this should help you out, but there's also some risks. I want to talk about the risks in just a second. But how did you find out about this secret? And why is it a secret? Yeah, it's a good question. And the second part, the why is it a secret plays into some of the risk question frankly. But um you know, I found out about it from just Ethereum ecosystem. People who will not be named won't be named. Don't want to be named um who kind of heard about this and for various reasons, you know, just wanted to give me, you know, bits and pieces of it. And then when I went to Meta Mask and I was like, hey, I know Xy and Z um first they were like, hey, no, um you know, please don't, you know, publish this until such and such a time. But, you know, they knew we were going to publish something anyway. And so they were willing to get on the record and the story that we published yesterday and specify the, the some of the um you know, more specific details of the, of the project. And so that's why we know with 100% certainty. Um This is what's happening. OK. Now, before we take this home, tell us about the risks, the challenges that are presented with this. Yeah. So, you know, um I, I've kind of like given the explanation of this at a high level, it's kind of like a black box, right where it's like now I put it in an intent and I say, hey, I want to sell my tokens. I want to do this, I want to do this and then meta mask handles it. What does that mean? What that means is they rely on third parties, a marketplace of third parties who auction against one another through some, you know, complicated mechanism in order to get the privilege to carry your transaction or your series of transactions or figure out what your transactions should be from point A to point B. Now again, that, that's confusing. It sounds like this kind of like a morphus thing. But what really matters at a fundamental level here is that meta mask, the biggest crypto wallet on a theory and behind, you know, so like the Lions share of transactions in decentralized finance on the, the biggest decentralized finance ecosystem is now making a fundamental change to who and how it routes your transactions where now it and at least this mechanism it's routed. Um It's creating has a ton of leeway over how it decides to funnel different transactions from users. So say, and, and I'm not saying this at all, but say meta mass for whatever reason behind the scenes decided that it was going to somehow configure its mechanism to route all trades to unis swap. There's reasons why it would do the opposite of that. But you know, say it decided to do that, that would be a big problem for users. Now, meta mask in this story explains a lot of ways why um you know how this is not centralized, this is not vertical integration, it prevents specifically against the case that I've mentioned right there. But this is something that we'll be taking a look at and the mechanism that they're putting together to assure neutrality is going to be closely scrutinized to avoid the sort of outcomes of, you know, centralized control, monopoly and also regulatory capture the idea of regulators looking at something like this and being like, huh there's a company that in some form or fashion has a big chokehold over where transactions flow in this really valuable ecosystem. Um Yeah, I it's complicated but really important as you're explaining the risks. I know two different stories, two totally different things. I was just thinking about ledger recover and the backlash that they received for that product because of uh centralization. Do you think that once this is launched, we could see similar backlash just from, from users? Yeah. So the Ledger recover case, which is a crypto wallet. Um There was like a bug or not even a bug but a capability in their software where, you know, there was a sort of backdoor situation people could go in and essentially by hacking people in a certain way, get their tokens in a manner that Ledger said it specifically prevented against. This is a little bit different because the code for this theoretically is all going to be public in in um in a way that should prevent against such a surprise. Um But it is similar um from the standpoint that the marketing of this product is going to need to match the way that it works in actual, you know, day to day, you know execution. So if meta s says we're creating this incredibly neutral, credibly, neutral and incredibly neutral platform where anybody can join in it's permissionless. Anybody can carry user, any third party can join to compete with one another to carry user transactions in a way that is, you know, neutral and balanced and so on and so forth. But then we realize that hey, some of these third parties are way more powerful and therefore accrue in the way that this system is constructed. A lot of the power. Again, we're being vague here because we don't have all the details and this market hasn't shaken out yet. But if that ends up happening, that is out of alignment with the marketing. And so people are gonna want to take a close look at it and might be concerned. Sam, thank you very much for joining me and explaining that story to us. I'm sure you'll be watching closely on next development. So we'll have you back on to tell us about the latest updates. Yeah, good to see you, Jen. Thanks for having me. That was deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols at Coindesk. Sam Kessler."

        "content": "David Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, recently addressed concerns surrounding the missing genesis block on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), citing a similar case with Ethereum.\n\nSchwartz made the latest disclosures while responding to questions raised by community member MetaMan regarding the XRP Ledger\u2019s seemingly unusual start at block 32,569.\n\nMetaMan voiced skepticism and emphasized the importance of transparency for XRP holders. \u201cTell me, is there any blockchain that lost its genesis block,\u201d the XRP community member asked Schwartz on X.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSimilar Case with Ethereum\n\nIn response, the Ripple CTO drew a parallel to Ethereum\u2019s genesis block ambiguity. He highlighted that Ethereum, despite having transactions predating its official start, does not publicly document them.\n\nThe choice of what to consider the genesis block is arbitrary. For example, ETH has lots of transactions before its genesis block that are not in the publicly available record. 1/2 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nSchwartz pointed to a specific 2,622 ETH transaction on Aug. 3, 2016, moving over $6 million. He questioned, \u201cWhere did that ETH come from? Where\u2019s the transaction that explains it?\u201d\n\nAn XRP community member referenced transactions showing 40,000 ETH transferred during Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSchwartz acknowledged this but stressed that the source of those 40,000 ETH was not publicly visible due to deliberate decisions in defining Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\nSchwartz argued that such decisions, including XRPL\u2019s genesis block starting at ledger 32,569, were arbitrary. He contended that similar choices, like those made in Ethereum\u2019s case, aimed to obscure fund sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 40,000 ETH tokens \u201cjust showed up out of thin air,\u201d the Ripple CTO emphasized that, from the public blockchain perspective, they did. However, he stressed that Ethereum insiders possess more information on the matter.\n\nNonetheless, in the case of the XRP Ledger, being one of the original architects, Schwartz confirmed that the genesis ledger of the chain had no transactions. However, according to him, the first 32,570 ledgers contained 534 transactions, which are presumably lost now.\n\nBefore Schwartz\u2019s response to MetaMan\u2019s initial question, Mayukha Vadari, a Senior Software Developer at RippleX, explained the reason behind the loss of genesis block.\n\nShe noted that the initial set of XRPL servers experienced uniform configuration and simultaneous memory depletion, leading to ledger issues.\n\nSustained Concerns Around the XRPL Genesis Block\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the genesis block\u2019s peculiarity has been questioned. Critics, in the past, raised concerns about the distribution scheme of XRP, suggesting hidden motives behind the absence of earlier ledgers. Schwartz has consistently debunked such notions.\n\nAn XRP holder asked a similar question in the Bitcoin Stack Exchange forum in October 2013, a year after the XRP Ledger went live. He sought to know the reason behind starting the network at block 32,570.\n\nSchwartz responded to this query, noting that a bug affected Ripple servers, causing ledger headers to be lost.\n\nDespite efforts to collect data, insufficient information hindered ledger reconstruction. He reassured the user that the missing ledgers (1 \u2013 32,570) held no significance for average XRPL users.\n\nMoreover, in a post from December 2019, Schwartz provided a broader historical perspective, emphasizing the XRP Ledger\u2019s evolution since its live debut in June 2012. According to him, after the ledger went live, it featured bugs which they had to fix.\n\nSchwartz confirmed that, as a result of some of these bugs and reset exercises carried out on the network, data from the XRP Ledger\u2019s first week, stored in ledgers 1 \u2013 32,570, was lost. However, he assured that they did not recreate the initial 100 billion XRP supply upon the resets."

Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart, posted to X.\n\nCoinbase and the SEC faceoff in-court\n\n\n\nNews of the SEC\u2019s delay comes amidst its legal fight against Coinbase, with the federal agency alleging the exchange sold unregistered securities on its platform.\n\nHowever, Coinbase pushed back against the SEC\u2019s allegations during Wednesday\u2019s hearing, arguing that none of the platform\u2019s tokens count as securities at all.\n\nJudge Katherine Polk Failla, who is overseeing the case, refused to make a decision on it as of Wednesday afternoon, citing concerns of regulatory encroachment.\n\n\u201cI worry that I would be doing exactly the thing you\u2019re alleging the Commission is doing here, which is to take power that I don\u2019t have to stop activity I shouldn\u2019t be stopping,\u201d Judge Failla told a lawyer for Coinbase.\n\nUnder pressure\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC is facing criticism for its extensive enforcement approach in regards to cryptocurrency.\n\nIn an amicus curiae brief in support of Coinbase, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) claimed the federal agency\u2019s desire to classify cryptocurrencies as securities \u201cexceeds the SEC\u2019s authority, encroaches on Congress\u2019s lawmaking, and contravenes the separation of powers.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his own disdain at the SEC\u2019s leadership during a conversation at the World Economic Forum.\n\n\u201cI do think the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is a political liability in the United States,\u201d Garlinghouse told CNBC\u2019s Arjun Kharpal. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s not acting in the interests of the citizenry, he\u2019s not acting in the interests of the long-term growth of the economy, and I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear what asset class the SEC will designate Ethereum as."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRecently the market sentiment on the two coins SOL and ETH has seen many price fluctuations since the start of the year. Now that Glassnode co-founders, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, known as Negentropic, have projected Solana (SOL) to potentially outperform Ethereum (ETH) by 500% the market is curious to know if this will be true.\n\nExperts Waged Debate on Solana Price\n\nThis optimistic outlook follows discussions with macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal, who highlighted Solana\u2019s magical momentum in the SOL/ETH chart in terms of risk-adjusted returns on the Crypto Banter Show.\n\nThey both have a similar outlook on SOL\u2019s upward movement in the chart is an indicator that it will surpass ETH soon. Looking at the key trajectories of Solana, the analysts are also betting $10000 investment in SOL as they expect it will rise in the coming weeks while answering the interviewer.\n\nTo give a more concrete example, the co-founders of Glassnode look at the current SOL/ETH ratio, which is 0.14. Based on their prediction, this ratio is expected to go up a lot, possibly hitting 0.76. If this happens, it means that Solana will do four to five times better than Ethereum as the crypto market continues to rise during this bullish phase.\n\nBut he has similar hopes with ETH too. He notes that this potential outperformance could continue until the cryptocurrency market reaches its peak. Importantly, the analysis doesn\u2019t envision a solo surge for Solana; instead, it anticipates a significant bullish rally for Ethereum as well.\n\nCurrent Market Sentiments\n\nWhile Solana is currently trading at $98.55 with a 4.7% weekly decline, and Ethereum at $2,516 with a similar decline, the Glassnode founders express confidence in Solana\u2019s continued success. Despite recent fluctuations, Solana has exhibited a robust one-year trajectory, growing by 340.43% from $20. Ethereum, in comparison, has a one-year growth of 59%, rising from $1,515.\n\nSince both coins are rising on distinct parameters, the market is still divided. Only time will tell who wins."

        "content": "Ethereum Completes Dencun Network Upgrade on Goerli Testnet\n\nEthereum has successfully implemented the Dencun network upgrade on the Goerli testnet.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Ethereum\u2019s developers have deployed the previously announced Dencun upgrade, succeeding the Shapella upgrade (also known as the Shanghai upgrade) in 2023.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade prominently features the implementation of EIP-4844, known as proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding, as the main component, allows for the temporary storage of off-chain data, easing the storage demands on Ethereum nodes.\n\nThis development is anticipated to significantly lower transaction fees for decentralized applications (dApps), particularly benefiting Layer 2 rollup chains.\n\nDencun is Goerli Testnet\u2019s Last Upgrade\n\nAccording to the Ethereum core team, the Dencun upgrade will be the last upgrade for the Goerli testnet, Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet, before the developers stop supporting it.\n\n\u201cEither three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators,\u201d said the team. \u201cAnyone relying on Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cApplication and tooling developers are encouraged to use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other EVM functionality,\u201d said the team. \u201cStakers and infrastructure providers concerned with protocol-level testing are encouraged to use the newly launched Holesky testnet.\u201d\n\nThe upgrade is named \u201cDencun\u201d as it combines the naming conventions for Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layer upgrades. Consensus layer upgrades are typically named after stars, while execution layer upgrades follow the names of Devcon city locations.\n\n\u201cDencun\u201d merges \u201cDeneb,\u201d a first-magnitude star in the Cygnus constellation, with \u201cCancun,\u201d the host city for Devcon 3, reflecting the collaborative nature of the upgrade across both layers of Ethereum\u2019s architecture.\n\nThe upgrade was livestreamed by the developers. If no major issues are found following the Goerli implementation, it will be deployed to Sepolia and Holesky.\n\nButerin Says Validiums are Not Genuine Rollup Solutions\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently sparked a debate about the classification of layer 2 scaling solutions, particularly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s validiums. Buterin asserts that validiums, which use off-chain data storage, should not be considered true rollup solutions.\n\nValidiums, while offering scalability through zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain transactions, face challenges in terms of data availability, differing from ZK-rollups which post full transaction data on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe discussion in the Ethereum community regarding the evolution and categorization of its scaling solutions has become increasingly relevant as Ethereum now moves forward with its Dencun upgrade."

        "content": "Over the past 30 days, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a notable surge of 17%, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded a surge of 2.5% over the same period.\n\nThis comes as the initial excitement surrounding the approval of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to have waned, with BTC witnessing a 5% drop in the past seven days.\n\nInterestingly, according to crypto trading firm QCP Capital, following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the focus has shifted to the potential launch of an ETH spot ETF, which could be one of the factors for Ethereum outperforming BTC.\n\nEthereum Gains Ground Against BTC\n\nAccording to QCP Capital, the total volumes transacted across all 11 ETFs in the past week have reached $9.8 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) alone accounted for $4.6 billion.\n\nSince converting from a Trust to an ETF, GBTC has experienced outflows of $1.17 billion. This is \u201cunsurprising\u201d for the firm, considering GBTC had been trading at a discount since 2020, offering investors an opportunity to exit at par value.\n\nBTC initially surged to a high of $49,100 upon ETF approval but has since seen a decline, consolidating above the $40,000 support level. Volumes have slowed since the initial launch, and market attention is focused on GBTC outflows.\n\nMeanwhile, ETHBTC, which traded below 0.05, has seen an upward trend to 0.06. According to QCP Capital, Ethereum is anticipated to continue to outperform Bitcoin in the medium term as the narrative shifts towards potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\n\nBitcoin Forward Contract Yields Decrease\n\nFollowing the launch of the BTC spot ETF, BTC forward contracts have experienced a greater decline compared to ETH forward contracts. BTC 1-month forward fell from 32% annualized to 9% (-23%), while ETH 1-month forward decreased from 28% to 12% (-16%).\n\nAccording to QCP Capital, despite declining yields, ETH forwards still appear attractive, offering 11-13% annualized returns. Additionally, selling ETH 1-month 2200 Puts presents a viable option with yields above 21% annually, and it could be a suitable level to buy in the event of a dip upon potential ETH spot ETF approvals.\n\nUltimately, the crypto firm suggests that the forthcoming BTC halving in mid-April and the potential approval of ETH Spot ETFs from May are anticipated to be significant events for the crypto market.\n\nIn the interim, market movements may also be influenced by macroeconomic events. The January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, as well as the February Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports, are being closely monitored for insights.\n\nThe pace of the balance sheet runoff, discussed briefly in December 2023, is expected to provide further clarity during the January FOMC meeting. The market consensus suggests a slowdown in quantitative tightening (QT), but the timing and extent of these changes remain uncertain.\n\nOverall, the potential launch of an Ethereum spot ETF has sparked speculation and could have a transformative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. As the market grapples with changing dynamics, attention remains on key events, such as the BTC halving and potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Etherscan data reveals that the wallet address \"0xfb2\" executed a series of purchases, acquiring a whopping 606.36 billion SHIB within the past 24 hours, amounting to a substantial $5.80 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sudden buying spree catapults the mysterious investor to the top of the Shiba Inu token buyers' list for the given period. As a result, the whale's cryptocurrency portfolio now boasts an impressive 733.21 billion SHIB, valued at $6.97 million. Remarkably, Shiba Inu has swiftly risen to become the second-largest holding in the investor's portfolio, trailing only behind Ethereum.\n\nEthereum, with a substantial holding of 52,618 ETH, retains its position as the leading asset in the whale's portfolio, valued at an impressive $132.92 million. The cumulative value of the investor's entire portfolio currently stands at an estimated $182.76 million.\n\nDelving into on-chain data, it is evident that the initial foray into Shiba Inu by this Ethereum whale occurred two years ago. At that time, the unidentified individual procured nearly 200 billion SHIB, setting the stage for what is now a significant and attention-grabbing resurgence in their Shiba Inu holdings.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, the sudden interest of major players like this mysterious ETH whale in the Shiba Inu token adds an element of intrigue, leaving SHIB enthusiasts and traders eager to see how the situation unfolds in the days to come."

Therefore, before someone claims that the Goerli hard fork failed and Deneb is delayed, we should allow time for a proper analysis,\u201d Terence, an Ethereum engineer, stated.\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) is not significantly affected by the Dencun update. According to the screenshot below, ETH is currently trading at $2,545, up 0.83% over the previous day.\n\nBy the end of January, the team intends to deploy the Dencun update on the Sepolia testnet.

        "content": "One of the most controversial expectations in the cryptocurrency market is known as \u201cthe flippening.\u201d The flippening is the forecast of Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization, which is both praised and criticized.\n\nInterestingly, QCP Capital foresees Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in price appreciation in 2024, according to a January 17 market update. The trading firm specializing in digital assets and cryptocurrencies shared the report on a Telegram group with 11,000 subscribers.\n\nDespite not mentioning a \u2018flippening,\u2019 QCP Capital mentioned the positive results of a previous report on ETH paired against BTC. Moreover, the trading firm forecasts Ethereum to continue outperforming the leading cryptocurrency due to ETH spot ETF expectations.\n\n\u201cWhen ETHBTC traded below 0.05, we mentioned that the cross looked attractive from both a technical perspective and with ETH as a catchup play. ETHBTC has since traded higher to 0.06. We expect ETH to continue outperforming BTC over the medium term as the narrative rotates to potential ETH Spot ETF approvals.\u201d \u2014 QCP Capital Broadcast\n\nQCP Market update \u2013 17 Jan 24. Source: CQP Capital Broadcast\n\nCould an Ethereum spot ETF approval cause the flippening?\n\nThe narrative started boiling after an interview with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), on CNBC. In particular, Fink explained that BlackRock sees value in tokenization and believes the SEC will approve an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 150% since January 2, 2023, until its current price of $42,418. Rumors and expectations on a Bitcoin spot ETF approval gained traction during this period while the market was pricing it.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA similar price action on Ethereum would put the leading Web3, and dominating DeFi blockchain, at above $6,235. This would drive ETH capitalization to around $750 billion, still nearly $100 billion lower than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap. Therefore, would not be enough for a \u2018flippening,\u2019 even if BTC kept its $830 billion value by press time.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNevertheless, QCP Capital is still optimistic about a medium-term outperformance for the second-largest cryptocurrency over the largest one. According to the trading firm analysis, ETH could offer a better risk-reward for 2024\u2019s investors.\n\nStill, investing in this market is unpredictable, and having caution is crucial while deploying capital for price speculation.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The widely-anticipated Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum network is live on the Goerli testnet. However, the upgrade is experiencing some issues.\n\nAccording to a livestream on YouTube, Dencun was launched on Goerli at 6:32 UTC on Wednesday, but the chain appears to have split as it failed to finalize when expected.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Goes Live\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is Ethereum\u2019s biggest since the Shapella upgrade in April 2023. While Shapella enabled the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH) on the network, the former is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs on layer 2 (L2) networks. They are significant steps in Ethereum\u2019s transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after the Merge.\n\nDencun is expected to enhance Ethereum L2 rollup efficiency through a mechanism called proto-danksharding or ephemeral blobs (EIP-4844). The approach introduces temporary storage space for higher transactional throughput by allowing access to off-chain data to reduce storage demands. This process will slash L2 transaction costs by 10x or more as analysts believe high costs hamper the growth of the protocols.\n\nThe upgrade was initially slated for October 2023 but moved to late Q1 or early Q2 2024. It will be implemented in three phases, with Goerli\u2019s deployment being the first. The subsequent implementation will be on the Sepolia testnet on January 31 and then the Holesky testnet on February 7 before the final release on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nFinality Issues\n\nDencun\u2019s deployment on Goerli failed to reach a consensus and finality. Developers believe this may be because of low participation, roughly 80%, and validators being offline. Pseudonymous X user Terence explained that validators could be offline due to operators not upgrading a piece of software or the presence of a bug.\n\nDue to Goerli having a \u201chighly\u201d diverse set of validators, it could take a while before the issue becomes clear. Regardless, developers intend to conduct a proper non-finality test over the next few hours or days.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I will not base my assessment of Goerli Deneb\u2019s readiness on the immediate finality results. It will take time to accurately evaluate the status. Therefore, before someone claims that the Goerli hard fork failed and Deneb is delayed, we should allow time for a proper analysis,\u201d Terence stated."

        "content": "Currently, there are plans to deploy Dencun on the Sepolia testnet on January 31, and then on the Holesky testnet on February 7.\n\nAmong the many things that the crypto industry has to look forward to, there is the Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum network. Touted as a way for Ethereum to increase its data processing abilities and scalability, it is largely seen as a game-changer by those in the industry. Now, we are a step closer to this upgrade as Ethereum developers have deployed a testnet of Dencun on the Goerli test network. This took place on January 17, 2024, at 6:32 UTC.\n\nDencun Coming Soon\n\nWhile the Dencun testnet launch was eventually deployed, it did meet some challenges along the way. Most notably, it wasn\u2019t able to reach finality and this is credited with validators not completing software upgrades and this led to low participation rates.\n\n\u201cAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it\u2019s likely to take a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!\u201d Tim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, said.\n\nFinality, in terms of blockchains, refers to the mechanism that makes transactions irreversible. It is one of the most important parts of any blockchain network and has to be gotten right. The developer teams have confirmed that they are looking into these issues and should resolve them in the next few days.\n\nAt the same time, this is one of the purposes of testnet deployment- to make sure that any potential kinks are worked out before the final launch date. And this isn\u2019t the last deployment we will see before Dencun fully goes live.\n\nCurrently, there are plans to deploy Dencun on the Sepolia testnet on January 31, 2024, and then on the Holesky testnet on February 7. All these will lead up to the final Dencun deployment by the end of the first quarter of the year.\n\nWhy the Dencun Upgrade Is Vital\n\nOne thing that the blockchain community knows very well at this point is that a single network upgrade can change the very trajectory of an ecosystem. Ethereum itself experienced this with its last major upgrade that saw the network moving from a proof-of-work consensus to a proof-of-stake one. This move saw the network\u2019s energy use cut by over 95% and made Ethereum much better for the environment.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is also on track to be impactful by introducing proto-danksharding. This is a mechanism that will increase Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data handling and make it cheaper to use. As such, Ethereum will become more scalable once it is implemented and naturally, there has been a lot of anticipation for this. While this testnet launch has seen its hiccups, we can hope that they are sorted and the final Dencun upgrade goes off without a hitch."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the last year, thousands of developers have abandoned crypto\u2014but in several other key metrics, the ecosystem looks as robust as ever.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new report out Wednesday from crypto venture firm Electric Capital, which says that the number of active, open-source crypto developers has dropped a sharp 24% from the end of 2022 through 2023. As of last month, just over 22,000 developers currently operate in the industry, across myriad blockchains.\n\nThe dropoff was all but certainly thanks to the crypto winter that set in after the $60 billion collapse of cryptocurrencies UST and LUNA in May 2022, and the subsequent collapse of FTX in November of that year, which cratered crypto\u2019s reputation and industry growth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s a silver lining in that trend: The overwhelming majority of developers who left the industry in 2023 appear to have been fairweather builders, who had hardly spent any prior time in crypto.\n\nOver 52% of new crypto developers\u2014with one year or less of experience\u2014left the space by December 2023. In contrast, developers with one to two years of experience only dipped by a marginal 1%, and developers with over two years of experience actually grew as a category by the year\u2019s end, up a resounding 33%.\n\nThe geographic diversity of those developers has also grown over time. In 2018, United States-based builders represented 40% of all crypto developers worldwide, according to Electric Capital. By 2023, that figure shrunk to 26%. Meanwhile, the share of crypto developers from non-Western countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has comparably ballooned in the same period, from 18% to 36%.\n\nEurope continues to produce the most crypto developers in the world\u201434% last year.\n\nWhat sorts of blockchains these developers work on has also developed promisingly over the years. As of 2023, 34% of all builders work on multiple chains, a marked increase that speaks to the scope and depth of development across the increasingly multi-chain crypto ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, unsurprisingly, continues to attract the majority of crypto developers; over 8,000 coders consistently contributed to the blockchain last year. But Ethereum scaling network Polygon and rival Solana have also seen a marked uptick in numbers of new contributors.\n\nSlightly below those three networks in new developer activity, but impressive in their own right, are BNB Chain, Cosmos, Arbitrum, Polkadot, NEAR, Avalanche, Optimism, and Internet Computer\u2014each of which attracted between 2,000 and 4,000 new developers in 2023.\n\nThe fastest growing new crypto ecosystem of 2023 was Base: Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 network, which took the industry by storm after its launch in August. 999 unique developers contributed to Base over the last three months of 2023.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, despite its status as the original blockchain, is no longer the coolest kid at the party. Where once the network could brag, way back in 2015, that it attracted more new developers than any other blockchain\u201417%\u2014by last year that figure shrunk to a measly 2%.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is now maintained by a core group of just over 1,000 developers. But some of those builders may be busier than others.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital\u2019s report, less than 10% of Bitcoin developers work on Ordinals, digital assets inscribed in tiny denominations of BTC that are akin to NFTs. Despite that relatively low figure, Ordinals, which were a runaway phenomenon in 2023, have routinely accounted for over 50% of transaction traffic on the Bitcoin network.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

This update comes in the wake of the general market push to wriggle out of the current bearish situation that is playing out in the ecosystem thus far.\n\nCardano\u2019s market price and capitalization are down by 2.56% in the past 24 hours to $0.5177 and $18,322,533,885, respectively, as the trading volume has dropped by 15.56% to $285,507,234. Ethereum has a milder growth rate, having slipped by 0.85% in 24 hours to $2,516.35.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Cardano Advantage\n\nOver the past few months, Cardano has always recorded massive inflows from market whales. Despite the dampened sentiments overall, the IntoTheBlock data showed that a total of $13 billion in large transactions is settled on the Cardano blockchain on average daily. By definition, the platform considers ADA transactions above $100,000 in fiat value as \u2018Large.\u2019\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nBy comparison, Ethereum only records a total of $5 billion in whale transactions on average per week. At the moment, the bearish sentiment in the market has subtly tilted the whale transaction trend in Ethereum\u2019s favor per rate of change over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe data from IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum\u2019s large transactions have soared by 6.74% to $4.16 in 24 hours. Cardano on the other hand maintains a larger volume pegged at $11.24 billion but with an 8.74% slump within the same period.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWill Cardano Flip Ethereum?\n\nJust the way there is a fight for dominance in the memecoin world, so also is there a foundational tussle amongst Layer-1 networks to outshine one another. One of the biggest ambitions of Cardano community members is to see the protocol flip Ethereum in market capitalization in the long term.\n\nThis is a distant dream, considering Cardano\u2019s $18.3 billion market cap is just a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s $302,549,903,898 capitalization. For the foreseeable future, Cardano may need to relish its areas of strength, including whale volume and developer activity."

Cryptoquant\u2019s exchange reserves data provides a real time snapshot of the total units of a cryptocurrency that is currently held in wallets hosted on exchanges and trading platforms.\n\nAs of Jan. 11, investors held a total of 14.8 million ETH coins in exchange-hosted wallets. Interestingly, the figure is now down to 14.7 million ETH as of Jan 18.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Exchange Reserves vs. Price | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs depicted above, investors have now shifted 133,271 ETH coins from exchange wallets into long-term storage in the last 7 days. exchange-hosted wallets into long-term, dispelling concerns of potential widespread profit-taking at the $2,500 milestone.\n\nTypically, a drop in exchange reserves is often bullish for a cryptocurrency\u2019s short-term price action. It essentially means that investors are moving their coins from trading wallets into long-term storage.\n\nPreference for long-term storage during a price rally signals investor confidence and intent to hold out for more gains. With the exchange supply in decline over the past week, it\u2019s unsurprising that ETH price has consolidated above the $2,500 support since Jan 15.\n\nImportantly, the historical trends show that periods of rapid decline in ETH exchange reserves have often been followed by a price uptrend. If the pattern recurs, Ethereum holders can anticipate an upswing toward $2,600 in the days ahead.\n\nWhile exchange supply drops, ETH is attracting more demand\n\nSecondly, as Ethereum exchange supply declined over the past week, the total number of active ETH sell orders has now dropped far below market demand. This current Ethereum spot market dynamics is another vital on-chain indicator pointing towards ETH stretching its lead over BTC in the days ahead.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s aggregate exchange order books chart captures a cryptocurrency\u2019s total active buy/sell orders across multiple exchanges.\n\nCurrently, there are active purchase orders for 357,490 ETH listed across 20 crypto exchanges including Binance and Coinbase. Meanwhile, the bears have put sell orders for only 250,750 ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Aggregate exchange order books | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe chart above depicts that the market supply for Ethereum has fallen short of demand by 106,740 ETH. Intuitively, when the demand for an asset outpaces supply by such a large margin, it signals a dominant bullish sentiment within the ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the prolonged decline in ETH exchange reserves has now led to excess demand in the spot markets. These two vital short-term indicators could accelerate Ethereum price rally and further widen its lead over BTC.\n\nETH Price Forecast: $2,700 Could be the next target\n\nBased on the 2 critical on-chain data points analyzed above, Ethereum price looks set to remain in upward trajectory towards $2,700 in the short-term.\n\nBut for the bulls to validate this bullish forecast, they must first scale the $44,000 resistance level. IntoTheBlock In/Out of the money data, which groups current Ethereum holders by their historical entry prices. also affirms this forecast.\n\nIt shows that 1.78 million existing investors had acquired 1.84 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,612. If those holders look to sell as ETH approaches their break-even point, it could inadvertently trigger a reversal.\n\nBut if the bulls can smash through the sell-wall at $2,612, the $2,700 area could be the next target for Ethereum price.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the downside if things take a bearish turn, the bulls can rely on the historically significant buy wall at $2,400 for initial support.\n\nThe chart above shows that 853,920 addresses acquired 4.5 million ETH at the average price of $2,414. If those holders make frantic efforts to cover their positions, Ethereum price can stage an instant rebound from that territory.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Proto-danksharking will allow the network to scale and more cheaply handle over 100,000 transactions per second, according to developers, via Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.\n\nEthereum layer-2 solutions, like Optimism, are where most of Ethereum\u2019s activity takes place, a report by market intelligence firm Messari said in October.\n\nProto-danksharking is the most talked about feature of the upgrade because Ethereum has long struggled with scalability; compared to other blockchains, it is slow and costly to do things on Ethereum, such as minting NFTs or sending ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDevelopers working on the new feature hope to solve this. \u201cDanksharding is how Ethereum becomes a truly scalable blockchain, but there are several protocol upgrades required to get there. Proto-Danksharding is an intermediate step along the way,\u201d developers explain on the Ethereum website.\n\n\u201cBoth aim to make transactions on Layer 2 as cheap as possible for users and should scale Ethereum to >100,000 transactions per second.\u201d\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be an Ethereum hard fork\u2014when validators on the network have to upgrade to the newest software in order to keep participating. There have been various similar upgrades to the network in the past, most recently 2022\u2019s \u201cmerge\u201d, when the network moved from proof of work to proof of stake."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade has gone live on the Goerli testnet.\n\nDespite preparations, the testnet launch has not gone as many hoped.\n\nThe timeline for when issues would be resolved remains unclear.\n\nThe long-anticipated Ethereum Dencun upgrade is now coming into full view. In line with timelines released in December 2023, developers have launched the upgrade on the Goerli testnet, the soon-to-be-phased-out Ethereum sandbox for staking infrastructure and other protocol-level changes.\n\nDespite months of preparation, however, the upgrade\u2019s first testnet outing faced several roadblocks amid underwhelming participation.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Off To a Rough Start\n\nThe Dencun upgrade was released on the Goerli testnet around 6:32 UTC on January 17, as promised by developers in December 2023. The upgrade, however, did not get off to the start many would have hoped.\n\nEthereum Foundation protocol support member Tim Beiko reported that the upgrade failed to achieve finality, likely culminating in a chain split. Finality is assurance that crypto transactions cannot be reversed once executed.\n\nDevelopers linked the challenges faced in the upgrade\u2019s first outing to low network participation as more validators failed to upgrade their clients. Ethereum developer Terence Tsao pointed out the lack of sufficient participation ahead of the Goerli fork, predicting that finality could be lost as participation was estimated to be around 80%. For context, finality will likely be lost with 10% of validators offline.\n\nBack to the Drawing Board?\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Beiko has noted that developers are investigating the hurdles faced during the Goerli fork. However, it remains to be seen when these issues will be resolved.\n\n\u201cClient teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates!,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDevelopers still have to test out the Dencun upgrade on two more testnets, Sepolia and Holesky, before they can launch it on the mainnet. While the initial timeline had indicated that a Q1 launch of the upgrade was likely, it remains to be seen how recent snafus will affect these projections.\n\nThe most anticipated feature of the upgrade is EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which promises to make fees cheaper on Ethereum Layer 2 chains by reducing the cost of storing data on the network with blobs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDevelopers had allocated a minimum of a week to test Dencun on each testnet.\n\nThe upgrade had gone smoothly during the shadow forks of Goerli.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be the last upgrade Goerli will see before it is phased out in favor of Holesky.\n\nThe full danksharding vision tipped to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns is still years away.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRecent hiccups during the Goerli fork may adversely affect Dencun mainnet launch projections.\n\nRead this for more on the Dencun upgrade:\n\nETH Devs Set Tentative Dencun Launch Dates for Key Testnets\n\n\n\nLearn more about Ethereum\u2019s growing dominance against Bitcoin:\n\nStrong Ethereum Fundamentals Fuel 20%+ Surge Against Bitcoin"

        "content": "As we navigate through 2024, Ethereum (ETH) remains a key player in the digital currency market. This article aims to shed light on how to purchase ETH using a card this year. We\u2019ll explore what Ethereum is and its potential as an investment in 2024. The guide will then walk you through the practical steps of buying Ethereum, making it a valuable resource for both new and experienced investors in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum, commonly referred to as ETH, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system. It is known for its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is highly versatile and has been at the forefront of the blockchain revolution, offering a platform where developers can build and deploy various decentralized applications beyond just simple transactions.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nEthereum has been a hot topic in the investment world, and many wonder if it\u2019s a smart choice to invest in it in 2024. Let\u2019s break this down in simple terms.\n\nFirst, think of Ethereum like a big digital building where lots of different apps and projects are made. Since more people are getting into digital currencies and apps, Ethereum might become even more popular. This is good news for its value.\n\nRemember how Ethereum made big changes in 2022 to use way less energy? That\u2019s just one example of how it keeps getting better.

This doesn\u2019t always make its price go up right away, but it shows that it\u2019s really important and useful.\n\nSo, is Ethereum a good investment in 2024? While it\u2019s true that prices can go up and down a lot, Ethereum looks like it could do well in the long run. It\u2019s got a solid place in the digital world, it\u2019s always improving, and a lot of people and projects depend on it.\n\nWhere to Buy ETH in 2024?\n\nBitget stands out in the crowded field of cryptocurrency brokers for several compelling reasons.

        "content": "In the dynamic cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) maintains stability around $42,500, despite the 1.20% downturn in the overall crypto market, now valued at $1.68 trillion. This steadiness is partly due to the excitement around the newly approved Bitcoin spot ETF, which has brought a fresh wave of investor interest, although Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced only marginal changes.\n\nEthereum, another major player in the crypto space, mirrors this trend, with analysts closely watching its performance. Amidst this, Jamie Dimon\u2019s recent remarks labeling Bitcoin as having \u2018no value\u2019 have sparked debates and short-term uncertainty in the market.\n\n15 min TF$BTC consolidating above 42k support in a tight 42k-43k range, strong move coming soon \u2026. pic.twitter.com/P4UNOG7RK4 \u2014 Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) January 18, 2024\n\nYet, the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, as the crypto community awaits the potential impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated interest rate cut in March and the approaching Bitcoin halving in April 2024.\n\nThese events are expected to play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price predictions in the near term.\n\nJamie Dimon\u2019s Criticism Sparks Short-Term Uncertainty in Bitcoin Market\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently stirred the Bitcoin market by comparing the cryptocurrency to a \u201cPet Rock\u201d during a CNBC interview. His critique has sparked some uncertainty in the crypto sphere, especially for newcomers.\n\nDimon acknowledged the promise of blockchain technology but differentiated it from Bitcoin, which he views more skeptically. While JPMorgan actively engages in tokenization with its JPM Coin, Dimon advises caution regarding Bitcoin, despite the bank\u2019s role in BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\n$JPM CEO Jamie Dimon still says he sees no value in $BTC, and doesn't want to talk about it. Here's a quote from Dimon today in an interview:\n\n\"Please stop talking about this $#!*\"\n\n\u201cI hope this is the last time I\u2019m talking about [Bitcoin], so help me god,\u201d \u2014 Market Rebellion (@MarketRebels) January 17, 2024\n\nDimon\u2019s skepticism extends to Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and its potential links to illicit activities. He also expressed concern about a possible recession, pointing to factors like dwindling pandemic savings and geopolitical tensions. His comments have the potential to influence short-term market sentiment, possibly leading to fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum (ETH), another major cryptocurrency, isn\u2019t directly mentioned by Dimon, but its market often mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s trends. As a platform known for its practical applications in blockchain technology, Ethereum may be less affected by Dimon\u2019s specific criticisms of Bitcoin, but it\u2019s still subject to the broader market sentiments and economic factors impacting the crypto industry."

        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL).\n\nThe analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 237,000 followers on the social media platform X that Solana might soar more than 39% from its current value.\n\n\u201cI think SOL might be gearing up for a leg up to $140-plus. This downtrend has been tested too many times now for me to consider bearish and can\u2019t ignore the clear three-wave move down from the highs looking corrective. Looks like the past two-week range has been a base, send it.\u201d\n\nBluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that attempts to predict future price action that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset goes through a five-wave rise followed by an ABC corrective move before starting its next leg up.\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that Solana will ignite a new five-wave surge after completing an ABC correction.\n\nSolana is trading for $100.62 at time of writing, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) is set up for a breakout after a period of price consolidation around the $0.33 level.\n\n\u201cVery healthy consolidation range beneath prior ATH (all-time high) on WIF.

        "content": "P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum (ETH) developer, has lauded EIP-1559 and its ETH burning mechanism as \u201cthe great equalizer.\u201d Taking to X on January 16, Szil\u00e1gyi admired EIP-1559\u2019s ability to \u201clevel the playing field between validators and regular users.\u201d\n\nDeveloper: EIP-1559 Is A \u201cGreat Equalizer\u201d\n\nSince the implementation of EIP-1559, Ethereum adjusted how users bid gas fees, introducing the \u201cbase fee,\u201d which was burned or sent to an irretrievable wallet. So far, data from Ultrasound Money shows that over 3.9 million ETH have been destroyed.\n\nIn the last week alone, the Ethereum network automatically sent more than 21,100 ETH out of circulation, \u201cburning\u201d ETH\u2019s supply.\n\nSpecifically, Szil\u00e1gyi mentioned the advantage regular users have with EIP-1559. Through this implementation, validators (previously miners before Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake blockchain) no longer have the privilege of arbitrarily adjusting gas limits and transaction fees.\n\nEarlier, that leeway created what the developer described as an \u201cimbalance,\u201d which made it tough for \u201cregular users to compete.\u201d However, following this implementation, everyone must adhere regardless of status as a validator, founder, or user.\n\nWith EIP-1559, the \u201cbase fee\u201d adjustment is set at the protocol level. It is this base fee that the network burns, gradually making ETH deflationary, reading from the number of coins taken out of circulation since EIP-1559 went live in early August 2021. Even so, a sender can \u201ctip\u201d the validator, incentivizing them to prioritize validating a transaction.\n\nStability And Predictability Achieved, Ethereum Upsides Capped At $3,000\n\nSzil\u00e1gyi\u2019s comments reflect a growing consensus among Ethereum supporters regarding the positive impact of EIP-1559. Though a big percentage of EIP-1559 is fixated on the price impact of the proposal, there is more that it achieves.\n\nMost importantly, from a user experience perspective, it is now easier for senders to predict how much they will pay for a transaction. This is crucial, especially when the network is congested. Additionally, though the Ethereum gas fee remains relatively high, EIP-1559, though considered a \u201cbad idea\u201d by Szil\u00e1gyi, has stabilized the network.\n\nETH burning is attributed to reducing inflation in Ethereum, a network whose total supply is not capped like Bitcoin. Over the long term, prices might benefit from this proposal. However, prices are bullish in the short to medium term. Still, upsides are limited to around the $3,000 psychological round number.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator \u2014 the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nThe 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.\n\nTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.\n\nEthereum keeps on struggling\n\nEthereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high \u2014 an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.\n\nThe ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.\n\nIf Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.\n\nSolana wants another round\n\nThe battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.\n\nThe technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nDespite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.\n\nLooking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.\n\nConversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss."

        "content": "In a recent revelation, David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Ripple and one of the key architects behind XRP Ledger, disclosed an intriguing insight into the genesis block secrets of Ethereum (ETH). The discussion unfolded when a curious crypto enthusiast probed Schwartz about the peculiar genesis block numbering in XRPL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question pointed to a historical mishap that resulted in the loss of ledgers 1 through 32,569 in XRPL, creating an unconventional void in recorded data. Schwartz responded by asserting that the choice of considering a particular block as the genesis block is arbitrary, drawing parallels to Ethereum's own genesis block.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Schwartz shared a link to an August 2016 transaction moving a substantial 2,622.1 ETH, currently valued at $6.68 million. He questioned the origins of the ETH and emphasized that Ethereum's genesis block, much like XRPL's, had undisclosed transactions that determined the allocation of funds.\n\nSomeone decided to define the genesis of the ETH chain to be before that transaction but after the transaction that explained why 40,000 ETH went to that address. So you cannot publicly see the source of that ETH unless you know where to look for it. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nAs the discussion unfolded, Schwartz delved into the intricacies of Ethereum's genesis block, revealing that certain transactions were deliberately excluded from the public blockchain. He suggested that decisions were made to obscure the source of funds, showcasing the arbitrary nature of defining a blockchain's genesis.\n\nWhat's with XRP?\n\nThe conversation further explored the absence of transactions in XRPL's genesis block, leaving 534 transactions in the first 32,570 ledgers presumed lost. Notably, the breakdown of XRP distribution at ledger 32,570 revealed specific ownership percentages, with individuals like Jed McCaleb, Chris Larssen, Arthur Britto and entities like OpenCoin holding precise and publicly known shares.\n\nEffectively, XRPL has a genesis block with balances in it just as ETH does, but a big difference is that the ownership of all but about .01% of those balances for XRPL is precisely and publicly known:\n\nJed: 9 %\n\nChris: 9 %\n\nArthur: 2 %\n\nOpenCoin: 79.99 %\n\nBeta testers and developers:\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nThis revelation not only sheds light on the mysterious genesis blocks of both XRPL and Ethereum but also raises questions about the transparency and decision-making processes within blockchain ecosystems."

        "content": "In Ethereum, six major buying points have emerged since \u201923, with the second largest liquidation of long positions occurring on January 12, coinciding with the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs and triggering a significant price correction.\n\nBased on a recent examination, the liquidation of long positions has set a tail low at $2,450. A breach of this price followed by a swift recovery might suggest an imminent rebound. In contrast, an inability to recover may suggest a change in sentiment and a rise in downside volatility.\n\nCritical Inflection Point for Ethereum\n\nAccording to the latest analysis by CryptoQuant, large futures liquidations often result in longer-tailed candlesticks. This is indicative of substantial buying activity from market whales simultaneously with the liquidation of long positions.\n\nThe low point of these candlesticks becomes crucial, representing extreme market sentiment, as per the findings of analyst \u2018MAC_D.\u2019\n\nThe aftermath of such extreme situations becomes important in determining the direction of the price trend. A cascade of liquidated long positions causing downside volatility can prompt a sharp shift in market sentiment. On the contrary, if the price holds and rebounds, it reassures investors and prompts a return to buying activity.\n\nExamining specific instances in September-October, November, and December \u201923 reveals a pattern. In each case, substantial long positions were liquidated, and breaking the tail lows momentarily resulted in a market bounce-back.\n\n\u201cThe tail low of the recent mass long position liquidation is $2.45k, so if we break that price and recover right away, we\u2019re likely to see a bounce, and if we break it, we\u2019re likely to see a shift in sentiment and downside volatility.\u201d\n\nEthereum Bulls Prevail\n\nEthereum was currently trading above $2,515 after a slight decline of 1.19% over the past day.\n\nThe supply of the leading altcoin on crypto exchanges has been on a steady decline and was approaching an all-time low, suggesting an optimistic outlook by investors.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance over Bitcoin also saw a significant uptick, with the metric recording a surge of 22.4% over the past week alone."

On the other hand, said that these are secondary market trades in which no contract is in place so they can't be securities. The judge's decision is expected to come in the coming weeks. But no timeline has been set. Former president and front runner in the Republican leadership race. Donald Trump has promised to ban central bank digital currencies during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Let's take a listen. As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency. I didn't know. You know, so I'm very well, New Hampshire, very smart people, very uh very current, you know what they're doing. Such a currency would give a federal government, our federal government, the absolute control over your money. CBD CS are digital versions or tokenized versions of cash that are issued by central banks. They may or may not use Blockchain as an underlying technology. And Solana based meme coin dog with hat makes a comeback. The coin based on this super cute pup in a beanie rose as much as 50% to 48 cents in the past 24 hours before retreating. This as trad five firm Franklin Templeton alluded to the W hat meme in an ex post late on Wednesday. Spurring sentiment. Other meme tokens like used car pop, catt and K pop also spiked as much as 50% according to data from tracking service, bird eye. Part of the recent appeal could have stemmed from Solana Mobile's announcement of a new phone in the works which is expected to ship in 2025. Ok. Today marks one week since the spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States started trading. You'll remember that 11 asset managers got the green light by the SEC to offer the product in what's been a 10 year long journey. Now, one of the pivotal moments leading up to this big event was Grayscale winning a court battle against the SEC last year. Greyscale, Ceo Michael Sonnenschein sat down with coin desk chief content officer Michael Casey and Crypto Councils for Innovation, Ceo Sheila Warren for the Money reimagined podcast. Let's take a listen to a little bit of their conversation when we got that phone call last week that the SEC was ready to approve our 19 4 and declare S3 effective. Um We were ready it, when did it come in? Uh I think it was in the afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um And you know, like, you know, in typical gray scale fashion, there was no panic, everyone was calm, everyone knew their role and, and, oh, no, seriously. And we had more rooms and tabletop sessions and readiness exercises. We were ready to go. Um And so it's, it's really just been a fantastic experience. And then we actually were fortunate enough to spend the first day of trading for G BT C on NYCR A on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. So, um you know, just such a historic building, seeing the trading volume, it completely surpassed our expectations, right, that first day of trading G BT C did $2.3 billion of notional trading volume that day. It was the ninth most actively traded ETF in the United States. Yeah. So it just, you know, blew past our expectations. So this is people moving there. How did it work? Is converting from their existing G BT Cotc to the, the new ETF? Well, so actually wouldn't say conversion is the optimal word. It was actually really just an uplifting. So if you were a G BT C shareholder, that Wednesday, the last day was on OTC markets, you just simply woke up Thursday and your shares were instead traded on the New York Stock Exchange, right? Companies, you know, move exchanges all the time. So investors had no action required of them. There were no consequences um of the uplifting other than the fact that it was now traded on NYCR A and obviously as an ETF, um I mean, obviously big numbers being thrown around some people talking about $100 billion market that emerged in this. But you know, it, it, it's been, you know, we had that big run up of the price came down. Uh It's fair to say that it hasn't sort of taken off uh broadly for, for the broader market necessarily. Um How do you read that? I mean, what is the, what, what, how do you expect sort of the non crypto crowd to come into this and as it as it goes forward? So I think there's two things I'd say there. Um Number one, I feel like it's too early to make any definitive judgment call on kind of what the earliest days of this are going to look like. Um We had two days of trading, we then had a holiday weekend, um just had our third day of trading, right? And so some people have already kind of called for, well, Bitcoin pricing. This was already priced in right after gray scale won its lawsuit earlier last summer, investor optimism took off. That's why you saw this material rise in Bitcoin prices over the back part of 2023. I'm not ready to quite say that it was kind of priced in, but that's certainly a narrative that's out there. Um The other thing I would say in is kind of the opportunity that we're so excited about is now investors have choice, right? And one of the areas that I think is gonna be most interesting for Bitcoin ETF S in the US is really the advised wealth market. So over $30 trillion of advised wealth in the US. So the fact that those types of assets, those types of allocations need product need um things on the at their brokerage firms that are approved that they can actually put their clients into this now opens up the opportunity to that entire audience. And that's one of the areas of growth that we're really excited about. A lot of focus on the fees. Fee, war of sorts. I mean, some of the other ETF S have come in at very low fees, like 0.2%. Uh, um, you guys are like, 0.02 right. So, you guys are, some of the ETF issuers are just way better, right? Yeah. But you're, you know, I mean, you've come down a bit but you're still at 1.5 right? So, I mean, how do you expect to win that battle? So when I think about the landscape of spot one ETF that we have now leading up to this event, we made a commitment to investors. We'd lower fees and we delivered on that commitment, we lower them by 25% and we are at 100 and 50 bips. Um G BT C coming to market had $28 billion of assets. Uh It's trading hundreds of millions of dollars a day now. It's trading billions of dollars a day, very diversified base of investors, tight spreads. Um And I think as a result of that, you know, the market um in the value that G BT C brings, I think is really reflected in its price. I think when you look at some of the other new issuers, um you know, they don't have assets, they don't have um a base of investors, they don't have a track record of doing this for 10 years, the way that we do kind of developing ourselves as a crypto specialist. Um And so there's an incentive for them to get assets and their products start getting those track records and that's great. It's like a liquidity premium, a history premium. I think that's, you know, some of the things you could certainly look at fee is definitely going to be an area that investors focus on, but is not the only area when you, there's lots of products on the market for similar exposures fee is one choice liquidity track record. Who's the firm behind it? There's a lot of factors that go into it. And um I think what we're also seeing is for a lot of the firms, they're, they're issuing these products with such low fees or with fee waivers that um I'm not sure how much it actually signals their commitment to Bitcoin or to these products. Um But rather they see the investor demand, they see how large G BT C has become and what the market reception has been to it. And perhaps, you know, this allows them to, you know, deepen relationships with clients by having something new and something differentiated that they've never been able to start conversations with clients with before Grace Scale has a case. It's making for its superiority over these other ones that is not necessarily just about fees. You've got this history, you've got this liquidity. But again, you've got, you know, if you're going to attract that retail audience, you know, name like blackrock, you know, a name like Fidelity, how are you gonna compete with it? It's education. Um It is definitely education even just being a Davos this week, I'm, you know, talking to some of the most educated, you know, people in the world that have had tons of experience personally and professionally, there is still not only such a knowledge gap. Um And I think gray scale as a crypto specialist asset manager can actually be that bridge that actually can fill that gap for the investment community. And that's really what we've always led with, to us that is going to be the driving force behind getting investors comfortable. They're not gonna action investment into things they don't inherently understand or aren't inherently comfortable with. So it has to start with education, this is not just another gold product or another S and P 500 instrument, this is an entirely new asset class. And I think we've never seen a better investor reception, not to mention an environment where investors are eager to learn about it. You know, a couple of weeks ago, our team did an initial wave with the Harris poll and actually looked at voters that are intending to vote in the 2024 presidential election. And some of the outcomes of that are actually two important outcomes. One was that over half of those that intend to vote. Um Believe that crypto Bitcoin is basically the future of, of finance, right um which is pretty staggering number and even more staggering is that four and five of the people surveyed that are intending to vote again, believe that as they kind of look ahead into this next presidential election. Um and thinking about their candidates being informed on these new technologies that crypto more than anything needs sound regulatory frameworks around it. You can catch more from this interview along with thoughts and commentary from super thinkers, Michael Casey and Sheila Warren on the Money Reimagined podcast. That's this coming Wednesday. You can find it on the Coin Desk podcast network. I will always take an opportunity to self promote. Go check that out. It's on every podcast platform at the top of the show we heard about the spot. Bitcoin et F's early success from Grayscale Ceo Michael Sonnenschein. But these next metrics indicate the price correction might not be over. Let's take a look at the chart of the day. The chart of the day is presented by crypto.com, the leading crypto platform trusted by over 80 million users worldwide. Bitcoin prices fell as low as 15% after the much anticipated ETF listing last week with outflows from Grays skills. Bitcoin Trust products said to be contributing to the downward pressure data provided by blackrock fidelity and bit wise shows that volume cumulatively crossed the $500 million mark earlier in the week with Coinbase, the custodian for several of the providers seeing record high OTC desk transfer volumes. Despite this crypto quant, further downside risks remain in a note shared with coin desk. The on chain analysis firm said quote, several on chain metrics and indicators still suggest the price correction may not be over or at least that a new rally is still not on the cards and quote. They added that short term traders and large Bitcoin holders are still doing significant selling in a context of risk off attitude. Let's move now from Bitcoin to the Ethereum ecosystem. There is a secret project going on over at meta mask and it could shake up how Ethereum works. I'm intrigued. So joining us right now is Deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols. Sam Kessler. Sam. So nice to see you. Good to see you. It's been a little while I miss the hash days. We all do. We all know R I pr IP. All right. Tell us, tell us about the secret project, what's going on. Yeah. So Meta mask, which is um one of the biggest crypto wallets. The biggest crypto wallet by far on Ethereum um is um putting together this secret project where they're changing the way that the app works. So conventionally, um when you're using a crypto wallet and when you're transacting on a Blockchain, more generally, what you do is you submit a transaction. So you want to trade some tokens, you'll go to unis swap a decentralized exchange or sushi swap another decentralized exchange and you go to one of these, you choose the, the specific specific exchange you want to go to. You say, hey, I wanna sell these tokens. You find the specific price that you're gonna sell those tokens at. You don't want to go above this price below this price. You specify a bunch of different things, bless you. You specify a bunch of different things and then um what you end up doing is um submitting a a transaction um that you know, does what you specified. But now me mask and a bunch of other programs that are kind of following. Um Well, that metamask is more than one following are are switching to this idea of intents where instead of having to submit a specific transaction, what you do is you submit a general intent, the idea like, hey, I just want to sell a token um get me the best price and then meta mask behind the scenes through some mechanism that they're putting together. And that's what this news is about. Um you know, figures out how to route your transaction to get or you know, route a series of transactions to accomplish what you want to accomplish. Um I know that's like kind of a AAA jumble of a lot of different things, but hopefully that at a high level um explains it. So what does that mean for the end user folks who are interacting with meta mask? Yeah, so I mean, the two big benefits are first user experience. Now, you don't have to, you know, suss out exactly what the best venue is for a given action on a Blockchain. There's a million different ways to do different things and, you know, you don't have to do any of that leg work anymore. Um Meta mask can handle it for you in the future as this stuff rolls out. And the second thing for end users, um, So it's user experience. But the second thing is just price um fees. Um You know, all of those things that people are typically mindful of meta mask can take care of. They can help you avoid Mev bots maximal extractable value, you can look that up. But the idea of people in the Ethereum ecosystem front running your transactions, they'll help you avoid that. They'll help you get the cheapest gas, they'll help you, you know, find the best route for your transaction. Maybe you should arbitrage a bunch of weird ways to get a better price for your tokens. I mean, this is like one example, but there's a bunch of ways where uh uh ostensibly this should help you out, but there's also some risks. I want to talk about the risks in just a second. But how did you find out about this secret? And why is it a secret? Yeah, it's a good question. And the second part, the why is it a secret plays into some of the risk question frankly. But, um, you know, I found out about it from just Ethereum ecosystem. People who will not be named won't be named. Don't want to be named, um who kind of heard about this and for various reasons, you know, just wanted to give me, you know, bits and pieces of it. And then when I went to Meta Mask and I was like, hey, I know Xy and Z um first they were like, hey, no, um you know, please don't, you know, publish this until such and such a time. But, you know, they knew we were going to publish something anyway. And so they were willing to get on the record and the story that we published yesterday and specify the, the, some of the um you know, more specific details of the, of the project. And so that's why we know with 100% certainty. Um This is what's happening. OK. Now, before we take this home, tell us about the risks, the challenges that are presented with this. Yeah. So, you know, um I, I've kind of like given the explanation of this at a high level, it's kind of like a black box, right where it's like, now I put it in an intent and I say, hey, I want to sell my tokens. I want to do this, I want to do this and then Meta Mask handles it. What does that mean? What that means is they rely on third parties, a marketplace of third parties who auction against one another through some, you know, complicated mechanism in order to get the privilege to carry your transaction or your series of transactions or figure out what your transactions should be from point A to point B. Now again, that, that's confusing. It sounds like this kind of like a morphus thing. But what really matters at a fundamental level here is that meta mask, the biggest crypto wallet on the thee and behind you know, so like the line share of transactions in decentralized finance on the the biggest decentralized finance ecosystem is now making a fundamental change to who and how it routes your transactions where now it and at least this mechanism it's routed. Um It's creating has a ton of leeway over how it decides to funnel different transactions from users. So say, and, and I'm not saying this at all but say meta mass for whatever reason behind the scenes decided that it was going to somehow configure its mechanism to route all trades to unis swap. There's reasons why it would do the opposite of that, but you know, say it decided to do that. That would be a big problem for users. Now, meta mass in this story explains a lot of ways why um you know how this is not centralized, this is not vertical integration, it prevents specifically against the case that I've mentioned right there. But this is something that we'll be taking a look at and the mechanism that they're putting together to assure neutrality is going to be closely scrutinized to avoid the sort of outcomes of, you know, centralized control, monopoly and also regulatory capture the idea of regulators looking at something like this and being like, huh there's a company that in some form or fashion has a big chokehold over where transactions flow in this really valuable ecosystem. Um Yeah, I it's complicated but really important as you're explaining the risks. I know two different stories, two totally different things. I was just thinking about Ledger Recover and the backlash that they received for that product because of uh centralization. Do you think that once this is launched, we could see similar backlash just from, from users. Yeah, so the Ledger recover case, which is a crypto wallet. Um there was like a bug or not even a bug but a capability in their software where, you know, there's a sort of backdoor situation people could go in and essentially by hacking people in a certain way, get their tokens in a manner that Ledger said it specifically prevented against. This is a little bit different because the code for this theoretically is all going to be public in in um in a way that should prevent against such a surprise. Um But it is similar um from the standpoint that the marketing of this product is going to need to match the way that it works in actual, you know, day to day, you know, execution. So if meta s says we're creating this incredibly neutral, credibly, neutral and incredibly neutral platform where anybody can join in, it's permissionless, anybody can carry user, any third party can join to compete with one another to carry user transactions in a way that is, you know, neutral and balanced and so on and so forth. But then we realize that hey, some of these third parties are way more powerful and therefore accrue in the way that this system is constructed. A lot of the power. Again, we're being vague here because we don't have all the details and this market hasn't shaken out yet. But if that ends up happening, that is out of alignment with the marketing. And so people are gonna want to take a close look at it and might be concerned. Sam, thank you very much for joining me and explaining that story to us. I'm sure you'll be watching closely on next development. So we'll have you back on to tell us about the latest updates. Yeah, good to see you, Jen. Thanks for having me that was deputy managing editor of tech and Protocols, Sam Kessler. And if you just love the way he explained that article, check out the protocol podcast, that's on the coin Desk podcast network everywhere. The podcasts are available. That is a wrap for first mover this morning. Thank you so much for watching and thank you to our guests. If you like what you're seeing, go back and watch previous first mover episodes. We won't fault you for that. We'll see you tomorrow. Same time, same place."
