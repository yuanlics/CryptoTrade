We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe quest for dominance between Ethereum (ETH) and its most obvious rival, Cardano (ADA), is taking a whole new shape, with new metrics defining how well each protocol is faring. A sneak peek into both protocols' decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, per data gleaned from DeFiLlama, especially as it relates to the Total Value Locked (TVL) metric, shows that Cardano has a clear lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the DeFiLlama data, there is a significant plunge in the total ETH tokens locked within its smart contract; however, the reverse is the case as concerns ADA. For a better perspective, while the total ETH locked in its DeFi protocol as far back as January was pegged at 18.28 million units, the current figure has now plummeted back to 13.33 million units at the time of writing.\n\nCardano, on the other hand, saw the total TVL in its DeFi smart contracts pegged at 198.65 million ADA tokens as of Jan. 1, and today, this ADA lockup has grown to 571.92 million, an indication of consistent growth and embrace of new applications making their way onto the Cardano blockchain.\n\nMore upsides for Cardano\n\nWhile the individual token lockup in DeFi smart contracts is in favor of Cardano, the protocol still lags behind in other significant areas. These areas include the exact market capitalization of Ethereum when compared to that of Cardano. This wide disparity in token market capitalization also compliments the overall dollar value of TVL on both protocols.\n\nHowever, amid all these, Cardano has a significant upside that investors can watch out for. The effort to consistently upgrade the Cardano network remains a very promising push that can attract more Web3.0 developers who can build dApps to rival those on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt may take some time, but overall, Cardano has the chance to become as big, or even bigger, than Ethereum."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDecentralized ID platform Worldcoin releases its native token.\n\nProtocol provides digital passports tied to a physical iris scan.\n\nWeb3 divided over pros and cons.\n\nDecentralized identity platform Worldcoin launched its ecosystem token, grabbing headlines as opinions remain divided about the potential positives and negatives of the blockchain-based digital passport project.\n\nMajor cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and Crypto.com announced support for the WLD token upon its launch. The token is tied to the Worldcoin ecosystem, which users receive upon creation of a privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID).\n\nIn order to create a World ID, users have to have their biometric data captured. This is taken in the form of an iris scan carried out by Worldcoin\u2019s proprietary, high-tech optic Orb hardware.\n\nThe long term vision of the project would see Orb\u2019s being built and distributed around the world, allowing users to create their own World ID\u2019s which can be used for a myriad of use cases.\n\nWorld ID\u2019s act as a \u201cproof of personhood\u201d that make use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) to protect the underlying data, including biometric, KYC and AML data. WorldCoin will also enable users to \u201creserve\u201d their respective IDs with a phone number in select countries, with an iris scan required to complete the process and receive a World ID.\n\nThe concept of proof of personhood is not new to the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed at length in a thought-provoking essay centered around the use case.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nUnpacking Worldcoin\n\nButerin delves into the technicalities of proof of personhood blockchain protocols and the potential benefits and pitfalls of projects that are blazing a trail for the use case.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder highlighted two key focal points of proof of personhood protocols, namely proving human identity and potential being a means to distribute universal basic income in the future.\n\n\u201cWorldcoin is unique in that it relies on highly sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user\u2019s iris using a piece of specialized hardware called \u201cthe Orb\u201d.\u201d\n\nAs Buterin explains, WorldCoin Orbs are set to be distributed around the world to allow users to create their respective digital ID. He also highlighted privacy and security concerns around the Orb, design issues regarding its native token and some ethical concerns around whether biometrics \u201care a good ideal at all\u201d.\n\nThe protocol was originally deployed on Polygon in its beta phase, while the current version runs on the Ethereum mainnet using a scalable batching architecture through layer 2 protocol Optimism. The project has over two millions users enrolled.\n\nSocioeconomic Considerations\n\nAs Buterin continues to explain, Worldcoin aims to produce Orbs to be widely distributed around the world in public spaces that will make digital IDs accessible for anyone to get.\n\nButeriun crediting Worldcoin for committing to decentralizing through a variety of technical aspects , including its architecture as a layer on Ethereum using Optimism\u2019s scaling SDK. Worldcoin also makes use of privacy centric zero-knowledge proofs, which allow a person to prove ownership of a credential without revealing any of the underlying data.\n\nNevertheless, efforts to ensure decentralization do not detract from criticisms against the protocol which Buterin highlighted, including privacy and security concerns around the Orb, issues with its WLD tokens and ethical issues relating to company decisions.\n\nButerin opined that broader considerations around biometrics and proof of personhood projects are \u201ca good idea at all\u201d:\n\n\u201cRisks include unavoidable privacy leaks, further erosion of people\u2019s ability to navigate the internet anonymously, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the potential impossibility of being secure at the same time as being decentralized.\u201d\n\nFour Major Risks\n\nButerin\u2019s essay outlines four major risks that come to mind when considering Worldcoin\u2019s approach to proof of personhood.\n\nThe first is privacy and whether the registry that contains human iris scans may reveal information:\n\n\u201cAt the very least, if someone else scans your iris, they can check it against the database to determine whether or not you have a World ID. Potentially, iris scans might reveal more information.\u201d\n\nWorld IDs are not easily accessible and may not be reliably accessible around the world unless the hardware is mass produced and easily accessible.\n\nButerin highlights centralization as another risk, considering that the Orb is a hardware device which leaves users with no way of verifying that it was built properly and doesn\u2019t have \u201cbackdoors\u201d:\n\n\u201cHence, even if the software layer is perfect and fully decentralized, the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake human identities.\u201d\n\nSecurity is the fourth risk, with Buterin pointing to scenarios like mobile device hacks or social engineering schemes:\n\n\u201cUsers could be coerced into scanning their irises while showing a public key that belongs to someone else, and there is the possibility of 3D-printing \u201cfake people\u201d that can pass the iris scan and get World IDs.\u201d\n\nButerin also joked that despite the \u201cdystopian vibez\u201d of staring into an Orb to scan your eyeballs, the specialized hardware systems \u201ccan do quite a decent job of protecting privacy\u201d. However this comes with the caveat of the centralization required to produce and manage the hardware.\n\nSecurity Issues of Proof of Personhood\n\nAs a gauge of where the proof of personhood ecosystem is at, Buterin also provides a handful of concerns that affect projects of similar designs.\n\nThis included the possibility of 3D-printed fake people, where a user could use AI to generate photographs or even 3D prints of fake people that are convincing enough to get accepted by the Orb software.\n\n\u201cIf even one group does this, they can generate an unlimited number of identities.\u201d\n\nButerin also suggested the possibility of selling IDs, where one user provides someone else\u2019s public key instead of their own when registering, giving that person control of their registered ID, in exchange for money.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be happening already. In addition to selling, there\u2019s also the possibility of renting IDs to use for a short time in one application.\u201d\n\nPhone hacking is another risk, giving an attacker full control of a users World ID. Lastly Butering also says there\u2019s a risk of a government forcing citizens to get verified while showing a QR code belonging to the government.\n\n\u201cIn this way, a malicious government could gain access to millions of IDs. In a biometric system, this could even be done covertly: governments could use obfuscated Orbs to extract World IDs from everyone entering their country at the passport control booth.\u201d\n\nWhile some of these dystopian risks sound far-fetched, Buterin believes they are points that have to be carefully considered as the drive to create proof of personhood protocols that are beneficial, secure and privacy-preserving"

        "title": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS): The Decentralized Domain System - Crypto Times",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, navigating through complex hexadecimal wallet addresses has been a major challenge for users. However, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) emerges as a beacon of convenience and user-friendliness, revolutionizing the way we interact with blockchain networks. ENS is a decentralized naming system that simplifies cumbersome wallet addresses, replacing them with human-readable names.\n\nIn addition to exploring the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), readers can also discover the convenience of Ethereum Code, an automated bot that streamlines various processes within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized domain naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to the traditional Domain Name System (DNS) used for mapping website domain names to IP addresses, ENS provides the same functionality but for blockchain addresses. It enables users to associate human-readable names with complex Ethereum addresses, making transactions and interactions more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nHow Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Works\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) operates through a well-defined architecture consisting of three main components: the Registrar, Resolver, and Registry. These components work together to provide a seamless and efficient naming system on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAt the core of ENS is the Registrar, which acts as the gateway for registering names. Users can go through a simple and straightforward process to secure a name of their choice on the ENS. This involves submitting a bid for the desired name, followed by a reveal phase to prevent front-running. Once the name is successfully registered, the user becomes the owner and gains control over it.\n\nThe Resolver component plays a crucial role in the ENS ecosystem by mapping names to the corresponding Ethereum addresses. When someone wants to interact with an ENS name, the Resolver provides the necessary information to locate the associated address. This allows users to send transactions, interact with smart contracts, and access decentralized applications using user-friendly names rather than complex hexadecimal addresses.\n\nLastly, the Registry serves as the decentralized database that stores and maintains the records of registered names and their ownership. It ensures the integrity and security of the ENS by recording ownership information on the Ethereum blockchain, making it tamper-proof and transparent.\n\nTo register a name on the ENS, users need to interact with the Registrar, following the specified process and meeting the required criteria. Once registered, users can manage their ENS names, making updates or transferring ownership as needed. The ENS management interface provides a user-friendly platform to perform these actions, empowering individuals and organizations to have full control over their digital identities on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service simplifies the user experience by enabling human-readable and memorable names for blockchain addresses. It eliminates the need to rely on long and complicated hexadecimal addresses, making it easier for individuals and businesses to interact with the Ethereum network.\n\nBenefits and Use Cases of Ethereum Name Service\n\nOne of the primary benefits of ENS is its ability to simplify the user experience. Traditionally, interacting with blockchain addresses required users to deal with long and complex hexadecimal addresses, which can be prone to human error. With ENS, users can associate their addresses with human-readable and memorable domain names. This makes it much easier to share addresses, receive payments, and engage in transactions, especially for non-technical users.\n\nENS also provides a solution for secure and immutable identity management on the blockchain. By linking verified identities to ENS names, users can establish trust and authenticity in their online interactions. This is particularly valuable in situations where identity verification is crucial, such as in financial transactions, decentralized marketplaces, or social platforms.\n\nDecentralized websites are another compelling use case for ENS. With ENS, domain names can point to decentralized content hosted on platforms like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or other decentralized storage networks. This enables the creation of censorship-resistant websites, where content cannot be easily removed or tampered with by centralized authorities. ENS-powered decentralized websites foster a more open and inclusive internet, giving individuals the power to publish and share information without relying on centralized entities.\n\nFurthermore, ENS plays a vital role in enabling decentralized applications (DApps) to deliver a more user-friendly experience. By integrating ENS, DApps can offer simplified interfaces that allow users to interact with the blockchain using familiar domain names instead of complex addresses. This not only enhances usability but also reduces the barrier to entry for non-technical users who may be intimidated by the technical intricacies of blockchain transactions.\n\nAdditionally, ENS has practical applications in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi protocols often rely on Ethereum addresses for various operations, such as lending, borrowing, or yield farming. By utilizing ENS, DeFi platforms can enhance the user experience by enabling users to interact with their services using human-readable names. This simplifies the process of interacting with DeFi protocols, potentially attracting a broader audience and driving further adoption in the DeFi space.\n\nUnderstanding ENS Integration: How to Use Ethereum Name Service?\n\nIntegrating ENS into your Ethereum wallet or application is a straightforward process. Most modern wallets and dApps are ENS-compatible by default, allowing users to leverage the service effortlessly. Here\u2019s a simple guide to get started:\n\nSet Up an Ethereum Wallet: If you don\u2019t already have an Ethereum wallet, choose a reputable one that supports ENS integration. MetaMask and MyEtherWallet are popular choices. Check ENS Availability: Before registering a domain, check if the desired name is available using ENS domain search tools. Register Your Domain: Once you find an available domain, use the ENS Registrar to register it under your Ethereum address. Link Your Address: After registration, associate your Ethereum address with the newly acquired domain. Update ENS Records: If you ever need to change your Ethereum address or transfer ownership, update the ENS records accordingly.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith its user-friendly approach, ENS simplifies address interactions, provides secure and immutable identities, facilitates decentralized websites, and enhances the usability of decentralized applications. As blockchain adoption continues to grow, ENS plays a vital role in bridging the gap between complex blockchain addresses and mainstream usability, making Ethereum more accessible and inclusive for all."

        "content": "Ethereum price bulls are doing everything within their power to mitigate losses after support at $1,900 caved in. The token powering the largest smart contracts token has in the last 24 hours, remained barely unchanged, and trading at $1,870. Despite the narrowing trading range, a $6.5 billion trading volume has been posted, with the market cap dropping slightly to $224 billion.\n\nEthereum Price Charts Show 18% Bullish Move\n\nEthereum price has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) on the daily chart, with the possibility of an 18% breakout to $2,372.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs a technical chart pattern, the inverse H&S presents a bullish signal to Ethereum traders. It\u2019s born via three troughs, with the middle one deepest \u2013 the \u2018head\u2019, and the \u2018shoulders\u2019 flanking shallower.\n\nA bullish move would be confirmed when this \u2018neckline\u2019 breaks, investors often anticipate an upward price swing, equal to the height of the pattern extrapolated above the breakout point, $2,000 in Ethereum\u2019s case.\n\nThe path with the least resistance is to the downside for now with greater risk lurking in the shadows if bulls lose the support provided by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red).\n\nWhile those declines may bounce off the 100-day EMA (in blue), the current technical picture suggests that overhead pressure may soar in the coming days.\n\nNotably, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) adds credence to the bearish outlook after sending a sell signal. Ethereum\u2019s drop below $1,900 might have accentuated the call to sell, which manifested with the MACD line in blue crossing below the signal line in red.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the bearish outlook as it slides below the midline.\n\nWith that in mind, shorts traders would be looking forward to lower profit targets, for instance, the 200-day EMA (purple) and the primary support between $1,630 and $1,700.\n\nEthereum Staking Stays Attractive\n\nInvestors have in recent months wholesomely embraced Ethereum staking both on the primary blockchain and liquid staking platforms. According to on-chain insights shared by Token Terminal Intern on Twitter, \u201ctotal assets through liquid staking protocols are hitting ATH, despite Ethereum bringing -61% from the top.\u201d\n\nEthereum staking eventually started to gain traction after the initial withdrawals which followed the Shapella Upgrade. Liquid staking platforms like Lido continue their dominance following the protocol upgrade that allowed investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time since the transition to the PoS consensus algorithm.\n\nThe increase in staking implies that investors are optimistic about the future of Ethereum and are willing to HODL the token with the hope of a rally back to the ATH. Staking also contributes to reducing Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, which has been shrinking significantly. If demand for Ethereum rises, we are likely to witness a breakout above $30,000."

        "content": "Total ETH staked reached its highest value.\n\nAs positive sentiment waned, the price stagnated within a narrow range.\n\nEthereum [ETH] validators have deposited $52.3 billion into the ETH2.0 contract to secure the L1 Chain. According to on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock, this marked the highest value it has ever reached.\n\nThe Ethereum network is currently being secured by a staggering $52.3 billion, marking the highest value it has ever reached. As the value of #ETH used to secure the network increases, it becomes increasingly challenging for any potential attacker to gain control over it. pic.twitter.com/2hrzj82Nk0 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 21, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nTo become a validator on the Ethereum PoS network, validators are required to deposit 32 ETH into the ETH 2.0 contract. As of the time of writing, the total number of ETH deposited into this contract by validators running the network was 27.05 million ETH, per data from Glassnode.\n\nThis represented 22.46% of the leading altcoin\u2019s total supply.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nValidators on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network are grouped into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator on the committee is responsible for producing blocks for each 12-second slot.\n\nA validator on the committee is charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot. However, if the assigned validator is unavailable, it will result in a missed block.\n\nData from Glassnode revealed that on 13 April (a day after the Shanghai Upgrade), the missed block count touched an all-time high of 658. This could be because some validators intentionally took their nodes offline during the upgrade and a day after it for a proper assessment of the impact of the upgrade.\n\nThis, however, soon declined. With only 42 missed blocks recorded on 21 July, missed block count has dropped by 94% since the 13 April high.\n\nFurther, to ensure that the PoS network runs optimally, there has to be a high degree of participation by Validators on the network.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior block space efficiency.\n\nOn 12 May, validators\u2019 participation rate slipped to its lowest point since December 2020. This dropped to 96%. It has, however, regained its spot at 99%, where it sat at the time of writing. This means almost all the network validators actively participated in block production.\n\nETH market continues its sideways movement\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $1,892.25, with its price trading within a narrow range since the middle of the month.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe narrow movement of the market was confirmed by the state of the alt\u2019s Bollinger Bands at press time. ETH\u2019s price was positioned by the middle line of this indicator.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s price moves in this manner, it suggests that the asset was experiencing a period of relative stability or consolidation at press time. In this situation, there might not be a strong directional trend in the price movement, and the market might be indecisive."

        "content": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin explores Worldcoin's biometric proof-of-personhood, discussing its potential value, applications, and challenges such as privacy, accessibility, and centralization.\n\nCo-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin explored the idea of biometric evidence of personhood, a subject that is gaining popularity in the Ethereum community, in a blog post from July 24, 2023. The article \"What do I think about biometric proof of personhood?\" examines the possible benefits and difficulties of decentralized proof-of-personhood solutions.\n\nAccording to Buterin, proof of personhood is a kind of real-world identification that claims a certain registered account is run by a real person, preferably without disclosing whose actual person it is. The \"unique-human problem\" is addressed by this idea, which has become the subject of various initiatives, including Proof of Humanity, BrightID, Idena, and Circles.\n\nOne of the most ambitious projects in this space is Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Worldcoin's approach to proof of personhood is unique as it relies on sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user's iris using a specialized hardware called \"the Orb\". The goal is to distribute these Orbs globally, making it easy for anyone to get an ID.\n\nButerin acknowledges the criticisms Worldcoin has faced, including privacy and security concerns around the Orb, design issues in its \"coin\", and ethical issues around some choices the company has made. He also discusses the broader concerns about whether biometrics are a good idea at all and the potential risks of proof of personhood in general, such as privacy leaks, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the challenge of maintaining security while being decentralized.\n\nThe blog post also explores the importance of proof of personhood, stating that it is valuable because it solves anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems, avoids dependence on centralized authorities, and reveals minimal information. Without proof of personhood, decentralized governance becomes easier to capture by wealthy actors, including hostile governments.\n\nButerin also discusses the potential applications of proof of personhood, which include airdrops for token distributions, voting in DAOs, protection against bots/sybil attacks in social media, and an alternative to captchas for preventing DoS attacks, among others.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, Buterin acknowledges the challenges that biometric proof-of-personhood systems face, including privacy concerns, accessibility issues, and centralization risks. He also explains Worldcoin's solutions to these problems, including as its long-term dedication to decentralization , its use of ZK-SNARKs and other cryptographic tools to safeguard users' anonymity, and its possibility for auditing Orbs to make sure they are constructed appropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, Buterin's paper offers a thorough examination of the idea of biometric evidence of personhood, as well as its possible advantages and drawbacks. It presents a fair viewpoint, taking into account both the necessity for major issues to be addressed as well as the potential for these systems to tackle important problems.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Linea users say their funds are stuck on the project\u2019s bridge due to ongoing issues.\n\nThe issues affect users trying to withdraw their Ether from the layer 2 blockchain.\n\nLayer 2 blockchain Linea\u2019s ongoing bridge issues have left users stranded barely a fortnight after its mainnet launch.\n\nBridge protocols allow users to send tokens across different blockchain. Layer 1 refers to a blockchain and layer 2 refers to a third-party integration that can be used in conjunction with the blockchain.\n\nWhile Linea has reportedly fixed the issues, several users say they are still unable to withdraw their Ether from the layer 2 network to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe team is working hard to speed up transactions of bridged assets from L2 to L1,\u201d the team tweeted on July 24.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cWithdrawal times should gradually reduce till we hit the target of [eight to 32] hours over the next few days,\u201d Linea said. \u201cRest assured, all pending transactions will be processed.\u201d\n\nLinea also said users have bridged $20 million in crypto assets on its network in the last week.\n\nWeb3 developer ConsenSys is the company behind Linea. Its founder Joseph Lubin has said that the aim of Linea is to provide \u201cseamless withdrawals.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s statement comes days after users began complaining of unusually long delays in Ether withdrawals.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNormally, this process can take up to 32 hours, according to Linea, but complaints on the project\u2019s Discord server suggest some user funds have been stuck since July 18.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for six days already\u2019\n\n\u201cDear developers, who can tell me how much longer I have to wait for my ETH that is stuck in the Linea bridge? I\u2019ve been waiting for six days already,\u201d a community member called Ibaba said.\n\nIn Linea\u2019s case, the layer 2 network\u2019s official bridge enables Ether deposits from Ethereum to Linea, as well as withdrawals from Linea to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, \u201ca batch submission issue\u201d had ground withdrawals between the Linea and Ethereum blockchains to a halt, Roo, a Linea Discord admin said on July 21.\n\nNOW READ: Arbitrum just came to a sudden halt \u2014 it ran out of money for gas\n\nThe batch submission issue affected withdrawals because of the way Linea processes cross-chain communication with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe Linea team worked on a fix and they deployed one,\u201d Roo said. \u201cThe batch submission has been resumed [but] it will take time to catch up with the L2 head.\u201d\n\nEven though Linea said a fix has been deployed, the batch submission process to the Ethereum network appears to not have synchronised with the requests submitted on the layer 2 chain, hence the ongoing delays.\n\nLinea did not return requests for clarification on when the fix was deployed and to comment on the issues raised.\n\nNOW READ: Multichain workers in China fear for safety after CEO\u2019s arrest, says Fantom boss\n\nSeveral users criticised the project\u2019s team for not disclosing more information about the issues.\n\n\u201cIt is understandable that there are problems with the mainnet launch but on issues related to the safe whereabouts of funds, the team needs to update the daily progress to ease people\u2019s concerns and MOD\u2019s work pressure,\u201d one user said.\n\nTo share tips or information about layer 2 blockchains please contact me at osato@dlnews.com."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could fall 5% to $27,500 after breaking crucial support at $29,872 ahead of the FOMC.\n\nEthereum price to test the $1,824 as bears become active below the 200-day EMA at $1,883 on the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nRipple price could correct back to move within range after collecting liquidity under $0.711.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues south after breaking the crucial support. The slump has harmed altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices bearing the brunt. Meanwhile, the crypto market looks to the oncoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday without much expectation, seeing as its influence on crypto market prices has been rather limited of late.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and ApeCoin trade volume spikes as correlation to Bitcoin dwindles\n\nBitcoin price slides sideways, harming altcoins\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has lost crucial support at $29,872 to extend almost 5% lower to a price of $29,090 at the time of writing. The move has seen the king of crypto flip the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support into resistance at $29,363 (red). As BTC heads toward the 100-day EMA at $28,344 (green), the bearish outlook points to a retest of the $27,500 level.\n\nThe pessimistic outlook is unfortunate considering the oncoming FOMC report, a macroeconomic event that would normally bode well for Bitcoin price if it came as expected. Noteworthy, the previous FOMC indicated the likelihood of a mild recession after the Federal Reserve (Fed) noted a decline in the US Dollar (USD).\n\nBTC and the USD trading inversely to one another, there is a possibility the Fed meeting could impact BTC \u2013 even though of late it has had less of an influence. Nevertheless, as reported, a loss of the crucial support at $29,872 would expose Bitcoin price to further losses, potentially tagging the $27,500 support. Such a move would constitute a 5% drop from current levels.\n\nBoth the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillators (AO) are headed south, pointing to falling momentum, which augurs well for the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nNevertheless, similar to April 21 and April 25, sidelined investors could choose the $27,500 support as an entry point. The ensuing buying pressure could see the Bitcoin price correct north.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Traders Cautious Despite Spot ETF Optimism, Leverage Indicators Suggest\n\nEthereum price drops as sellers rouse\n\nEthereum (ETH) price suffers the aftermath of awakened sellers below the 200-day EMA at $1,883 (blue) on the four-hour timeframe. The subsequent selling pressure sent ETH toward $1,824, a crucial multi-month support level.\n\nIf the support at $1,824 gives way, Ethereum price could fall 7% to the $1,720 range or lower in the dire case to tag the support floor around the psychological $1,640.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, a resurgence by the bulls could see Ethereum price bounce from the $1,824 support akin to what happened during late June and early July. Such a move could see ETH regain the ground lost, potentially shattering the $1,959 resistance level. This would constitute a $6 rally north from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin worth $23 million drained from Alphapo hot wallets\n\nRipple price could pull back after collecting liquidity\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken below the support at $0.711, a move that appears to be a successful attempt to collect buy-side liquidity hanging after volatility following the July 13 rally. Liquidity collection often stabilizes the market for a few days before the asset continues its overall trend.\n\nAccordingly, Ripple price could restore north to move within range. However, XRP could extend even further north in a highly bullish case, breaching the $0.823 resistance level. This would denote a 20% rise from current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nNevertheless, with the RSI heading south and AO histograms soaked red, bears are gaining ground, and Ripple price could rally south toward the $0.544 level.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-XRP John Deaton argues SEC vs. Ripple ruling is sound, cites Celsius bankruptcy example"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has expressed his opinions on Worldcoin\u2019s biometric identity verification mechanism. Buterin claimed that personality-proof systems raise concerns about privacy and security but that they are still necessary and that continued development of these systems may take years. He pointed out that Worldcoin is distinctive in that it uses highly advanced biometrics to scan each user\u2019s iris using specialized gear known as \u201cthe Orb.\u201d\n\nThe Risks And Issues With Worldcoin (WLD)\n\nButerin noted that Worldcoin\u2019s guiding idea is simple, that is AI will benefit humanity much in terms of abundance and wealth, but it can also lead to the loss of many jobs and make it almost impossible to tell the difference between a human and a robot.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTherefore, he highlighted that the gap must be addressed by creating a highly effective system for personality evidence that enables people to show their actual humanity and by offering a UBI to everyone. Using specialized hardware known as the \u201cOrb\u201d to scan each user\u2019s iris, Worldcoin\u2019s dependence on cutting-edge biometric technology sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, Worldcoin has drawn criticism, for its \u201ccoin\u201d\u2018s poor design, privacy, and security concerns around the Orb, and some of the company\u2019s business decisions, Butrin said. Some of the comments are very detailed, focusing on choices the project made that could have been made differently and that the Worldcoin project itself may be prepared to amend.\n\nOthers, however, question whether biometrics in general. They doubt that the eye-scanning biometrics of Worldcoin and the more straightforward face-video-uploads and verification games employed in Proof of Humanity and Idena are even smart ideas. Others criticize any evidence of personhood in general, the Ethereum founder noted.\n\nIn fact, due to these drawbacks, a few analysts have started to bad mouth Worldcoin and called the company fraud. Crypto analyst Dylan LeClair took to Twitter to inform its followers, not to buy Worldcoin or visit Orb. He asked the people to also stop sharing their biometrics data.\n\nAlso Read: What Is Worldcoin Token And Where Can You Buy It?\n\nOther Issues On Worldcoin (WLD) To Look Out For\n\nAccording to Vitalik, the registry of iris scans may provide information when it comes to privacy. If someone else scans your iris, they can at the very least verify it against the database to see if you have a World ID. Iris scans could perhaps give more details.\n\nRegarding accessibility, planet IDs won\u2019t be dependably accessible unless there are a sufficient number of Orbs that anybody on the planet can reach with ease.\n\nThe WLD token is up by more than 50% in the last day and holds a global market cap of $265 million. It is trading at $2.54 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Remains Rangebound, Hold On Before Making the Next Move"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says a major sell-off event is on the horizon for altcoins, but notes that leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) may be safe.\n\nIn a new strategy session, DataDash host Nicholas Merten tells his 511,000 YouTube subscribers that altcoins look primed for a sustained corrective move.\n\n\u201cNot only are altcoins at the moment looking like they\u2019re ready for a continued pullback, we\u2019re doing our due diligence, we\u2019re trying to find the projects we\u2019re interested in but at the same time, I\u2019m going to be honest with you guys, I do see the market continuing to correct.\u201d\n\nLooking at Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of crypto exchange Binance and currently the fifth-ranked digital asset, Merten says its price action could reveal what\u2019s next for the altcoin market at large.\n\nAccording to the crypto trader, BNB could witness a deep correction if it fails to hold the $30 billion level in terms of market cap.\n\n\u201cWe are basically trying to determine now that Binance [Coin], or BNB, has broken through this long-term trend line that it held since 2017, how low can things go? Can it hold here at around $30 billion? Because if it can\u2019t, if it breaks through that level, we are entering into no man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, the market cap of BNB is $37.6 billion.\n\nAlthough Merten is cautious on altcoins, he says that Ethereum could swim against the tide.\n\n\u201cOut of all the cryptocurrencies out there, one that has stood out that looks at least more bullish to me is the price pattern of Ethereum. Over the last more than a year, it has been building an ascending triangle. This is a bullish pattern where you have a flat range of resistance, ascending lows that line up, squeezing and coiling in price, usually to bounce to the upside.\n\nHowever, I want to make it clear that there\u2019s no guarantee of that as with all technical patterns, we\u2019re just simply working with what we have.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,883 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Transfers To Exchanges Suggest More Selling Pressure For ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Currently, the crypto market is under fire from bears, and coins like Ethereum (ETH) are already starting to feel the heat. Amid the struggle to recover, there have been massive inflows of ETH into centralized exchanges, which could spell further struggles for the digital asset going forward.\n\nEthereum Whales Move Millions To Centralized Exchanges\n\nMultiple reports from the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert have shown that Ethereum whales could be exiting their positions in large volumes. The reports started on Saturday, July 22, when the first transaction was first picked up on the blockchain.\n\nIn the first transaction, Whale Alert shows that the whale had moved 15,000 ETH to Gate.io. And at the time, the transaction was worth around $28.28 million. However, this was only the first of many as the whale tracker would go on to report even larger movements to centralized exchanges.\n\nThe next was a transaction carrying 19,328 ETH worth $36.5 million at the time to Coinbase. Moving forward, the tracker also reported another transaction of 15,000 ETH ($28.1 million) being moved to the Gate.io crypto exchange once more.\n\nThe fourth transaction was one carrying 19,328 ETH valued at $36.12 million, transferred from another unknown wallet to Coinbase. And last but not least, a large ETH transaction carrying 12,000 ETH ($22.5 million) popped up in the early hours of Monday.\n\nETH price falls following large whale inflows to exchanges | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nWhat Do These Transactions Mean For ETH?\n\nThese movements by Ethereum whales could have negative implications for the price of ETH going forward. This is because when crypto investors send coins to exchanges, it is usually because they are looking to sell their coins and take advantage of the deep liquidity that centralized exchanges provide.\n\nIf this is the case and these whales begin to sell such large amounts of ETH in one go, then it could significantly impact the price of ETH. This could see the altcoin which is already struggling in the market fall even further as the selling pressure climbs.\n\nAlready, ETH is seeing a decline in its prices, falling toward $1,830 in the early hours of Monday before making a brisk recovery. Such sharp declines could have been triggered by the whales selling, and if there is not enough demand in the market to soak up this new supply, then ETH\u2019s price could return to the low $1,800s once more.\n\nFor now, the digital asset seems to be holding up against the bears but it has already lost its footing at the $1,850 support. Right now, the next major support lies at $1,800, unless the bulls are able to retain control and reclaim $1,900.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOpenAI Inc. CEO Sam Altman's new cryptocurrency project, Worldcoin, has caught the attention of Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and sparked conversations about the advent of decentralized proof-of-personhood solutions in the cryptocurrency realm. Buterin recently discussed the potential of biometric technology in the context of blockchain and Ethereum, focusing on Worldcoin's unique approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorldcoin aims to address the \"unique-human problem\" or proof of personhood by creating a decentralized system where each registered account is controlled by a unique human individual. This system is expected to preserve the anonymity of individuals while confirming their human identity. Worldcoin is unique in its application of biometrics, employing an advanced iris-scanning device, known as \"the Orb,\" to confirm user identities.\n\nHowever, the novelty of this approach has not been without criticism. Questions have been raised about privacy and security concerns related to biometric technology, specifically Worldcoin's Orb. Concerns have also been raised about whether or not biometrics are a suitable solution for proof of personhood at all. The risks associated with privacy leaks, coercive governments and the potential impossibility of maintaining both security and decentralization are some of the highlighted issues.\n\nIn his breakdown, Buterin argued that there is not an ideal proof of personhood form. Instead, we have different paradigms, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. He suggested that these techniques should be seen as complementary and combined. He proposed that biometrics might provide a good short-term solution, while social-graph-based systems could prove more robust in the long term.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential pitfalls of proof-of-personhood systems, Buterin also recognized the work done so far by various teams taking privacy seriously. He called for vigilance from the community, emphasizing the need for open-source tech, third-party audits and a balance of checks to ensure accountability. He also emphasized the need for more alternatives in each of the three proof-of-personhood categories."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum network, released a long-form essay with his thoughts on the recently launched Worldcoin human identity verification system.\n\nOn July 24th, Buterin tweeted his response to Worldcoin which launched on the same day.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nIn his article, along with an explanation of Worldcoin and how it intends to work, Buterin addressed the larger concept in discussion within the release of the Worldcoin token \u2014 proof of personhood.\n\nWorldcoin, along with similar identity solutions, such as Proof of Humanity, BrightID, Idenam and Circles, believe that as artificial intelligence (AI) advances, it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between humans and machines.\n\nMost of these systems that supply a token type, such as Worldcoin, also see human utility being endangered by bots and therefore needing a universal basic income.\n\nButerin writes that these factors combined beckon the need for digital verification of humans. He argues that this system of proof of personhood is valuable to solving \u201canti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems.\u201d\n\nRelated: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testifies in \u2018historic\u2019 Senate hearing on AI safety\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum co-founder also highlights that systems like Worldcoin, if it continues to decentralize as promised, will avoid \u201cdependence on centralized authorities and reveal the minimal information possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf proof of personhood is not solved, decentralized governance becomes much easier to capture by very wealthy actors, including hostile governments.\u201d\n\nButerin also addressed the major concerns looming over such solutions, which he summarized into four main points of privacy, accessibility, centralization within the Worldcoin Foundation and security.\n\nOn June 27, Worldcoin had a small scare that it immediately clarified after thousands of Safe deployments to Optimism caused speculation of an attack.\n\nSteve Dakh, a developer working on the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), which is the network\u2019s own service that creates, verifies and revokes on/off-chain attestations, commented on Buterin\u2019s post saying systems like Worldcoin could be complimentary with EAS.\n\nI think Worldcoin can just be an attester of proof of personhood using a protocol like EAS and other entities can decide whether or not they value those attestations. \u2014 Steve Dakh (@stevedakh) July 24, 2023\n\nIn conclusion, Buterin said there is currently \u201cno ideal form of proof of personhood\u201d and envisions three different approaches to the problem that could become a hybrid of each other.\n\nHe called for community accountability in the process with audits, checks and balances. Although saying he does not envy those whose task it is to design and implement such systems, his point is simple:\n\n\u201cA world with no proof-of-personhood seems more likely to be a world dominated by centralized identity solutions, money, small closed communities, or some combination of all three.\u201d\n\nAs of July 14, a week before the system\u2019s launch, sign-ups for Worldcoin World ID surpassed 2 million in less than half the time it took to reach the first million.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift"

        "content": "Blur, a prominent contender in the NFT marketplace, is commencing the distribution of its postponed BLUR token airdrop today, as a gesture of appreciation towards Ethereum NFT traders. Since its launch in October, the platform, which is recognized as a \u201cmarketplace for professional traders,\u201d had made a commitment to provide token rewards to traders. Traders are now able to claim Ethereum-based tokens from their \u201ccare packages\u201d with an anticipated commencement time of approximately 1:30 PM ET, after experiencing a slight delay.\n\nThe distribution of tokens took place in three distinct phases, specifically aimed at Ethereum NFT traders who met the eligibility criteria and actively engaged in Blur\u2019s competitive marketplace prior to its official launch. Additionally, tokens were allocated to users who listed their NFTs for sale during the month of November, as well as traders who placed bids on NFTs within the Blur platform. Blur had originally intended to distribute governance tokens to eligible users in January, but the airdrop was subsequently delayed in order to implement additional enhancements.\n\nIn March 2022, Blur successfully secured $11 million in a seed funding round, with Paradigm taking the lead. The company\u2019s primary objective is to cultivate a strong user base by providing traders with token rewards that hold the potential for significant value. Blur\u2019s growth has been fueled by the anticipation surrounding the upcoming token halving, resulting in occasional instances where it surpasses OpenSea in terms of NFT trading volume.\n\nIT'S TIME FOR $BLUR Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official @BLUR_io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming. pic.twitter.com/tSbOPLqYTW \u2014 Blur (@blur_io) February 13, 2023\n\n\n\nThe introduction of token rewards generated a sense of enthusiasm among users. However, it also raised concerns regarding the practice of \u201cwash trading,\u201d where users could potentially manipulate trades in order to artificially inflate their rewards. In contrast to certain other marketplaces, Blur has managed to avoid encountering substantial challenges related to dubious trades. However, it is worth noting that approximately 13% of its trades are categorized as suspected wash trading, which is higher compared to the approximately 2% observed on OpenSea.\n\nThe token airdrop by Blur has the potential to enhance its momentum even more, as traders capitalize on the incentives, with the backing of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Huobi."

        "content": "The investors favor crypto projects that add value to the industry. A new project, Tradecurve, is one such project that has multiple utilities and solves complex real-world problems. Even the growth rate of Aptos (APT) and Ethereum (ETH) seem smaller when compared with the rise of Tradecurve (TCRV).\n\nWhile all crypto projects aim to make a big impact on the market, only a few of them are able to do so. Considering its growth prospect, whales have been pouring money into its ongoing presale round.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nAptos (APT) Becomes 9th Most-Tweeted Crypto Project\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has been beneficial for Aptos (APT), barring the month of March. While Aptos was able to soar by about 400% in January, it forged many new strategic partnerships in February. Aptos was also able to record its all-time high of $19.90 in January.\n\nHowever, bears suppressed Aptos in March, and the token lost about 48% value from its ATH. Currently, Aptos is changing hands at $10.26, with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion. In the meantime, Streamr has ranked Aptos 9th on the list of most-tweeted cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to experts, the ranking is a sign of investors\u2019 confidence in Aptos (APT), which has increased in the past three months.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nWhales Increase Their Ethereum (ETH) Accumulation\n\nEthereum (ETH) launched Shanghai Upgrade on its mainnet in April. Since it was one of the most-awaited developments of this year, the market sentiments around Ethereum have become bullish after the launch of the Shanghai Upgrade.\n\nHowever, the market value of Ethereum has plunged by 12% in the past week. Ethereum has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. According to the latest data from Santiment, whales have increased their Ethereum accumulation by 0.5% in recent weeks. Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade has enabled users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,854.82.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) Becomes the Market Star of 2023\n\nThere are thousands of trading exchanges in the world, but all of them are tunnel-visioned. For instance, exchanges like Binance and Huobi are limited to cryptocurrency-related assets, while platforms like Upstox and Webull restrict their users to traditional derivatives. However, the entry of Tradecurve (TCRV) has changed the entire landscape.\n\nIt is a first-of-its-kind platform that allows the trading of a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrency, Forex, stocks, bonds, OTC derivatives, and ETFs without FIAT payments. Since the crypto market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% from 2021 to 2030, experts believe that Tradecurve has massive growth potential.\n\nThe USP of this platform is that traders hold their own keys, and control their own assets, unlike established projects like Coinbase. It also protects users\u2019 privacy through DeFi capabilities. TCRV token owners will be given bonuses on their trades, discounts on trading fees, and subscription fees for using AI trading bots.\n\nIts presale phase has begun, and is currently in stage 1. TCRV tokens are currently available to purchase at $0.018. Since only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be supplied during the presale phase, bulls have pounced on the project to get the maximum benefits.\n\nTo find more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token, visit the links below:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official"

        "content": "Investor Takeaway: Layer-1 blockchains are central to the growth of the cryptocurrency and DeFi markets. While there\u2019s been a massive boost in investor interest (and subsequent boom/bust cycles), the SEC\u2019s recent labeling of some Layer-1s as securities means some caution might be prudent.\n\nThe modern cryptocurrency ecosystem is based around Layer-1 blockchains. Scalable blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have played, and continue to play, a vital role in the development of notable DeFi technology like NFTs. As such, billions of dollars from investors have flowed into the industry in the last five years.\n\nThere\u2019s always some give-and-take, however. The inherent volatility of native Layer-1 tokens has also drawn the attention of regulators in the US and EU. In 2023, the SEC is taking a tough stance against all prominent Layer-1 blockchains apart from the big two \u2013 Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn this sector report, we will focus on the broad trends in the industry around Layer-1 blockchains, along with a closer look at the potential impact of the recent SEC decisions regarding Layer-1 tokens like Cardano, Solana, and BNB Coin.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nLayer-1 (L1) blockchains are the true backbone of the nascent cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin led the way with the first-ever viable Layer-1 protocol. However, its technology and architecture have since been overtaken by more innovative and scalable networks like Ethereum.\n\nAlthough bitcoin is still the king of Layer-1 protocols, its utility is largely limited to being a highly lucrative speculative asset. Other protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano offer a host of other benefits.\n\nMany experts think blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize finance, payments, banking, and other economic spheres. Through their support for smart contracts and decentralized apps, the newer Layer-1 protocols are actively contributing to the evolution of the blockchain space.\n\nAs of Q2 2023, over $270 billion is invested in the top 9 Layer-1 blockchains below bitcoin. The latter dwarfs them all with a market cap of $500 billion, but it has also been around for over 12 years.\n\nApart from Ethereum, which launched in 2015, all other Layer-1 blockchains started after 2017. In a relatively short time frame, many of these projects have managed to attract upwards of $5 billion each in market cap.\n\nThe top players in the descending order of magnitude are Ethereum, BNB Chain, Cardano, Tron, Solana, Polkadot, and Avalanche. Ethereum dwarfs them all with a total market cap of $209 billion, nearly three times the combined market cap of all other L1 blockchains (besides bitcoin).\n\nAll these blockchains, including bitcoin and Ethereum, have suffered heavy losses in the crypto bear market of 2022. The entire blockchain sector suffered a collective loss of $2 trillion in market cap from January 1, 2022 through June 2023.\n\nDespite these losses, we believe the industry still has an upbeat future, at least in the case of the two main blockchains \u2013 bitcoin and Ethereum. Both are firmly established, with stable ecosystems and global user bases, and are least likely to suffer a catastrophic collapse.\n\nHowever, the fate of the remaining players in the market is less clear, largely due to factors like increased competition, internal weaknesses, and above all, increasing regulatory pressure. This vital point will be discussed in greater detail in our investor thesis below.\n\nTop Layer-1 Projects\n\nProject Market Cap Annualized Revenue Assets Staked (market cap) Total Daily Transactions Daily Active Addresses Ethereum $209.2b $2.51b $34.4b $474k 527.6k BNB Chain $37.1b $20.12m $5.39b 3.49 2.0m Cardano $9.6b $0 $6.47b 66,791 54,977 Solana $6.0b $561k $6.02b 29m 143.3k Polkadot $5.7b $222.75k $2.62b 8.82k 4.3k Tron $6.5b $89.4m $2.69b 12m 2.7m Avalanche $4.1b $1.3m $3.14b 457.9k 161k\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nBlockchain proposes a radically different way of handling large volumes of sensitive data in a secure yet highly decentralized manner. This model has massive ramifications for our modern economy, where data is traditionally stored in centralized databases.\n\nIn sectors as diverse as finance, health care, real estate, business, and logistics, organizations are forced to spend vast amounts of resources to maintain database security. This often comes at the cost of efficiency, economy, and privacy.\n\nBlockchain technology has the power to change all that. And Layer-1 blockchains are the building blocks of this decentralized future, particularly in the space of payments, finance, and banking. L1s are like the operating system for the blockchain ecosystem. They provide the base layer upon which everything else is being built.\n\nThis is particularly true for Ethereum. It\u2019s smart contracts allow developers to build all sorts of interesting (and potentially profitable) dApps on top of the base Ethereum layer. Investors can also use DeFi apps and smart contracts on Ethereum and other L1 ecosystems to put their crypto assets to work in yield farming and crypto lending. You can also hold the coins native to the blockchain for speculative trades.\n\nLayer-1 blockchains are popular among investors because they open the doors to a wide range of investment opportunities with varying levels of risk. However, because of the very nature of the L1s, that is to provide the base layer for everything, it\u2019s not likely that they can all survive. In order to survive, Layer-1 relies on a growing developer community, and the associated network effects. This means that in the future it is likely that we will see 1 or two dominant L1s and perhaps another 1-2 more \u201cniche\u201d and smaller L1s take over the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nInvestor Alert: The Potential Impact of SEC Regulations in 2023\n\nWhile they hold an immense promise of high ROI, investments in Layer-1 blockchains do present risks. Market volatility is a major threat in the crypto space. Bear markets and flash crashes routinely wipe out billions of dollars in market cap in a matter of days or weeks.\n\nHowever, many of the Layer-1 blockchains face another threat from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States: more stringent regulations. In the aftermath of the collapse of Terra/LUNA and FTX, regulators are cracking down on the crypto space.\n\nLeading the charge, the SEC has classified the tokens of more than 12 major blockchains as securities. Under current US regulations, entities selling securities to the public have to be registered with the SEC.\n\nIt also brings stringent compliance rules regarding the disclosure of information, and other extensive financial regulations, audits, and oversight. The SEC has also filed lawsuits against the two major centralized exchanges \u2013 Binance and Coinbase \u2013 for selling Layer-1 tokens and other crypto products in the US.\n\nThe SEC has classified all the major Layer-1 tokens, except Bitcoin and Ethereum, as securities. Trading or selling these tokens may incur penalties for cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nFor investors, the Layer-1 blockchain landscape has become a lot more complicated outside of ETH and BTC. The recent SEC regulations could also hurt the price and liquidity of all L1s.\n\nWe strongly recommend all investors think carefully before investing in any of the other L1 tokens targeted by the SEC. It could be a while before we get further clarity on the matter since multiple lawsuits are pending in the courts, and could take years to settle. In addition, it seems Congress is weighing in on the recent SEC actions, and looking to push back with new regulatory frameworks, which could be a win for the crypto industry.\n\nWho\u2019s Investing: Institutional Backing\n\nThe Layer-1 blockchain space has probably seen the largest influx of institutional capital in the entire crypto space. Bitcoin leads due to its unique status as a high ROI speculative asset. Major investors holding bitcoin worth hundreds of millions of dollars include companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Block, Coinbase Global, and Riot Blockchain.\n\nDue to its highly scalable and environmentally-friendly technology, Ethereum has also attracted considerable interest from companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Square, and Paypal. Hedge Funds like Fortress Investment Group, Ark Investment Management, and Renaissance Technologies have also bet on Ethereum since 2021.\n\nAnd all that is just an investment into buying the native tokens of these blockchains. Some projects have also raised cash over time through multiple avenues like initial coin offerings (ICOs) and subsequent funding rounds.\n\nFor instance, Solana\u2019s ICO invited interest from investors like Coin Shares, Multicoin Capital, Buck Stash, and the now-defunct Alameda Research. Major investors in Polygon include Disney Accelerator, Crown Venture Capital, Celsius Network, SoftBank Vision Fund, and Steadview Capital.\n\nTop Layer-1 Protocols by Market Cap\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice: $1,738.66\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $2.51b\n\nDaily Active Users: 338k\n\nTwitter Followers: 3.08m\n\nAs the second largest blockchain by market cap behind bitcoin, Ethereum requires no introduction. The project was launched in 2015 as a Proof of Work blockchain by several developers, including Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum is incredibly popular due to its excellent support for smart contracts and decentralized apps that can solve real-world problems. The native asset of the blockchain is Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nDue to increasing network congestion and high transaction fees (gas), Ethereum began a switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2020. The final network update (the Merge) was completed in April 2023.\n\nFurther updates will bring other features like sharding to solve the problem of network congestion. Among all the blockchains on this list, Ethereum undoubtedly has the most well-developed Layer-1 ecosystem and \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 the best growth prospects.\n\nThanks to the promise of additional rewards through staking and other DeFi projects, demand for ETH remains quite high in 2023. The risk of regulatory sanctions are also lower as the SEC considers ETH to be a commodity, not a security.\n\nBNB Chain (BNB)\n\nPrice: $237.46\n\nAnnualized Revenues:\n\nDaily Active Users: 1.2m\n\nTwitter Followers: 10.5m\n\nBNB Chain was originally called Binance Smart Chain. It was launched in 2020 by Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Although Binance is a centralized exchange, BNB Chain is designed to be a decentralized and permissionless blockchain.\n\nBNB began life as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain before it was elevated to a proper cryptocurrency on its native Layer-1 protocol. Think of BNB Chain as a competitor to Ethereum, and BNB as a competitor to ETH.\n\nLike Ethereum, BNB Chain supports DeFi, smart contracts, and scalable Layer-2 chains. The Layer-1 protocol also uses a PoS, with validators receiving rewards in the form of Binance Coin for providing liquidity and processing transactions.\n\nBNB Chain enjoys massive popularity in key markets outside the United States due to its association with the Binance exchange. However, the company has been hit hard by regulatory action in the US.\n\nA 2023 lawsuit by the SEC has severely affected Binance\u2019s ability to serve US customers. Pending the outcome, both the exchange and the BNB chain could face higher operating costs and compliance burdens in the United States. Other countries have followed suit.\n\nDue to the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in a key market like the US, it is hard to comment on the long-term growth prospects and viability of BNB Chain.\n\nCardano\n\nPrice: $0.276\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $0\n\nDaily Active Users: 50k\n\nTwitter Followers: 844k\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, several new blockchains were launched with highly scalable PoS consensus mechanisms. These Layer-1 protocols rose in popularity as alternatives to Ethereum, as the latter was getting bogged down by network congestion and high transaction charges.\n\nCardano was a leading contender among these protocols for the title \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d It is named after an Italian genius from the 16th century \u2013 Gerolamo Cardano. And the native token is named ADA in honor of Ada Lovelace, a pioneer of computer programming.\n\nOver the years, Cardano added various innovative features including support for NFTs and smart contracts. However, despite a thriving Layer-1 ecosystem, the blockchain has largely failed to live up to the name of \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d\n\nAs a further blow, Cardano is among the 13 cryptos labeled as securities by the SEC. In the long term, this has the potential to severely restrict the trade of ADA on US exchanges. As of this writing, Cardano\u2019s long-term growth potential looks rather bleak due to the high level of regulatory uncertainties.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nPrice: $15.20\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $6.83m\n\nDaily Active Users: 150k\n\nTwitter Followers: 2.25m\n\nSolana is a Layer-1 protocol with a heavy focus on DeFi, smart contracts, and NFTs. The blockchain has its bases in Geneva and San Francisco and was launched in 2020. In its early years, Solana was touted as a promising Ethereum killer due to its scalability and speed.\n\nHowever, the blockchain has endured a stunning fall from grace since 2022. The native SOL token tanked in value by 94% in a single year. Solana was heavily affected by its association with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the FTX exchange.\n\nHis investment firm had a major stake in SOL and he was also an early backer of the Solana protocol. There is even a suspicion among some quarters that Bankman-Fried\u2019s involvement may have contributed at least indirectly to SOL\u2019s meteoric rise.\n\nDespite its promise of speed and scalability, Solana has struggled to live up to its billing in the contest with Ethereum. With the latter\u2019s switch to PoS, Solana faces an even steeper climb for future relevance and growth.\n\nProbably the biggest setback to the protocol after the FTX debacle is its listing by the SEC as a security. Lower trading opportunities in the US market could severely affect Solana\u2019s popularity at a time when the token is already facing internal challenges and stiff competition.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPrice: $4.63\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $222.75k\n\nDaily Active Users: 3.61k\n\nTwitter Followers: 1.4m\n\nPolkadot is technically not a Layer-1 blockchain. Unlike most other protocols on this list, it operates at a much deeper level and is called a Layer-0 protocol. Polkadot was launched with the ambitious plan to act as a \u201cblockchain for all blockchains.\u201d\n\nIt serves as a platform where all other blockchains can exist as interconnected protocols. In other words, it is a \u201cmeta protocol.\u201d Layer-0 protocols provide the infrastructure that facilitates secure and easy interactions between Layer-1 protocols like Ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nIn the highly fragmented blockchain ecosystem, Layer-1 protocols exist as independent silos. Launched in 2020, Polkadot has the potential to revolutionize the entire space. However, due to its complex nature, the blockchain is more oriented toward developers than retail users.\n\nThe Polkadot system has a central protocol called the relay chain. Users can create additional chains in parallel to the relay chain. These \u201cparachains\u201d can connect among themselves and with other popular blockchains using a connecting layer or bridge.\n\nThe native token on the protocol is called DOT. It acts as the governance token and can also be used to earn staking rewards. Polkadot had a rough year in 2022, as many of its associated NFT and DeFi projects failed to gain traction due to the market crash.\n\nAnother major setback was the de-pegging of the algorithmic stablecoin Acala. The Acala network was a major source of revenue for the Polkadot platform. The subsequent crash of major CEXs and stablecoins in the market has also contributed to a steep fall in DOT prices.\n\nIn the ongoing bear market, Polkadot faces an uncertain future. However, there is no doubt that the parachain concept has immense utility in a diverse crypto market filled with multiple Layer-1 protocols. Polkadot\u2019s growth prospects are tied to the wider prospects of the crypto/NFT/DeFi markets.\n\nTron (TRX)\n\nPrice: $0.0724\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $1.09b\n\nDaily Active Users: 2.03m\n\nTwitter Followers: 1.4m\n\nTron is a Layer-1 blockchain launched in 2017 with a heavy focus on content creation and media consumption. It aims to act as a platform where creators \u2013 musicians, designers, artists \u2013 can remove intermediaries and claim full ownership of their creations and deal directly with their audience.\n\nThe blockchain is extremely popular among users because it does not charge any fees on transactions. This has allowed the protocol to remain viable despite a long series of controversies and scandals.\n\nTron\u2019s founder Justin Sun is one of the most outspoken and controversial figures in the cryptocurrency industry. Despite (or maybe because of) this, Tron has retained a significant following in Asia. In its early years, the protocol developers focused heavily on the Asian crypto markets.\n\nDue to its absurdly low transaction fees and heavy involvement in DeFi/NFT space, Tron still has robust growth prospects in its overseas markets. However, inside the US, its chances are much bleaker given the regulatory stance.\n\nTron\u2019s native token TRX was labeled a security by the SEC in early 2023. In a lawsuit, the regulator charged founder Justin Sun and eight others with a wide range of charges including securities fraud.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nPrice: $11.81\n\nAnnualized Revenues: $15.92m\n\nDaily Active Users: 70k\n\nTwitter Followers: 954k\n\nLike Cardano and Solana, Avalanche is another Layer-1 blockchain designed to provide a better user experience than Ethereum. The protocol was launched in 2019 when Ethereum was going through one of its worst phases of network congestion.\n\nThe native token on Avalanche is called AVAX. It can be staked for passive rewards. Owners also get governance rights on the protocol. With a circulating market cap of $4 billion, AVAX is nowhere close to ETH in terms of adoption. But among L1 protocols, it easily slots into the top 5 lists.\n\nAnd over the years, AVAX has remained relatively free of major scandals and controversies. The protocol has a unique network architecture with three separate chains handling different functions and use cases.\n\nThe protocol has steadily cultivated a layer-ecosystem filled with DeFi projects, NFTs, and other decentralized apps. It also offers excellent integration with Ethereum through a bridge that is under constant development.\n\nAVAX has not been labeled a security by the SEC as of this writing. If things hold, this could be a major boost for the blockchain against its direct rivals like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon. The project is probably never going to overtake the post-PoS switch Ethereum. But it still has quite a lot of staying power in its present condition.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nLayer-1 blockchains are central to the growth of the cryptocurrency and DeFi markets. Over the years, the sector has attracted massive investor inflows while undergoing frequent boom and bust cycles.\n\nThe most recent crash in 2022 was particularly severe, wiping out nearly two trillion dollars in investor funds. That, and the high-profile collapse of major entities like Terra/LUNA and FTX has increased regulatory scrutiny over the entire space.\n\nOutside of the top two blockchains \u2013 bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 all other Layer-1 blockchains are on the radar of the SEC in the United States. These tokens have all been labeled as securities. Any sale or trading of unregistered securities could attract regulatory penalties.\n\nMany US-based exchanges and platforms have already stopped offering trades or sales on the affected layer-1 blockchain tokens. If you are already an investor, we strongly suggest that you think carefully before investing in other L1s, outside of bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSubscribe to Bitcoin Market Journal to learn more about blockchain investing in Layer 1 protocols."

        "title": "Scorpion Casino Token, Ethereum and Solana: The importance of roadmaps - Euro Weekly News",
        "content": "By Guest Writer \u2022 Published: 23 Jul 2023 \u2022 9:30\n\nHaving a clearly set out roadmap, with milestones for success is crucial for crypto projects, especially in presale. Hoping to become the next big crypto coin, Scorpion Casino Token (SCORP) has outlined a clear roadmap, drawing inspiration from the path taken by top coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). The project\u2019s roadmap provides a strategic plan that outlines the goals, development stages, and anticipated achievements of a crypto token.\n\nScorpion Casino Token, Ethereum, and Solana are three notable tokens that have demonstrated the significance of a well-defined roadmap in attracting investor confidence and participation.\n\nIntroducing Scorpion Casino Token: The Next Big Crypto Coin\n\nScorpion Casino Token has emerged as a promising contender in the crypto market, positioning itself as the next big crypto coin for growth investing. This token introduces a unique feature set that appeals to investors seeking opportunities in the online gambling industry. The SCORP token is deflationary, with automatic burn mechanisms triggered after every transaction and every time the casino generates profits. It also leverages reputable platforms like BetRadar and CoinsPaid to offer users a seamless and secure gambling experience.\n\nScorpion Token\u2019s roadmap outlines the development stages of the project, including the creation of the number one social online gambling platform. The roadmap introduces exclusive rewards, such as enrolment in the Elite Scorpion Members Club, which offers VIP services, cash-back incentives, extra staking rewards, and additional SCORP tokens. These milestones provide a clear progression of the project\u2019s growth, inspiring confidence and attracting investors seeking potential returns in the booming crypto and online gambling industries.\n\nEthereum: Empowering the Blockchain Industry\n\nEthereum, often regarded as the pioneer of blockchain-based smart contracts and decentralised applications, has established itself as a leading cryptocurrency. With a robust infrastructure and a large developer community, Ethereum has become a symbol of innovation and versatility in the crypto space. To maintain its position, Ethereum continues to upgrade its roadmap, enhancing its offerings and keeping up with the evolving needs of the industry.\n\nThe roadmap consists of a series of planned upgrades aimed at scaling the platform into a maximally resilient network. The recent Shapella upgrade was just one milestone in Ethereum\u2019s journey. However, the roadmap extends beyond this upgrade, with several major improvements still in the pipeline. Notably, the introduction of distributed validator technology (DVT) will enable solo and squad staking, empowering users to participate in securing the network and earning rewards. Ethereum\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement instil confidence in investors, as they see the platform\u2019s dedication to remaining a powerful global blockchain platform for decentralised applications.\n\nSolana: Unlocking Unprecedented Scalability\n\nSolana has gained attention as a high-performance blockchain platform aiming to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. Positioned as one of the fastest blockchain platforms in existence, Solana offers developers an opportunity to create dApps at scale. Solana\u2019s roadmap focuses on scalability, security, and decentralisation. By addressing these key aspects, Solana aims to provide developers with a platform where they can build complex applications without compromising speed or security.

        "title": "Dogecoin Gains 10% Following Twitter\u2019s Rebranding As X - Ethereum World News",
        "content": "DOGE became one of the top gainers today after Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X.\n\nThe meme token gained as much as 10%, topping a two-month high of $0.077.\n\nThe demand for Dogecoin increased after Musk briefly displayed its dog-themed logo in his Twitter bio.\n\nTraders also rushed to invest in multiple namesake tokens leading to triple-digit gains.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) witnessed double-digit gains earlier today after Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X. Musk, who bought Twitter in October last year, has owned the domain name X.com since 2017 and previously revealed his plans to turn it into \u201cthe everything app\u201d. The domain name now redirects users to Twitter and is part of the billionaire businessman\u2019s broader plan to turn the social networking platform into what he envisions as \u201cthe most valuable financial institution in the world.\u201d\n\nDogecoin Reaches Two-Month High Of $0.77\n\nElon Musk took to Twitter recently to announce his social networking platform\u2019s new identity. The rebranding included the X logo featured on Twitter\u2019s homepage, replacing the iconic blue bird logo.\n\nX is the future state of unlimited interactivity \u2013 centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking \u2013 creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we\u2019re just beginning to imagine.\u201d Linda Yaccarino, CEO of Twitter\n\nShortly after the announcement, traders scrambled to buy up DOGE, anticipating some role for the meme token in Twitter\u2019s overhaul. The memecoin gained as much as 10%, reaching a two-month high of $0.77. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.75. The buying frenzy led to a 374% increase in the memecoin\u2019s daily trading volume, which topped $1.38 billion.\n\nhttps://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy now points to https://t.co/AYBszklpkE.\n\n\n\nInterim X logo goes live later today. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023\n\nThe rebranding to X also led to several namesake tokens witnessing triple-digit gains. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the price of one X token increased by a whopping 313%. Another token, X AI, which didn\u2019t even exist till last week, gained more than 166%.\n\nMusk has been vocal in his support for Dogecoin, going as far as enabling DOGE payments on The Boring Company, an online store that previously sold flamethrowers, perfumes, and even Tequila. Several of his cryptic tweets with a subtle hint of the dog-themed memecoin have sent its price soaring in the past.\n\nFollowing the announcement of X, he even displayed Dogecoin\u2019s logo in his Twitter bio briefly. In early April, members of the crypto community on Twitter reported that they could see the dog mascot of the meme coin instead of Twitter\u2019s logo on their homepage."

        "title": "Tokenized BTC On Ethereum Plunges 44% in 1 Year, What Happened? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "According to data from Dune Analytics on July 24, the amount of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), a synthetic form of Bitcoin, circulating on Ethereum has fallen by 44% since May 2022. In July 2023, wBTC circulating on Ethereum stood at approximately 158,000 BTC, a sharp decline from 282,000 BTC recorded in May 2022.\n\nInterestingly, on-chain records also showed that the amount of wBTC minted and circulated in Ethereum, primarily for decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes, continued to rise in the first five months of 2022. It peaked in May 2022 amid a market-wide contraction of crypto prices that saw Bitcoin cool off from 2021 peaks of over $69,000.\n\nBTC On Ethereum Falls\n\nBitcoin holders often tokenize their coins, converting them into ERC-20 tokens in Ethereum to participate in various DeFi activities. These engagements may include staking to increase returns, yield farming to maximize returns, lending, and borrowing to receive USDT or DAI and other coins through platforms like MakerDAO.\n\nAmong the popular tokenized Bitcoin are wBTC, renBTC, tBTC, and others. However, as of July 24, a significant percentage of tokenized Bitcoin in Ethereum was wBTC, with over 158,000 tokens circulating. Users also chose other platforms to mint hBTC and renBTC.\n\nThe decline in tokenized Bitcoin highlights the general state of DeFi in Ethereum and other platforms, including BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon. As of July, there has been a marked decline in DeFi activity over the past year from the number of assets locked in various protocols across the ecosystem.\n\nDeFi Activity Decimated By Bears\n\nDeFiLlama data on July 24 shows that the total value locked (TVL), an indicator of demand, has contracted from over $177 billion registered in November 2021 to less than $50 billion. Even so, while DeFi TVL has remained below $50 billion in 2023, most DeFi activity still revolves around Ethereum, highlighting its dominant position in the DeFi space. Data shows that Ethereum\u2019s share of the total TVL is over $24 billion, a more than 50% share.\n\nThe drop in DeFi activity can be primarily attributed to the crypto winter of 2022, a period of bearish market sentiment and reduced overall crypto market activity, which forced most asset prices to lower. Among the coins adversely affected by bears was ETH, the native currency of Ethereum, which fell from around $4,800 to as low as $1,100.\n\nDuring this time, tokens of top DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, posted deep losses. After peaking at around $45, UNI, the governance token of Uniswap, crashed to as low as $3 in the last bearish cycle.\n\nBeyond the effects of falling crypto prices in 2022, the relatively high fees in Ethereum have also impacted DeFi activity. Trackers on July 24 show that sending a simple ETH transaction attracts a $1.86 fee. Meanwhile, the same transaction costs cents in competing protocols like Polygon or Avalanche. Presently, a simple transfer via Polygon zkEVM, for instance, is $0.09.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Price Hovers Near $18.40 - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The bullish rally for ETC price started during the middle of June 2023 as the price formed support near the $14.70 level. The surge was due to BlackRock filing for the Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nThis move led to the creation of a high at $23.30. The cryptocurrency price faced strong rejection from the $23.30 level due to the presence of bears above $23, which pushed the price below $21.\n\nAfter the rejection, the price shifted its trend to bearish and melted to form a support at $18.40. Recently, the price retested $20 and fell back to the same support level. The surge of 10% was due to the partial victory of Ripple (XRP).\n\nIf bears can shatter the support level of $18.40, the price might fall toward the major support level of $17, causing a downfall of approximately 7.53%.\n\nSource: ETC/USDT By TradingView.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price can sustain above $18.40 and gain bullish momentum, it might rise toward $20.20 in hopes of shattering it. For the price to retest the annual high of 24.95, it needs to break and close above $23.\n\nETC price action was praiseworthy during the first quarter of 2023 but the second quarter showed shabby performance.\n\nThe transactions have reached $5.03 Million with a transaction volume of 268,863. The daily active addresses are 13,052. The year-to-date return of Ethereum Classic is 18.23%.\n\nWill ETC Price Retest $20 Level?\n\nSource: ETC/USDT By TradingView.\n\nThe cryptocurrency price trades below 20,100 and 200-day EMAs. The 50-day EMAs have been acting as a support for the price. Currently, the price is facing rejection from the 50-day EMA.\n\nChaikin money flow score is -0.01, suggesting a slight weakness in the market. The relative strength index is 49.17 implying that the price is in neutral territory and the possibility of consolidation.\n\nLower time frames exhibit that price is currently in a narrow consolidation zone. The Bollinger bands have contracted hinting at low volatility in the market. The price is currently trading below the 20-day SMA of Bollinger and residing near the lower band with no certain signs of bullishness.\n\nIf the price can rise above $19, it can head toward the upper band. The long/short ratio is 0.86 with 46.34% longs and 53.66% shorts indicating a higher number of selling positions in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe market capitalization has also decreased by 0.43% to $115,048,222.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe market structure and price action of Ethereum Classic is currently indecisive as the price does not have momentum. The market leader Bitcoin is hovering near $30,000. There is a possibility that the price might consolidate in the current region for a while before making any moves. The longer the price consolidates, the more intense the breakout will be.\n\nTechnical Levels\n\nMajor Support: $18.40 and $17\n\nMajor Resistance: $20.20 and $21\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only.
