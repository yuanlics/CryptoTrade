        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has had a great 2023, so has Ethereum (ETH), the second-most traded and recognizable crypto coin in the world. Ethereum is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform and has risen 89.4% in value as of date in 2023.\n\nThe crypto behemoth has paved its path to winning over new customers by making a significant update this year, known as the Shanghai Upgrade. Under this upgrade, ETH shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively short history of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nPowered by this development and what promises to be a significant 2024 for cryptocurrency, analysts around the world have turned bullish on it. There is a consensus that ETH might outperform BTC in 2024 with regard to growth rate and will gain more market share based on its proposals to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second. In fact, its planned upgrade, called EIP-4844, might ensure that transaction costs could fall to as low as $0.01.\n\nPer Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, ETH revenues could double from 2023, up to $5 billion in 2024. Also, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, with markets widely betting on rate hikes having come to an end and the first rate cut as early as first-quarter 2024, the crisis for crypto may have been averted.\n\nEthereum has already started to make good of the state of the market, and it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform. Here is a selection of two stocks that we believe should be tracked. These currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture plc ACN: This global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved by 0.1% over the past 60 days. ACN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nCME Group Inc. CME: This company operates as one of the world's largest futures exchange, offers a wide range of derivatives contracts and provides various solutions to invest in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.\n\nCME Group\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14.7%.

        "title": "Difficulty Bomb: Ethereum's Increasing Difficulty in Mining - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Was the Difficulty Bomb?\n\nEthereum launched using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, an algorithm that uses large amounts of energy and computational power. This mechanism uses a competitive reward system that encourages mining\u2014and centralized mining farms that have taken over the network. However, this centralization goes against the original decentralization tenet behind cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum's \"difficulty bomb\" referred to the intentional and sudden increase in mining difficulty on the blockchain. It was released to coincide with the blockchain's transition to proof-of-stake. The intent behind the difficulty bomb was to exponentially increase the amount of time it took to mine a new block on the Ethereum blockchain so that it:\n\nEncouraged cryptocurrency miners to move away from energy-intensive proof-of-work mining by removing the incentive\n\nTook away the ability to centralize currency creation and ownership\n\nDiscouraged blockchain forks\n\nForced node upgrades\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum\u2019s \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d referred to a sudden increase in mining difficulty to discourage miners from opting to stay with the proof-of-work mechanism after it transitioned to proof-of-stake.\n\nDifficulty refers to the time and computational power needed to verify a cryptocurrency's transactions within a blockchain under the proof-of-work mechanism.\n\nEthereum's difficulty bomb deployed at block 15530314 on Sept. 14, 2022, the day before \"The Merge\" went live.\n\nUnderstanding the Difficulty Bomb\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, the term difficulty describes a setting that keeps the network randomly guessing for the target solution for a prescribed amount of time. It is calculated in different ways by different blockchains, but the Bitcoin blockchain uses the current difficulty, the expected time, and the actual time to calculate the new difficulty.\n\nMining a cryptocurrency is often confused with creating a coin; however, mining is the verification process that involves guessing a 64-character hash that is less than the target value set by the network. When a miner's machine guesses correctly, they are rewarded with a coin.\n\nEthereum's developers created the difficulty bomb to increase the difficulty of solving the hash exponentially, eventually making it too expensive in time and energy to be worth the cost.\n\nEthereum's developers always intended to move to proof-of-stake, which is claimed to consume 99.95% less energy than proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum\u2019s difficulty bomb is a deterrent for miners, who may have wanted to fork the original blockchain to continue mining using the PoW mechanism. The primary reason miners didn't want to switch to PoS is that the expensive mining machines and farms they created would become obsolete, at least as far as earning rewards for profits.\n\nDifficulty Bomb Challenges\n\nMigrating to PoS was an enormous challenge for the developers\u2014they had to keep pushing the difficulty bomb release date back because The Merge kept being rescheduled. Releasing the bomb before upgrading to PoS would have been counterproductive\u2014the difficulty bomb would have significantly slowed down transactions and severely congested the network.\n\nThere have been six upgrades that, among other fixes, pushed back the difficulty bomb:\n\n2017 : Byzantium update\n\n: Byzantium update 2019 : Constantinople update\n\n: Constantinople update 2020 : Muir Glacier update (difficulty bomb only)\n\n: Muir Glacier update (difficulty bomb only) 2021 : London update\n\n: London update 2021 : Arrow Glacier update (difficulty bomb only)\n\n: Arrow Glacier update (difficulty bomb only) 2022: Gray Glacier (difficulty bomb only)\n\nIs Ethereum Getting Harder to Mine? Ether (ETH), the native Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem cryptocurrency, can no longer be mined due to the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nWhat Does Ethereum Difficulty Mean? Ethereum difficulty referred to the increasing amount of time it took to validate transactions under the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022 removed PoW as the consensus mechanism for the Ethereum blockchain, so difficulty is no longer an issue.\n\nWhat Will Happen to Ethereum Miners After The Merge? Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, can no longer be mined. Miners will need to switch to a minable cryptocurrency if they want to continue mining. Alternatively, they can switch their mining activities to validation activities to earn rewards and help secure the blockchain.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEthereum's difficulty bomb was an attempt by its developers to discourage miners from forking the blockchain and continuing proof-of-work on an Ethereum-like blockchain. It was supposed to work by increasing the difficulty level to a point where mining was impossible when the blockchain switched to proof-of-stake. However, Ethereum Classic forked long before the transition, and other mineable forks were created.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The network of Ethereum layer-2 rollups using zkSync\u2019s ZK Stack got a new addition Thursday, with the launch of the Cronos zkEVM testnet.\n\nBlockchain developer Cronos Labs is developing its third blockchain, which is the first to use ZK Stack hyperchain to reach a live testnet.\n\nThe first chain in the Cronos ecosystem was a Cosmos appchain developed in partnership with the Crypto.com exchange and launched in 2021. Cronos then followed up with an EVM-compatible chain, also built using the Cosmos SDK in 2022. This new effort augments, but does not replace, the prior two chains.\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM is the result of a collaborative effort involving Cronos Labs, Matter Labs (the team behind zkSync), and several engineering teams from stakeholders Crypto.com and dapp developers on the existing chains.\n\nThe zkEVM testnet is built on top of the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and leverages zkSync\u2019s new open-source prover, Boojum, a STARK-based zero-knowledge proof system, notable for its low hardware requirements and low fees in the layer-2 rollup space.\n\nRead more: Polygon Zero and Matter Labs square off over open-source norms\n\nLaunching a native Ethereum chain was motivated by frustrations with bridging across EVM chains and between Cosmos and Ethereum, according to Ken Timsit, managing director at Cronos.\n\n\u201cWhen we started building Cronos as an EVM chain, we were, of course, already convinced that the Ethereum developer ecosystem has richness and robustness that has no comparison when it comes to building DeFi and NFT applications,\u201d Timsit told Blockworks.\n\nGood relations with Matter Labs and a desire to contribute to the open source development of the ZK Stack led them to take the next step.\n\nHyperchains share components of the ZK Stack, including a shared native bridge to the Ethereum mainnet and zkSync\u2019s trustless bridging mechanism, in which assets remain secured by Ethereum.\n\nIt will also benefit from zkSync\u2019s native account abstraction, which allows transactions fee payment in various cryptocurrencies, such as Cronos\u2019 token (CRO).\n\n\u201cWhen you look at legacy chains, it\u2019s very hard to migrate Ethereum assets, for example, to account abstraction enabled wallets,\u201d Timsit said. \u201cAnd so for us, starting by default with account abstraction is a way to take advantage of what this technology offers, better than what we can do on a chain which already has an ecosystem of wallets and tokens.\u201d\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM is expected to progress to mainnet in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nGrowing hyperchains\n\nA handful of other hyperchains are in development using the ZK Stack, notably GRVT, (pronounced \u201cgravity\u201d) a derivatives exchange, and Tradable, which is working on bringing private credit on-chain.\n\nTradable intends to have an institutional focused hyperchain, eventually forming a decentralized chain alongside other institutional partners, according to Omar Azhar, Matter Labs head of business development.\n\n\u201cI think what you might start seeing is app specific chains and then ecosystem specific chains,\u201d Azhar told Blockworks.\n\nMatter Labs sees the zkSync hyperchain as strictly a better option than app-specific chains in Cosmos, such as Cronos\u2019 earlier efforts, said Marco Cora, senior vice president of business and operations. That\u2019s because Cosmos chains generally must provide for their own validator set and security, and lack native token bridges to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIf you are an appchain developer, why are you taking on these two extra projects that you shouldn\u2019t really focus on: building the bridge and bootstrapping the security?\u201d Cora told Blockworks.\n\nThe ZK Stack competes with other well-funded networks building zkEVM chains, including Polygon, whose Chain Development Kit (CDK) shares many of the same goals, and StarkWare\u2019s Starknet, the progenitor of STARK prover technology which both Polygon and zkSync have iterated upon.\n\nHyperchains can also serve the purpose of private blockchain frameworks such as Hyperledger or Corda, Cora said, but with all the benefits of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThey are technically highly scalable, but they practically don\u2019t scale. When you speak with most enterprises, they tell you this is way too expensive for what it is for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAside from cost considerations, there\u2019s the social coordination problem.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Goldman Sachs, you don\u2019t want to join the Morgan Stanley Chain just because it\u2019s the Morgan Stanley Chain. If you\u2019re Fidelity, you don\u2019t want to join the BlackRock Chain just because it\u2019s the BlackRock Chain and so on and so forth,\u201d Cora said.\n\n\u201cBut if the sponsor of the chain\u2026forced himself to create a zero knowledge proof and to hand this proof to a third party \u2014 which is Ethereum \u2014 they now can claim a much higher degree of credible neutrality,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, this party cannot mess with the system.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum could do surpass Bitcoin in performance next year due to the upcoming Protodanksharding upgrade.\n\nThe JPM report says the potential impact of Bitcoin halving on its price is already factored into current valuations.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are stating that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs may not lead to a significant influx of new capital.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s crypto outlook for 2024 is marked by caution, particularly regarding Bitcoin (BTC). The financial institution perceives Bitcoin as being overbought, driven by what they consider \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIts new report suggests Ethereum (ETH), currently the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, may surpass Bitcoin, the largest, in performance next year.\n\nProtodanksharding To Drive Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nThe report, authored by JPMorgan analysts including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglo, cites the anticipated Ethereum network upgrade, dubbed \u201cProtodanksharding ,\u201d as a key factor in this potential shift. This upgrade, expected in the first half of 2024, aims to significantly enhance the efficiency of the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to the JPMorgan report, Protodanksharding is the primary catalyst for this expected outperformance. Analysts believe that this upgrade will be a significant step in improving the activity on the Ethereum network, thereby boosting its performance relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThe report also addresses the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin halving. It notes that current valuations already factor the potential impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price into their predictions.\n\nJP MORGAN EXPECTS ETH TO OVERSHADOW BTC AFTER PUBLIC CRYPTO SHADE Is JP Morgan\u2019s CEO having a change of heart? \u2013 JP Morgan analysts expect the forthcoming EIP-4844 upgrade or \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d to be immensely bullish for #Ethereum \u2013 \"Protodanksharding\" is essentially a\u2026 https://t.co/RZGGTqvsWj pic.twitter.com/Q6d3gjOGTj \u2014 BSCN (@BSCNews) December 15, 2023\n\nDespite speculations that the halving event would lead to a substantial price increase for Bitcoin, JPMorgan suggests that this is not a certainty and that Ethereum\u2019s advancements could position it for stronger performance in comparison.\n\nThe report said: \u201cGiven the current ratio of the Bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 Bitcoin halving event is largely in the price.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs May Not Boost Crypto Markets\n\nThe JPMorgan report presents a skeptical view on the potential impact of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIt says the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), anticipated in 2024, may not lead to a significant influx of new capital into the crypto markets. This is based on observations from Europe and Canada, where the approval of spot crypto ETFs did not substantially increase investor interest or capital flow into the volatile Bitcoin or Ethereum markets.\n\nA few months ago, JP Morgan wasn't feeling Ethereum, and now they're singing a bullish tune. pic.twitter.com/1yPiiA9FSs \u2014 fity.eth (@Fityeth) December 14, 2023\n\nGrayscale ETF Woes Loom\n\nJPMorgan analysts believe that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could redirect investments towards existing Bitcoin-related products. These include Bitcoin mining companies, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThis conversion could lead to investors seeking to capitalize on the SEC\u2019s approval. This could result in up to $2.7 billion in losses for the Trust. Such a scenario is expected to exert \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPerfect timing for @JSeyff note today on why cash creates kill one \"superpower\" of ETFs, and how Grayscale would be hit hardest given they have sitting on tons of bitcoin they bought at lower prices that they'd have to sell. pic.twitter.com/3Uvji7mMya \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2023\n\nAdding to the cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed his negative view during a Senate banking committee hearing last week. Dimon stated his willingness to \u201cclose [crypto] down,\u201d indicating a strong skepticism towards the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDimon said: \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance, I\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, et cetera.\u201d"

When asked why now, Lomashuk told The Block the motivation centers around furthering the development of these newer technologies. \"We believe that we can accelerate the technologies by investing capital,\" said Lomashuk.\n\nThe $100 million investment firm is being funded entirely with capital from cyber.Funds' founders, a spokesperson said by email.\n\nAlthough the flow of fresh capital into crypto and blockchain enterprises has continued during the last year, the amount of money being invested has slowed considerably from what it was during the bull run. Meanwhile, investment in artificial intelligence has soared, spurred partly by interest in projects like ChatGPT.\n\nEarly believers in top crypto projects\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBefore this re-launch, cyber.Fund was primarily active between 2014 and 2018, according to Lomashuk. The firm not only invested early in projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and Solana, but also helped build Lido Finance and P2P, according to Thursday's announcement. Lomashuk co-founded Lido Finance.\n\n\"Our aim is to create a more open, efficient and sustainable economy,\" cyber.Fund said in the post. \"We believe that by working to accelerate the growth, adoption and eventual decentralization of the these technologies, the world will enter a new age of unprecedented prosperity.\"\n\nCyber-Fund considers the emergence of a \"cybernetic\" world as inevitable and sees blockchain, robotics and AI playing a key role in shaping this new paradigm.\n\n\"We invested in Ethereum and build staking to keep it censorship resistant and decentralized,\" said Lomashuk.

Until now, the project\u2019s root node was managed by members of the Ethereum community.\n\nNick Johnson, ENS founder, endorsed the change in ownership. He wrote on X:\n\n\u201c[This is] truly the end of an era. Here\u2019s the message I just sent to the ENS root keyholders, requesting the transfer of the last of their powers to the DAO.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s attached email stated that the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of ENS, which is a governance group formed and controlled by ENS token holders, voted unanimously to acquire control of the project\u2019s root node.\n\nHe said that, in response to those voting results, he created a transaction to execute two actions that transfer root control to the DAO address (wallet.ensdao.eth). He wrote that this transaction transfers all remaining multisig responsibilities to the DAO, thereby \u201cretiring the multisig entirely.\u201d It is unclear whether the other multisig owners have approved the transaction.\n\nIndividuals who previously managed ENS\u2019 multisig include Chainlink\u2019s Sergey Nazarov, Metamask\u2019s Dan Finlay, MyCrypto\u2019s Taylor Monahan, Colony\u2019s Aron Fischer, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Jason Carver and Martin Swende, and Johnson himself. Johnson addressed those individuals in his message, writing: \u201cThank you so much \u2026 for your service to ENS over the years.\u201d\n\nENS governance will be more open\n\nENS\u2019 DAO is a governance group comprising token holders that vote on decisions and issues related to the project by staking tokens.\n\nAccording to the latest proposal, the DAO already has several ownership responsibilities but did not have control over the core ENS root name until now.\n\nThe DAO will gain specific capabilities by controlling the ENS root. The ownership change will allow the DAO to create, manage, and permanently lock top-level domains apart from the permanent and unchangeable .eth domain. It will also allow the DAO to update reverse resolutions that map addresses back to a name. The DAO may also introduce primary domain names on layer-2 networks.\n\nA snapshot indicates that voting concluded on Dec. 15, 2023. Virtually 100% of the staked tokens, or 1.9 million ENS, were staked in favor of DAO ownership. Johnson was one of the largest voters, staking 155,000 ENS in favor. Less than 17 ENS tokens were staked against the plan or were used to abstain."

        "content": "JPMorgan released its 2024 cryptocurrency outlook this week, providing an analysis of expected price performance and adoption trends across various digital assets. While expressing caution broadly towards crypto markets, analysts highlighted Ethereum\u2019s coming transition as a potential bright spot.\n\nKey highlights:\n\nEthereum price expected to outperform Bitcoin based on Ethereum merge upgrades.\n\nRegulatory approval of Bitcoin ETFs is unlikely to drive major upside.\n\nJPMorgan anticipates that Ethereum will be the highest-performing cryptocurrency over the next year due to planned upgrades that will make the Ethereum network more efficient and scalable.\n\nRead more: SushiSwap And Other DApps Exploited Through Ledger Connect Vulnerability\n\nEthereum to dethrone Bitcoin\n\nThe EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d will add capacity to Ethereum through a new transaction type called \u201cblob-carrying transactions.\u201d By improving network bandwidth, analysts expect demand for Ether to increase, driving price gains versus Bitcoin and other altcoins.\n\nIn contrast, JPMorgan believes Bitcoin is at an overbought level, and regulatory approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is unlikely to have a lasting impact. They cited a \u201chigh chance of buy-the-rumor/sell-the-fact effect\u201d post-approval, meaning prices could quickly revert lower after an initial spike.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Will Surge Above $80,000 In 2024, Bitwise Predicts\n\nThe report also noted nascent signs that venture capital funding is stabilizing after the crypto crash of 2022. However, decentralized finance applications still lack connectivity with mainstream finance, which analysts see as necessary for further crypto adoption.\n\nWhile expressing a cautious view on cryptocurrency prices overall, JPMorgan remains constructive on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap and expects Ether to be a relative outperformer as network upgrades roll out over the next year.\n\nTheir analysis reinforces the view that crypto returns may prove selective based on project roadmaps rather than lifting the broader asset class."

The currency now sits at $2,270. But its gains have lagged behind bitcoin, which has rocketed by around 154%.\n\nThe rally has largely been buttressed by optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will get regulatory approval soon. But JPMorgan analysts are more skeptical about the bullish bets on bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto optimists believe a spot ETF approval would improve liquidity and lower the barrier of entry for more investors to invest in bitcoin without owning the currency. JPMorgan, however, thinks it's not so much new capital that would flow into the crypto as much as it is re-shuffled money from other crypto assets.\n\nAlso fueling the hype in bitcoin is the halving event scheduled for April next year, which tends to reduce the supply of the currency and lift prices. But the more bearish take by JPMorgan analysts is that the quadrennial event has been \"well factored\" into the current price, and the currency won't rally post-halving.\n\n\"We instead look for around 20% drop in the hash rate post halving as miners in higher cost locations or with less efficient hardware would be forced to exit the market,\" they wrote. \"This scenario would be more consistent with around $35k bitcoin price post halving.\""

        "title": "Ethereum Restaking is Gaining Steam: OETH Joins EigenLayer - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Ethereum staking has taken the space by storm since 2021\u2019s Merge. The new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism allows anyone to participate in securing Ethereum\u2019s network in exchange for a share of rewards primarily derived from transaction fees.\n\nSince launching, ETH staking has garnered tremendous demand from individuals and institutions alike. The advent of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) has further boosted adoption by drastically lowering barriers to entry. As a result, nearly 24% of ETH\u2019s supply is now securing the network, making it highly resilient.\n\nHowever, novel networks struggle to build similar staking support. This means that they\u2019re forced to develop their products without the same resources or robust security.\n\nEnter EigenLayer. Launched in June 2023, the bleeding-edge restaking protocol allows new chains and protocols to share ETH\u2019s network security and strengthen their offerings. The tokenless protocol has seen impressive demand, garnering more than $260M in TVL thus far.\n\nKeep Reading Lisk Announces New Partnership with Indonesian Ministry of Communications & Informatics\n\nIn line with this growing interest, EigenLayer has onboarded a host of leading LSTs as collateral on the platform. Origin Ether (OETH), Ethereum\u2019s second largest yield aggregator, is among the latest additions to the protocol, bringing restaking to a brand-new audience.\n\nHow Does Restaking Work?\n\nRestaking provides an avenue for developers to harness Ethereum\u2019s robust security on novel chains and dApps.\n\nUsers can restake native staked ETH, LSTs, and ETH LP tokens on EigenLayer. These restaked assets are lent out to builders to provide a solid foundation for protocol security. Projects using restaked assets pay a premium for this service, which is distributed to restakers in the form of rewards.\n\nBeyond allowing projects to share ETH\u2019s security, restaking also offers a unique opportunity for ETH stakers to compound their returns.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that restaking carries additional risks, as the same assets are being reused across multiple networks. As a result, restaked assets are exposed to heightened slashing risks, as each network carries its own set of rules and parameters.\n\nHowever, restakers are compensated for this risk in the form of heightened rewards.\n\nPreparing to Scale\n\nIn tandem with the addition of OETH and other LSTs, EigenLayer is raising its deposit cap on restaked assets. From Monday, users will be able to deposit a total of 200K ETH in assets per LST. However, should total LST deposits exceed 500K ETH, a pause mechanism will be activated.\n\nThis incremental approach allows EigenLayer to support new assets without compromising security.\n\nGiven the significant demand for EigenLayer\u2019s services, it\u2019s possible that the current caps may be reached soon after the new deposit caps go live.\n\nOETH\u2019s EigenLayer Integration\n\nThe addition of OETH to EigenLayer is particularly exciting given Origin Ether\u2019s rapidly expanding presence across DeFi. Since launching in May, OETH has garnered more than 30,000 ETH in TVL. The novel LSTfi protocol is backed by ETH and reserves of Lido stETH, Frax\u2019s frxETH, and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, offering LST holders a seamless platform to boost their returns.\n\nOETH\u2019s incisive strategies generate yields well above base rewards rates for users, boasting a trailing 30-Day APY of over 6%.\n\nThe EigenLayer integration marks one of many milestones on OETH\u2019s quest to become one of DeFi\u2019s most integral money legos. Beyond restaking, OETH holders can also leveraged yield on Pendle Finance, and liquidity mine incentivized pools on Curve and Balancer.\n\nRestaking OETH via EigenLayer allows users to further compound their yield, while also participating in instruments at the very forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nAs crypto continues its march toward mass adoption, primitives like restaking will be invaluable for new builders who lack the deep resources of established Ethereum projects. By harnessing OETH and leading LSTs for restaking, savvy investors could position themselves well for the sector\u2019s future growth."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA dormant Ethereum (ETH) whale is back to life after more than three years of inactivity. According to insights shared by crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, the once dormant whale has deposited a total of 5,000 ETH worth approximately $11.3 million to Coinbase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypically, when related deposits are made to crypto trading platforms, it is often a sign of a sell-off, and this appears to be what this whale is making a move at. According to market data, the Ethereum whale has been receiving funds since as early as 2017, when the price of Ethereum was still $60.\n\nA whale that has been dormant for nearly 3 years deposited 5,000 $ETH($11.3M) to #Coinbase 3 hours ago and currently has 20,398 $ETH($45.88M) left.\n\n\n\nThe whale received $ETH from #Bitfinex in 2017 when the price was ~$60.https://t.co/bSAWFB8XYe pic.twitter.com/WtvEdeNH9L \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 14, 2023\n\nThe last major inflow the whale received came about three years ago, when it bagged a total of 25,398.1 ETH. At the current market value of $2,281.29 per Ethereum, this fund is worth $57,940,431.549.\n\nAs the whale woke up, it conducted at least two test transactions featuring outbound 0.07 ETH and inbound 0.067 ETH, a move that might be intended to confirm it still has skin in the game. After the 5,000 ETH were moved, the whale is now left with 20,398 ETH worth approximately $45.88 million.\n\nReawakening dormant addresses now trendy\n\nWhile the reawakening of the Ethereum whale address shows more hidden influential wallets within the network, the move is arguably becoming a trend as other major cryptocurrencies also see reawakening whale addresses.\n\nAs reported earlier by U.Today, an ICO-era Ethereum address woke up in late November and went on a selling spree on Kraken Exchange. At the time, the whale sent 3,000 to Kraken for potential liquidation, leaving the 5,172 ETH worth approximately $10.7 million.\n\nBesides Ethereum, dormant Bitcoin (BTC) addresses are also prominently featured in these reawakening and liquidation trends."

        "title": "Ethereum Bounces Off Support Zone: Path To New All-Time High Set? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows Ethereum has successfully found a rebound at a major support zone, a positive sign for the asset\u2019s exploration at higher levels.\n\nEthereum Recently Made A Retest Of A Strong On-Chain Support Zone\n\nIn terms of on-chain analysis, the potential of any particular price range to act as support or resistance lies in the total number of investors who bought their coins inside said price range.\n\nThe reason behind that is the holders are more likely to react whenever the price retests their cost basis or acquisition price, which is obviously an important level to them since it can flip their profit-loss situation.\n\nA single holder showing such a reaction won\u2019t cause any effects on the market, naturally, but if a large number of investors share their cost basis inside a tight range, the asset\u2019s retest of the range could perhaps produce a sizeable reaction.\n\nHence, the larger the concentration of investors inside a particular range, the higher the ability of said range to act as resistance/support. Analyst Ali shared this chart recently in an X post that showed how the various Ethereum price ranges looked like in terms of the amount of addresses who acquired their coins at them at the time of the post:\n\nThe various on-chain support and resistance levels | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nFrom the graph, it\u2019s apparent that the $1,934 to $2,160 range is the Ethereum range that hosts the cost basis of the most amount of addresses. At the time Ali had made the post, Ethereum was retesting this range.\n\nNow, since this range has such a high number of investors, a retest of it is probable to cause some reaction on the ETH price. But what kind of reaction would it be, support or resistance?\n\nWhat decides this is the direction the price is retesting from. If the retest is from above, that is, these investors had been in profit just before the retest, then the market could feel some support.\n\nThis is because the holders might think this same price range could be profitable again in the future, so they might decide to participate in some accumulation at it.\n\nSimilarly, a retest from below could end up leading to resistance for Ethereum, as the investors might fear the asset dropping once more, so they could become more likely to sell.\n\nTherefore, this huge range holding the cost basis of 5.85 million addresses should have acted as support for Ethereum during its latest retest. And indeed, since the retest, the asset has successfully found a rebound, as it has shot up towards higher levels.\n\nAs is visible in the chart, the ranges ahead up to the asset\u2019s all-time high are all relatively thin with investors. This means that, thanks to the large support basis below, ETH shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble traversing through these levels, at least in theory.\n\nETH Price\n\nSince finding the rebound at the support range, Ethereum has climbed towards the $2,300 level.\n\nLooks like ETH has been going up during the last couple of days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How to Stake Ethereum? - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "Crypto has come a long way since 2009, when Bitcoin was launched. So many things have changed, and thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been developed. Users now have endless options when it comes to crypto, blockchain, Web3, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), mining, staking, yield farming, and many more. Even mentioning those crypto-related terms can show how much crypto has grown.\n\nWhile there are so many crypto projects on the market, some of them still remain in the spotlight thanks to their features, the many years they have been traded for, and the security and safety they provide. Among them, there is Ethereum, one of the cryptocurrencies that progressed the most and revolutionized many concepts in the crypto industry.\n\nSo, if you have been around for the littlest of time, you might have considered purchasing Ethereum. Are we right?\n\nAnd you may have also asked yourself what it takes to earn more by staking those ETH coins. Well, you are in the right place, as in this article, we will talk about Ethereum staking, its main requirements, benefits, and the best ways to stake your ETH.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nOfficially launched on July 30, 2015, by a team of 5 founders, Ethereum is the 2nd largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. Unlike some may think, Ethereum was not conceived with fast transactions in mind.\n\nHowever, the network\u2019s initial developers, Vitalik Buterin, Jeffrey Wilck, and Gavin Wood, aimed to develop an ecosystem that can store decentralized applications (dApps) and help the DeFi industry evolve as much as possible.\n\nThe whitepaper of Ethereum, which was published in 2013, explained what dApps are, how they work, and how they can rely on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, Ethereum is home to numerous decentralized applications and many other types of crypto projects, being the most developed blockchain.\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has passed through plenty of updates and new launches, but the most significant remains The Merge. While Ethereum first worked based on a PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus mechanism, on September 15, 2022, the network switched to PoS (Proof-of-Stake), thus moving from mining to staking.\n\nThe Merge was a major change for Ethereum and came with various significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption. After switching from PoW to PoS, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption was reduced by approximately 99.95%, a tremendous decrease in carbon emissions.\n\nEthereum Staking\n\nOnce The Merge was completed, the Ethereum network moved to Ethereum 2.0, or the 2nd version of the blockchain. This way, users can now stake their ETH to earn staking rewards based on the amount of ETH they lock up and the lock-up period.\n\nStaking ETH implies using your coins to verify, secure, and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Once a transaction is verified, you can receive a reward. That reward basically is the network fee required by the blockchain to complete that transaction.\n\nWhere and How to Stake Ethereum\n\nConsidering that Ethereum switched from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, crypto enthusiasts can now stake their ETH coins.\n\nIt is widely known that, overall, the staking process is a little less complex than mining. Furthermore, you need less powerful (and expensive) hardware for staking than you do for mining.\n\nSo, many crypto investors were eager to start staking Ethereum once this was possible.\n\nAt the moment, there are multiple ways to stake ETH, and you have to choose the one that is most profitable and easy to complete, depending on your needs, holdings, and knowledge.\n\nThe most popular Ethereum staking options include solo staking, staking pools, staking through a centralized crypto exchange, or even SaaS (Staking as a Service).\n\nWe will take them one by one and highlight their features and advantages.\n\nStaking Ethereum on Crypto Exchanges\n\nThere are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges on the market, each one coming with new or improved features and products. Most of them also support Ethereum, among other cryptocurrencies, and some also allow users to stake their ETH tokens to improve the Ethereum network and earn extra coins.\n\nStaking on a crypto exchange is easier than you think. First, you have to sign up on a platform if you do not have an account already. Then, you should purchase ETH or move it from another platform. Afterward, all you have to do is select the amount of ETH you want to lock up and start staking it.\n\nTop Crypto Exchanges\n\nBinance\n\nBinance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, with over 168 million registered users. The platform is user-friendly, but it is most suitable for crypto investors who already have at least a little trading knowledge.\n\nBinance supports over 350 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, the platform allows users to stake their ETH coins on its platform. The minimum amount required is 0.1 ETH, and the reference APR varies, but it is approximately 3.5%. At the moment of writing, the reference APR was 3.22%.\n\nStaking ETH on Binance is as straightforward as possible. You do not need extensive knowledge of crypto to do this, and Binance is in to help its users stake their Ethereum coins by explaining the process on its official website.\n\nStep 1: Sign up on Binance\n\nFirst, if you do not have a Binance account, you should sign up. To do this, you will have to provide an email address, your phone number, and other similar information. However, Binance will never ask you to provide too much information, as it only requires what it needs to create your account.\n\nStep 2: Click on \u201cEarn\u201d\n\nOnce you are registered and signed in, you can go to the staking page. To do this, you will have to click on \u201cEarn\u201d from the top of the screen.\n\nStep 3: Click on Ethereum\n\nThen, you should see multiple cryptocurrencies available, each having a dropdown. Click on \u201cEthereum.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Click on \u201cETH Staking\u201d\n\nThen, you will see the staking option.\n\nStep 5: Start Staking Ethereum\n\nAfter you click on \u201cETH Staking,\u201d you will be able to stake your Ethereum coins as desired. You will also notice the reference APR, the conversion ratio, and the total value staked on Binance.\n\nOf course, it is essential to note that you must hold ETH to stake it on Binance or any other platform. So, if you do not hold it yet, you can purchase it directly on Binance.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase is the 2nd largest crypto exchange on the market, being available almost worldwide and offering numerous trading services. Coinbase allows users to buy, sell, and trade over 250 cryptocurrencies through 2 main platforms: Coinbase Simple Trade and Coinbase Advanced Trade .\n\nStaking on Coinbase is pretty easy. The platform is user-friendly, and the staking feature is not significantly more complicated than other processes supported by the Coinbase exchange.\n\nOnce you have some ETH coins in your account, you can start staking it and earn ETH staking rewards. The estimated reward rate for Ethereum staking is 3.49%. Thus, depending on your holdings and the amount you lock up, you can earn approximately 3.49% of the amount of staked ETH.\n\nKraken\n\nKraken is one of the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and exchange over 220 cryptocurrencies, including the most popular, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the staking feature is a little affected at the moment by a lawsuit filed by the SEC against Kraken at the beginning of the year, the crypto exchange still offers staking for various cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Cosmos (ATOM), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), or Tron (TRX). However, it is essential to note that the feature is still not available for US citizens.\n\nStill, if you want to earn rewards by staking ETH, you can use Kraken, as the platform is extremely intuitive, so the process should not take too much. The yearly rewards for Ethereum staking range between 3% and 6%, depending on the amount of staked ETH and the period you decide to lock up your coins.\n\nCrypto Wallets\n\nStaking Ethereum through crypto wallets is as easy as with crypto exchanges. Things do not differ that much, the main requirement being to hold some ETH coins in your account. At the moment, numerous wallets allow users to stake ETH, some of the most popular being MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetaMask may be one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets on the market. It is available as a web browser extension (available on Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Opera) and a mobile app (available on Android and iOS devices), and users usually praise the wallet for its user-friendliness. MetaMask allows you to stake crypto on both its extension and app.\n\nIn the app, for instance, you have to go to the \u201cExplore\u201d section and search for \u201cMetaMask Portfolio.\u201d Afterward, all you have to do is access the MetaMask dashboard and tap on \u201cStake.\u201d Then, you can select Ethereum and choose a platform.\n\nAt the moment, you can choose from Lido and Rocket Pool. The rewards differ, too. Lido offers rewards of up to 3.83%, while Rocket Pool has a reward rate of approximately 3.65%.\n\nMyEtherWallet\n\nMyEtherWallet is one of the best Ethereum wallets on the market, supporting all ERC-20 and ERC-271 tokens. On MyEtherWallet, users can buy, sell, swap, and exchange crypto seamlessly, thanks to the user-friendly platform provided by the company. The wallet is free to use, and investors are required to support network fees.\n\nMyEtherWallet also allows users to stake ETH on the platform, offering 2 types of staking. Users can choose to run a validator node or stake smaller amounts of ETH through pooled or liquid staking.\n\nUsers can check their rewards on the MyEtherWallet platform, which is available on web and mobile devices. The rewards vary depending on the amount of staked ETH and the lock-up period.\n\nSolo Staking\n\nAlso called \u201cnative staking,\u201d solo staking brings you the most significant rewards, but there is a catch: to be a solo staker, you have to get your own validator node, and this requires 32 ETH. Now, for some users, such an amount of crypto may be too much, considering that ETH exceeded $2,000.\n\nHowever, solo staking is quite profitable, and the hardware required for this type of staking is not that expensive, especially compared to the hardware you need to mine crypto.\n\nIf you decide to stake ETH on your own, you will have to do all the work. Solo Ethereum validators will have to wait a little bit more to earn rewards, as they also have to go through an activation process enforced by the protocol. The process might take a few days, but in some cases, it can also take a couple of weeks.\n\nOverall, solo staking is considered to be the least risky staking option, considering that you have full control over your staked ETH and validator rewards.\n\nStaking as a Service (SaaS)\n\nIf you hold at least 32 ETH and want to earn native block rewards but do not want to get directly involved with the staking process, you can choose SaaS (Staking as a Service). There are certain staking platforms that can manage the validator on your behalf.\n\nOf course, if you choose to do this through such staking services, you will have to pay a little commission to the company managing your validator. All in all, staking-as-a-service is a great option for those who aim to earn crypto through staking but do not have the time or the right hardware to do it themselves.\n\nOf course, once you give your ETH to a SaaS platform, the entire staking process becomes a little less safe. However, just like with any other crypto-related process, we strongly advise you to research the platforms available and choose the safest option.\n\nWith so many crypto platforms out there, you will surely find a trustworthy platform to manage the staking process for you.\n\nPooled Staking\n\nIf you do not have 32 ETH, you can join a staking pool, where users\u2019 ETH coins are combined to get the total required for running a staking node. Pooled staking platforms offer many users the opportunity to join the Ethereum ecosystem without the burden of having to purchase 32 ETH (approximately $70,630).\n\nWhile the Ethereum network does not directly support pooled staking, there are various platforms that allow you to join staking pools in no time. This way, that platform will be responsible for activating and deactivating validators according to deposits and withdrawals. Furthermore, they will have to manage and ensure that it supports the pool.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking is similar to pooled staking, but there are some differences worth considering. This staking method implies staking your coins into a pool, but the reward part is entirely different.\n\nIn liquid staking, rewards are distributed to users based on their percentage ownership. However, you will not receive tokens but transferable receipt tokens (also called liquid staking tokens). These tokens will act as proof of ownership and will allow you to withdraw your funds.\n\nKeep in mind that many consider liquid staking to be one of the riskiest staking methods, as it implies counterparty risks with the transferable receipt. However, once you get the ETH staked to a safe place, everything should be under control.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nStaking Ethereum is a great opportunity to earn passive income by locking up the coins you already hold for as much time as you want. With so many staking options, it may seem hard to choose the best option for your funds.\n\nSolo staking requires more advanced hardware and a minimum of 32 ETH to become a validator. However, with pooled or liquid staking, things get a whole lot easier.\n\nFurthermore, if you hold 32 ETH, you can choose staking-as-a-service, and a staking provider will manage your funds and complete the staking process.\n\nBesides, you can always consider staking through a crypto exchange or wallet, as many such platforms also provide staking services. On exchanges and wallets, things get a lot easier, but there is a possibility that the rewards will decrease once you choose such a staking method.\n\nShare this Post Twitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n* The information in this article and the links provided are for general information purposes only and should not constitute any financial or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price is recovering losses above $2,220. ETH could gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above the $2,285 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh increase above the $2,180 and $2,200 levels.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major declining channel with resistance near $2,215 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a strong increase if there is a close above $2,285 and $2,300.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price remained supported above the $2,100 zone. ETH formed a base and was able to start a recovery wave above the $2,150 resistance zone, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a decent increase above the $2,180 resistance zone. Besides, there was a break above a major declining channel with resistance near $2,215 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair cleared the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,378 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,285 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,378 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,350 level. The main resistance is now near $2,400. A clear move above the $2,400 zone could send the price toward the $2,500 level. The next resistance sits at $2,580. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,640 level.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,285 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,230 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $2,180. The main support is now near $2,120. A downside break below $2,120 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,000 support. Any more losses might call for a test of the $1,880 support zone in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,230\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,285\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Although investors \u2018have been heavily\u2019 allocating to Solana throughout 2023, Ethereum will still be the top smart contracts platform in 2024, Coinbase says.\n\nIn a new report titled \u201c2024 Crypto Market Outlook,\u201d Coinbase noted that throughout 2023, net fund inflows to Solana-related (SOL) investment funds were second only to Bitcoin (BTC), surpassing Ethereum (ETH) and other multi-asset funds flows.\n\nAnalysts at the U.S.-based crypto exchange attributed the surge in Solana investment to the network\u2019s ability to handle high transaction volumes and low fees, which they say are necessary to support a new wave of highly performant applications.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we believe that improved transaction throughput and lower fees are necessary to improve UX to onboard a series of new use cases, and Solana has an early lead in that regard.\u201d Coinbase\n\nDespite the growing popularity of Solana, Ethereum is still the most important smart contract platform in the cryptocurrency space, Coinbase noted. Processing an average of around 1 million transactions per day and maintaining a consistent daily transfer volume between $1 billion and $3 billion, Ethereum\u2019s status as the top platform for decentralized applications \u201cmay not be displaced anytime soon,\u201d Coinbase claims.\n\nAs of press time, ETH is trading at $2,280, demonstrating a 91% year-to-date increase, according to CoinGecko data. Solana\u2019s SOL is trading at $78.3 with a staggering 697% increase in 2023.\n\nCoinbase noted, though, that while Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space is likely to persist in the near future, Solana\u2019s scalability and performance could make it a viable alternative for some use cases in 2024.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s experts added that in addition to Solana, a group of other layer-1 networks such as Aptos, Sui, Sei, and others are likely to increase competition in the space as they \u201chandle scalability demands at the base layer.\u201d\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "While many investors have rejoiced at Bitcoin\u2019s recent price upswings, others are betting that crypto\u2019s second fiddle, Ether, will actually be the big winner of 2024.\n\nWhile loud voices on Crypto Twitter have predicted the start of another bull run with Bitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence, JPMorgan analysts just wrote in a new report that the coin is overbought.\n\nThe report took aim at one of the biggest drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s recent rosy performance: the possibility that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve several spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January.\n\nSome have predicted that the approval of spot ETFs from TradFi firms like BlackRock and Fidelity will drive billions of dollars of inflows to Bitcoin, but JPMorgan said this optimism is misplaced.\n\nThe bank pointed to weak demand for existing spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada as evidence that the investment vehicle could fail to garner significant traction in the U.S. Instead of bringing in fresh capital, spot ETFs are likely to instead draw from capital already invested in Bitcoin-backed vehicles such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs, or Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nIf the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, in particular, is allowed to become a spot ETF, existing investors could take profits and remove as much as $2.7 billion from the exchange-traded fund. That could severely dent prices, the report said.\n\n\u2018Recapture market share\u2019\n\nThe report also claims that the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which will cut the mining reward in half, has already been priced in and will not give the coin the boost some expect.\n\nOn the other hand, the JPMorgan report said Ether could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 owing in part to an upcoming upgrade to the underlying Ethereum blockchain dubbed EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding. The update is meant to increase throughput and decrease gas fees charged to those who execute transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nAs crypto prices have fallen over the past several months, funding dollars have dried up, and some VCs have cut the valuations of some of their biggest crypto bets by double digits. JPMorgan said it\u2019s seen a \u201creinvigoration\u201d of VC funding this quarter, although it still looks preliminary.\n\nStill, analysts think a revival in venture capital activity in the crypto industry could make a meaningful difference. \u201cTo the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024,\u201d the report continued, \u201cthat would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the Crypto Winter.\u201d"

        "title": "Native Bitcoin Staking on Ethereum and Solana Could Soon Be a Reality - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere are a few essential truths that govern accepted thinking about blockchain networks. One such truth is that, without compromises like wrapped tokens and blockchain bridges, proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum and proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are tantamount to water and oil: They just don\u2019t mix.\n\nNow, a new startup led by a Stanford professor and a former Dolby engineer is attempting to disprove that. Babylon, a project that seeks to allow users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) to validate nodes on a variety of proof-of-stake networks including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, is already well on its way to achieving its improbable-sounding goal.\n\nThe company just raised an $18 million funding round co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC, with participation from funds including Framework Ventures, Polygon Ventures, OKX Ventures, and Castle Island Ventures. It is also in ongoing conversations with multiple blockchain networks about integrating its services, including Polygon, a Polygon Labs spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow could it be possible, even theoretically, for someone to stake BTC\u2014actual BTC, not a wrapped token that utilizes a blockchain bridge\u2014on a proof-of-stake network? Proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum utilize smart contracts to govern the staking process, which rewards users who deposit a certain amount of ETH with rewards accrued over time.\n\nIn return, these ETH deposits are used to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. The entire staking process represents an intricate web of if/then conditions executed automatically by a smart contract.\n\nSmart contracts, however, are not natively supported on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014but Babylon says it\u2019s found a workaround.\n\nThe solution relies in part on Bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctime lock\u201d mechanism, which allows users to deposit a certain amount of BTC for a certain period, then withdraw it after that period without depending on a third party. But Babylon also had to find a way to get around the pesky smart contract problem.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for staking is that the stake is a collateral,\u201d David Tse, an engineering professor at Stanford who co-founded Babylon, told Decrypt. \u201cIn other words, I have to be able to slash the Bitcoin when the validator on the proof-of-stake chain is doing something bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTypically, a smart contract would either release collateralized funds to a staker if all conditions were met, or burn (or slash) those funds if they hadn\u2019t been. Tse says his team has been able to replicate that process on the Bitcoin network without smart contracts.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a way to use the existing Bitcoin scripting language to effect the slashing,\u201d Tse said. \u201cThat is the main innovation of the project.\u201d\n\nIf Tse and his team have in fact gotten this right\u2014he says they still have a bit of final tweaking to do on the technology\u2014then the potential upside is enormous.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains of all sorts could tap into the $838 billion worth of incredibly secure Bitcoin already in circulation to validate their transactions. That innovation would be an all-but-certain path to deflation for any proof-of-stake network, that would no longer have to issue so many new tokens in order to incentivize validation.\n\n\u201cThe Cosmos hub is paying about 10%\u2014inflating the token 10%\u2014to pay for Cosmos\u2019 security,\u201d Tse said, giving an example. \u201cBy bringing in Bitcoin, it can potentially lower the cost of security quite a bit, because Bitcoin is a much larger supply of capital.\u201d\n\nBabylon won\u2019t be able to provide its technology to any given proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem until that blockchain\u2019s governance gives consent. So, at the moment, the company\u2019s vision is still theoretical.\n\nBut Babylon is, as mentioned above, currently in serious conversations with major proof-of-stake blockchains like Polygon\u2014and also has already received the blessing of industry leaders including Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.\n\n\u201cBabylon's vision aligns with our commitment to fostering decentralized ecosystems by offering diverse options for communities to seamlessly choose from,\u201d Nailwal said in a statement. \u201cWe are enthusiastic about the positive impact this collaboration will bring to the wider blockchain community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf (or when) proof-of-stake networks like Polygon begin adopting Babylon\u2019s novel technology, they may create new parameters for what it means to stake BTC on their chain as opposed to the network\u2019s native token.\n\nEthereum, for example, may not require the minimum amount of BTC needed to stake on the network to equal 32 ETH, the system\u2019s current requirement. It might also elect to offer a lower rewards return rate for BTC stakers.\n\nEven if proof-of-stake networks that eventually work with Babylon opt to make such choices, though, the demand for receiving any sort of passive, guaranteed return on Bitcoin will likely be immensely attractive to BTC holders around the world.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "SEC Delays Decision on Invesco Galaxy\u2019s Ethereum ETF Until February 2024\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Invesco Galaxy\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, with a new decision to be made in 2024.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s latest filing, the decision, initially expected by December 23, 2023, has been delayed to allow the Commission more time to review the proposal. The new deadline is Feb. 6, 2024.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d wrote the SEC in the filing.\n\nThe SEC has designated the new deadline \u201cas the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d\n\nTrend of Ethereum ETF Applications\n\n\n\nIn September, Invesco and Galaxy Digital filed the form for the application of the spot Ethereum ETF. According to the S-1 registration statement, their ETF aims to \u201creflect the performance of the spot price of ether\u201d by holding units of the crypto with a separate custodian.\n\nAs of today, major financial institutions including BlackRock, ARK, Fidelity, VanEck and Hashdex have filed spot Ethereum ETF applications with the SEC, all pending final decisions.\n\nSEC Holds Meetings with Major Bitcoin ETF Issuers\n\n\n\nRecent filings indicated that the SEC has been meeting with major Bitcoin ETF issuers and including BlackRock, Grayscale, Franklin, and Fidelity. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the meetings have brought renewed momentum to the discussion of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nWith the SEC set to make a decision on BlackRock\u2019s application by mid-January, these discussions are critical. The repeated engagements and strategic amendments to applications, such as BlackRock\u2019s inclusion of cash purchases for new fund shares, reflect a concerted effort to align with regulatory expectations.\n\nSeyffart suggests that the SEC might consider simultaneous approvals for multiple applications to ensure a level playing field among competitors. As the SEC\u2019s review process continues, the crypto community awaits what could be a landmark decision in the history of cryptocurrencies."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary trader and investor Peter Brandt has once again shown he is not a fan of Ethereum (ETH), with a mind-numbing forecast about the coin\u2019s future. According to Peter Brandt, he did not foresee Ethereum living up to be a listed digital currency in the next 10 years, a rather gloomy projection for a coin that is currently the second largest, after Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands for $2,269.34, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours and by more than 3.7% in the trailing seven-day period. While Peter Brandt's decade prediction of Ethereum is a major concern to note, his differing position stems from the belief that the digital currency is not a worthy store of value.\n\nIn his post on X, Peter Brandt said ETH is not a comparable store of value when placed side by side with Bitcoin, and he acknowledged not understanding why traders often choose to HODL the coin.\n\nEther $ETH is not comparable to $BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC\n\nAnd the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\n\nMy prediction is that ETH may not even be a listed asset in 10 years https://t.co/4WQ7wnFWEO \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 14, 2023\n\nTo Peter Brandt, the bad functionality of Ethereum and the skyrocketing gas fees might eventually be its demise in the long run. With how relatively unusable ETH is, Brandt boldly labeled the asset as a \"piece of junk.\"\n\nEthereum on radar of most experts\n\nThe fact that Ethereum pioneered a different aspect of the industry makes it a subject of comparison for many experts in the space.\n\nBesides the gloom shared by Peter Brandt, Raoul Pal also waded into the Ethereum versus Solana debate recently. The top analyst labeled Ethereum as the Android of the crypto ecosystem while naming Solana as the iOS of the industry.\n\nUnlike Brandt, many experts foresee a brighter future for Ethereum, especially as it currently powers some of the most innovative layer-2 protocols in the industry, including Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), among others."

        "content": "The latest report from Coinbase indicates that despite the emergence of competing networks like Solana, Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum presently accounts for around 57% of the total value locked in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with its market capitalization being second only to that of Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Resilient Position\n\nCoinbase\u2019s 2024 Crypto Market Outlook reveals that Ethereum is still leading in the smart contract space.\n\nDespite the rapid expansion of Layer-2 scaling solutions and the emergence of new rollup stacks, Ethereum\u2019s mainnet remains a hub of activity. The report highlights that these Layer-2 solutions are vying more with alternative Layer-1 platforms rather than detracting from Ethereum.\n\nNotably, the share of Ethereum (ETH) locked on rollup-linked bridges has surged, showing its steadfast position even as the landscape shifts.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, JPMorgan\u2019s analysis projects a bright future for Ethereum. They predict a sustained market presence and a potential increase in Ethereum\u2019s market share within the crypto ecosystem, possibly even outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is supported by the anticipated Proto-danksharding upgrade, set for release in the first half of 2024. This upgrade, pivotal for Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency, is particularly beneficial for Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe upgrade aims to improve the efficiency of these networks by promising to increase network throughput and decrease transaction fees.\n\nThe Rise of Solana\n\nOn the other hand, Solana has been getting attention for its potential rise. According to Finbold\u2019s report, Solana is expected to continue its upward trajectory, potentially reaching 10% of Ethereum\u2019s market cap, a milestone previously achieved.\n\nThis projection is based on Solana\u2019s transaction speed and scalability, which outpaces Ethereum. Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has also been on a steady rise, reaching a new yearly peak in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nThese factors feed into the narrative that Solana might eclipse Ethereum in future bull markets, particularly in areas demanding high throughput, like decentralized exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s landscape continues to diversify, with each platform establishing its niche based on distinct strengths and capabilities.\n\nEthereum\u2019s anticipated upgrades and sustained dominance in the DeFi space solidify its position as a key player. However, the agility and scalability of Solana present a compelling narrative for its potential expansion in the years ahead."

        "title": "Ethereum Supply Turns Deflationary Post-Merge, Here\u2019s How Much ETH Has Left Circulation - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has seen its deflationary status once again in the limelight as the network continues to see a significant decline in the number of ETH tokens in circulation. This comes on the back of the belief that the bull run and some other factors could help uphold this trend.\n\nMore ETH Goes Out Of Circulation\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound Money, Ethereum has seen a decrease in its circulating supply in the last seven days, with over 14,160 ETH going out of circulation. This is a result of over 30,700 being burned during this period while only just over 16,500 ETH have been issued during this same timeframe.\n\nThis development continues a growing trend where the number of tokens being burned outpaces the number of tokens being issued. NewsBTC had reported earlier this month how over 106,000 ETH had been burned in the last 30 days (between November 4 and December 4). At the same time, only just over 70,000 ETH had been issued.\n\nThis deflationary trend has been attributed to the increasing number of validators exiting the Ethereum ecosystem. This trend is said to have begun at the start of October. Glassnode noted that the average number of validators exiting per day surged from 309 to 1018 validators per day at the start of October.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only contributing factor, as network activity on Ethereum has picked up significantly. According to data from Etherscan, the daily number of transactions on the network has stood over a million in the last seven days. This has caused a spike in gas fees, causing more ETH to be burned with the EIP-1559 protocol.\n\nETH price rises above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Deflationary Trend Expected To Continue\n\nIt is no coincidence that network activity on Ethereum has picked up as many continue to position themselves ahead of the imminent bull run, which is projected to kickstart in 2024. The recent surge in the trading volume of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum has also been a big factor. This is expected to continue once the bull market takes its full course.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the fact that more liquidity is expected to flow into the Ethereum ecosystem if the pending Ethereum Spot ETFs applications get approved. This would likely spark a further increase in the trading activity on the network as many will look to invest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nETH investors will undoubtedly be delighted at the fact that the future trajectory of ETH looks bullish. One can expect the crypto token\u2019s value to rise as it continues to maintain this deflationary status. The less ETH in circulation, the more valuable it likely will be.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,270, up by over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Coinpedia, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In the ongoing debate of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, renowned market trader Peter Brandt has expressed significant doubts about Ethereum\u2019s future, contrasting sharply with other market experts. Brandt, known for his blunt analysis, questioned Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability, particularly in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nPeter Brandt Predicts Dim Future for Ethereum\n\nBrandt, a respected figure in market trading circles, has openly criticized Ethereum, challenging the popular notion that it might soon outpace Bitcoin. He raised a fundamental question regarding investors\u2019 preference for Ethereum over Bitcoin, which he sees as a superior store of value. His comments come amidst bullish forecasts from other market experts and institutions, including JPMorgan. These predictions often highlight Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, especially with its upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Protodanksharding.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Brandt\u2019s skepticism about Ethereum is rooted in its structural and functional aspects. He specifically pointed out the high transaction fees, or \u2018gas fees,\u2019 associated with Ethereum, labelling the digital currency as inefficient. These fees, in his view, severely detract from Ethereum\u2019s value as an investment asset. Furthermore, he controversially suggested that Ethereum might lose its relevance entirely within the next decade.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Fate Tied to Key Price Level\n\nBrandt\u2019s stance starkly contrasts with other leading analysts like Raoul Pal, who have a more favorable outlook on Ethereum. Despite differing opinions, Brandt acknowledged his respect for these analysts but did not waver from his critical perspective.\n\nIn his analysis, Brandt emphasized the importance of the ETH/BTC price chart. He pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s future could hinge on its performance relative to Bitcoin, specifically if it manages to maintain above the 0.04803 level. Should this level hold, Brandt conceded that the \u201cimminent funeral\u201d for Ethereum could be postponed, albeit temporarily.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Brandt has expressed skepticism about Ethereum. In previous statements, he has questioned its decentralization and even referred to it as a \u201cpiece of crap\u201d cryptocurrency. His consistent critique of Ethereum has been a topic of discussion in trading circles, influencing perceptions among investors.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Price Prediction As Bull Trap Puts $ETH At Risk of 12% Drop"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have welcomed massive capital inflows, a move that can greatly impact the prices of both coins.\n\nAccording to insights shared by top market analyst, Ali Martinez, a total of $19.7 billion flowed into Bitcoin and Ethereum today. He posited that the last time this enormous capital entered the market was in December 2020, a period when the price of Bitcoin grew astronomically from $18,000 to $65,000 respectively.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are bullish at the moment. While Bitcoin is priced at $42,455.71, up 2.64% in 24 hours with a market cap of $830,279,319,394, Ethereum has grown 3.83% to $2,268.96 atop a market valuation of $272,882,507,263. With volatility high for both coins, trading volumes are considerably elevated.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDynamic Shift in Capital Inflows\n\nThe chart shared by the analyst showcased the interesting twist in the coins\u2019 flow balance. According to the chart, as of December 11, 2020, when the price of BTC was $18,079.31, the coin\u2019s positive 30-day Capital inflows came in at $22,244,699,464.21, while the Negative 30-day Capital Outflows stayed unchanged at $0.\n\nThe data at the time also showed that the BTC and Ethereum Net Position Change was $19,598,379,734.19, while the stablecoin Net Position Change was pegged at $2,646,319,730.02.\n\nShortly after the market recorded these figures, the price of Bitcoin rallied to the all-time high of $69,000, represented by the dark lines on the chart displayed by the analyst.\n\nAt the moment, similar statistics are visible with the Positive 30-day Capital Inflow coming in slightly higher at $22,343,091,198.64. Should history choose to repeat itself and BTC decide to trail a similar path as the 2020 cycle, achieving many of the conservative price targets above $100,000 by some market experts may be feasible.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin ETF Catalyst\n\nThis data insight comes at a time when the broader digital currency ecosystem is getting set for the emergence of a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product.\n\nWhile the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not given a green light to the numerous applications on its desk, the hype is high considering the positive communication between the regulator and some of the applicants.\n\nShould the SEC approve the product, it might usher in billions in capital into the market, a move that will also impact price surge."

        "content": "In a new development for the tokenization ecosystem, the ERC3643 standard has achieved \u2018Final\u2019 status in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP). The EIP process, essential for proposing and implementing upgrades, features, and standards, has seen the ERC3643 standard join the ranks of influential protocols like ERC20 and ERC721. What sets ERC3643 apart is its specialization in compliant tokenization, addressing the limitations of the widely-used ERC20 standard, particularly in the realm of securities activities.\n\nUnlike ERC20, ERC3643 integrates controlled advanced functions and compliance modules, making it the permissioned token standard for a wide array of use cases, including securities, real-world assets, payment systems, and loyalty programs. The standard dynamically verifies user eligibility through a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, ensuring compliance via anonymous but verifiable credentials. This empowers token issuers with continuous control over tokens, facilitating governance and adherence to regulatory requirements.\n\nThe association emphasizes that achieving \u2018Final\u2019 status for ERC3643 is a testament to their commitment to providing a robust standard for enterprises seeking to deploy permissioned tokens on any EVM-compatible blockchain efficiently and compliantly. This achievement is poised to enhance collaboration and interoperability, aligning with the overarching goals of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe ERC3643 standard is positioned to redefine how enterprises engage with blockchain technology, offering a secure and compliant framework for tokenizing diverse assets. Its recognition as an official standard underscores the Ethereum community\u2019s dedication to meeting the diverse needs of its users and establishing a benchmark for institutions looking to leverage ERC3643 for their tokenization initiatives.\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into the ERC3643 EIP, further information is available on the association\u2019s platform.\n\nAbout ERC3643 Association\n\nThe ERC3643 Association is a non-profit organization regrouping industry leaders within a shared mission to advance the adoption of the ERC3643 standard and promote the development of a standardized, secure, and compliant tokenization framework. The association brings together the expertise and resources of its members to foster collaboration, drive innovation, and create a more inclusive, efficient, and secure financial landscape. By supporting the widespread adoption of the ERC3643 standard, the association aims to unlock the full potential of tokenization and pave the way for a new era of global asset management.\n\nRead other stories: Pave Bank Emerges with $5.2 Million Funding to Pioneer Programmable Banking\n\nProject Diamond Launches Smart Contract Platform for Digitally Native Assets"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's price trajectory has been the subject of intense scrutiny and speculation, especially as it shows numerous reversal signs. Chart analysis suggests that the middle of January 2024 could be when Ethereum potentially hits the coveted $2,500 price mark. However, like any projection on the volatile market, this comes with significant caveats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA study of Ethereum's price performance, as depicted in the recent ETH/USDT chart, shows a robust uptrend with high momentum. This is corroborated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, although retreating from overbought territory, remains strong, indicating sustained buying interest. The moving averages (MAs) \u2014 key indicators of long-term trends \u2014 demonstrate a bullish crossover, with shorter-term MAs traversing above longer-term ones, signaling ongoing upward momentum.\n\nSpecifically, the separation between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages is widening, a classic confirmation of a strong trend. However, this separation could also precede a long-term correction, particularly if it continues to expand without price consolidation. Additionally, descending volume accompanying recent price spikes raises concerns. Robust volume is a hallmark of sustainable price movements, and without it, the likelihood of a retracement increases.\n\nGiven these factors, mid-January 2024 stands out as a pivotal moment for Ethereum. Should the current momentum persist, and if volume picks up to validate the trend, reaching $2,500 is possible. This projection assumes that the current support levels hold firm and that buyer interest continues unabated.\n\nHowever, investors should heed the warning signs. The descending volume is the primary indicator to watch after as it may bring some issues and cause a drop of momentum in the future. Moreover, the potential for a long-term correction looms if the market perceives the price has outpaced fundamentals."

        "content": "Ethereum is poised to reassert itself and outperform other cryptocurrencies in 2024 according to analysts at JPMorgan.\n\nThe key driver will be Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated EIP-4844 upgrade, dubbed Protodanksharding, slated for rollout in the first half of next year.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 (Protodanksharding) upgrade in 2024 will likely boost Ethereum\u2019s network activity and help it outperform other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nFactors seen as bullish for Bitcoin in 2024 like spot ETF approvals and the halving event are already priced into Bitcoin\u2019s current value according to JPMorgan.\n\nDecentralized finance continues to struggle to make inroads into traditional finance due to issues like regulation, technical challenges, and lack of cooperation.\n\nVenture capital funding improved slightly in crypto in Q4 2022 but the recovery seems tentative; steady gains in Q1 2024 could signal the end of the crypto winter.\n\nDespite CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s Bitcoin criticism, JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain unit Onyx continues to grow rapidly underscoring the bank\u2019s ongoing blockchain focus.\n\nThis upgrade will act as a stepping stone toward full Danksharding on Ethereum, a more efficient form of sharding. While originally Ethereum looked to shard by splitting the network into fragments, Danksharding uses temporary data blobs attached to blocks capable of holding more data without altering Ethereum\u2019s block size or permanently storing data on-chain.\n\nCrucially, these data blobs can enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum like Arbitrum and Optimism. By providing additional temporary data capacity, Protodanksharding will enable Layer 2s to increase throughput and lower transaction fees without changing Ethereum itself. This boost to Layer 2 network activity is what will help drive Ethereum\u2019s outperformance, per JPMorgan.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin in 2024 faces headwinds that could limit major gains. JPMorgan cautions that presumed 2024 tailwinds like ETF approvals and the upcoming halving are likely already accounted for in Bitcoin\u2019s current price. After previous halvings slowed Bitcoin\u2019s market price growth relative to production costs, a comparable deceleration after the 2024 halving would make sense. With Bitcoin\u2019s price already trading around twice production costs, much halving-related upside seems eliminated.\n\nBeyond technical upgrades, crypto as an asset class still confronts adoption challenges. Decentralized finance\u2019s inability to make traction in mainstream banking and finance persists as a disappointment for JPMorgan.\n\nMajor traditional financial applications of blockchain technology continue to operate on private chains, not public ones. Meanwhile tokenization remains experimental thanks to lacking regulations, uncoordinated technologies, and hesitation around central bank digital currencies."

Also, the Bitcoin (BTC) halving is already priced in and will likely have no further price impact, according to Chase Bank.\n\nThe report\u2019s prediction pivoted from general crypto-native sentiment, which has espoused bullish remarks amid hopes of billion-dollar inflows into BTC following the SEC\u2019s potential nod.\n\nInstead, JPMorgan opined that successfully launching spot BTC ETFs would divert capital from existing Bitcoin-based products like futures ETFs, mining operations, and Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe heavyweight bank also said GBTC\u2019s conversion into a spot ETF could induce $2.7 billion worth of sell pressure from long-standing Grayscale customer looking to cash in early on their faith in the company.\n\nVeChain CEO Sunny Lu said crypto regulations would likely impact the markets more than BTC\u2019s halving. However, Lu argued that an ETF decision should not be understated.\n\nThe impact regulation is having on the market is becoming more significant than the impact of Bitcoin halving. The attention of the entire crypto market is on ETF progress for Bitcoin spot, which I believe may be the biggest milestone in bitcoin and crypto\u2019s history.

The bank supported this assertion by citing forthcoming technological upgrades to reduce gas fees and boost throughput.\n\nThe upgrades are part of EIP-4844, an Ethereum improvement proposal focused on proto-danksharding.\n\nWe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem. JPMorgan Analysts\n\nJPMorgan researchers shared these thoughts weeks before January 2024, when some believe the SEC could approve the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. SEC chairman Gary Gensler recently dodged answering questions on the subject, while experts surmised that approvals are a matter of when, not if.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surge in volatility as the digital assets Bitcoin and Ethereum entered into a minor correction. This pullback has plunged the ETH price from a recent top of $2400 to $2238, registering a 7.4% loss. However, this retracement lies within the range of a rising channel pattern and projects the recovery is intact.\n\nAlso Read: Peter Brandt Stirs Debate with Harsh Critique of Ethereum\n\nadvertisement\n\nChannel Pattern Hints Next Jump Above $2500\n\nA channel pattern leads the current recovery trend in the ETH price\n\nUntil the pattern\u2019s lower trendline is intact, the coin holders can enjoy the bull rally\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nSince mid-October, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a robust recovery, beginning with a rebound from the $1522 support level. This rally is best understood through the lens of a channel pattern, characterized by two ascending trendlines that have been providing dynamic resistance and support to the price movements.\n\nOn December 13th, the Ethereum price marked its latest recovery from the lower trendline of this pattern, evidenced by a morning star candle formation. This reversal propelled the price to its current level of $2243, signaling the onset of a new bull cycle within the confines of the channel pattern.\n\nIf the ETH price continues to adhere to the trajectory set by this channel pattern, we could see a 12-15% surge, potentially reaching the upper trendline in the region of $2500 to $2600. As long as these two trendlines remain intact, Ethereum is likely to maintain its upward trajectory, albeit with minor pullbacks along the way.\n\nHowever, a breakout above the channel\u2019s resistance could significantly amplify buying momentum, potentially leading to a more substantial recovery. In such a scenario, initial targets could be set at $2730, with a further potential rise to $3260, marking key milestones in Ether\u2019s bullish journey\n\nCan ETH Price Fall Back to $2000\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum price seems strongly bullish, the rising channel pattern in a strong rally can commonly lead to a decisive breakdown from the lower trendline. This breakdown would likely intensify the selling pressure and trigger a significant correction in ETH price. Thus, under the influence of this pattern, the Ethereum coin may revisit $2000 coin again\n\nBollinger band: Despite the current retracement in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator , indicates the recovery momentum is active.\n\nRelative Strength Index: A lower high formation in the daily RSI slope reflects the weakening of buyers\u2019 strength in the market."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently garnered significant attention after experiencing a substantial rally over the past month. However, this surge encountered a hurdle around the $2,100 mark last Friday, creating a triple-top pattern and prompting a reversal in its upward trajectory.\n\nDespite this temporary setback, the Ethereum market has witnessed a noteworthy trend in institutional interest, a phenomenon that has become more pronounced in the month of November 2023. According to Woominkyu, an analyst at Cryptoquant, a leading crypto analytics firm, institutional holdings of Ethereum have seen an unprecedented surge. This surge in institutional interest coincides with Ethereum\u2019s price stabilization in the range of $1,800 to $1,900.\n\nWoominkyu highlighted this development in a post, stating, \u201cThe surge in institutional Ethereum holdings signals a growing interest from institutional investors. It reflects their strong belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the market\u2019s potential for growth.\u201d\n\nInstitutional investors appear drawn to Ethereum not only due to its recent price stability and potential approval of a spot ETF but also because of the technical advancements, including the much-anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and enhanced smart contract functionalities.\n\nNotably, recent reports reveal that investors have migrated over $30 million in ether and stablecoins to Blast, a new Ethereum Layer 2 network. This influx underscores the growing demand for Layer 2 solutions that address speed, cost, and scalability issues. The protocol natively participates in Ethereum staking, with staking yields passed back to users and decentralized applications on the Layer 2 network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, insights from onchain analytics firm Glassnode further suggest that whales, particularly addresses with 10,000 or more Ethereum, have been on an accumulation spree for nine consecutive days\u2014a trend not witnessed in the past nine months. Consistent buying pressure among whales is often interpreted as a bullish signal for Ethereum\u2019s future price action.\n\nNotably, Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently emphasized Ethereum\u2019s recent achievement in surpassing the crucial resistance zone spanning from $1,982 to $2,044. According to him, this breakthrough led to a notable acquisition, with 1.67 million wallets collectively securing an impressive 38.7 million ETH. According to him, this achievement, coupled with minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, positions Ethereum favourably to reach new yearly highs.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s resilience in the face of market fluctuations, coupled with growing support for Layer 2 solutions, positions Ethereum for continued growth and adoption, which could positively impact price in the coming months. Ether was trading at $2,292 at press time after a 0.66% drop over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "This week has seen significant volatility in the Ethereum price (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value. For the first time in the previous week, the decline caused the coin\u2019s price to drop below $2,300, and it has since been trending down.\n\nEven though the overall crypto market is beginning to recover a little, it is still unclear what caused the collapse. Given that investors are closely monitoring economic indicators, there are several potential explanations for this decline. Let\u2019s dive deep into the possible causes of the latest sell-off in the cryptocurrency market and explore how Ethereum\u2019s price can make a recovery.\n\nCrypto Market Fall: An Overview\n\nFor the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2024 got off to a good start. Most cryptocurrency tokens started recording from December 2023 and continued their price rally in the first month of this year. Nonetheless, in comparison to their all-time highs, cryptocurrency prices are still trading at bargain.\n\nMoreover, the first half of 2023 has seen a wild ride in the price of cryptocurrencies. However, the last part of the latter half of the 2023 showed a promising signs for an upcoming bull market in 2024. But the question, will cryptocurrencies soar to new heights and fully overcome their losses in 2024?, remains on the back of the mind for all crypto investors.\n\nWhy is the Ethereum Price Falling?\n\nBefore going to the questions raised above, the majority of crypto enthusiasts want to know the reason behind the fall in Ethereum\u2019s price. This question becomes the talk of the town. Moving forward to the exact reason, several crypto-specific as well as other factors led to the decline in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe entire crypto market is in red as of January 2024. Contrary to what investors believed, the Bitcoin price dropped by 20% after Bitcoin ETF approval. The market price trend movements of Bitcoin always have a direct impact on the price movements of altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\nAdding to the ongoing bear price trends in the market, Celsius moved massive ETH holdings to exchanges, further causing the Ethereum price to drop. Around $35 million worth of ETH was moved from Celsius staking wallets to crypto exchange platforms like Coinbase and FalconX. This is also one of the major reasons behind the ongoing price drop of Ethereum.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Make A Recovery?\n\n\u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201d is a question that is currently making waves. There are numerous expert views present on the topic. But no one has the exact idea about the same. However, it depends on several factors.\n\nThe precise course of Ethereum\u2019s recovery is still difficult to predict, though, since different projections point to both possible ups and downs in the near future. The comeback of Ethereum is dependent on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, technological developments, and market patterns. After the fall in the price of Ethereum, a lot of analysts are still positive about the cryptocurrencies long-term prospects.\n\nWhat Factors Can Drive Ethereum\u2019s Price Up?\n\nAs we all know, Ethereum is a utility token. So, Ethereum\u2019s price is affected by a mix of general and crypto-specific factors in addition to the price of Bitcoin and other macroeconomic variables.\n\nHowever, the price of Ethereum is largely determined by supply and demand. Since ETH is now a deflationary utility token, its price may rise in the coming months due to growing scarcity and rising demand.\n\nEther Price Prediction: Will Ethereum Reach $10,000?\n\nEthereum is well-known in the cryptocurrency world and is one of the top platforms for smart contracts and decentralized apps. Investors are curious as to whether Ethereum can ever hit the incredible $10,000 price threshold.\n\nTherefore, although it is appealing to think that Ethereum might hit $10,000 in 2024, a realistic study indicates that this is a very unlikely possibility. The necessary price increase, the market capitalization at the moment, and the aftermath of the previous bear market provide formidable obstacles for Ethereum to clear in a short amount of time. Investors should use caution when making price projections and take into account the market\u2019s inherent volatility and unpredictability.\n\nIf we look at the price of Ethereum over the previous five years, it has gone through significant fluctuations. The ups and downs include the record bull run of 2017 and the bear market that followed in 2018. By going through the data, you can find out that the cryptocurrency has the potential to appreciate in value significantly, as evidenced by its recent surge in 2021. However, there is always a chance that Ethereum will hit $10,000 at some point in the future, and it is very difficult to believe that this will happen within the next six months or in 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum bull run clearly shows that the price of ETH is maintaining above-significant support levels and breaking through important resistance zones. However, how the market responds to these technical indications will determine the course of future price movements. Will Ethereum recover and reach $10,000? might have a positive response if it manages to breach the resistance encompassed by the YTD high. Investors must, however, keep a careful eye on these levels because they are a guide, not a magic bullet."

The upgrade is expected to reduce transaction costs and boost throughput, two of the key challenges faced by the ETH blockchain presently.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Etheruem has stressed the importance of reducing ETH transaction fees on several occasions during interviews. Core developers are therefore focused on tackling the challenge with EIP-4844, in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAccording to a research note by banking giant JP Morgan\u2019s analysts, this upgrade in itself is expected to boost the altcoin\u2019s adoption and help ETH outperform Bitcoin and its crypto competitors.\n\nAccording to TheBlock, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note,\n\nWe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem. The main catalyst is the EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place during the first half of 2024.\n\nEthereum price rally to $3,800 likely in 2024\n\nCrypto analyst and trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe analyzed the Ethereum price chart and predicted an ETH price rally to the range between $3,400 and $3,800 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nThe analyst notes that Ethereum price made a positive support and resistance flip at the $2,125 mark.

        "content": "Alongside their \u201ccautious\u201d outlook of the industry in the coming year, JP Morgan has predicted that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024. Moreover, they have stated the forecast despite the incoming halving event that will decrease the number of total Bitcoin tokens in circulation.\n\nUltimately, JP Morgan has highlighted \u201cexcessive optimism,\u201d as working against Bitcoin in the coming year. Additionally, analysts at the institution have noted the aforementioned halving event is \u201clargely priced in\u201d to the current value of the asset. Therefore, they are not expecting immense gains over the next year.\n\nJUST IN: JPMorgan says Ethereum will outperform #Bitcoin in 2024. December 14, 2023\n\nAlso Read: How Many Times Bitcoin Was Declared Dead in 2023?\n\nJP Morgan Unenthusiastic About Bitcoin\u2019s Prospect in 2024?\n\nFor much of 2022 and the early parts of the subsequent year, Bitcoin struggled in the mainstream. Indeed, the entire industry endured a crypto winter that saw a host of concerns regarding its ability to bounce back. Now, with just one month before 2024 arises, the excitement around the asset has never been higher.\n\nAnticipation over a potential Spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the upcoming halving have driven elation over its potential. However, one bank is not as bullish on crypto\u2019s overall positive performance throughout next year. JP Morgan has stated that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Predicts S&P 500 To Crash 25%: Here\u2019s When\n\nThe bank released an outlook on the coming year that they have called \u201ccautious\u201d considering a host of factors. Specifically, they have cited the potential for over-excitement to ultimately work against Bitcoin. Subsequently, this led the asset to be overbought in a market that has already factored in the upcoming halving event.\n\nJP Morgan highlighted how the halving event will affect miners. Indeed, they noted that based on current hash rates and Bitcoin mining difficulties, production costs should double. Additionally, they have predicted a 20% decline in the hash rate, leading miners with excessive costs to exit the market altogether. Moreover, they stated that expectations for capital inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETF products are exaggerated.\n\nConversely, they discussed Ethereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 \u201cProto-dank sharding\u201d upgrade. They discussed its potential impact on the asset\u2019s performance over the coming year especially. Yet, they still have expressed their concerns over centralized staking on the Ethereum network. If JP Morgan is correct regarding its Bitcoin concerns, the asset could greatly struggle to live up to the hype."

        "title": "JPMorgan: Ethereum to Outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "JPMorgan analysts predict that Ethereum will see massive growth in 2024, mostly thanks to its upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade. This upgrade will introduce improved sharding methods.\n\nCurrently, the crypto community is watching the Bitcoin price movement amidst hopes that it will enter a full-on bull run and reach a new price high in 2024. But according to a new report from JPMorgan, it might actually be Ethereum that will see runaway success in 2024.\n\n2024 a Big Year for Ethereum?\n\nAs per the report, Ethereum will \u201cre-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d in 2024. The main reason why JPMorgan shares this optimism is because of the incoming EIP-4844 upgrade scheduled to take place in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe EIP-4844 upgrade will see the ecosystem take on a more efficient sharding technique. Sharding involves splitting a blockchain into smaller chains so that more transactions can be processed. The EIP-4844 upgrade means that Ethereum will not split itself into smaller shards but will instead create data packets that can handle these extra transactions.\n\nThere will also be immense benefits for Ethereum Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum which will enjoy lower transaction fees and increased network capabilities.\n\nUpgrades within the Ethereum ecosystem have always been a big deal. The recent switch to a proof-of-stake consensus earned Ethereum a lot of favor with the public and the same will likely be true of the EIP-4844 upgrade. JP Morgan believes that this will lead to not just goodwill but a stronger and more successful blockchain as well.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin is being completely left behind either. JPMorgan believes that several factors, including the incoming halving and the potential approval of an ETF, will help the Bitcoin price improve. A halving typically comes with positive price movements for Bitcoin and it looks like this incoming one will be no different.\n\nThe ETF is especially interesting because it has been so heavily pursued within the industry. Many companies have applied for it over the years but BlackRock seems to be on the brink of being approved. Should the ETF go through, we can expect the price, as well as public interest in Bitcoin, to increase.\n\nIt has also been speculated that there will be some benefits for Ethereum as well. BlackRock is believed to be pursuing an Ethereum ETF if the Bitcoin ETF goes through and the token should enjoy the same benefits.\n\nThe report also noted some of the \u2018disappointments\u2019 of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, mainly its failure to embed itself in the traditional finance world. Several factors were noted as the cause of this, including a lack of regulations and the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies.\n\nWith all these considered, 2024 is shaping up to be a profitable year for the major tokens and hopefully, this will trickle down to the rest of the industry."

        "title": "Ethereum Rising User Base Boosts Revenue Projections: Predicted To Double To $5 Billion - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitwise Invest, an investment firm specializing in the crypto space, recently unveiled its anticipated crypto predictions for 2024.\n\nThese projections provide a glimpse into the future of the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting major milestones and potential breakthroughs for the largest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin Predicted To Smash Records\n\nBitwise\u2019s first prediction suggests that Bitcoin will surpass previous records and trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high. The firm attributes this bullish outlook to two key catalysts: the imminent launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) early in 2024 and the anticipated halving of new Bitcoin supply by the end of April.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise expects the spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved and to collectively become the most successful ETF launch in history.\n\nInterestingly, Bitwise also forecasts that Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, will witness its revenue double, surpassing Wall Street expectations by at least 10 times.\n\nThe firm points out that Coinbase\u2019s trading volumes typically surge during bull markets, and they anticipate a similar trend in 2024. Additionally, Bitwise highlights Coinbase\u2019s successful launch of various new products that have gained traction in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the investment firm predicts that more money will settle using stablecoins compared to traditional payment giant Visa. Bitwise highlights stablecoins as one of crypto\u2019s \u201ckiller apps\u201d and notes their remarkable growth from virtually zero to a $137 billion market in just four years. Bitwise anticipates 2024 to be another significant year for stablecoin expansion.\n\nEthereum Set For Major Breakthrough\n\nBitwise expects Ethereum\u2019s revenue to more than double from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $5 billion in 2024. The firm attributes this growth to the increasing number of users flocking to crypto applications. Bitwise emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s potential as one of the fastest-growing large-scale tech platforms globally.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise anticipates a major upgrade to Ethereum, labeled EIP-4844, which could reduce average transaction costs to below $0.01. This significant cost reduction is expected to pave the way for mainstream adoption and the development of groundbreaking applications within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBitwise\u2019s bonus prediction suggests that by the end of 2024, one in four financial advisors will allocate funds to cryptocurrencies in their clients\u2019 accounts. The firm foresees increased adoption by financial advisors once Bitcoin becomes easily accessible and mainstream.\n\nIn summary, Bitwise Invest\u2019s crypto predictions for 2024 paint an exciting future for the cryptocurrency market. With expectations of a new all-time high for Bitcoin, the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and revenue growth for industry giants like Coinbase and Ethereum, the crypto space is poised for significant advancements in the coming years.\n\nAs of the current update, ETH is trading at $2,200, reflecting a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. This positive movement follows a similar trend set by BTC. However, Ethereum has experienced a slight decline of 2.4% in the past seven days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum community has officially signed off on the ERC-3643 Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), establishing it as a recognized standard for compliant tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).\n\nAccording to a Dec. 15 announcement, the proposal reached its final status, meaning it has been formally reviewed, discussed and agreed upon within the Ethereum community. It\u2019s a similar process to the way ERC-20 and other popular standards were established in the past.\n\nEthereum Community Approves #ERC3643 as the First #Tokenization Standard\n\n\n\nWe're proud to announce that the ERC3643 standard has achieved 'Final' status in its #Ethereum Improvement Proposal (#EIP).\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://t.co/Z4XzijY6se#RWA pic.twitter.com/DhR3XmGrVU \u2014 ERC3643.org (@ERC3643Org) December 15, 2023\n\nERC-3643 is a standard for securities tokenization, RWAs, payment systems and loyalty programs. It verifies users\u2019 eligibility for a token via a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, providing anonymous yet verifiable credentials, the association behind the proposal explained.\n\nThe approved standard, which was proposed in 2021, is built on top of ERC-20 and incorporates two distinct permission layers to enhance security and compliance.\n\nThe first layer focuses on the identity and eligibility of the transaction\u2019s receiver, utilizing ERC-734/-735 standards to verify if the necessary claims are present on the identity and are authenticated by trusted claim issuers. The second layer implements global restrictions on the token itself, such as limits on daily token volume and the maximum number of token holders, providing controlled and regulated token circulation.\n\nAsset tokenization involves converting the value of a physical or digital asset into a digital token on a blockchain or distributed ledger. Possible benefits of asset tokenization include increased liquidity, faster settlements, transparency and accessibility to various markets. Real-world applications include enabling fractional trading of real estate, art, financial assets and intellectual property.\n\nManagement consulting firm Roland Berger estimates that asset tokenization will have grown to a market worth $10 trillion by 2030, a significant rise from the current value of around $300 billion.\n\nAsset tokenization is being considered by a wide range of traditional and crypto-native firms as one of the main trends in finance. Notable companies exploring the technology include JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale. Data from VanEck Research shows the total market capitalization for RWAs reached $342 billion in September despite the crypto industry\u2019s headwinds.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto \u2014 Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

        "content": "In a recent episode of The Scoop podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predict a high likelihood of the SEC approving a series of spot Bitcoin ETFs between Jan. 5-10.\n\nSeyffart and Balchunas\u2019s prediction aligns with the final deadline for the ARK and 21Shares application, initially filed in April, preceding other major players like BlackRock in June in a competitive field of 12 firms.\n\nSeyffart speculates that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been strategically delaying decisions, possibly to align multiple approvals simultaneously. This approach would prevent any single firm from gaining an unfair advantage. Seyffart warns that if the SEC were to deny these applications, it would represent a significant shift in its approach, akin to \u201cgoing nuclear.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ashcryptoreal/status/1735690467126169851\n\nYou might also like: Goldman Sachs forecasts dramatic surge in blockchain asset trading volumes by 2025\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reluctance to play kingmaker in the cryptocurrency ETF arena reflects its efforts to maintain neutrality and fairness. Seyffart, citing various sources, believes that the SEC\u2019s pattern of behavior, especially observed during the approval of ether futures ETFs earlier this year, indicates a likelihood of mass approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nThe conversation also touched on Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory against the SEC, which could influence the approval of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Seyffart notes that this case has backed the SEC into a corner, potentially accelerating approvals.\n\nHowever, the path for spot ether ETFs appears more complex, given the differences in market robustness and underlying technologies between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). While optimistic, Seyffart suggests that approvals for ether spot ETFs are more likely towards the end of May 2024, yet with less certainty compared to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYou might also like: SEC is taking \u2018new look\u2019 at spot Bitcoin ETF applications\n\nSeyffart also explains that following the SEC\u2019s 19b-4 process approval, ETFs \u201cmust have their S-1 prospectuses cleared by the SEC\u2019s Corporate Finance division before trading can commence.\u201d This process could introduce delays, adding to the uncertainty of a precise timeline for the ETFs\u2019 market debut.\n\nSeyffart anticipates a cautious initial uptake regarding market reception due to the rigorous due diligence processes of major brokerages and banks. However, he predicts that BlackRock might expedite the inclusion of these ETFs on various platforms, given its strong industry relationships.\n\nNice find here: Gensler's staff met with BlackRock yesterday to talk $IBTC but it wasn't normal crew, more public policy folks incl BlackRock's Public Policy Director Ben Tecmire who btw used to be senior counsel at the SEC's Division of Inv Mgmt https://t.co/bMePGpOufK \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 15, 2023\n\nSeyffart expressed confidence in the long-term success of these ETFs, projecting substantial capital inflows driven by both hype and the strategic interests of major asset owners.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ghost Chain? Cardano Beats Bitcoin and Ethereum as It Leads in Chain Activity - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Cardano is constantly beating the \u201cghost chain\u201d claims, recently outperforming all other networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, to top the list of blockchains in chain activity.\n\nData from crypto-focused research and analytical resource Messari confirms this feat. According to Messari, Cardano currently leads in terms of chain activity over the past 24 hours. Notably, the metric employed by the platform to gauge a network\u2019s chain activity is its on-chain transaction volume.\n\nThis metric shows that Cardano beats every other mainstream blockchain network by an impressive margin. Interestingly, Cardano\u2019s 24-hour on-chain transaction volume currently stands at $23.56 billion. Notably, this represents all the transaction volume recorded yesterday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBefore now, Cardano\u2019s on-chain transaction volume averaged $9 billion every day throughout November. However, the network started witnessing an uptick in December, surging to a high of $11.32 billion on Dec. 2. This uptick persisted, with Cardano recording $29.86 billion on Dec. 9.\n\nDespite witnessing a drop in the days that followed, Cardano has maintained an intraday on-chain volume above the $18 billion mark. The recent $23.56 billion was recorded due to a new upsurge in this metric.\n\nMeanwhile, per Messari data, Bitcoin, the leading blockchain network, comes second on the list, with $13.09 billion in on-chain transaction volume, nearly half of Cardano\u2019s figure. Ethereum, the largest smart contracts network, secures third with just $5.06 billion in transaction volume.\n\nLitecoin sees a volume of $1.51 billion, while the XRP Ledger\u2019s volume only stands at $777 million. Other blockchain networks on the top ten list include Dogecoin, Tron, Bitcoin Cash, Verge, and Stellar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nIt bears mentioning that on-chain volume is different from trading volume. Trading volume refers to the total number of shares, contracts, or assets traded on a specific market, especially on exchanges, during a given period. It is typically a measure of market activity and liquidity.\n\nOn the other hand, on-chain transaction volume involves the total number of transactions that occur on a blockchain. It includes all transactions, whether they involve trading, transfers, or other interactions within the network. On-chain transaction volume provides insights into the level of activity and usage of a blockchain.\n\nA high on-chain transaction volume indicates active use of a blockchain for various purposes, such as transfers, smart contract executions, and dApp interactions. This metric helps to evaluate the health and sustainability of a blockchain network, showcasing its utility beyond speculative trading.\n\nAmid the increased on-chain transaction volume, ADA, Cardano\u2019s native token, has witnessed an impressive price surge. ADA recently surged to a 19-month high of $0.68 today before facing opposition. Currently changing hands at $0.6349, the altcoin is up 42% over the past week."

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts, while maintaining an overall cautious stance on the cryptocurrency market, foresee Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies in market price performance by 2024.\n\nThis bullish outlook for Ethereum reflects a distinctive perspective within the institution, suggesting that the analysts see unique potential and favorable prospects for Ethereum relative to other digital assets, even amid an overall cautious sentiment towards the broader crypto landscape.\n\nIn a published note on Wednesday, a team of analysts headed by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou conveyed their expectation that Ethereum (ETH) will reclaim its prominence and regain market share within the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the upcoming year.\n\nEthereum Will Overtake Bitcoin \u2013 JPMorgan\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note.\n\nThe analysts underscored the pivotal role of the EIP-4844 upgrade, popularly known as Protodanksharding, as the primary catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s anticipated resurgence.\n\nThis crucial upgrade, scheduled for implementation in the first half of 2024, is poised to bring about substantial improvements in Ethereum\u2019s network activity.\n\nDanksharding is a more efficient sharding method for Ethereum, and protodanksharding is the first step toward its complete implementation. Danksharding sidesteps the tedious procedure of dividing Ethereum into several shard chains, as contrast to the initially intended sharding method.\n\nETH market cap currently at $273 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nData blobs, which are connected to blocks and can hold more data than blocks but are not permanently stored or accessible by the Ethereum virtual engine, are instead introduced.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan\u2019s optimistic forecast aligns with Standard Chartered\u2019s, as they previously stated in a communication that Ether might experience a 400% surge within a few years, followed by a more sustained upward movement towards $35,000.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research, expressed the viewpoint that the upward trajectory for Ether might unfold at a more gradual pace compared to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: 5x Increase\n\nDespite this potentially more extended timeframe, Kendrick envisions Ethereum eventually attaining a higher price multiple than Bitcoin relative to their current levels. Specifically, he anticipates Ethereum reaching a price multiple of 5.0x, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s expected 3.5x multiple.\n\nLayer 2 networks, such as Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), would gain the most from the upgrade, according to the JPMorgan analysts.\n\nEther seen rising to $2,426 this month. Source: Coincodex\n\nLayer 2 networks on Ethereum would benefit from the increased temporary data space, which would increase network throughput and decrease transaction fees. Data blobs improve Layer 2 network efficiency without changing the size of an Ethereum block.\n\nIn the meantime, as ether discovers new applications, demand for it will rise, and cryptocurrency-related trends will only grow. For example, the most common Ethereum use case is NFT transactions, which Kendrick believes will grow.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $2,281, up 5.0% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin was exhanging hands at $42,910, with a 2.3% increase in the same timeframe.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitwise, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, noted in its prediction for 2024 that Ethereum is poised to witness a doubling in its revenue.\n\nFurthermore, the EIP-4844 upgrade is expected to reduce the average transaction cost on Ethereum by 90%.\n\nEthereum price is maintaining a bullish macro outlook, marking a 53% rise in the past two months.\n\nWhile 2024 is expected to be Bitcoin's year in more ways than one, it will also bear a significant impact on Ethereum price and network. But in its own way, the home of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is predicted to make an impact on the market by likely improving the overall operations and financials of the network.\n\nEthereum revenue to double in 2024\n\nBitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, published its predictions for 2024. Two of these ten predictions are focused on Ethereum, making it the most in-demand network despite the rise of layer-2 chains and competitive layer-1 chains.\n\nBitwise noted that Ethereum revenue will probably double to $5 billion over the next year. Per the report, the network reported $2.3 billion in fees, i.e., revenue, which is almost half the revenue of 2022's $4.1 billion. Bitwise, in regard to this prediction noted,\n\n\"Ethereum functions like a global supercomputer, hosting thousands of crypto applications that people use every day. And in order to use those applications, you have to pay a fee using the Ethereum crypto asset. That's cash flow.\"\n\nEthereum network revenue\n\nAnother crucial prediction for 2024, the asset manager made, was that the average transaction costs on Ethereum will fall to $0.01. This prediction falls in line with the expected network upgrade going by the name of EIP-4844.\n\nThe primary goal of the proposal is to reduce the average transaction cost by 90% in order to make the network more accessible to mainstream users. According to Bitwise's report, with fees going down, Ethereum will radically increase the types of activities individuals can feasibly participate in on the network. Major product ideas like micropayments, social media, and large-scale gaming would become possible.\n\nWhether these pan out in 2024 is up to the conditions of the market at that time and the impact they would have on Ethereum price.\n\nEthereum price remains bullish\n\nEthereum price in the short-term timeframe might have noted some correction, but when it comes to the macro outlook, ETH is still bullish. The 53% increase observed in the past two months is expected to continue into 2024, potentially bringing the price to $2,500.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is exhibiting bullish signal on the 3-day chart. This bullishness might exhaust or demand some correction following the spot Bitcoin ETF approval rally.\n\nHowever, at the moment, ETH is expected to recover and flip the $2,296 resistance into support to push the price to $2,421.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nIf this breach fails, the altcoin could retrace to $2,142 and losing this support line would invalidate the bullish thesis, likely pushing ETH down to $2,000."

Discover SCENE\n\nJP Morgan has poured cold water on hopes of a crypto bull run next year, with the bank\u2019s analysts taking a \u201ccautious\u201d stance in their 2024 crypto outlook.\n\nAnalysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a newly published report that the Bitcoin halving is \u201clargely priced in,\u201d since the halving event and its effect on the Bitcoin supply are \u201cpredictable and in our opinion are well factored into the current bitcoin price.\u201d\n\nThe team argued that based on the current Bitcoin hash rate and mining difficulty, that the production cost for miners would rise from around $22,000 at present to around $44,000 post-halving.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price of around $42,000 is consistent with a 5% drop in the post-halving hash rate, which \u201cseems too low,\u201d with the team anticipating a 20% drop in the hash rate and miners with higher overheads exiting the market.\n\nSince the 2020 halving brought Bitcoin's price to a 1:1 ratio with miners\u2019 production cost, and the current Bitcoin price is around twice the production cost, it implies that the 2024 halving is largely priced in, the report suggested.\n\nEthereum could \u201coutperform\u201d Bitcoin in 2024, the report said, pointing to the EIP-4844 \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d upgrade as a potential catalyst, but raised concerns about centralization of staking on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe report cautioned that it is \u201ctoo early to be getting excited\u201d about a revival of DeFi and NFT activity, while pointing to the \u201cencouraging\u201d rise of new DeFi chains including Aptos, SUI and Pulsechain, and the \u201crenewed interest\u201d in NFTs prompted by the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF flop?\n\nJP Morgan analysts also expressed skepticism that the long-anticipated approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would bring fresh capital to the market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe report cited both the lack of interest from investors in already-approved spot ETFs in Canada and Europe, and the likelihood that capital would move into spot Bitcoin ETFs from existing Bitcoin products, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs and Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nThe report argued that as much as $2.7 billion could exit GBTC following its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF, as investors take profit. Were those funds to exit the market rather than moving into other Bitcoin instruments, it would put \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on the price of Bitcoin, analysts said.\n\nJP Morgan and crypto\n\nThe JP Morgan report comes just a week after the firms\u2019 CEO, Jamie Dimon, took aim at crypto in a Senate Banking Committee hearing, saying that he would \u201cclose it down\u201d if he were the U.S. government.\n\nDimon claimed that, \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance,\u201d adding that, \u201cI\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etcetera.\u201d"

        "content": "Blockchain Meets AI: Ethereum\u2019s Early Investors Dive into New Era\n\nInvestment firm cyber.Fund, known for its early support of Ethereum (ETH), has committed $100 million to projects at the intersection of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nWith previous investments in Cosmos, Solana, and Polkadot, cyber.Fund aims to foster the growth of the \u201ccybernetic economy,\u201d where blockchain serves as the foundation, according to a recent press release.\n\nThe firm defines the cybernetic economy as an interconnected and automated economic framework that converges blockchain, AI, and IoT.\n\nThe move comes as AI-based tokens gained traction within the cryptocurrency industry, buoyed by the success of mainstream AI tools like ChatGPT earlier this year.\n\nThe increasing convergence between blockchain and artificial intelligence has sparked predictions of a potential bull cycle in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe cybernetic economy represents a new era of innovation and collective growth, and we at cyber.Fund are fully prepared to be at the forefront of this transformation,\u201d Konstantin Lomashuk, co-founder of cyber.Fund, said.\n\nBy channeling significant investment into projects at the intersection of blockchain, AI, and IoT, cyber.Fund aims to drive advancements in these fields and shape the evolution of the cybernetic economy.\n\nAI and Crypto Represent New Opportunities\n\n\n\nBack in June, Coinbase released a research report stating that the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain represents a major opportunity for entrepreneurs.\n\nAt the time, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange highlighted the benefits of combining both techs to create new solutions for societal challenges presented by AI.\n\n\u201cAs applications within AI and blockchain mature, the disruptions these technologies represent may lead to areas of collaboration and the emergence of new use cases for crypto to help address specific societal challenges posed by AI,\u201d David Duong, head of research at Coinbase, said.\n\nThe report mentioned several potential use cases that combine both AI and blockchain technology.\n\nIn the first place, it said decentralized data marketplaces could help generative AI meet the demand for a verified and diverse set of data to train its models.\n\nSimilarly, token-based incentive mechanisms could improve the quality of data sourced from those marketplaces.\n\nOther use cases include providing computational power from decentralized networks that utilize graphics processing units for AI projects to train their models, improving data authenticity, and making AI algorithm\u2019s opaque decision-making process more auditable.\n\nFurthermore, the report claimed that the combination of AI and blockchain has the potential to address issues such as algorithmic bias and digital identity verification.\n\nIt is worth noting that blockchain technology also has the potential to address issues like disinformation risks. Blockchain and non-fungible tokens can be used to establish the provenance of images, video, music, and other media.\n\nMoreover, blockchain can help make the decision-making processes of generative AI models more transparent, allowing users to scrutinize the logic and reliability of the AI-produced outcomes."

        "content": "Crypto trader and analyst Ali Martinez is saying that a top-10 altcoin by market cap is potentially forming a bullish pattern and that it could appreciate by double-digit percentage points.\n\nMartinez tells his 35,500 followers on the X social media platform that Binance Coin (BNB) could be forming an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal.\n\nAccording to Martinez, if Binance Coin manages a \u201csustained close above the neckline at $261,\u201d the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap could surge by nearly 20% towards the $310 price.\n\nBNB is trading at $251 at time of writing, up by around 10% over the past two weeks.\n\nTurning to Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s recent fall in price to around $40,300 presented an opportunity for whales to accumulate. Citing data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Martinez says that the number of entities holding 1,000 Bitcoin or more has increased since the price dip.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $42,897 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Ethereum (ETH), Martinez says that approximately 5.58 million addresses purchased 39.87 million Ethereum at prices ranging between $1,934 and $2,160.\n\n\u201cFrom an on-chain perspective, this is ETH\u2019s most critical support level.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Brandt finds Ethereum's high gas fees and functionality issues concerning.\n\nHe bluntly calls Ethereum a \"piece of junk\" due to its perceived lack of usability and effectiveness.\n\nWhile Brandt is skeptical, others like Raoul Pal see Ethereum as an innovative ecosystem with potential.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt isn\u2019t optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, predicting it won\u2019t become a recognized digital currency in the next ten years. Despite being the second-largest cryptocurrency, Brandt questions Ethereum\u2019s ability to serve as a reliable store of value, especially when compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHe criticizes Ethereum for its functionality issues and high gas fees, foreseeing potential challenges ahead. In straightforward terms, Brandt labels Ethereum as a \u201cpiece of junk\u201d due to what he sees as its lack of usefulness.\n\nEthereum Under the Slammer\n\nIn a recent X post, Peter Brandt voiced his dissatisfaction with Ethereum, deeming it an inferior store of value compared to Bitcoin. He expressed confusion about traders choosing to hold onto the coin.\n\nEther $ETH is not comparable to $BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC\n\nAnd the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\n\nMy prediction is that ETH may not even be a listed asset in 10 years https://t.co/4WQ7wnFWEO \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 14, 2023\n\nAccording to Brandt, Ethereum\u2019s poor functionality and soaring gas fees could potentially lead to its downfall in the long run. He boldly went so far as to label the asset a \u201cpiece of junk\u201d due to its perceived lack of utility and usability. This critical stance from a seasoned trader like Brandt adds to the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,274.34, experiencing a 0.6% dip in the past 24 hours and a more substantial 3.7% decrease over the last seven days, as per Coinpedia news.\n\nBrandt\u2019s skepticism about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects is grounded in his assertion that digital currencies, in general, do not serve as reliable stores of value.\n\nHere\u2019s A Contrasting View: JPMorgan Claims Ethereum Will Outshine Bitcoin in 2024; Here\u2019s Why\n\nPutting the Spotlight on Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s unique position as a pioneer in the blockchain industry has made it a focal point for comparison among experts. While Peter Brandt\u2019s assessment paints a gloomy picture, other industry figures, such as Raoul Pal, have engaged in the Ethereum versus Solana debate.\n\nI do think there is a >20% chance that this cycle in Crypto and Exponential Age tech is an Everything, Everywhere, All at Once adoption cycle. The narrative/price will probably outrun the reality however, but by 2030 all forecasting will go out the window\u20261/ \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 10, 2023\n\nPal characterized Ethereum as the \u201cAndroid\u201d of the crypto ecosystem, contrasting it with Solana, which he likened to the \u201ciOS\u201d of the industry.\n\nThere Is Still Hope!\n\nDespite Brandt\u2019s less optimistic stance, a group of experts remains hopeful about Ethereum\u2019s future. The blockchain keeps innovating through various layer-2 protocols, including Polygon zkEVM, Arbitron (ARB), and Optimism (OP). These developments show a lively and robust ecosystem within the Ethereum network, countering the prevailing doubt and hinting at potential breakthroughs.\n\nAs Ethereum faces skepticism, we\u2019ll see if it can overcome the hurdles pointed out by Brandt. What do you think?"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nJPMorgan announced in a research note on Wednesday that the investment bank expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThat prediction comes as a surprise to many in the crypto community after Bitcoin has led the recent rally. Bitcoin is up 156% this year, while Ethereum is up only 90%. The ETH-BTC ratio, a measure of the growth of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin, has fallen to 0.053 from 0.072 at the start of the year.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s lag this year, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated that \u201cwe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\u201d\n\nProto-Danksharding Promises to Boost Ethereum\u2019s Speed\n\nThe catalyst behind JPMorgan\u2019s optimistic outlook is Ethereum\u2019s recent EIP-4844 upgrade, which introduces proto-Danksharding onto the world\u2019s largest smart contract network.\n\nDanksharding is a form of data sharding that uses temporary data blobs that temporarily attach to blocks in the Ethereum blockchain. This extra data is expected to boost network throughput, particularly for Layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum that operate on top of Ethereum.\n\nThe proto-danksharding upgrade initiates a test of how danksharding can improve transaction speeds and lower gas fees on Ethereum. If successful, the upgrade could pave the way for wider implementation and make Ethereum more competitive with ultra-fast chains like Solana and Cardano.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Driving Further Speculation around ETH\n\nWhile not explicitly mentioned in JPMorgan\u2019s report, there\u2019s another potential catalyst for Ethereum in 2024: a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nBlackRock submitted an application to the SEC for a spot ETH ETF in mid-November. While there\u2019s been little movement on the application so far, analysts widely expect that the SEC will approve an Ethereum ETF shortly after it approves a wave of spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nIf approval comes, it\u2019s likely to happen in 2024\u2014and Ethereum could see a significant run-up in price as investors speculate on the SEC\u2019s decision and the future mainstreaming of ETH.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Stands to Surge from Ethereum\u2019s Gains\n\nEthereum\u2019s rise in 2024 could bring many altcoins built on the Ethereum blockchain along with it. Chief among tokens that stand to benefit is Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX), a stake-to-mine token that enables investors to earn Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is designed to revolutionize the way that investors mine Bitcoin. $BTCMTX token holders can stake their coins and earn mining credits, which they can redeem for hashpower in the cloud. Mined Bitcoin is sent back to the Bitcoin Minetrix pool and distributed to investors as a reward.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix benefits from Ethereum\u2019s performance in two key ways.\n\nFirst, any growth in the Ethereum ecosystem tends to benefit altcoins that use its network. Investors become more willing to buy altcoins, and especially those like Bitcoin Minetrix that deliver above-average staking rewards.\n\nSecond, Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in 2024 could draw attention and miners away from Bitcoin, making it easier and cheaper to mine BTC. Bitcoin Minetrix token holders will get more hashpower for their staked $BTCMTX, enabling them to mine more Bitcoin with the same amount of investment.\n\nEven if Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin next year, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is likely to keep rising\u2014so any gains in mining returns would be a boon for $BTCMTX token holders and send the value of this token soaring.\n\nThe good news for investors is that there\u2019s a chance to buy Bitcoin Minetrix now before this flywheel starts turning. $BTCMTX is available on presale at a price of $0.0122, but investors have to hurry. The presale has already raised more than $5.25 million and the price is set to increase in just over 48 hours.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has been showing some good price action with the ETH price shooting all the way to $2,300 earlier this week. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,281 with a market cap of $274 billion.\n\nFTX and Celsius Deposit Large Amounts of ETH to Exchanges\n\nAs per the latest data, two bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Celsius Networks have been depositing large amounts of ETH to the crypto exchanges. Both FTX and Celsius Network have initiated substantial Ethereum (ETH) transfers following the resurgence of ETH prices above $2,300.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per data by SpotonChain, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network executed a substantial ETH deposit of 7,500 ETH (equivalent to $17.4 million) to FalconX approximately 8 hours ago. This move comes on the heels of Celsius depositing a staggering 25,000 ETH (equivalent to $57 million) to both FalconX and Coinbase in the past week. The strategic transfers indicate notable activity and investment decisions within Celsius Network.\n\nOn the other hand, FTX made a significant move by transferring 1,593 ETH (equivalent to $3.66 million) to the address labeled 0xCeF around 55 minutes ago. Notably, the destination address 0xCeF currently holds 2,244 ETH (equivalent to $5.16 million) and hints at a potential ETH deposit to Coinbase in the near future. FTX\u2019s timely and sizable transactions add to the dynamic landscape of crypto exchanges responding to market movements.\n\nThese substantial ETH transfers from Celsius Network and FTX underscore the evolving strategies and positions of major crypto entities amid the cryptocurrency market\u2019s continuous fluctuations. Investors and enthusiasts are keenly observing these movements for potential insights into market trends and upcoming developments.\n\nEthereum Price Action Ahead\n\nThe Ethereum (EHT) price has been able to sustain above $2,300 and has been facing rejection at those levels. On the downside, the crucial demand zone for ETH is from $1,934 to $2,160. Within this demand zone, 5.58 million addresses have been holding a total of nearly 40 million $ETH.\n\nIf there is a decline below the $2050 level, where the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned, it would signal a negative development, prompting a reassessment of the overall situation. However, the likelihood of such a scenario occurring in the near term appears low. Therefore, the current perspective suggests adopting a strategy of buying on market downturns. The $2100 level is anticipated to act as a significant support zone. In the event that prices approach this level, there is an expectation that a considerable number of buyers will seize the opportunity to acquire \u201cdiscounted Ethereum,\u201d contributing to a substantial upward movement in the market. Baking giant JPMorgan believes that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the coming year 2024."

        "content": "Greed remains the main driving force of the crypto market in recent days, and the corresponding index is on its way to the extreme greed zone. Its cap has risen by 0.3% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has seen about zero change, with trampling around $42.8K.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard was designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain and tokens like RATS, SATS and ORDI are BRC-20 tokens. One of the key reasons for BRC-20 popularity is that the token standard unlocks new capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain when used in DeFi applications.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is likely to overshadow Bitcoin price performance in 2024 said JP Morgan analysts in a recent note. Ether traded in the $2,400 region after nearly three weeks of consolidation but this uptrend seems to have lost momentum as Bitcoin price takes a hit this week . Despite the Bitcoin ETF approval hype, ETH continues to remain largely neutral as other altcoins outperform Ether. In the near future, ETH is likely to slip into sideways movement due to a few reasons: a slump in on-chain activity, a delay in ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a fast-approaching holiday season, and a lack of momentum to push Bitcoin price higher.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Ethereum\u2019s price action has been crucial, consistently testing the $2,300 mark while encountering resistance.\n\nWith 5.58 million addresses holding nearly 40 million ETH in the critical zone from $1,934 to $2,160, ETH\u2019s resilience remains noteworthy. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around 60 levels indicates upward momentum, reflecting a favorable scenario for the bulls.\n\nHowever, the market is on high alert for potential downtrends, eyeing support levels at $2,050 and $2,100. A drop below these thresholds might trigger a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to ETH\u2019s price falling further to $1,531 or $1,369.\n\nDespite the downtrend, Ethereum\u2019s price performance is promising today, there\u2019s an air of caution among investors. The prevailing strategy suggests capitalizing on market downturns, reinforcing the belief that opportunities arise amidst volatility.\n\nFTX, Celsius Network ETH Transfers Caused Market Ripples\n\nSimultaneously, bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Celsius Networks caused ripples in the market by executing significant ETH transfers. Celsius Network, in particular, conducted massive ETH deposits, funneling 7,500 ETH (worth $17.4 million) to FalconX and another substantial 25,000 ETH (valued at $57 million) to FalconX and Coinbase within the past week.\n\nFTX also joined the party, initiating a sizable move by transferring 1,593 ETH (equivalent to $3.66 million) to an address labeled 0xCeF, hinting at a potential ETH deposit to Coinbase shortly. These transactions from both entities reflect their strategic positions in response to Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics, closely observed by investors for future market trends.\n\nIn a Negative Market, Can Ethereum Hit $3,000?\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s daily chart showcases a promising green candle, hinting at potential price growth. Altcoin Sherpa, the crypto analysts speculate that the current scenario might be an opportune moment to acquire Ethereum before an anticipated rally. Some even predict Ethereum could soar to $3,000 in this impending uptrend.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s current positive sentiment fuels optimism for Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, igniting speculations on whether the ETH rally will continue with more consecutive green candles or retrace amidst fluctuating market sentiments. The next moves for Ethereum are being closely monitored as the crypto space braces for potential market shifts and ETH\u2019s continued price action. Will you buy before it rallies to $3K?"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nEthereum saw a pullback from just above the long-term resistance at $2300.\n\nThe dip in active addresses pointed to a reduction in demand for ETH in the market.\n\nEthereum [ETH] noted a decent retracement of its gains earlier in December. While the trend and the market structure remained bullish on the one-day chart, some on-chain metrics outlined that selling pressure was on the rise.\n\nThe deflationary nature of Ethereum should inspire confidence in long-term holders. Estimates of shrinking ETH supply do not help in the short-term market sentiment, and a move to $2000 or lower was still a possibility.\n\nWill the $2130 support hold?\n\nIn early November, ETH shot skyward to reach $2130 and began to pull back thereafter. This retracement took nearly three weeks before Ethereum bulls were back in control.\n\nThey needed to capture the $2000 level as support and managed to do so and beat the local highs at $2130 afterward.\n\nOn the way higher, ETH took some time to consolidate at the $2030 region before the swift push northward. This region was highlighted in cyan. Combined with its proximity to the $2000 mark, it should serve as a strong support zone.\n\nThe $2019 level was the recent higher low, and a move beneath it would flip the one-day market structure bearishly. At press time, the RSI floated just above neutral 50 to denote bullish momentum.\n\nThe OBV was also in an uptrend, though it saw a dip in recent days.\n\nThese metrics signal caution\n\nThe age-consumed metric saw some notable spikes over the past two weeks. The most recent one arrived on the 10th of December when ETH was trading at $2340.\n\nA couple of days later, the mean coin age, which had previously been in a strong uptrend, cratered. This suggested a lot of ETH had been moved between addresses. Combined with the age consumed, it suggested a spike in selling pressure.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis increased selling saw Ethereum prices fall toward the $2100 mark. Notably, the active addresses count began to falter over the past week. The MVRV ratio also reached a new high.\n\nHolders whose ETH was in profit chose to sell their assets to realize some of these profits. Overall, the metrics suggested that long-term investors had reasons for concern."

        "title": "2024 Crypto Outlook: Ethereum Set to Outshine Bitcoin, Says JP Morgan - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a recently released financial outlook for 2024, JP Morgan, a global leader in financial services, has presented a cautious stance on the cryptocurrency industry. Despite the approaching Bitcoin halving event, the bank anticipates Ethereum (ETH) outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming year. This forecast emerges amidst heightened anticipation and speculation within the crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP-4844 Could Eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s Growth\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s analysis suggests Ethereum could see more significant growth than Bitcoin in 2024. The bank points to Ethereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 update, also known as \u201cProto-dank sharding,\u201d as a potential catalyst for its performance. This upgrade is expected to enhance Ethereum\u2019s network efficiency and scalability, giving it an edge in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrastingly, Bitcoin\u2019s much-anticipated halving event, which traditionally has been a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency, is considered by JP Morgan to be already factored into its current price. The halving, which reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoins, is expected to increase production costs and potentially lead to a 20% decline in the hash rate. According to JP Morgan, this could result in higher operating costs for miners and drive less efficient miners out of the market.\n\nEthereum Favored Over Bitcoin in JP Morgan\u2019s Outlook\n\nOne of the central themes in JP Morgan\u2019s report is the notion of \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d surrounding Bitcoin. As per the bank\u2019s analysts, this optimism has led to the asset being overbought in a market that has preemptively priced in the effects of the upcoming halving event. The bank further argues that the expectations for capital inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETF products are overstated, potentially setting up the market for disappointment.\n\nRegarding mining, the halving event is expected to double production costs based on current hash rates and Bitcoin mining difficulties. This cost increase, combined with a predicted decline in the hash rate, may force miners with excessive operating costs to exit, further impacting the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhile JP Morgan\u2019s outlook favours Ethereum over Bitcoin in the upcoming year, the bank has not shied away from expressing concerns regarding Ethereum, particularly its centralized staking mechanism. This aspect of Ethereum\u2019s network has raised questions about network security and decentralization, critical factors in any cryptocurrency\u2019s broader acceptance and success.\n\nRead Also: Tether Freezes Attacker\u2019s Wallet in Ledger Library Exploit"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum scaling network Arbitrum reported a \"partial outage\" Friday, bringing activity on the Arbitrum One blockchain to a standstill for the first time since June.\n\nOffchain Labs, the company that developed Arbitrum, announced that the network stalled at 10:29am ET Friday due to \u201ca significant surge in network traffic.\u201d The issue remained unresolved for well over an hour, ultimately resuming at 11:57am ET.\n\nFriday afternoon, Offchain Labs confirmed that the cause of the activity surge was indeed an abundance of \"inscriptions,\" as widely suspected\u2014that is, artwork and media being etched onto the blockchain, akin to NFTs but entirely on-chain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We can confirm that a sustained surge of inscriptions triggered the sequencer to stop relaying transactions properly,\" the Arbitrum account tweeted. \"We've resolved this issue, but due to the backlog, gas prices are recovering from the transaction volume. These should normalize soon.\"\n\nThe Arbitrum One sequencer is up and running after a temporary outage starting at 10:29 AM EST and resuming at 11:57 AM EST. The team is actively investigating, but we can confirm that a sustained surge of inscriptions triggered the sequencer to stop relaying transactions\u2026 \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) December 15, 2023\n\nOn Twitter, numerous Arbitrum users and Arbitrum-based services reported a complete inability to process transactions on the network since the outage began.\n\nArbiscan, a blockchain explorer for Arbitrum, initially attributed the network\u2019s failure to a \u201csurge in activities due to inscriptions,\u201d according to multiple Twitter users. It has since adjusted language on its website to match Arbitrum\u2019s official statement, deleting the reference to inscriptions.\n\nInscriptions, first popularized by the massive success of Bitcoin Ordinals earlier this year, are detailed images or other pieces of media that are carved into denominations of cryptocurrency. While incredibly costly and a major lift for blockchains to process, inscriptions made a fair deal of sense for the Bitcoin network, which due to its lack of smart contract capabilities has never been able to support NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut recently, some users have begun embarking on the incredibly energy-intensive project of creating inscriptions on networks that already support NFTs. Last week, inscriptions on the Polygon, BNB Chain, and Avalanche blockchains accounted for a whopping 57% of traffic across the three major networks, according to the pseudonymous blockchain analyst Hildobby.\n\n.@arbitrum is down. All DLN trades into Arbitrum are pending fulfillment until the network is up again pic.twitter.com/DUdVwelkLo \u2014 deAlex (@AlexSmirnov__) December 15, 2023\n\nIn the last week, inscription transactions have accounted for 30% of all traffic on Arbitrum One specifically, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nPrior to official confirmation of the cause, numerous Twitter users expressed their frustration at the possibility that inscription-related traffic brought down Arbitrum, as they feel the innovation is both unduly costly and fails to serve a practical function.\n\nWhat's the value prop of inscriptions on a layer two like Arbitrum? I need to know who is this fucking bored. \u2014 themovingavg (@themovingavg) December 15, 2023\n\nif this is because of inscriptions I will lose my shit lmao this is the 4th time that these things have totally destroyed a blockchain \u2014 mert | helius.dev (d/acc) (@0xMert_) December 15, 2023\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details after the cause was confirmed.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

When ETH dropped to that level, did investors choose to sell their holdings, or were they confident in ETH and expected a price hike?\n\nEthereum reaches a critical demand zone\n\nAli, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet on 13th December highlighting an interesting development.\n\nAs per the tweet, ETH has dipped into a crucial demand zone, ranging from $1,934 to $2,160. In that range, over 5.58 million addresses were holding nearly 40 million Ethereum.\n\n#Ethereum has dipped into a crucial demand zone, ranging from $1,934 to $2,160.

For traders, this could be the ideal reloading point to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Qh1P8lQMhk \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 13, 2023\n\nSince ETH was in a critical demand zone, AMBCrypto took a look at Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to see whether there were any sell-offs near those marks.\n\nAs per our analysis, when ETH\u2019s price reached the $2,170 mark, the token\u2019s liquidation did increase, as evident from the fluorescent lines. However, soon after that, the token\u2019s price rebounded and went up.\n\nThanks to that, ETH\u2019s price rallied by more than 4% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,264.32 with a market capitalization of over $272 billion.\n\nHowever, if ETH has to sustain its bull rally, it does have to cross a few resistance levels. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s liquidation heatmap revealed that it has to cross a crucial resistance level at the $2,300 mark in the near term.\n\nIf ETH manages to go above that, then ETH has to encounter another crucial roadblock at $2,450.\n\nSelling pressure on ETH is increasing\n\nHowever, the viability of ETH maintaining its bull rally looked slim if supply distribution was to be considered.\n\nAccording to an analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserve was increasing, meaning that selling pressure was high.\n\nIts aSORP was also red, clearly suggesting that more investors were selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum\u2019s derivatives metrics looked bullish as its taker buy/sell ratio remained green. Additionally, ETH\u2019s funding rate also remained green while its price increased.\n\nThis meant that futures investors were buying ETH while its price rose, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder and developer Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new concept of \u2018enshrined zkEVM\u2019 for addressing Ethereum scalability.\n\nIn his latest blogpost, the Ethereum core developer said that a zero-knowledge EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) could efficiently be implemented directly on Ethereum layer 2 networks, which use both optimistic and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups.\n\nVitalik describes that the current layer 2 protocols on Ethereum heavily rely on EVM execution and verification with a large set of codebases.\n\nIf the codebase of these layer 2 protocols contains any bugs, it puts the whole network at risk of being hacked.\n\nHe further said that these layer 2 projects mostly provide the functionality already available on Ethereum, and in addition, Ethereum governance could implement changes to the network.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s light clients are getting more powerful, it is expected that ZK-SNARKs will be fully operational on EVM for data verification and transaction executions over the next few years. Vitalik believes that at that time, Ethereum will eventually have a built-in zkEVM, so it could also be available for rollups as well.\n\nAccording to Vitalik, the proposed zkEVM needs to have certain key properties so that it can efficiently address scalability.\n\nIt requires compatibility \u2013with Ethereum\u2019s multi-client system including data availability and proof verification for different clients\u2013 , upgradability, and support for all EVM-based infrastructures.\n\n\u201cThe most important property [\u2026] is speed,\u201d said Vitalik, adding\n\n\u201cWhile it is possible to design an in-protocol ZK-EVM feature that is asynchronous, returning an answer for each claim only after a delay of N slots.\n\nthe problem becomes much easier if we can reliably guarantee that a proof can be generated within a few seconds, so whatever happens in each block is self-contained.\u201d\n\nVitalik has also delved into many technical aspects of an ideal zkEVM, which are largely inherited by current layer 2 networks.\n\nHowever, the implementation of zkEVM on Ethereum does not replace the need for layer 2 networks, as \u201clayer 2 projects would still be responsible for many important functions,\u201d such as high-speed confirmations and MEV mitigations, while maintaining a user and developer-friendly environment infrastructure."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe Ethereum community has approved the ERC-3643 standard. This standard is the first-ever designed specifically for compliant tokenization. This new standard improves upon the widely used ERC-20 standard, particularly in securities activities. It enhances ERC-20 tokens with controlled advanced functions and compliance modules.\n\nJoachim Lebrum, Chair of the Technology Working Group ERC-3643 Association, stated that:\n\n\u201cThe ERC3643 standard is a groundbreaking step towards integrating advanced blockchain solutions into the enterprise sector, and this validation sends echoes across the ecosystem that ERC3643 is the superior standard for such use cases.\u201d\n\nERC-3643 is a permissioned token standard for tokenizing securities, real-world assets (RWAs), payment systems, and loyalty programs. The standard uses a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework to verify users\u2019 token eligibility dynamically. This feature ensures compliance through anonymous but verifiable credentials.\n\nThe new ERC-3643 standard sets out to revolutionize how companies leverage blockchain technology. It provides them with a secure, compliant framework to tokenize various assets. Ethereum\u2019s official recognition of this standard demonstrates its goals to address users\u2019 diverse needs. It also establishes a benchmark for institutions implementing this framework in tokenization projects.\n\nCompanies now have an approved standard to actively deploy to bring real-world assets onto blockchains while integrating the necessary compliance controls and permissions.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, experts predict the momentum behind asset tokenization will accelerate. HSBC\u2019s research group forecasts the market for tokenized assets will swell to trillions of dollars by 2030. Governments and significant investment funds are demonstrating growing interest in this area. The next wave of tokenization will likely see bonds, equities, and other mainstream financial assets transitioning to blockchain-based models."

        "content": "The expectations of a rapid rise in the altcoin market capitalization were supported by technical analysis.\n\nSome selling pressure could depress Ethereum\u2019s prices in Q1 2024.\n\nThe crypto market has been on fire since mid-October. Bitcoin [BTC] saw a giant increase in trading volume as bulls poured in and forced prices to smash the $29.8k resistance to smithereens.\n\nSince then, large-cap assets such as Ethereum [ETH] have also performed well.\n\nA bird\u2019s eye view of the crypto market at large, as well as the altcoin market, could help put where we are right now in perspective. In that endeavor, the market capitalization of the total crypto market and that of the altcoin sector was examined.\n\nThe highs from October and August 2022 were breached\n\nThe market capitalization excluding BTC and ETH is the altcoin market cap. The $413.8B and $453.9B had been highs from October and August 2022 respectively.\n\nAt press time, the market cap has beaten both these levels. The weekly chart showed that the next significant level was at $839.1B. A move here would mean the market cap gained more than 80%.\n\nDuring the previous cycle, the altcoin market cap highs set in 2018 were respected till September 2020. Thereafter, it was flipped to support, and the market continued to soar till late 2022.\n\nIt is thus possible that the same scenario could play itself out once again, and that the $839B resistance might not pose much of an obstacle once the bull run is in motion.\n\nAssessing the timeline\n\nThe cycle in 2018 took 175 days to complete before beginning to reverse. The one in 2021-22 took 413 days.\n\nHence, an argument could be made that as the market matures the cycle duration also lengthens, while the magnitude of gains (in percentage terms) reduces.\n\nTaking this logic forward, the next run could take much longer than 400 days, and it was unclear just how high the total crypto market cap could reach.\n\nA conservative estimate based on the Fib extension levels plotted in the chart above showed that $5T was possible, but much higher gains are possible too.\n\nExamining the state of the altcoin king\n\nIt is a widely held belief that an ETH rally comes alongside an altcoin market-wide rally. Therefore, taking a look at how Ethereum is shaping up could be helpful.\n\nIn the long-term, meaning over the next two years, a large price appreciation across the market seems inevitable.\n\nIn the coming weeks, however, it would be prudent for ETH holders to book some profits. The MVRV ratio was climbing toward the early 2023 highs.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis meant that a large chunk of ETH holders were sitting on unrealized profits. This could add to any selling pressure Ethereum faces as they look to book profits.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum could experience some turbulence in the next month or two as the high MVRV ratio readjusts. Yet, based on the earlier evidence, the crypto market seemed headed inexorably higher."

        "content": "The last month has seen resurging activity in Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work network.\n\nThis has been due to the general market rally.\n\nThe EthereumPoW [ETHW] network has witnessed a significant upsurge in activity due to the recent market rally, on-chain data has revealed.\n\nThis comes after an extended period of decline, during which demand for the chain plummeted to its lowest levels.\n\nEthereumPoW has seen traction in the last month\n\nA major indicator of the uptick in demand for the EthereumPoW network has been its hashrate, which has risen consistently since the 20th of November.\n\nAccording to data from 2Miners.com, in the 14 months prior, the network\u2019s hashrate had declined by 65%.\n\nThe drop in a network\u2019s hashrate is often due to a decline in the value of its native cryptocurrency. This makes mining less profitable, leading to miners leaving the network.\n\nInasmuch, in the 14 months preceding the hike in hashrate, ETHW\u2019s price had fallen by 98%.\n\nHowever, since the 20th of November, EthereumPoW\u2019s mining hashrate has grown. At 16.28TH/s at press time, it has since climbed by 52%.\n\nThe steady increase in the network\u2019s mining hashrate coincided with the rally in the value of its native coin. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETHW\u2019s price has grown by 70% in the last month.\n\nAs expected, the uptick in mining activity on the blockchain has also resulted in a similar uptrend in the chain\u2019s mining difficulty.\n\nAt press time, EthereumPoW\u2019s network difficulty was 209.59T, recording a 55% growth since the 20th of November.\n\nFurther, the total value of assets (TVL) locked by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols housed within EthereumPoW has also increased, data from DefiLlama showed.\n\nThe uptrend began on the 22nd of November, and the network\u2019s DeFi TVL has since gone up by 90%.\n\nHowever, EthereumPoW\u2019s DeFi TVL remained significantly lower than its October 2022 peak of $6 million at press time. The network\u2019s TVL was $215,294 at the time of writing, logging a 72% decline year-to-date (YTD).\n\nNetwork activity in the last 24 hours\n\nPer data from OKLink, EthereumPoW saw an influx of new addresses in the last 24 hours.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETHW Profit Calculator\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, 2469 new addresses were created on the blockchain, bringing the total number of addresses on the chain to 381 million.\n\nHowever, out of the 381 million total addresses on the chain, only 9,369 were deemed to be active."

If Ethereum drops below this level, it could spell trouble.\n\nEthereum has been on a roll lately, and it's not just a fluke.\n\nThe reason behind this rally is the growing speculation around central bank policies worldwide. You might wonder how these bank policies are connected to a digital currency like Ethereum, but the answer is simple.\n\nWhen central banks make big decisions, it affects the entire financial world, and Ethereum is part of that world.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nSo, what's the deal with Ethereum's recent price surge? Well, it's all about risk appetite. When people are feeling bold and ready to take risks, they tend to invest in assets like Ethereum. It's like a rollercoaster ride for investors, and Ethereum is one of the exciting markets when it comes to momentum and risk appetite aspects.\n\nBut here's the catch: even rollercoasters have their ups and downs. Ethereum is no different. We can expect a short-term pullback in its price. Think of it as a small dip in the rollercoaster ride. However, this dip can be a golden opportunity for smart investors. If Ethereum's price gets close to $2100, many buyers will swoop in to grab some \"cheap Ethereum.\"\n\nNext Target: $2500\n\nNow, let's look at the next target: $2500. This is the level that Ethereum enthusiasts are eyeing in the short term. If Ethereum manages to break above this level, we could see it go even higher. But breaking that barrier won't be a piece of cake; it's like reaching the summit of a challenging mountain. Nevertheless, it's not impossible, and Ethereum could conquer it eventually.\n\nIn this journey, we must keep an eye on the $2050 level, which is where the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average sits. If Ethereum drops below this level, it could spell trouble. We'd have to rethink our whole strategy. However, the chances of that happening in the near future seem slim. So, for now, it's best to see this as a \"buy on the dips\" opportunity.\n\nBut Ethereum isn't alone in this crypto adventure. Bitcoin, often considered the leader of the crypto pack, can influence the entire crypto world. So, if you plan to trade Ethereum, keep a watchful eye on the Bitcoin market as well. The two are closely connected, and what happens in one can affect the other.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum's recent rally is tied to the global speculation surrounding central bank policies. While we can expect some short-term ups and downs, Ethereum has the potential to reach new heights. Keep an eye on key levels, pay attention to Bitcoin, and stay aware of the US Dollar's influence.\n\nReady to trade our ETH/USD forecast?

Liquid staking addresses this constraint by providing a flexible solution that allows users to convert their staked assets into fungible tokens, enabling liquidity and accessibility to a broader range of financial opportunities.\n\nLiquid staking platforms such as Lido Finance, utilize advanced protocols to issue tokenized representations of staked assets. These tokens, often referred to as staked tokens, can be freely traded, lent, or used as collateral on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nUsers benefit from the best of both worlds \u2013 participating in the network\u2019s staking activities while retaining the flexibility to engage in a variety of decentralized financial activities.\n\nLido\n\nLido is the leading liquid staking solution on Ethereum \u2013 providing a simple way for users to get rewards on their digital tokens. By staking with Lido, the user\u2019s tokens remain liquid and can be used across a range of DeFi applications, getting extra rewards.\n\nWhile the platform provides staking for multiple blockchain networks, most notably it is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, allowing users to stake their $ETH and receive stETH (Lido staked $ETH) tokens in exchange. These tokens represent the user\u2019s staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s shift to Proof of Stake (PoS), individuals wishing to serve as staking validators can engage in the process by depositing a minimum of 32 $ETH, which represents a relatively high entry threshold. However, Lido enables users to participate with smaller fractions of Ether (any amount) and still receive block rewards at 3.4% in Annualized Percentage Rate(APR).\n\nstETH tokens, which are ERC-20 compatible, are minted as soon as funds are deposited into Lido\u2019s staking pool smart contract and burned as soon as users withdraw their $ETH tokens.\n\nTo stake your Ether on Lido Finance, you will be required to connect an Ethereum wallet on this page.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n________________________________________\n\n________________________________________"

It is an initial step for the implementation of Danksharding which introduces blobs to store data and improve block capacity temporarily until EVM execution.\n\nJPMorgan analysts say that this upgrade is very beneficial for Ethereum layer 2 networks such as Optimism and Arbitrum, as it improves network throughput while reducing fees.\n\nWhile referring to the bullish stance for Bitcoin, analysts said that the driving factors \u2013 such as optimism around spot Bitcoin ETFs and upcoming halving in April 2024 \u2013 are already priced in, hence a huge upsurge in Bitcoin price is blurry.\n\n\u201cGiven the current ratio of the bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is largely in the price,\u201d said analysts."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum \u2013 Can one\u2019s price outdo the other\u2019s prediction in 2023? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The ETH/BTC chart has been in a long-term downtrend.\n\nIn comparison, the strength of Bitcoin was clear and is likely to continue.\n\nSince October, Bitcoin [BTC] has rallied by an impressive 57.5% as of press time. In the same period, Ethereum [ETH] gains measured 48.34%. The difference is not much, but ETH has been underperforming for close to a year now.\n\nThis means that during times when Bitcoin runs higher, Ethereum doesn\u2019t achieve equivalent or higher gains. During periods of a downturn, Ethereum prices suffer more than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIs this trend likely to reverse?\n\nTechnical analysis of the ETH/BTC chart underlined gloom\n\nThe ETH/BTC chart on the one-day timeframe highlighted the downtrend that has been present since early June. The inference was that ETH just wasn\u2019t able to keep up in terms of performance. And the story doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe zone of resistance highlighted at the 0.055 region represented a key resistance zone that ETH bulls will need to breach to reverse their fortunes. However, the market structure was bearish.\n\nThe 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level was tested on 10th November. It was followed by a rapid reversal.\n\nA move below the 0.051 mark would signal that ETH/BTC was headed much further lower. If that happens, traders and investors could exit the ETH market if a higher timeframe bearish market structure break occurs.\n\nAssuming Bitcoin climbs above the $45k key resistance but ETH/BTC falls, participants could look to shift their funds to BTC to ride the trend higher.\n\nAssessing sell pressure on ETH and BTC\n\nA sign that sell pressure is imminent on an asset is if we spot large inflows to exchanges. If that happens, the exchange reserve for the asset would shoot skyward. In the case of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, this has not yet occurred.\n\nThe BTC exchange reserve has consistently trended lower since June. Despite the downtrend, there was a noticeable spike from 5th December to 12th December. Just after this spike, Bitcoin prices tumbled from $43.7k to $41.2k.\n\nThe Ethereum reserves saw less volatility. It, too, was in a downtrend and has been since February 2023.\n\nEthereum saw a small spike in the reserve between 11th-13th December, but the increase came during and after the price drop. This suggested that some holders panicked due to what they perceived as a shift in trend, while BTC\u2019s inflows preceded the fall.\n\nThe inference was Bitcoin reserves and flow could be a more accurate gauge of the next price direction than Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this was based only on the recent spike, and is not a practical finding with a large sample size. Nevertheless it is something to look out for.\n\nWhat is the sentiment of BTC and ETH like?\n\nA look at the social volume for both crypto assets revealed that, as expected, Bitcoin\u2019s social volume was far higher than Ethereum\u2019s. Even so, their trends were pretty similar. This could be because of their price performances being closely interrelated.\n\nWhen Bitcoin rallies, so does Ethereum, but just not as much.\n\nThe MVRV ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum also showed similar trends, but their magnitudes were vastly different. At press time, BTC stood at 41.17% while ETH was at 26.45%.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBoth values were at their respective six-month highs despite the recent dip in prices. The conclusion was that both assets were overvalued, with Bitcoin holders being at a greater profit, and hence, the happier.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these holders choose to realize their profits en masse and cause a large wave of selling."

(Wasn't due until Dec 23rd I think) pic.twitter.com/jFCjnND3Rf advertisement \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 13, 2023\n\nThe Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF\n\nInvesco joined the race for crypto ETF in September to roll out the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, a joint effort with Galaxy Digital Funds. This ETF was meant to hold Ethereum (ETH) directly so that it is distinct from several Ethereum futures ETFs that are preparing to go live very soon.\n\nNotably, Invesco and Galaxy had earlier filed for a joint physically-backed Bitcoin ETF before finally retracting the application.\n\n\u201cWe have determined not to pursue the launch of a Bitcoin futures ETF in the immediate near-term; however, we will continue to work in partnership with Galaxy Digital to offer investors a full shelf of products with exposure to this transformative asset class, including pursuing a physically backed, digital asset ETF,\u201d Invesco explained.\n\nIt is, however, a major contender for Ethereum spot ETF, a truly dynamic twist.\n\nSEC Delays Multiple ETF Applications\n\nIn terms of the delay, Invesco is not the only asset manager that has received such news from the SEC about its application. A week ago, the SEC announced a 45-day extension for its decision on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s application for a spot ETF. This meant that its expected verdict by December 6, 2023, was no longer valid, rather the new deadline was moved to January 25, 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC has requested feedback from the public on Fidelity\u2019s proposed rule change for a similar product and the asset manager is still expecting a verdict from the regulator.\n\nAlso, the broad crypto industry is waiting for a decision from the SEC on the spot Bitcoin ETF applications made by BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, and many other companies. It is barely four weeks away from the short approval window the SEC has to approve the batch of due applications in January.\n\nThe anticipation is building intensely and crypto proponents are still very positive that the regulator will rule favorably on these applications and possibly mark the first time that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved in the United States."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, encountered a pivotal market moment as its price dipped to approximately $2,148 early Wednesday.\n\nThis descent ushered the altcoin into a crucial demand zone, eliciting significant interest and predictions among market analysts foreseeing a potential rally to the $3,000 mark.\n\nWhat Defines Ethereum\u2019s Current Position?\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s price follows a broader sell-off across the crypto market since the start of the week.\n\nMarket experts attribute this downturn to investors\u2019 de-risking strategy as the US awaits crucial economic events such as the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) final meeting of the year.\n\nWithin this tumultuous landscape, Ethereum found itself within a price range between $1,934 and $2,160, delineated as a critical demand zone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsight from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock revealed a staggering accumulation of nearly 40 million ETH tokens across 5.58 million wallet addresses within this pivotal range, underscoring its importance as a key support zone for Ethereum.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Bullish Outlook on Ethereum\u2019s Rally\n\nMarket analysts, buoyed by Ethereum\u2019s breakout past the psychological barrier of $2,000, are now steadfast in their predictions of an impending rally to the $3,000 level. Notable voices within the crypto space, including analysts from platforms like X, have echoed sentiments of a bullish trajectory for Ethereum.\n\n@CryptoJelleNL, a prominent crypto analyst, has confidently proposed an upward movement for Ethereum, asserting that the altcoin is poised for a rally to the coveted $3,000 mark within the current market cycle.\n\nOther experts, including @AltcoinSherpa, align with this optimistic viewpoint, identifying Ethereum\u2019s recent exit from a consolidation period below $2,000 as a precursor for the anticipated ascent towards $3,000 in the months ahead.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nChallenges Along Ethereum\u2019s Rally Path\n\nHowever, this bullish outlook faces potential hurdles in the form of resistance levels between $2,160 and $2,247.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s data highlights that approximately 1.04 million wallet addresses hold 5.49 million ETH tokens within this range, suggesting a formidable barrier that Ethereum must surpass to validate the optimistic rally projections.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nAt the time of writing this, Ethereum\u2019s trading price lingers around $2,230.38 on Binance, hovering in proximity to the $2,100 threshold, marking a weekly loss of nearly 5% for holders.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s current positioning within this pivotal demand zone sets the stage for a potentially transformative market movement. Analysts\u2019 bullish sentiments and the altcoin\u2019s resilience in the face of recent market turbulence paint an intriguing picture, as the crypto community eagerly anticipates Ethereum\u2019s journey towards the sought-after $3,000 milestone."

        "content": "Share:\n\nInvesco Digital\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF\u2019s approval is delayed.\n\nEthereum price is likely to hover between the $2,030 and $2,539 levels for the next few weeks.\n\nOn-chain metrics note a decline in user activity, which could add headwinds to the uptrend.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is likely to overshadow Bitcoin price performance in 2024 said JP Morgan analysts in a recent note. Ether traded in the $2,400 region after nearly three weeks of consolidation but this uptrend seems to have lost momentum as Bitcoin price takes a hit this week. Despite the Bitcoin ETF approval hype, ETH continues to remain largely neutral as other altcoins outperform Ether. In the near future, ETH is likely to slip into sideways movement due to a few reasons: a slump in on-chain activity, a delay in ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a fast-approaching holiday season, and a lack of momentum to push Bitcoin price higher.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum revenue could double to $5 billion and fee may fall to $0.01 in 2024: Bitwise prediction\n\nSEC delays Ethereum ETF\n\nAs noted by Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart, the Commission has decided to delay the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.

This technical formation is a bullish pattern in which the asset price creates higher lows and equal highs. In Ether\u2019s case, three distinctive higher lows and three equal highs formed.\n\nConnecting the equal highs shows a horizontal resistance level at $2,030. This level was broken on November 20, indicating the upside potential of the pattern was activated. The ascending triangle setup forecasts a 43% upswing to the $2,943 level, obtained by measuring the distance of the widest part of the triangle and extrapolating it higher.\n\nEthereum price\u2019s breakout was succeeded by a 16% rally to a local top at $2,403. Since then, ETH has dropped 6.3% and currently trades at $2,252. Going forward, the smart contract token is likely going to move sideways between the ascending triangle\u2019s base at $2,030 and the weekly resistance level at $2,539.\n\nA decisive flip of the $2,539 will open the path for Ethereum price to continue rising to its theoretical target of $2,943 or the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s Social Dominance metric has been trending lower since September 30, showing a decline in interest for ETH among investors.\n\nETH Social Dominance\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, On-chain Volumes saw a spike on November 10 but has been steadily slumping since then. The same can be said about Whale Transaction Count, which has also seen a decline.\n\nETH On-chain Volume, WTC\n\nWhile this is bearish in the short term, the Active Addresses have been in an uptrend since mid-September. Network Growth has also remained consistent, which shows that the investors are being patient about the mid-to-long term outlook.\n\nETH Active Addresses, Network Growth\n\nA decisive breakout above $2,539 could signal a bullish outlook for ETH. In such a case, the Ethereum price could eye a retest of the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $2,030 support level could trigger a 15% crash in Ethereum price to $1,727."

We\u2019ll explain everything!\n\nBitcoin in decline? Ethereum ready for succession\n\nIs the end of bitcoin\u2019s reign near? While it continues to impress the crypto community with enticing statistics (such as the number of hodlers with non-zero balance wallets, price increase, and a possible return to the November 2021 highs of $69,000, etc.), its younger sibling Ethereum is not lagging behind. For instance, there is an increase in the number of ETH hodlers, a historic record, which far exceeds that of BTC investors.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: JPMorgan says ether will likely outperform bitcoin next year https://t.co/REnIa5p8XU \u2014 The Block (@TheBlock__) December 13, 2023 Could Ethereum take the place of Bitcoin? JPMorgan believes so.\n\n\u201cEXCLUSIVE: According to JPMorgan, ether is expected to outperform bitcoin next year.\u201d\n\nThe article linked by The Block to this tweet talks about a prediction from JPMorgan analysts stating that Ethereum would surpass bitcoin and other crypto currencies in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year, Ethereum will reassert itself and regain market shares within the crypto ecosystem. The main catalyst is the upgrade to EIP-4844 or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2024. We think this upgrade will likely be a more significant step towards improving the activity of the Ethereum network, thereby helping Ethereum to outperform.\u201d Report by Nikolaos Panigirzouglou\u2019s team details.\n\nEIP-4844 or Protodanksharding, what\u2019s that? In fact, it\u2019s a step preceding the deployment of Danksharding, an improved version of sharding in Ethereum. Thanks to Danksharding, the blockchain will be given a new mode of sharing, that is, it will no longer be divided into multiple sharing chains.\n\nThus, EIP-4844 will grant Ethereum new conveniences such as:\n\ndata blobs;\n\ntemporary data packets attached to blocks (more conducive to storing quantities of data);\n\nand so on.\n\nFor JPMorgan, this update will also benefit layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum. Protodanksharding will indeed provide additional temporary data space, which will allow for an increased network throughput and lower transaction fees as a layer 2 network on Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

This is because the Ethereum network was the first to provide smart contracts and decentralized apps.

Ethereum (ETH) is the project that led to the idea of a decentralized future since it created the framework for the launch of many projects.\n\nSolana\u2019s Scalability Increased the Possibilities\n\nWhile Ethereum introduced smart contracts, scalability remained a long-standing issue. In 2017, the Solana network was launched as a game changer. While Ethereum can only handle 8-18 transactions per second (TPS), the Solana network has the potential to handle 65,000 TPS.\n\nThis scalability caused the Solana coin to gain traction. It also led to a massive expansion of the network. The growth of the network has established the Solana coin as one of the top altcoins in the cryptocurrency market today.\n\nThe Emergence of Pullix (PLX)\n\nPullix is now being referred to as a trifecta of crypto success as it combines both concepts introduced by Ethereum and Solana. As an exchange, it combines the decentralization of Ethereum with the great scalability of Solana.\n\nPullix has thus unveiled an exchange platform that exceeds the competitors. As a result, the exchange functions in a safe and decentralized environment. Furthermore, it promotes a transparent trading system that eliminates intermediaries and lowers transaction fees.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s great scalability has enabled it to enter new markets. Users will be able to trade more than just cryptos on Pullix. Users will be able to trade assets from the stock, FX, commodities, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) markets.\n\nPullix has linked its DeFi cryptocurrency, PLX, to the trading platform in order to bring additional incentives to customers. PLX token holders will receive regular passive income transfers via providing liquidity.\n\nDue to these amazing features, there has been great interest in the platform\u2019s DeFi cryptocurrency, PLX. Over the last few days, almost a million PLX tokens have been snapped up. Fortunately, PLX is still available at a great price of $0.042 per token before its projected rally.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe combination of successful two models has made Pullix one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in at the moment. This is the reason why it is referred to as a trifecta of crypto success. Now is a great time to join the project before its projected rally of 100x.\n\nFor more information regarding the Pullix Presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nKeywords: top altcoins, best cryptocurrencies to invest in, DeFi cryptocurrency, altcoins, Ethereum, Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum network, Solana, Solana network, Solana coin\n\nMeta Title: Crypto Trifecta: Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Forge the Path for Pullix (PLX) Success\n\nMeta Description: Find out how Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have paved the way for the success of Pullix (PLX).\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "Profitable retail investors are careful with their choices. However, if you are looking for a crypto that can deliver 10x ROI in 2024, look no further than BorroeFinance ($ROE). This new platform aims to revolutionize web3 fundraising, and investors are backing it to succeed. Also, some investors are monitoring the ecosystem progress of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Polygon (MATIC). Let\u2019s delve in to see what experts think about these tokens.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\n$ROE to Deliver a Triple-digit ROI TO Early Investors\n\nAs a crypto trader in a bullish market, now is the time to buy BorroeFinance ($ROE). BorroeFinance is the world\u2019s first web3 blockchain invoice discounting NFT marketplace. This decentralized AI-based fundraising platform allows web3 businesses to raise instant cash by selling future digital earnings to supportive communities. Savvy crypto investors like you have already invested over $1.8 million in BorroeFinance.\n\n$ROE is currently selling for $0.0175 in its third presale stage, and the token gained 16.7% from its second presale stage price of $0.015. After all presale stages conclude, $ROE will hit the mainstream crypto market and sell for $0.04. Analysts say this price movement will guarantee a massive 128.6% ROI for early $ROE investors in 2024.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nETC Records Double-Digit Surge in December\n\nIn November, BlackRock (one of the world\u2019s biggest investment firms) registered the iShares Ethereum Trust in the startup-friendly State of Delaware. According to Eric Balchunas, a senior Bloomberg analyst, BlackRock has made the first step towards filing for an Ether Spot ETF with the SEC, and Ethereum Classic investors reacted positively to this development.\n\nAs a result of this move, Ethereum Classic and top altcoins associated with Ether recorded price surges in the first week of December. On December 2, ETC traded at $19.01. A week later, ETC gained 16.47% and sold for $22.08. Experts say Ethereum Classic will record a massive influx of ETC investors if ETH Spot ETF is eventually approved. As such, we can expect ETC to trade at $29.50 by Q1 2024.\n\nMATIC Whale Goes All in On Staking Program\n\nRecently, WhaleAlert revealed that a specific Polygon whale invested over $6 million in the Polygon staking program. This platform allows savvy and beginner cryptocurrency investors to easily earn rewards on Polygon\u2019s layer-2 blockchain by becoming a validator. According to reports, the whale transferred 7,543,889 MATIC tokens to the staking program in December; experts say this is a bullish indicator for Polygon.\n\nAs expected, MATIC recorded a double-digit surge in the first week of December. MATIC traded for $0.8065 on December 2. Seven days later, MATIC gained 14.66% and sold for $0.9241. According to experts, Polygon will likely record a bull run in Q1 2024 due to the recent influx of whales to its staking program. Therefore, MATIC can trade between $0.8750 and $1.5580 in early 2024.\n\nLearn more about BorroeFinance here:\n\nVisit BorroeFinance Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow BorroeFinance on Twitter\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "3 Transformative Cryptos Changing The World: Ethereum (ETH), Everlodge (EDLG), Toncoin (TON) - TechCabal",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency was originally created to transform how we make payments. Now, innovative new projects like Ethereum, Everlodge, and Toncoin are taking things one step further. Each project offers an innovative new solution, and as a result could be extremely profitable for early investors. Here\u2019s why investors should consider each for their portfolios.\n\nEthereum Continues To Pioneer DeFi Developments\n\nEthereum is the largest blockchain in the world. Over 1,500 active decentralized apps have been built on the network, with a total value locked (TVL) of over $1 billion. Many analysts believe that Ethereum is now more important than Bitcoin, and could play a more important role in the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum recently experienced its largest price increase of 2023, rising to over $2,350. It has since declined to $2,232, though Ethereum\u2019s value has still increased by 8.65% in the last month. With huge plans for 2024, including a potential spot ETF, experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s value could surge over the next year. Predictions range from $3,000 to $4,000+, though most experts agree that Ethereum\u2019s value will rise.\n\nToncoin Blockchain Slows Following New Protocol Release\n\nToncoin was created to provide seamless DeFi transactions, offering speeds of over 100,000 transactions per second. However, a recent issue with Toncoins transaction processing has cast a shadow of doubt around the project.\n\nLast Tuesday, a new protocol inspired by Bitcoin Ordinals caused a spike in activity on the Toncoin network. This caused the blockchain\u2019s speed to crash to less than 1 transaction per second on Thursday, during which over 2.5 million transactions were pending.\n\nDue to congestion Tonkeeper, a popular Toncoin wallet, had to suspend its services. Later reports suggest that network usage increased by 61 times in just 30 minutes, causing issues for Toncoin. Since this setback, Toncoin\u2019s value has fallen by 8% to $2.17, and Toncoin\u2019s daily trading volume has fallen to $50 million.\n\nCould Everlodge Revolutionize A Trillion Dollar Market?\n\nWhile most crypto projects focus on finance or the blockchain, Everlodge applies DeFi technology to an entirely new market\u2013 travel properties. As a pioneer in this industry, Everlodge is expected to gain significant traction throughout 2024 as thousands of investors discover a new way to build their property portfolios.\n\nEverlodge looks to disrupt the travel property market by minting properties as NFTs. This is designed to streamline the buying and selling process. Once minted, NFTs are fractionalized so investors can buy a percentage of the property instead of the entire property outright. For example, a holiday home in the U.K. worth $1 million could be split into 5 fractions, after which 5 individuals can own a 20% share in the property.\n\n<blockquote class=\u201dtwitter-tweet\u201d><p lang=\u201den\u201d dir=\u201dltr\u201d>We're thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb<br><br>Check out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we've added.

Properties available on Everlodge will include luxury villas, hotels, and holiday homes, with plans to add more property types in the future.\n\nEverlodge is currently in stage 8 of its presale, having sold out at record rates during its previous seven rounds. Its native token, ELDG, is currently available for just $0.027, and will offer numerous benefits to holders once Everlodge officially launches.\n\nInvestors who buy ELDG tokens during the Everlodge presale will automatically be granted access to the Everlodge private members club, which will offer lucrative rewards such as free stays at properties within the Everlodge ecosystem.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nShare this article"

        "title": "Fast Growing Cryptos that Could Moon? Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche and the growing ApeMax Presale - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space has witnessed high growth and expansion over the years, as crypto has morphed from a niche segment to a thriving ecosystem with an extensive number of coins and tokens. Although past growth spurs were heralded by Bitcoin and later Ethereum during the most recent bull market, nowadays newer and younger generation coins are also gaining momentum and growing in popularity.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at some of the fast growing crypto coins and the expanding presale of new token ApeMax. This piece discusses each coin in detail after having researched these tokens in depth and collected information on them from a number of different crypto publications and first hand accounts.\n\nTop Fast Growing Cryptos and Fast Growing Presales\n\nApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax takes the spotlight as the world\u2019s first \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d crypto coin, introducing an interesting staking mechanism. Currently available at presale for a limited time, ApeMax offers purchasers immediate access to their tokens, meaning they can also start enjoying the coin\u2019s utility from the get-go. The ApeMax presale has been growing with new eligible holders getting their ApeMax coins daily.\n\nGoing beyond other new coins in presale, ApeMax users can engage in boost staking immediately, with the possibility to earn token rewards through staking. For a short duration, discount loot boxes are up for grabs by eligible token buyers.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum secures its place as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Functioning as a blockchain platform, Ethereum facilitates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the execution of smart contracts.\n\nWhile Ethereum has a proven track record, there is ongoing speculation about its sustained position, prompting discussions about potential challengers. Ethereum is up by over 70% over the year and this coin has experienced tremendous growth from its inception to its heights during the NFT bull market.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nDesigned for high-speed and high-volume transactions, Solana offers a more scalable and efficient alternative to other blockchain networks. Despite its technical prowess, Solana faced setbacks linked to its association with Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial founder of FTX.\n\nHowever, if Solana can overcome technical hurdles, it could rival other smart contract chains like ETH, external analysts say. Solana took a big hit following FTX winding down, but has since made a rebound and is up by over 400% over the last 12 months and up by over 28% in the last 30 days alone.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nFormerly known as Matic Network, Polygon provides scalable and interoperable infrastructure for building decentralized applications. As a \u201clayer two\u201d to the Ethereum network, Polygon\u2019s low-cost structure has contributed to its widespread adoption, creating a robust network effect that has fueled its growth.\n\nFrom an early price of $0.00547046 in late April 2019 to its height of $2.88 on the 27th of December 2021, Polygon Matic\u2019s price grew by over 50,000%.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche offers a decentralized infrastructure for building dApps and executing smart contracts. Distinguished by its use of subnets, Avalanche\u2019s child chains provide a flexible approach to launching dedicated blockchains for various use cases.\n\nNotable projects, such as DFK Chain, showcase the versatility of Avalanche in the Web3 space. Over the last 30 days alone, AVAX\u2019s price soared by over 125%.\n\nWhat makes cryptocurrency grow?\n\nCryptocurrencies that have demonstrated swift growth have often done so in periods of market optimism and increased crypto adoption. Examples of this trend include certain meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which observed substantial and explosive surges during the latest crypto bull run, especially amid periods of heightened enthusiasm surrounding meme coins.\n\nBitcoin has consistently recorded notable overall growth over the years, while smart contract-capable blockchains like Ethereum and Solana experienced significant acceleration during the recent NFT craze when new smart contract use cases abounded. It\u2019s crucial to note that growth is deeply linked to the supply and demand mechanism that affects coin prices in the crypto market.\n\nWhat drives the growth of cryptocurrency?\n\nObserving the economic theory, the value of an asset is determined by the intersection of its supply and demand. When the demand outpaces the supply, the price of cryptocurrency experiences an increase.\n\nWho could dominate the crypto market in 2024?\n\nWhat the main theme of the crypto market will be in 2024 remains a mystery. According to several external analysts, Bitcoin might remain a popular subject of news and conversation in the new year. Other observers note that social fi and other trends may have a role to play in 2024\u2019s crypto arena. Meme coins and altcoins which have been popular in 2023, such as older generation meme tokens like Shiba Inu or younger meme tokens like ApeMax and Pepe coin might have their unique paths in the following year. In any case, it\u2019s too soon to say for certain what will be the trend or coin which will lead in 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Fast Growing Crypto Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystem has expanded throughout the years, with some coins experiencing unprecedented expansion sagas, defying what many skeptics thought possible as crypto moved further in the mainstream. While coins like Ethereum and Solana grew tremendously alongside meme tokens such as Shiba Inu, younger coins like ApeMax are also gaining their own fan base and experiencing momentum in their presales.\n\nAs the crypto market gears up for potential trends in 2024, its key to remember that despite past and current growth, future growth is not a guarantee, and that all cryptos are still volatile and contain risks. As readers buckle up for a new year, they can remember that the highly unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies emphasizes the need for caution, due diligence, and responsible practices.

With Cardano exhibiting 18 out of 30 green days and a 9.33% price volatility during that time, analysts have made a bullish Cardano price prediction. They estimate the Cardano price to reach $0.39 in December 2023.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The Newcomer with a Twist\n\nGoogle Bard believes that the newest contender, Meme Moguls (MGLS), represents the evolving nature of the crypto space. As the world\u2019s first meme-backed stock market, Meme Moguls is bringing something new by allowing users to trade their favorite memes and earn rewards through MGLS tokens.\n\nYou will soon be able to make connections, share tips, and collaborate on strategies with countless traders from around the globe.

        "content": "Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin has undertaken a large-scale transaction involving trillions of meme tokens, leaving the broader cryptocurrency space curious about the motives behind the founder\u2019s decision.\n\nEthereum Founder Executes Massive Memecoin Sales\n\nEthereum inventor and founder, Vitalik Buterin has made new headlines as reports surface of his substantial memecoin sales. According to blockchain security company, PeckShield Alerts, a Vitalik labeled wallet address was seen swapping 100,000,000,000,111.111 DOBE tokens worth approximately $22,900 for 10.44 Ethereum tokens (ETH). Additionally, the wallet also initiated another sale of 1,858,140,000,000 DOJO tokens worth $6800 for 3.12 ETH.\n\nThe motivation behind the sell-offs remains unknown however the large-scale memecoin transaction has adequately caught the attention of cryptocurrency investors and the market as a whole.\n\nThe substantial meme coin sale follows a recent loss experienced by Buterin earlier this week. The Ethereum founder\u2019s publicly known crypto wallets became short of $29 million between December 15 and 21.\n\nThe loss was reported by blockchain analytics service, Arkham Intelligence. According to the analytics platform, the reason for the loss was due to crypto market fluctuations which saw Buterin\u2019s wallets losing 5% of the total value of its assets.\n\nETH price chart at $2,300 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nButerin Crypto Sell-Offs\n\nIn addition to Buterin\u2019s recent large-scale meme coin sell-off, there have been many other crypto sales executed by the ETH founder. Earlier this year, Buterin sold about 9.9 billion CULT tokens worth $332,420 at the time of the sales. The Ethereum founder subsequently revealed reasons for the sell-off, stating that the cryptocurrency held no cultural or moral value.\n\nLater in October, rumors surfaced about Buterin allegedly selling off his ETH holdings after the Ethereum founder sold about 500,000 USDC worth approximately $14.93 million at the time, to the Gemini exchange. Buterin clarified the sell-off allegations stating that the transactions were made to charitable organizations and other initiatives.\n\nMore times than not, large-scale crypto transactions from prominent leaders in the crypto space tend to capture the attention of investors as these sales could lead to a shift in the market. However, Buterin has also revealed that he has never sold Ethereum tokens (ETH) for his gain since 2018.\n\nThe Ethereum founder is known for making multiple ETH donations to charity organizations and COVID-related causes. Buterin is also known for purchasing and constantly dumping meme coins, causing the value of these tokens to plummet in several cases.\n\nFeatured image from Newsway, chart from Tradingview.com"

Since January, Over $40 billion worth of ETH has been staked, thus representing nearly 50% of total staked assets across all blockchains. Furthermore, analysts expect the first approved spot crypto ETFs to come in Q1 2024.
