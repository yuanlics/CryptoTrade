        "title": "Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2: Differences, Adoption, and Drawbacks - Wilson Center",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThere are hundreds of active Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols across over one hundred blockchains. As the adoption and usage of DeFi continues to increase so does the need for the underlying blockchains the protocols are built on to be able to scale. Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and Tron can process thousands of transactions per second with transaction finality time, or the guarantee a transaction cannot be tampered with or reversed, on-par with traditional payment processors. While there are several billion dollars worth of total value locked (TVL) on DeFi protocols on these blockchains, the Ethereum ecosystem continues to dominate the DeFi space as users favor the security of Ethereum and the robust spread of protocols deployed on the network. According to DefiLlama as of August 17, 2023, the Ethereum ecosystem accounts for 68% ($50B) of DeFi TVL and 56% ($69B) of stablecoins deployed on-chain.\n\nHistorically, low scalability and high transaction costs on Ethereum have hindered adoption. Over the last year, this has begun to change with the emergence of Layer 2 solutions on the Ethereum blockchain. These solutions aim to address the scalability and cost issues associated with Ethereum's Layer 1. But what exactly are Layer 1 and Layer 2? How do they differ, and why are they crucial for the future of DeFi and the broader crypto ecosystem? This article delves into these questions, offering a comprehensive understanding of Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2, adoption trends, challenges, and an outlook on their future. Before you dive in, if you\u2019re new to DeFi concepts we recommend reading the previous article in this series, DeFi 101: The Good, the Bad, and the Regulatory, which provides a breakdown of how DeFi works and defines many of the concepts we will be discussing here today.\n\nEthereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum's main network, or Layer 1, is the Ethereum blockchain's base layer, where all transactions are settled. It is highly secure, thoroughly battle-tested, decentralized, and arguably the most trusted blockchain outside of Bitcoin. The Ethereum produced its first block in July of 2015 utilizing a \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW) consensus mechanism. This remained unchanged until September of 2022 when the Ethereum network completed the significant transition to a \u201cproof of stake\u201d (PoS) consensus mechanism. Let\u2019s break down what this means and why it matters.\n\n2015-2022: The Proof of Work Era\n\nOriginally, like Bitcoin, Ethereum operated on a \"proof of work\" (PoW) consensus mechanism. In this system, miners leveraged GPUs and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) to solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain. While this method provides strong security, it is energy-intensive, as it requires a vast amount of computational power.\n\nPoW also does not necessarily benefit from economies of scale as each subsequent block produced (how transactions are processed and stored) becomes more difficult to solve, requiring ever increasing amounts of computational power. This ever-increasing difficulty also severely limits scalability. For example, Bitcoin mining consumes roughly 0.5% of all energy produced worldwide but can only process 7 transactions per second. This energy consumption has been a point of criticism for many environmental advocates and has raised concerns about the sustainability of PoW-based blockchains.\n\n2022-Present: Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nIn response to these concerns and to improve the network's efficiency, Ethereum transitioned to a \"proof of stake\" (PoS) consensus mechanism in September of 2022. This method is far less energy-intensive, with estimates suggesting it reduces energy consumption by up to 99%. Unlike PoW, where miners compete to solve mathematical problems, PoS relies on validators who are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to \"stake\" or lock up as collateral. In Ethereum\u2019s case, validators stake native Ether ($ETH). Validators also participate in attesting or agreeing on the validity of proposed blocks. This process ensures that blocks added to the chain are valid and agreed upon by a majority of validators.\n\nValidators earn rewards for proposing new blocks and for attesting to the validity of transactions. These rewards come from transaction fees and, in some cases, newly minted cryptocurrency. To ensure validators act honestly, the PoS system has a punitive measure called \"slashing.\" If a validator tries to approve fraudulent transactions or behaves maliciously, a portion (or all) of their staked cryptocurrency can be taken away or \"slashed.\" This mechanism discourages dishonest behavior since validators have a financial stake in the network's proper functioning.\n\nEthereum Scalability Issues Remain\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s successful transition from PoW to PoS in September of last year was a monumental achievement. This transition reduced the energy required to run the network,and with no disruption to the operation of the network. However, this upgrade did little to address the issues of the network: scalability and prohibitively high transaction fees, also known as gas fees. In its current form, Ethereum Layer 1 can only process 20-30 transactions per second (TPS) -- for reference, Visa can process 24,000 TPS. It also carries high transaction costs with average gas fees in 2023 over $7, which is orders of magnitude higher than the fractional penny transaction costs of traditional payment processors. With transaction orders driven by an auction-esque system on Ethereum, during peak congestion times, gas fees can reach truly astronomical numbers. In November of 2021, during the bull market's peak, average Ethereum gas fees were over $40 per transaction, with individual transactions costing hundreds of dollars.\n\nEthereum Layer 2, the Scalability Solution\n\nEthereum Layer 2 blockchains (also known Ethereum Rollups) address these issues by processing transactions off the main chain, thereby increasing speed and reducing costs. They do this by rolling up collections of transactions: hence the name. The final, rolled-up transaction is presented to the Ethereum blockchain as a single transaction. By leveraging this rollup technology, Layer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum, like Arbitrum and Optimism, can process up to 40,000 TPS with transaction fees a fraction of the cost of Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nTypes of Rollups\n\nThere are primarily two categories of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: These rollups operate on a principle of trust. They assume that the data being processed is accurate and that no malicious actors are embedding fraudulent transactions. If there's suspicion of a deceptive transaction, it's challenged and verified directly on the Ethereum network. Both disputing parties have Ethereum (ETH) staked, and the one in the wrong stands to lose their staked amount.\n\nPros:\n\nFaster processing due to the assumption of validity.\n\nIncentivizes honest behavior with staked ETH at risk.\n\nCons:\n\nRelies on external actors to challenge suspicious transactions.\n\nPotential disputes can slow down transaction finality.\n\nNotable Optimistic Rollups:\n\nOptimism: Known for its scalability and speed, Optimism maintains Ethereum compatibility. It uses fraud proofs for transaction integrity, enhancing throughput and reducing costs, and is favored for its developer-friendly environment. The OP Stack, maintained by the Optimism Collective, is a standardized, shared, and open-source development stack designed to simplify launching production-ready Layer 2 blockchains. It aims to foster an interoperable blockchain ecosystem through the Superchain concept\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Arbitrum: A significant player in the Optimistic Rollups space, Arbitrum stands out for its approach to handling smart contracts and transaction batching, offering improved scalability for Ethereum transactions. Arbitrum Orbit allows for the creation of customizable L2 or L3 chains, leveraging Arbitrum Nitro for flexibility and tailored solutions to specific needs. Orbit chains can be either Rollups or AnyTrust chains, offering scalability with different levels of decentralization and performance. They enable dedicated throughput and traffic isolation, and permission access, enhancing gas price reliability and supporting custom token fees\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Base (by Coinbase): Developed by Coinbase as a public good, Base is an emerging Optimistic Rollup solution focusing on creating a seamless user experience. It aims to provide an accessible entry point for users new to the Ethereum ecosystem, balancing ease of use with the core benefits of scalability and reduced transaction costs. Base distinguishes itself by emphasizing simplicity, security, and developer support, aiming to foster greater adoption and innovation within the blockchain space. Zora: Zora introduces a unique approach to Optimistic Rollups, emphasizing decentralized commerce and creator economies. Their solution supports seamless integration of blockchain technology into digital marketplaces, providing an efficient platform for creators and users to interact and transact. Fuel Labs: Fuel Labs focuses on high throughput and low-latency processing, optimizing for simple transactions like token transfers. Cartesi: Cartesi enables developers to use mainstream software stacks for smart contract development, bridging traditional software with blockchain.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-rollups): Zk-rollups utilize a cryptographic tool known as a zero-knowledge proof. This allows a user to prove a statement's authenticity without revealing additional details about it. In the crypto world, a specific type of zero-knowledge proof, termed zk-SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), is employed. This ensures that only valid transactions are added to the rollup, eliminating the need for disputes.\n\nPros:\n\nEnhanced security through cryptographic proofs.\n\nEliminates the need for dispute resolution, ensuring smoother operations.\n\nCons:\n\nRequires more complex cryptographic operations, which might be resource intensive.\n\nDue to their complexity, zk-rollups are significantly more difficult to develop for relative to optimistic rollups.\n\nSeveral key projects have emerged as leaders in this space:\n\nLinea: Developed by Consensys (developer of critical web3 infrastructure like the MetaMask wallet and the Infura API suite, founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin), this project stands out for its ability to generate ZKPs directly from Solidity, Ethereum's primary programming language. This capability significantly eases the development process, lowering the risk of errors and streamlining the integration of advanced privacy features into Ethereum-based applications. Importantly, Linea also maintains a user experience akin to Ethereum, enabling both developers and users to continue using familiar wallets, tools, and interfaces. This dual benefit of simplicity in development and familiarity in user experience positions Linea as a user-friendly yet powerful tool in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Scroll zkEVM: Scroll is focused on security, transparency, and creating a reliable, decentralized infrastructure. It has a multi-layered architecture that includes a settlement layer, a sequencing layer, and a proving layer, with benefits like decentralized proving and low proving costs. Polygon zkEVM: Polygon's suite of ZK rollup solutions includes various rollups like Zero, Hermez, Nightfall, Miden, and zkEVM. Each solution has unique features, such as EVM compatibility, decentralized proving, and reduced centralization risks. Polygon 2.0 represents an upgrade to these systems, promising lower fees and higher scalability. StarkNet: StarkNet uses zk-STARK technology to ensure transaction correctness without revealing sensitive data. It features user accounts implemented as smart contracts, a sequencer for processing transactions, and a prover for generating cryptographic proofs. Benefits include native Account Abstraction and reduced transaction costs. zkSync Era: An advanced version of the zkSync protocol, zkSync Era is designed to be more efficient and scalable, supporting almost all smart contracts based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It offers enhanced scalability, security, and a better developer experience. Immutable: Immutable uses zk-Rollup technology, focusing on gaming via Immutable zkEVM. It stands out for EVM compatibility, low cost, and high scalability, optimized for gaming. Over 200 games plan to launch on Immutable making it one of the predominant players in the Web3 gaming space.\n\nSince many Layer 2 blockchains can operate in parallel with each other, the different approaches to rollups are not a zero sum game. Developers and users can choose the rollup that best serves their particular needs. Keep an eye out for an upcoming article in this series on DeFi Privacy where we discuss zero-knowledge proofs in greater detail.\n\nAdoption: Led by the Layer 2 chains, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync Eta, the adoption and usage of Layer 2s have steadily increased in the last year. Q2 2023 saw a 60% increase in Layer 2 transaction growth QoQ, accounting for 56% of total Layer 1 and Layer 2 transactions. Major centralized exchanges like Coinbase now allow users to transfer tokens directly to Arbitrum and Optimism, allowing users to bypass Ethereum Layer 1 entirely.\n\nCurrent Challenges and Upcoming Solutions: Layer 2 chains provide a much-needed boost to Ethereum scalability, but challenges remain, most notably congestion on Layer 1 and Layer 2 centralization.\n\nCongestion on Layer 1: As new Layer 2 chains are launched, and existing chains improve, Layer 1 Ethereum will eventually become primarily a settlement layer, with most transactions occurring on Layer 2 chains vs. the settlement/transaction hybrid role it now serves. The issue is that even though Layer 2 chains have significantly higher TPS, they ultimately have to settle transactions on Layer 1 in competition with the transactions happening directly on the chain. During the latest Meme coin hype cycle in May of this year, which saw Layer 1 gas fees double, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync era saw their gas fees increase by an order of magnitude. An upcoming Ethereum Layer 1 roadmap upgrade called \u201cdanksharding\u201d aims to address this bottleneck. At a high level, danksharding will dramatically decrease the cost of transactions on Layer 2s, ultimately enabling Ethereum to scale to over 100,000 TPS. This upgrade is slated for \u201clate 2023\u201d. However, while the promised performance improvements should not be questioned, due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum development and delays in previous upgrades, this date should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nCentralization: One of the key strengths of Layer 1 Ethereum is the security and reliability provided by its decentralization. However, Layer 2 rollups have centralization risks as they rely on operators to post data to Layer 1. The ecosystem is currently concentrated in a few operators. Rollups can suffer downtime if operators go offline. This is not atypical, as many crypto projects begin highly centralized to streamline development and become more decentralized as they mature. That said, until the Ethereum Layer 2 chains progress on this front in alignment with the Ethereum roadmap, their levels of centralization remain a potential attack vector.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2\n\nThe Ethereum community is actively working on upgrades and innovations to address the challenges faced by both Layer 1 and Layer 2. With the anticipated danksharding upgrade and ongoing efforts to decentralize Layer 2 solutions, the future looks promising. As these layers continue to evolve, they will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of DeFi and the broader crypto landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 are integral components of the blockchain's ecosystem. While Layer 1 provides a secure and decentralized foundation, Layer 2 solutions offer scalability and cost-effectiveness. By understanding their dynamics, strengths, and challenges, users and developers can make informed decisions and contribute to a more efficient, inclusive, and innovative DeFi landscape. As US policymakers navigate the complex world of DeFi, understanding these layers and their implications is crucial for informed decision-making and future regulatory considerations."

        "title": "Staking can modernize the Ethereum ETF - Blockworks",
        "content": "Before diving into the crux of this op-ed, let\u2019s be clear: The vision outlined here recognizes the pragmatic approach ETF issuers are currently taking.\n\nInitial Ethereum ETFs will be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d in structure and simply track the spot price of Ethereum as a first iteration. That said, just as the equity ETF market has evolved to offer a plethora of sophisticated products beyond simple price tracking offerings, so too must the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nWith that understanding, a particular vision emerges \u2014 one where, just as an investor in an equity ETF demands a pro-rata dividend, an Ethereum investor assertively seeks out staking rewards. To omit such rewards is akin to denying oneself a full, comprehensive return on investment.\n\nStaking is Ethereum\u2019s beating heart. It is the mechanism that rewards any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators, who then propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, and in return are rewarded with newly minted Ethereum as well as a portion of the transaction fees in the block.\n\nTo put it plainly, staking is the modern-day operating system for Ethereum. And therefore staking must play a role in an ideal Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs an example, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH (approx. $15 million) could earn an additional 32 ETH on a monthly basis by staking. This not only enhances the fund\u2019s revenue, but also contributes to Ethereum\u2019s network security. Staking ensures validators are actively participating and making the network more resilient against potential attacks.\n\nIncorporating staking rewards also gives investors a fuller experience of Ethereum ownership. These rewards can potentially provide enhanced returns over time when compared to solely tracking Ethereum\u2019s price performance, as has historically been the case.\n\nStaking rewards can offer a unique avenue for fund managers. They can be innovative in compensating investors, either by directly distributing the rewards pro-rata to investors like a dividend, or by reducing management fees and adding staking rewards to the fund\u2019s total allocation, thus increasing the net asset value (NAV) for each investor. This creates a win-win scenario for both the fund and the investor.\n\nWhy staking matters\n\nSince the Merge in 2022, Ethereum\u2019s supply has been on a decline. A portion of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users is burned, the amount of which is usually higher than the new supply issuance. This deflationary nature makes ETH scarcer by the day, increasing its inherent value.\n\nAn ETF that stakes and captures new issuance might, in essence, be capturing an increasingly valuable asset.\n\nA staking-centric approach reinforces Ethereum\u2019s network. As more ETH is staked and more validators join the network, the cost to attack Ethereum rises exponentially, fostering a more secure environment for transactions and smart contracts.\n\nStaking is not without its challenges. The dynamic unbonding period of Ethereum means that once staked, the assets aren\u2019t immediately liquid. To address this, an Ethereum ETF could strategically stake only 50% of its holdings.\n\nFurthermore, by incorporating a liquid staking protocol which adheres to KYC/AML norms, the ETF could allocate another 30% \u2014 ensuring the requirements of institutional investors are met without compromising liquidity.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: DeFi has a reputation problem\n\nLiquid staking is a mechanism where users stake their crypto assets \u2014 in this case, ETH \u2014 and receive a token representing their staked amount in return. These tokens can then be traded, sold or used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, essentially making them a liquid counterpart to an otherwise locked asset.\n\nIt\u2019s essential that institutional investors look for protocols who fulfill KYC/AML requirements. The remaining 20% could be maintained in spot ETH, offering additional immediate liquidity.\n\nAs Ethereum ETFs gain momentum, their success will hinge on delivering returns while addressing liquidity concerns.\n\nAn intelligent combination of staking platforms and liquid staking protocols can be the bridge between these two worlds, ensuring Ethereum investors get the complete value they deserve, analogous to the dividends stock investors have come to expect. This vision paves the way for an Ethereum ETF that truly resonates with the modern investor\u2019s needs.\n\nFor informational and advertising purposes only.

        "content": "Despite Ether\u2019s recent lackluster performance, at least one multinational bank estimates that by the end of 2026 the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could hit an all-time high.\n\nEther was trading near a six-month low, just above $1,500 at time of publication, according to CoinGecko, as its overall share of the crypto market has declined two percentage points since January to 17%. (Meanwhile, Bitcoin is approaching 50% market dominance.)\n\nBut British bank Standard Chartered said in a Wednesday note that Ether could go on a tear that sees it reach $8,000. Eventually, the bank predicted, Ether could be worth $26,000 to $35,000 per token.\n\n\u201cWe think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\u201d Geoff Kendrick, the head of crypto research and EM FX West at Standard Chartered, wrote in the note.\n\nCrypto market onlookers had hoped that a spate of newly launched Ethereum futures ETFs would boost inflows to the cryptocurrency, but that hasn\u2019t been the case so far. In their first week, six of the futures-based ETFs attracted just $10 million in investment, according to a report by CoinShares. For comparison, the first futures-based Bitcoin ETFs launched in 2021 brought in $1 billion in the first week, although interest in cryptocurrencies was higher then among investors.\n\nStill, Standard Chartered believes Ether has the potential to explode in value in part due to upgrades scheduled for its underlying blockchain, Ethereum, over the coming years. Last year, the blockchain took a leap forward with its much-hyped Merge update that switched the network to proof of stake from proof of work and reduced its carbon footprint by 99%. The most recent update in April, dubbed Shanghai, allowed validators on the blockchain to withdraw staked Ether.\n\nThe Standard Chartered analysts\u2019 notes mentioned a series of updates that will add \u201cdanksharding\u201d to the Ethereum network, helping boost its dominance in DeFi. Danksharding is meant to allow the blockchain to process 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nA possible rise in the popularity of blockchain gaming and tokenized real-world assets could also boost activity on the Ethereum blockchain, which would in turn increase Ether\u2019s price, the analysts wrote."

        "content": "One of the largest banks in the world reportedly believes that the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) could soar by more than 2,100%.\n\nAccording to a new CNBC article, the UK-based bank Standard Chartered is predicting that Ethereum will eventually increase to as high as $35,000 after hitting $8,000 in about three years.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, an analyst at the London-based bank, says that increasing use cases and layer-2 scaling solutions built on Ethereum are among the reasons for the price forecast.\n\n\u201cWe think Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026 [which is] a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, Kendrick believes gaming and tokenization of real-world assets offer some of the greatest growth potential for Ethereum.\n\nHe also expresses optimism about planned Ethereum upgrades. In early 2024, Ethereum is slated to implement \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which would increase the network\u2019s transaction speed and lower transaction costs.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 scaling solutions\u2026 are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E (price to earnings) ratio over the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nWith ETH trading for $1,540 at time of writing, an increase to $35,000 would represent a 2,173% jump, while a move to $8,000 would be a 419% increase.\n\nStandard Chartered is the 43rd largest bank in the world with $820 billion of assets under management.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum price drops to a 7-month low as data points to more downside - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price experienced a 7% decline between Oct. 6 and Oct. 12, hitting a seven-month low at $1,520. Although there was a slight rebound to $1,550 on Oct. 13, it appears that investor confidence and interest in Ethereum are waning, as indicated by multiple metrics.\n\nSome may argue that this movement reflects a broader disinterest in cryptocurrencies, evident in the fact that Google searches for \u201cEthereum\u201d have reached their lowest point in three years. However, Ether has underperformed the overall altcoin market capitalization by 15% since July.\n\n\u201dEthereum\u201d keyword search, globally. Source: Google Trends\n\nInterestingly, this price movement coincided with Ethereum\u2019s average seven-day transaction fees declining to $1.80, the lowest level in the past 12 months. To put this in perspective, these fees stood at over $4.70 just two months ago, a cost considered high even for initiating and closing batched layer-2 transactions.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty and lower staking yield back ETH\u2019s price decline\n\nA significant event that impacted Ether\u2019s price was the remarks made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson regarding U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Director William Hinman\u2019s classification of Ether as a non-security asset in 2018. Hoskinson, who is also an Ethereum co-founder, alleged on Oct. 8 that some form of \u201cfavoritism\u201d influenced the regulator\u2019s decision.\n\nEthereum staking has also garnered less interest from investors participating in the network validation process, as the yield decreased from 4.3% to 3.6% in just two months. This change occurred alongside an increase in ETH supply due to reduced activity in the burn mechanism, reversing the prevailing scarcity trend.\n\nOn Oct. 12, regulatory concerns escalated after the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution (ACPR), a division of the French Central Bank, highlighted the \u201cparadoxical high degree of concentration\u201d risk in decentralized finance (DeFi). The ACPR report suggested the need for specific rules governing smart contract certification and governance to protect users.\n\nDerivatives data and dropping TVL reflect bears\u2019 control\n\nTaking a closer look at derivatives metrics provides insight into how professional Ether traders are positioned following the price correction. Typically, ETH monthly futures trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium to compensate for delayed trade settlement, a practice not unique to the crypto markets.\n\nETH 2-month futures premium vs. spot market. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe premium for Ether futures reached its lowest point in five months on Oct. 12, signaling a lack of demand for leveraged long positions. Interestingly, not even the 8.5% Ether price rally between Sept. 27 and Oct. 1 could push ETH futures above the 5% neutral threshold.\n\nEthereum\u2019s total value locked (TVL) decreased from 13.3 million ETH to 12.5 million ETH in the past two months, indicating reduced demand. This trend reflects diminishing confidence in the DeFi industry and fewer advantages compared with the 5% yield offered by traditional finance in U.S. dollars.\n\nEthereum network TVL ex-native staking. Source: DefiLlama\n\nTo assess the significance of this decline in TVL, one should analyze metrics related to decentralized application (DApp) usage. Some DApps, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, are not financially intensive, rendering the value deposited irrelevant.\n\nTop Ethereum DApps 7-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nRegrettably, for Ethereum, the drop in TVL is accompanied by decreasing activity in most ecosystem DApps, including the leading DEX, Uniswap, and the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea. The reduced demand is also evident in the gaming sector, with Stargate showing only 6,180 active accounts on the network.\n\nWhile regulatory concerns may not be directly related to Ether\u2019s classification as a commodity, they could adversely affect the DApps industry. Furthermore, there is no assurance that key pillars of the ecosystem, such as ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation, will remain unaffected by potential regulatory actions, particularly in the United States.\n\nConsidering the reduced demand for leveraged long positions, declining staking yields, regulatory uncertainties and a broader lack of interest (as reflected in Google Trends), the likelihood of Ether dropping below $1,500 remains relatively high.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen shed light on Ethereum's (ETH) performance, which, contrary to popular belief, has not been as robust as many in the crypto community think it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCowen presented compelling data: on May 12, 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH were priced at $26,800 and $1,804, respectively. Fast forward to October 11, 2023, and BTC's price steadfastly held at $26,800, whereas ETH had dwindled to $1,564. This downtrend was not just a momentary lapse but was reflected starkly in the ETH/BTC ratio, which progressively slipped from 0.067 to 0.058 in the same period.\n\nMay 12th, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1804\n\n\n\nJune 20th, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1790\n\n\n\nSep 1st, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1630\n\n\n\nOct 11th, 2023:\n\nBTC: $26,800\n\nETH: $1564\n\n\n\nBut people keep telling me \u201cETH is holding up well\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 11, 2023\n\nA counterpoint was raised by a crypto enthusiast who emphasized ETH's 77% surge from its low, outpacing BTC's 73% climb. However, Cowen swiftly noted the selective nature of these statistics. He stressed that a holistic view paints a different picture \u2014 from their all-time highs, BTC had retracted by 61%, while ETH saw a sharper decline of 68%.\n\nCurrent market analysis further cements Cowen's stance. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $26,727.99, maintaining a semblance of stability. In contrast, Ethereum struggles at around $1,551.34, a concerning figure for investors who recall its past highs.\n\nThis discourse is not just about numbers; it is a lesson in market perception versus reality. Ethereum, despite its groundbreaking contributions to the DeFi and NFT sectors, has not been impervious to market strains. Its trajectory, when juxtaposed with Bitcoin's, highlights the nuances of market movements and the fallacy of general assumptions.\n\nMomentary spikes and troughs can be deceptive, and an asset's true health is often revealed in longer-term trends and broader market contexts. This revelation does not undermine Ethereum's potential but serves as a grounding notice to traders to delve deeper, looking beyond the surface-level chatter to make informed investment decisions."

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Talks Up Protocol Enshrinement - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin quietly published an intriguing technical overview last month, describing the process of \u201censhrining\u201d certain features in the blockchain\u2019s core protocol or moving certain layer two functions to layer one.\n\nInterestingly, similar conversations have been occurring in the Bitcoin community where Paul Sztorc, CEO and founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm LayerTwo Labs, has been vigorously arguing for the viability of drivechains \u2013 a type of sidechain or secondary blockchain that interacts with the primary Bitcoin network.\n\nThese technical conversations have been largely overshadowed by the high-profile trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO and founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.\n\nEthereum\u2019s protocol enshrinement and Bitcoin\u2019s potential implementation of drivechains (which won\u2019t be covered below, but a brief synopsis can be found here) will likely have far more impact on the industry in the long run than Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial, regardless of how much attention the latter receives in the short term.\n\nIf Bankman-Fried is convicted, it will certainly reverberate for years to come. But a fundamental change in the mechanics of the world\u2019s top two blockchains will arguably be more consequential.\n\nProtocol enshrinement \u2013 a story of trade-offs\n\nThere are no solutions in crypto, only trade-offs, and few concepts embody that aphorism better than enshrinement.\n\nAccording to Buterin, enshrinement is simply the process of incorporating certain key features that are part of the broader Ethereum infrastructure, directly into the core protocol. Buterin says this minimizes the impact of potential bugs and mitigates validator centralization, among other things.\n\n\u201cFrom the start of the Ethereum project, there was a strong philosophy of trying to make the core Ethereum as simple as possible\u2026by building protocols on top,\u201d Buterin writes. \u201cMore recently, however, there has been some cautious interest in being willing to enshrine more of these features into the core Ethereum protocol.\u201d\n\nSome of those features include account abstraction, which enables smart contract wallets that support critical functions like account freezing and recovery, and zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) that speed up transaction processing in a secure and verifiable way by leveraging cutting-edge cryptography. Enshrining account abstraction and zkEVMs would provide more effective ways of dealing with bugs, according to Buterin.\n\n\u201cIf some set of pieces of code are used by all users, or a very wide class of users, then it often makes more sense for the blockchain community to take on itself the responsibility to hard-fork, to fix any bugs that arise,\u201d writes Buterin.\n\nHe also describes how enshrining liquid staking could prevent validator centralization. Liquid staking involves locking up or staking cryptocurrency on a proof-of-stake blockchain and receiving corresponding tokens from a provider such as Lido. The tokens can be subsequently used for decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\n\u201cIf a single such staking token dominates, that leads to a single, potentially attackable governance gadget controlling a very large portion of all Ethereum validators,\u201d Buterin explains. \u201cTo the credit of protocols like Lido, they have implemented safeguards against this, but one layer of defense may not be enough.\u201d\n\nGradual protocol evolution\n\nDespite these promises of lower bug risk and decreased probability of centralization, enshrinement\u2019s glaring drawback is how it could result in an increasingly complex protocol that eventually becomes overextended and unwieldy.\n\n\u201cWhat features should be brought into the protocol and what features should be left to other layers of the ecosystem is a complicated trade-off,\u201d Buterin explains. \u201cWe should expect the trade-off to continue to evolve over time.\u201d"

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Solana? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After carrying out The Merge last year, Ethereum (ETH 6.26%) has been one of the top-performing cryptos in 2023. It is up more than 30% over the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, a number of other cryptos with large market caps have turned in an even more impressive performance. For example, Solana (SOL 11.69%), an Ethereum rival, is up a stunning 128% year to date. So, should you be buying Solana instead?\n\nInstitutional asset flows\n\nTo help answer that question, consider what's happening with institutional asset flows in the crypto market right now. According to CoinShares, a digital-asset investment firm that tracks the weekly inflows and outflows of digital assets, Solana has become the altcoin of choice for institutional investors. Based on an analysis of digital asset flows, institutional investors appear to be moving their money out of Ethereum and into Solana.\n\nThe latest weekly numbers from CoinShares are stunning, to say the least. Out of the $78 million in net inflows, Solana received more than $24 million of the total. By way of comparison, Ethereum received $10.2 million and Bitcoin (BTC 9.20%) received $43 million. So, the net inflow of institutional investor funds into Solana was more than twice the amount that went into Ethereum.\n\nBy just about any back-of-the-envelope calculation, this shouldn't be happening. Given that Ethereum accounts for nearly 20% of the total capitalization of the crypto market, and Solana accounts for less than 1%, there's no reason to expect institutional investors to allocate so much of their portfolios to Solana. Still, here we are.\n\nAnd this is not a fluke, either. For the first 32 weeks of the year, Solana has seen net inflows in 28 of them, according to CoinShares. Moreover, net inflows into Solana are at their highest levels since March 2022. All of this suggests that momentum is continuing to build around Solana. At the same time, Ethereum continues to see net outflows and is losing momentum.\n\nSolana's long-term growth prospects\n\nThere are several factors that might explain new investor inflows into Solana. Perhaps institutional investors are behaving just like retail investors and are simply chasing performance. With Solana up 122% for the year, this is a distinct possibility.\n\nMoreover, investors might be seeking out altcoins that provide superior diversification benefits. Ethereum still tends to track Bitcoin's performance, while Solana is less correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, I think there's a much bigger factor at play here: Investors are finally waking up to the fact that Solana is superior to Ethereum as a blockchain in terms of rapid processing speed, low transaction fees, and massive throughput potential. Even after The Merge, Ethereum can still process only 15 to 20 transactions per second; Solana can theoretically process 65,000 transactions per second. That tremendous gap in speeds might help to explain why Visa recently partnered with Solana (and not Ethereum) on a new stablecoin payment project.\n\nTaking a big-picture view, Solana could finally be fulfilling its potential as a so-called \"Ethereum killer.\" Ethereum is the past, and Solana is the future. There's something to be said for the fact that, even after The Merge, Ethereum is nowhere close to Solana's level of performance.\n\nIs Solana really the next Ethereum?\n\nSuppose you consider institutional investors to be the smart money. In that case, it's highly significant that they have been voting with their portfolios and moving money out of Ethereum and into Solana throughout 2023. Do they know something that we don't?\n\nWhile Ethereum has had a remarkable run since its launch in 2015, just about nobody is expecting it to replicate that type of performance. Since 2015, Ethereum is up 44,576.12%. Institutional investors might be looking for the next Ethereum to generate those types of otherworldly crypto gains, and have determined that Solana might fit the bill.\n\nI'm increasingly bullish on Solana as a long-term investment. If it continues to line up big-ticket partners like Visa, then it has a legitimate chance to turn in some impressive long-term returns."

        "content": "Road Town, British Virgin Islands--(Newsfile Corp. - October 13, 2023) - LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, listed Ethereum Express (ETE) on October 13, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the ETE/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.\n\n\n\n\n\nETE Listing Banner\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8831/183884_bd0534eb549c89e1_001full.jpg\n\nEthereum Express (ETE) is a blockchain network that employs innovative consensus mechanisms, sharding, and cross-chain communication protocols to achieve scalability, security, and interoperability in the world of decentralized applications (DApps) and digital assets.\n\nIntroducing Ethereum Express\n\nLBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of Ethereum Express (ETE), a cutting-edge blockchain network designed to address some of the most pressing challenges facing the world of decentralized applications (DApps) and digital assets. At its core, Ethereum Express leverages a hybrid randomized DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus protocol known as \"Chaos Consensus.\" This unique consensus mechanism combines elements of DPOS and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance), introducing a random selection process for validating nodes. This innovation not only enhances decentralization but also significantly boosts transaction confirmation speed, enhancing the overall throughput of the network.\n\nOne of Ethereum Express's standout features is its data availability sharding mechanism. By dividing complete blocks into smaller, verifiable pieces or shards, this approach maximizes decentralization while simultaneously improving scalability. Users can choose to store either all data or a subset of shards, ensuring that every node can participate in securing the network and that capacity scales with the addition of new nodes. Ethereum Express also introduces a robust proof of data availability system, utilizing Merkle proofs to ensure the validity and accessibility of data across the network.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Express emphasizes cross-chain communication and interoperability. The \"Time Crossing\" protocol facilitates trustless interactions between chains by establishing a root of trust between them, enabling secure cross-chain asset transfers and automatic verification of state changes. Additionally, Ethereum Express incorporates multi-chain architecture, allowing application-specific chains to be built on top of its infrastructure, providing flexibility and customization for various projects, especially those in the GameFi sector. Moreover, Ethereum Express supports cross-chain contract calls, enabling DeFi applications on one chain to be directly invoked from another.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum Express is a forward-looking blockchain network that addresses scalability, security, and interoperability challenges within the blockchain and DApp ecosystem. Its innovative consensus mechanisms, data availability sharding, and cross-chain communication protocols make it a promising platform for the future of blockchain technology, catering to a wide range of applications and use cases.\n\nAbout ETE Token\n\nETE token, short for Ethereum Express Token, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Express blockchain network. ETE plays a pivotal role within the ecosystem, serving as both a medium of exchange and a store of value. Users can utilize ETE tokens for transaction fees, staking, and participating in the network's governance processes. Additionally, ETE tokens are essential for incentivizing network security and validators, ensuring the integrity and robustness of the Ethereum Express network. As a fundamental element of this innovative blockchain platform, ETE token underpins its functionality and contributes to its vibrant and decentralized ecosystem.\n\nBased on ERC20, ETE has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). The distribution of ETE tokens is designed to be fair and equitable, with a portion allocated for initial investors, validators, ecosystem development, and user adoption, fostering a balanced and sustainable growth of the Ethereum Express network.

For instance, the dYdX crypto exchange built its own ZK roll-up system to help reduce fees for users.\n\nOther solutions are more ambitious, like Loopring, which used the technology to build a general-purpose business platform for trading, swapping, liquidity provision, and payments.\n\nZKSync Era has the highest TVL of all zkEVMs.\n\nFinally, at the most universal level, L2s like Starknet, ZKSync Era, and Linea are open to any Web3 application that could benefit from the scalability and lower gas fees offered by ZK rollups.\n\nAlthough there are plenty of ZK rollup-based L2s already available, Scroll was developed with the vision of creating a user-friendly platform for the full spectrum of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nZK Rollups for the Masses\n\nOne major challenge Ethereum developers faced when working with ZK rollups was the lack of full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). As such, they remain out of reach for many Ethereum dApp developers.\n\nHowever, Scroll contributes to recent advances in EVM-compatible rollups known as zkEVMs.\n\nzkEVM has arguably become the gold standard technology for scaling Ethereum. In this article, I want to share some of the lessons we have learned while building the zkEVM, and how we\u2019ve been thinking of different trade-offs along the way.https://t.co/fQlORnU41r \u2014 Ye Zhang \ud83d\udcdc (@yezhang1998) February 20, 2023\n\nIn fact, the new platform could even be the first \u201ctype 1\u201d zkEVM according to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s four-part categorization whereby type 1 zkEVMs \u201cstrive to be fully and uncompromisingly Ethereum-equivalent.\u201d\n\nThe lack of strong Ethereum equivalence in existing solutions makes them very difficult to use for the average dApp developer. Many ZK rollups require the use of obscure programming languages and a deep understanding of zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nHowever, with Scroll, developers can implement smart contracts using any EVM-compatible language.\n\nArguing that existing solutions are \u201cdeveloper-unfriendly,\u201d Scroll\u2019s developers have said they want to \u201cprovide the best developer experience [\u2026] so that existing Ethereum applications can simply migrate over onto the zk-Rollup as is.\u201d\n\nAccelerating Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n\nThe ZK in ZK rollups refers to the use of zero-knowledge proofs: a cryptographic process for verifying information without revealing its content.\n\nZK rollups offload complex computation and state storage off-chain, processing numerous transactions in a batch and posting only summarized data to the Ethereum mainnet. Using ZK proofs, they can succinctly verify that the summary data is true.\n\nA major obstacle to the widespread use of ZK proofs is the time necessary to generate them. For example, the ZCash network can take over 30 seconds to generate proof for each anonymous transaction. Meanwhile, Filecoin requires around an hour to make each proof.\n\nHowever, Scroll co-founder Ye Zhang has developed a new hardware acceleration method that can increase the speed of proof generation by 100x.\n\nZhang et al\u2019s novel architecture for accelerating zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nIn a recent blog post , Zhang observed that the ultimate goal for the Ethereum community was to \u201cbuild an Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM which can be used to prove mainnet blocks.\u201d\n\nHe also proposed a future Ethereum in which \u201cvalidators don\u2019t need to re-execute a layer 1 block, but instead, they only verify a succinct zk proof.\u201d\n\nThe dream is surely a lofty one, which could dramatically streamline Ethereum\u2019s entire operation. \u201cImagine one day, you can prove the whole history of Ethereum via one single proof,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that super exciting?\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum: Standard Chartered Predicts ETH May Hit $35,000 - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been on a downtrend for the last couple of weeks. The second largest crypto by market cap is down by 5% over the last week and by 2.8% over the last month. However, banking giant Standard Chartered believes that the future is bright for ETH.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Standard Chartered, ETH could reach a price of $8,000 by 2026. This represents a growth of about 419% from current levels. The bank\u2019s bullishness arises from Ethereum\u2019s development in terms of smart contracts, gaming, and tokenization of assets.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: $100 Weekly Investment Turns Into Millions in 2023\n\nHowever, Standard Chartered does not expect ETH to stop at $8,000. The bank expects the crypto to eventually reach $35,000. According to the bank\u2019s Head of FX Research, West, Geoff Kendrick, \u201cWe see the $8,000 level as a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000.\u201d\n\nReaching $35,000 would mean a growth of about 2172%. However, it should be noted that this prediction is considering the future performance and revenue streams of the project. Kendrick stated, \u201cThat valuation assumes future use cases and revenue streams that may not have emerged yet, although the real-world use cases of gaming and tokenization should support their development.\u201d\n\nHe further added that this prediction is \u201cvery long-term,\u201d and is estimated to take place by 2040.\n\nIf Ethereum reaches $35k, how much should you invest to become a millionaire?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nIf ETH were to hit $35k, an investor would need about 28.57 ETH. The value of 28.57 ETH at current price levels is about $44,000. Hence, an investor could potentially become a millionaire by 2040 with an investment of $44,000 right now.\n\nAlso Read: JPMorgan: Ethereum Has Become \u2018More Centralized\u2019 Since Merge\n\nHowever, there is also the possibility that Standard Chartered\u2019s prediction never comes to fruition. The bank\u2019s prediction considers revenue streams that do not exist yet. Hence it is very difficult to say for sure if ETH will actually hit $35k or not."

The charts are whispering some alarming messages, and those in the know are paying close attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpen interest is an essential metric for understanding the futures market. It represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not yet been settled. When open interest is high, it indicates that many traders have open positions on the market. For Ethereum, open interest has been ramping up continuously. But what does this mean? And more importantly, why should we be concerned?\n\nThe recent charts for Ethereum depict ever-increasing open interest. The continual upward trend in open interest indicates a growing number of investors betting on the future price movements of ETH, either up or down. While high open interest can be seen as a sign of heightened activity and interest in Ethereum, it also suggests that there is a lot of speculative trading happening. Speculative trading, as history has shown us, can lead to intense volatility.\n\nWhen examining the attached open interest chart, one notices a stark divergence. While Ethereum's price has seen fluctuations and is showing signs of consolidation, the open interest continues to surge. This divergence can be a precursor to significant price swings. When there is a discrepancy between price movement and open interest, it often suggests that a considerable price shift is on the horizon.\n\nThis \"scary\" surge in open interest, paired with volatile price actions, could lead to what traders term a \"long squeeze\" or a \"short squeeze.\" If the majority of these open contracts are betting on Ethereum's price to go up (long positions) and the price starts to drop, it could trigger a cascade of sell-offs."

        "content": "It was not too long ago that the key concern regarding Ethereum\u2019s future was the desperate need for it to scale. High network activity and subsequent gas costs spawned an explosion of layer-2 solutions.\n\nThus, the most recent developments on Ethereum have been focused on infrastructure and how to reduce the load on the once heavily burdened network. Now, it finally seems to be ready for prime time.\n\nBut where did all the traffic go?\n\n\u201cThe argument was always, well, if you increase throughput by a hundred X, which has happened, then you should increase transactions by a hundred X, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d says the head of digital asset trading at GoldenTree, Avi Felman.\n\nOn the 1000x podcast (Spotify/Apple), Felman says, \u201cyou\u2019ve just moved all the transactions from ether (ETH) to Arbitrum, and you\u2019ve barely increased the overall amount of transactions that are occurring.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone was kind of expecting it to look good on a deflationary basis,\u201d Felman says, \u201cbut that\u2019s just not going to be the case as long as activity is mostly on Base, or mostly on Arbitrum or mostly on Optimism.\u201d\n\nMore lanes = more traffic?\n\nGoldman Sachs executive director Jonah Van Bourg compares his expectations for Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions to the constant addition of freeway lanes in California. \u201cEvery time they add a new lane, it just brings more cars onto the freeway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the same thing would happen to ETH,\u201d he says, but instead it\u2019s looking more like the network of pipelines in the Permian Basin in Texas.\n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019s just too much oil,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything\u2019s bottlenecked. So then there\u2019s this frenzy of pipeline building, which is effectively a scaling solution for an oil field. And then suddenly there\u2019s just way too much pipeline capacity and not enough oil.\u201d\n\nVan Bourg explains that scaling solutions were overbuilt during a period of particularly high demand in Ethereum\u2019s history. Now, capacity is much greater than demand, Van Bourg says, \u201cso gas prices are just forced into the toilet.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum blockspace on track for first unprofitable month since the Merge\n\nVan Bourg expects the pendulum to \u201cswing back the other way hard one day\u201d when people realize, he says, \u201cwe have this thing that\u2019s cheaper and better than AWS for our use case \u2014 and probably more permanent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that might be a year off, or six months off, or two years off, who knows.\u201d\n\nVan Bourg notes that negative sentiment regarding Ethereum on \u201ccrypto Twitter\u201d might pressure holders to think short term. \u201cYou read tweets where people who have been ETH-bullish for five years are just like, \u2018It\u2019s over. Never buying this crap again.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at your ETH and you look at these tweets and you\u2019re probably saying to yourself, \u2018Crap, I\u2019m going to get out.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRemind yourself,\u201d he says, \u201cthat in 12 or 18 or 24 months when this thing is gassing higher and it\u2019s trading $5,000 a token, those very same people will be talking about how ETH is the future, how it\u2019s going to $50,000 a token, how they\u2019ve been long all the way up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gradient of outcomes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not black and white. ETH is not over. ETH is not the future. It\u2019s this constantly evolving shade of gray.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to filter out the noise.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Join us as we delve into VanEck\u2019s forecasts for Ethereum\u2019s value and the factors shaping their predictions.\n\nMost importantly, discover what this could mean for your investments and the crypto market as a whole.\n\nUnderstanding the Base Case\n\nVanEck\u2019s core estimate for Ethereum\u2019s future value is an impressive $11,000 per coin. They believe this projection is possible as Ethereum\u2019s market size is expected to grow from $2.5 billion annually to a substantial $50 billion within the next six to seven years. This suggests a substantial increase in Ethereum\u2019s worth compared to its current price.\n\nWhile some reports speculate that Ethereum could reach $50,000 by 2030, VanEck\u2019s base case of $11,000 remains their most recent and steady estimate.\n\n\u201cWe just refreshed this internally to make sure it\u2019s still valid. Our base case is $11,000 per coin for Ethereum, and that\u2019s based on a topline that grows from about 2.5 billion dollars annuallyized today to $50 billion over the next six to seven years. I mean, we\u2019re going to need to see some decentralized apps go viral and get mass adoption to achieve that price target.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Decoding Ethereum\u2019s Decline: Are Foundation Sales a Red Flag?\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis takes into account various crucial factors, such as Ethereum\u2019s growing adoption and the expansion of its market. This optimistic outlook depends on the expectation that Ethereum will keep growing. Nevertheless, it\u2019s vital to remember that market changes and developments can significantly impact these projections.\n\nHe mentioned that the crypto landscape might change due to macroeconomic factors. Typically, Bitcoin becomes more dominant during cryptocurrency bear markets, while Ethereum is considered a riskier asset. However, investors seek even riskier assets when the cryptocurrency market is bullish, leading to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies performing well.\n\nRead More: How Ripple Case Developments Could Impact Ethereum\u2019s Fate\n\nIn conclusion, VanEck\u2019s analysis paints a promising picture for Ethereum\u2019s future value, with a base case of $11,000 per coin."

        "content": "A prominent crypto venture capital firm is comparing Ethereum (ETH) to the mobile operating system Android and Solana (SOL) to iOS.\n\nIn a new blog post, Placeholder Capital makes a case for why Ethereum and Solana are comparable to the two different operating systems.\n\n\u201cEthereum and Solana are like Android and iOS. Android values modularity: it runs on many different types of devices made by hundreds of manufacturers worldwide; Google only makes 1-2% of them. This approach made it the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, with an estimated 60-75% market share.\n\nAndroid\u2019s flexibility has been a boon for hardware companies making anything from smartphones to televisions, as they can bring new products to market without investing billions into building bespoke operating systems. However, such diversity also makes it more difficult to develop apps that seamlessly work across many devices with different specs, screen sizes, and the various versions of Android these devices run.\u201d\n\nThe venture capital firm says that iOS has significant qualities that Android lacks, including a more consistent user experience.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, because Apple makes all iOS devices, it can provide users and developers with a more integrated and consistent experience. The time saved by not having to optimize across different devices can go into delivering better apps that users are willing to pay a premium for, and it\u2019s not uncommon for companies to launch on iOS first as a result.\n\nSo, while Apple has just about a third of the market in terms of distribution, it does a much better job at capturing the value of its ecosystem with a whopping ~60% of all mobile spend, plus all the hardware revenue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Placeholder Capital, Ethereum\u2019s likeness to Android is helping to boost its layer-2 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cEthereum is similar to Android in that it\u2019s quickly becoming more of a platform for third-party networks than the place where most end-users and developers operate.\u201d\n\nSolana offers developers certain benefits over Ethereum, including speed and cost, according to the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana is similar to iOS in how it values tightly integrated components in the name of throughput and performance. There\u2019s much more to it \u2013 different consensus mechanisms and design principles \u2013 but ultimately, Solana as a single, unified network is much faster and cheaper than Ethereum and many other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This initiative allows Upland to accelerate on its mission to build the world\u2019s largest digital open economy in the metaverse through its dynamic ecosystem of players, entrepreneurs, creators, and developers by allowing its utility token, Spark, to be traded outside of Upland\u2019s boundaries.\n\nUpland presented the Sparklet White Paper to the community to review in late September, which outlined the initiative to bridge the in-app token Spark to Ethereum where it will be mirrored and minted as the Sparklet token, equivalent to one-thousandth of Spark. The Sparklet White Paper details the need for Spark to support value creation in the metaverse. It is the resource required for world-building, joint community projects, no-code NFT minting, and \u201cmanufacturing\u201d of 3D map assets, such as cars, decor, and more. Current and future utility details along with tokenomics, Sparklet vesting schedules, implementation, and token distribution were also presented to the Upland community in the White Paper for comment ahead of the governance vote.\n\nWith the community approval of the Sparklet White Paper, Upland is now preparing the next steps to make Spark tradable outside of Upland via a Token Tradability Event (\u201cTTE\u201d), where Spark, a utility token on the EOS blockchain, will be mirrored by the Sparklet token on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy executing the Spark TTE, Upland advances its path toward progressive decentralization, where Spark holders will now be able to trade Sparklet in liquid markets. Additionally, it aims to enhance its presence within the broader Web3 industry through listing on external exchanges, attracting a larger user base to the platform, and enhancing the platform\u2019s network effects.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAdhering to our mission to build the largest digital open economy, Sparklet allows us to take the next step towards progressive decentralization in a responsible way by offering tradability to our users while having mechanisms in place that can shield and protect Upland\u2019s economy from unwanted externalities,\u201d says Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Upland, Dirk Lueth. \u201cThe upside of Sparklet traded on an external exchange means of course higher visibility and more credibility for Upland, which contributes to a positive ripple effect in the web3 community, and also improved liquidity for current Spark holders.\u201d\n\nSpark holders in Upland will have different reasons why they want to increase or decrease their holdings. For instance, some players might want to accelerate building structures on their virtual properties which requires more Spark while others are done with most of their world-building plans and have a reduced need for Spark which they can now liquidate via Sparklet. Creators, Entrepreneurs and Brands might need different amounts of Spark because they want to increase or decrease their manufacturing capabilities. And finally Developers might create additional demand because they introduced a new utility for Spark.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to study the Spark economy since we launched it two years ago, which gives us the confidence to provide the right model for it to be sustainable for decades to come in Upland,\u201d says Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Upland, Idan Zuckerman. \u201cWith Sparklet, we are excited that players will be able to truly own Spark and trade it in liquid markets.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Spark needs to be staked in Upland in order to build or manufacture items. The white paper states that there are over 130,000 players in Upland who hold Spark, with 93.6% of those who purchased Spark using it to build in Upland.\n\nSparklet equals one-thousandth (1/1,000) of one Spark and will exist on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. Sparklet tokens will be able to be uploaded from Ethereum to Upland, where they will be converted into Spark at x/1,000 factor, while Spark tokens can be reclaimed from Upland to Ethereum using the reverse calculation.\n\nAs part of the TTE, a total of 1,000,000,000 Sparklet tokens as finite supply will be issued on Ethereum. These tokens will be mirrored by 1,000,000 Spark that will be minted in Upland on the EOS blockchain. The community-approved Sparklet White Paper highlights that the amount of Spark that is under ownership in Upland will always be exactly equal to the amount of Sparklet that is present in an escrow on the Ethereum bridge.\n\nUpland, a US based company headquartered in Silicon Valley, CA, has not issued a tradable token given regulatory uncertainties in the US crypto space. Recent developments such as the groundbreaking SEC v. Ripple ruling the United States Southern District Court of New York opened the door for token tradability. Upland has never sold its internal utility token to investors.\n\nTo read the Sparklet White Paper and follow the announcements of Upland\u2019s utility token, refer to the Sparklet pages on the Upland website www.upland.me/sparklet and follow Upland on X (formerly Twitter) and Discord.\n\nAbout Upland\n\nUpland, the Metaverse Super App, is a web3 metaverse platform mapped to the real world on a mission to build the largest digital open economy. Our ecosystem is a diverse community of players, entrepreneurs, creators, developers, and brands, all benefiting from true ownership and guaranteed intellectual property rights powered by blockchain technology.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst says Ethereum (ETH) challenger Cardano (ADA) may be approaching a long-awaited breakout moment.\n\nAli Martinez tells his 31,100 followers on the social media platform X that ADA could move above the upper bound of an enduring consolidation range as early as December.\n\n\u201cCardano\u2019s current consolidation trend eerily mirrors the 2018-2020 phase! If history repeats, ADA could stay in this consolidation phase until July 2024.\n\nBarring unforeseen events like the COVID-19 crash, ADA could break out as soon as December!\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader is looking for ADA to cross the $0.50 mark. If that happens before the end of the year, he believes it would likely surpass the $6 level by the end of 2024.\n\nADA is trading for $0.24 at time of writing.\n\nThe trader is also weighing in on Bitcoin (BTC). He says the crypto king needs to convincingly close above $28,233 to ignite a bull cycle. He bases the prediction on the Warm Supply Realized Price indicator, which comprises the less active component of the short-term holder supply, right through to the start of the long-term holder cohort.\n\n\u201cBitcoin Warm Supply Realized Price indicator suggests that the bull run will only reignite if BTC secures a sustained close above $28,233!\u201d\n\nMartinez is watching the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that aims to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.\n\n\u201cBitcoin: In the past month, the four-hour chart RSI has been the real MVP for spotting those local highs and lows!\n\nThe strategy is simple: buy BTC when RSI dips below 30.35. Sell BTC when RSI exceeds 74.21.\n\nNotice the RSI recently dropped below 30.35, signaling a potential buy-the-dip opportunity!\u201d\n\nNext up, the trader says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which traces a series of price points to signal possible trend reversals, is suggesting Ethereum could soon bounce.\n\n\u201cEthereum is moving within a steady range. Interestingly, the TD Sequential presented a buy signal at the lower end of this range, suggesting ETH could rebound to $1,630.\n\nBut be cautious: if ETH closes below $1,530, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,536 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Market Falls As Bitcoin Climbs - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is once again dealing with immense selling pressure while bulls move swiftly to defend support at $1,550. The hype around the approval of a bunch of Ether futures ETFs early last week propelled ETH to $1,750 but a weak crypto market structure coupled with profit-taking among investors cut short the recovery, leading to a sharp dive.\n\nThe largest smart contracts token although barely unchanged over the last 24 hours, is down 4.6% in a week to trade at $1,557 on Thursday. Approximately $7.5 billion in trading volume has come in during the same period while Ether\u2019s market capitalization holds at $187 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Cedes Ground As Bitcoin Gains\n\nEthereum is ceding ground to the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin as investors seek exposure to the most popular digital asset amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions caused by the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSince June, Ethereum\u2019s market value has shrunk by 18% while Bitcoin lost around half of the same amount in the period to $522 billion. In the last seven days, market value decreased by 4.6% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 2.9% drop to $26,792.\n\nThis downward trend has led to a drop in Ethereum\u2019s percentage of the total market capitalization to 17.9% from approximately 18.4% at the beginning of 2023. According to market data aggregated by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has come up stronger with its market value rising from 40% at the beginning of the year to 50%.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Ethereum network has suffered significant setbacks in the last few weeks, with network activity and gas fees dwindling. At the same time, the token\u2019s supply has been on an upward trajectory following months of deflation.\n\nInvestors are also choosing Bitcoin over Ethereum as the war in the Middle East rages on. Ethereum has increased by 32% this year, slightly less than half of Bitcoin\u2019s 66% growth.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Ether has been massively underperforming the broad market since the Merge, with both the ETH/BTC price and volume ratio trending downwards over the past year,\u201d research firm Kaiko said in a report. \u201cEther\u2019s underperformance is likely due to the ongoing impact of the bear market, which historically has seen traders turn to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nEthereum Price On The Verge of A Bigger Dip\n\nEthereum price is holding below all the bull market moving average indicators including the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-week EMA, and the 200-week EMA.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the bearish outlook as the indicator drops below the midline (50) heading toward the overbought region (below 30).\n\nLosing support at $1,550 would mean abandoning a potential trend reversal due to the formation of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart. The next possible support area from here is the buyer congestion at $1,450 but traders cannot rule out extended losses to $1,230 and $1,050, respectively.\n\nAn immediate recovery would be possible if bulls stand their ground at $1,550 and push to reclaim higher support at $1,600. This move would be enough to call investors back with the anticipation of a falling wedge pattern breakout targeting $1,800 and highs above $2,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nThe CoinCodex price prediction algorithm forecasts Ethereum price will surpass $10,000 by 2028 and reach $35,000 by 2037\n\nCoincidentally, Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s lead researcher believes that ETH will reach $8,000 by the end of 2026 and consolidate in the $26,000 to $35,000 range in the long term\n\nThe reasons for Ethereum\u2019s price increases include BTC halving, gaming, and tokenization, with the launch of an Ethereum spot ETF being the most immediate one\n\nEthereum price could reach as high as $35,000, according to Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s head of research\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been on a downward trend since April, when the second-largest crypto recorded its yearly high of $2,133. The cryptocurrency is currently changing hands at $1,564, down roughly -27% since its YTD high and nearly -70% removed from its ATH of $4,867 in 2021.\n\nBut the fortunes of ETH holders might soon be changing for the better. According to head of forex and crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, Geoffrey Kendrick, we could see Ethereum retest the $4,000 by the end of 2024. What\u2019s more, Kendrick says that ETH/USD will reach $8,000 by the end of 2026 and proceed to climb to between $26,000 and $35,000 \u2013 a price range Kendrick identifies as Ethereum\u2019s \"long-term structural valuation.\"\n\nStandard Chartered believes gaming and tokenization trends hold the most growth potential for Ethereum. Source: Standard Chartered Research\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s lead analyst believes that the reasons for the massive price increase are gaming, tokenization, upcoming BTC halving, and regulatory breakthroughs that might lead to the launch of an Ethereum ETF in the US. The launch of an ETF is the most immediate potential price catalyst, so let\u2019s explore that further.\n\nEthereum spot ETF could be an immediate price catalyst\n\nOn October 2nd, we saw the launch of nine different ETFs that provide investors with exposure to Ethereum. This includes products launched by asset managers Bitwise, ProShares, VanEck, Valkyrie, Kelly, and VolShares. These ETFs are based on the price of Ethereum futures contracts traded on the CFTC-regulated exchange CME.\n\nJust like with Bitcoin, U.S. investors don\u2019t yet have access to a spot Ethereum ETF. However, there are markets where investors can already buy Ethereum ETFs that actually hold ether. For example, spot Ethereum ETFs are available in both Europe and Canada. Some asset managers are pushing to launch Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S. market. For example, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest submitted a filing with the SEC to launch such a product, and Grayscale is looking to convert their Ethereum trust into a spot ETF.\n\nIn early October, former BlackRock managing director Steven Schoenfield told the panel at CCData\u2019s Digital Asset Summit in London that he gives \u201cthree to six months\u201d before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a Bitcoin spot ETF. He also said that he believes that a spot ETF could facilitate up to $200 billion in fresh capital flowing into the Bitcoin market.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that approval for an Ethereum spot ETF would follow soon after a Bitcoin spot ETF \u2013 in the end, the SEC considers both assets commodities so there\u2019s no regulatory barrier on that front. It is also reasonable to assume that capital inflows would represent a decent chunk of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2024-2030\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction model, ETH could surpass $8,000 by the end of 2025, which is largely in line with the prediction made by Kendrick. This price increase would coincide with the next Bitcoin halving, which is expected to happen in Q1 2024. Historically speaking, BTC halvings have arguably been the most important market events in crypto, driving prices to new highs roughly every four years.\n\nAI predicts Ethereum to reach as high as $12,700 by 2029.\n\nBy the end of the 2020s, the model expects Ethereum to surpass $10,000. Going forward, the price of ETH could reach $35,000 by 2037, which is again broadly in line with the model presented by Kendrick.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, a logarithmically plotted chart of ETH\u2019s historical and (potential) future price moves, predicts a mean value of ETH by the end of 2028 at roughly $9,200.\n\nThe bottom line: Predictions are one thing, reality is another\n\nYou should note that no matter the quality of prediction models and how many factors are taken into account, there is a decent chance that the future doesn\u2019t pan out as predicted. There are simply too many variables that can impact the markets and render predictions virtually worthless. Still, analyzing historical price movements and creating price prediction models can offer great insight into market movements and serve an important role when trying to understand the behavior of the markets.\n\nThat said, there are sound reasons to assume that ETH might be primed for an upswing in the future. Setting aside the cyclical nature of crypto markets driven by BTC halvings, Ethereum\u2019s role as a financial hub of the crypto ecosystem is undeniable, and if the ecosystem continues to grow, so will Ethereum.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the potential long-term price movements of ETH, check out our Ethereum price predictions for 2040 and 2050."

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently gave his thoughts on whether the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had given Ethereum a regulatory free pass as recent rumors suggest.\n\nCardano Founder Alleges Favoritism Toward Ethereum\n\nIn an AMA session shared on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson mentioned that the Himman emails and other revelations expose the thought process of the SEC and show that there was unequal application, which he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with. Furthermore, he believes that none of the Commission\u2019s actions presupposes corruption but only favoritism.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Hoskinson happens to be a co-founder of Ethereum. However, he was forced to exit the team after he suggested that Ethereum be run as a commercial entity rather than a nonprofit, but this idea didn\u2019t seem to resonate with others on the team.\n\nAs such, one can easily assume that there could be some form of bias in his statement, as he could feel endeared to Ethereum despite the circumstances surrounding his exit. Reacting to the clip, One X user stated that Hoskinson\u2019s \u201cold ETHGATE buddies\u201d may have convinced him to make such statements.\n\nMeanwhile, others in the crypto community criticized his statement, emphasizing that there was really no difference between favoritism and corruption, especially when a government agency is involved. Some went as far as alleging that Hoskinson could well have been involved in the scandal and that he was talking \u201clike a defendant.\u201d\n\nETH price continues to struggle | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHimman Emails And Other Revelations A Big Deal\n\nWhile Hoskinson may have tried to downplay the Himman emails and other revelations, they undoubtedly lay a foundation as to possible wrongdoings of the Commission. For one, the email showed that Bill Hinman had interacted with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin before he gave his speech, where he mentioned that ETH wasn\u2019t a security. With this in mind, Buterin could have possibly influenced Hinman\u2019s speech.\n\nThere have also been revelations of how the SEC had close ties with Ethereum, which instantly presupposes a conflict of interest as it becomes harder to regulate or deal fairly with such a body without being influenced by external factors.\n\nMeanwhile, Steven Nerayoff, who was an active participant during Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO), continues to allege that the SEC was corrupt in its dealings with Ethereum and that he has evidence to back up his claims.\n\nPro-XRP legal expert John Deaton has also confirmed Nerayoff\u2019s claims as he has seen this supposed evidence under the attorney-client relationship.\n\nIn his announcement last month, Deaton mentioned that Bill Himman\u2019s cross-examination would be of \u201cepic proportions\u201d and even offered to handle that personally if the SEC\u2019s case against Ripple were to go to trial.\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "After a strong start to the month of October 2023, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has come under significant selling pressure slipping under $1,600 earlier this week.\n\nAt press time, ETH is trading at a price of $1,558 with a market cap of $187 billion. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that the Ethereum price has been relatively stable within a consistent range. Notably, the TD Sequential indicator has generated a buy signal near the lower boundary of this range, indicating the potential for ETH to recover to $1,630.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to exercise caution. Should the ETH price close below the $1,530 mark, it could invalidate the bullish outlook.\n\nMixed Reviews on Ethereum\n\nAs per the Reuters report on Wednesday, October 11, Standard Chartered Bank expects the ETH price to touch $8,000 within the next two years or utmost by early 2026. This optimistic perspective is grounded in Ethereum\u2019s expanding presence in smart contracts, gaming, and the tokenization of conventional assets. Additionally, Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research at Standard Chartered, suggested a more ambitious structural valuation in the long term, ranging from $26,000 to $35,000 by 2040, driven by emerging real-world use cases.\n\nHowever, not everyone is bullish about Ethereum going ahead. Following the Shanghai upgrade in April, there was a 12% reduction in daily transactions on the Ethereum network, according to a report from JPMorgan Chase. Analysts at the bank, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, raised concerns about the diminishing network activity on the platform.\n\nThere was a substantial 20% decline in daily active addresses. Additionally, the total value locked on the Ethereum network dropped by 8%. Furthermore, the introduction of nine Ether futures ETFs yielded disappointing results. As a result, ETH has been losing ground to Bitcoin. Ethereum Price Predictions As said, Ethereum is trading in the crucial demand zone in the range between $1,530-$1,630 levels. Lately, Benjamin Cowen, a renowned analyst known for his precision, has expressed his views on Ethereum through his YouTube channel. He predicts that Ethereum, a widely recognized cryptocurrency, is likely to experience a decrease in value by the end of this year. \u201cIn my opinion, the most likely outcome is that Ethereum will drop to less than $1,200 within the next two and a half months, and maybe even lower,\u201d he noted. However, Ethereum whales have continued to show hands with the top 10 largest ETH wallets adding 40 million ETH recently."

        "content": "Amid a difficult week for a large part of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has continued to record losses, and machine learning (ML) algorithms predict more bad times for the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization in the near future.\n\nSpecifically, ML-based algorithms used by the cryptocurrency price forecasting platform PricePredictions set the price of Ethereum to reach $1,484.94 by October 31, 2023, as per the most recent information obtained by Finbold on October 12.\n\nEthereum 30-day price forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nProvided that this prediction, relying on indicators such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD), proves correct, it would represent a decline of 4% to the current price of Ethereum.\n\nOn the other hand, the price prediction algorithm over at the crypto analytics websiteCoinCodex is rather bullish on Ethereum, placing its price at $1,784.76 by the last day of October, which would indicate an increase of 15.38%, should it come true.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time trading at the price of $1,546.9, down 1.45% on the day, as well as dropping 5.25% across the previous week and losing 3.76% over the past month, according to the most recent charts on October 12.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, the 1-week technical analysis (TA) gauges over at the finance and crypto monitoring website TradingView are showing a bearish reading for Ethereum that suggests a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 16, as based on oscillators in the \u2018sell\u2019 position at 2 and moving averages (MA) suggesting a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 14.\n\nEthereum 1-week sentiment gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nAll things considered, Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects remain promising, but its short-term upward movements are, indeed, under threat, partially due to the offloading or redistribution of more than 5 million ETH by whales, which have been consistently cashing in on higher prices, as Finbold reported on October 10.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "A recent report from a top-tier bank has sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community with its bold prediction for Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) growth.\n\nStandard Chartered has suggested a potential surge of over 2,000% could be on the cards for ETH \u2013 piquing the attention of investors worldwide.\n\nThis bullish sentiment around ETH has also left investors wondering if other tokens, like Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), might also be poised for sizable gains in the year ahead.\n\nETH in Precarious Position as Price Reaches Critical Support Level\n\nEthereum is currently facing a difficult situation, with the token\u2019s price hovering on the edge of a breakdown below the crucial support level at $1,500.\n\nAfter a brief recovery in late September, ETH rejected the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near $1,735, sparking a steep downtrend.\n\nNow that ETH is just above $1,500, any break below could trigger an even sharper decline.\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, ETH is trapped in a descending wedge pattern, featuring clear lower highs and lower lows.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain data from CoinGlass shows that the 4-hour short volume has increased by 137% to $1.24 billion, indicating bearish sentiment among traders.\n\nOverall, Ethereum is clearly at a major inflection point, with the next few days likely to decide whether the bulls or bears will be in control \u2013 and where ETH will head in the remaining months of 2023.\n\nStandard Chartered Predicts Bright Future for Ethereum\n\nEven with Ethereum stuck in a web of uncertainty, bullish predictions for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency keep rolling in.\n\nThe latest prediction from Standard Chartered Bank forecasted that ETH could rocket over 2,000% in the coming years.\n\nThe UK-based financial giant sees Ethereum hitting $8,000 by the end of 2026, representing a 419% increase from current levels near $1,500.\n\nDriving this price surge are emerging real-world use cases in gaming, NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and enterprise adoption \u2013 cementing ETH\u2019s dominance as the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform.\n\nLonger-term, Standard Chartered predicts Ethereum could reach between $26,000 and $35,000, a staggering 2,173% upside.\n\nUpgrades like proto-danksharding in 2024 are expected to boost Ethereum\u2019s capabilities and justify higher valuations for ETH.\n\nWith major banks like Standard Chartered now calling for colossal ETH price targets like these, the stage looks set for Ethereum to graduate to a key player in the financial and technological landscape.\n\nIs Bitcoin Minetrix The Next Token Set for Lift-Off After Raising $1.2m?\n\nAfter Ethereum, there\u2019s another trending token that\u2019s catching the attention of the crypto community \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nThis innovative project is drawing attention as a potential breakout star thanks to its unique \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model, which allows token holders to earn BTC rewards without the need for mining hardware.\n\nHosted on the Ethereum blockchain, BTCMTX promises yields as high as 488% per year for stakers \u2013 far higher than most comparative staking protocols.\n\nOnce the platform launches, stakers stand to benefit doubly, earning both BTCMTX tokens and BTC payouts through the Stake-to-Mine setup.\n\nGiven the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s unique approach could boost potential rewards for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe promise of double income has created a considerable buzz around Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale, helping it raise $1.2 million in just over three weeks.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale will feature ten stages, each with an incrementally increasing price point for BTCMTX \u2013 meaning the earlier investors get in, the lower the price they\u2019ll secure.\n\nAdding to the presale\u2019s appeal is that Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s platform has been comprehensively audited by Coinsult, one of the world\u2019s premier blockchain security firms.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team is even hosting a $30,000 \u201cMinedrop\u201d giveaway, where ten lucky winners will each come away with $3,000 worth of BTCMTX tokens.\n\nWith big names in the crypto space endorsing BTCMTX and its ability to decentralize the crypto mining process, Bitcoin Minetrix is being touted as the next token on the brink of a massive pump.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

Currently, there are only 223 validators in the entry queue \u2013 a far cry from the peak earlier this year.\n\nThe average wait time for a validator to join the network is also down to just 1 hour and 50 minutes, compared to the 45 days validators had to wait in line in June.\n\nSome market participants have noted that the declining waiting times might be a sign of declining demand for staking. Interestingly, the demand for ETH staking was amplified when the Shanghai upgrade went live in April, with institutional investors depositing three times the amount deposited in the previous month.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade enabled the ability for validators to withdraw their staked ETH after more than two years. Although, it is worth noting that at the time of the upgrade, the majority of ETH staked was underwater.\n\nStill, while the demand for staking ETH now appears to have weaned off, the number of active validators has been on the rise. Data shows that there are currently 857,000 active validators on the network, with around 22% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply staked.\n\nThe counterintuitive numbers might be caused by the increased popularity of liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool, which together have $15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL)."

Bitcoin has only had one negative return in October since 2014, according to Coinglass data.\n\n\u201cWe attribute a large part of why this has happened to the shocking disappointment of the Ethereum ETF, which has only traded roughly 0.2% of the corresponding Bitcoin ETF volume two years ago,\u201d QCP Capital said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 which track the future price of the asset rather than the current price \u2014 clocked up over $1 billion in trading volume in just two days after launching. ProShares\u2019 BITO generated $200 million in the first 15 minutes, as it launched at the peak of the crypto market when Bitcoin was trading around $60,000.\n\nAbout 90% of Ethereum futures ETF volumes is concentrated on VanEck and ProShares products.\n\nInvestors likely \u201cfelt institutions were on the verge of massive Ethereum adoption,\u201d the firm said, adding that \u201cit reflects more the scepticism towards futures ETFs in the space now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr perhaps crypto traders are too distracted right now listening to soundbites from SBF\u2019s ongoing trial,\u201d the firm said.\n\nUS inflation date today could make matters worse QCP Capital said, which, since Covid, \u201chas generally produced upside surprises relative to expectations for this month\u2019s release.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully the relative underperformance of Bitcoin and Ethereum to the upside now also mean their beta is lower to the downside as well, should CPI come in stronger than expected,\u201d QCP Capital said prior to today\u2019s US inflation report.\n\nBeta measures market volatility.

        "content": "Time to Dump Ethereum (ETH) and Buy Bitcoin (BTC)? 3 Reasons Why That Might Be a Good Idea\n\nEthereum Logo / Source: Adobe\n\nIt\u2019s been an ugly month so far for Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network, that remains the dominant blockchain used to power most sectors within web3, including DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, GambleFi and SocialFi.\n\nThe ETH price, which was last trading just under $1,550 after hitting new seven-month lows earlier this week at $1,520, is down a little over 7.5% for the month.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is thus on course to post its third negative month in four, having now pulled back around 28% from April\u2019s yearly highs close to $2,150.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was last trading with losses of only around 0.5% for the month.\n\nAt current levels in the $26,800s, BTC is down a more conservative 16% from its earlier yearly highs near $32,000, which were hit back in June.\n\nWith the ETH/BTC pair having recent hit its lowest level in 15 months earlier this week under 0.058 following a downtrend that has lasted around one year, some investors are asking whether now might be the time to dump Ethereum and buy Bitcoin.\n\nHere are three reasons why that might be a good idea.\n\nThe Technicals Tell a Bearish Story\n\nETH/BTC has been stuck within a bearish falling wedge patter for the best part of a year.\n\nThat is, until about one week ago, when the cross bearishly broke to the downside of this pattern.\n\nETH/BTC has since proceeded to find strong resistance at the downtrend that had formerly been offering support.\n\nThat, combined with the fact that the cross has also in recent months been finding strong resistance at its major moving averages, suggests momentum remains firmly in the hands of the bears.\n\nRecent technical developments strongly suggest a continuation of the recent bearish market bias, and that a test of the mid-2022 lows around 0.049 remain is on the cards for the months ahead.\n\nEther Faces Demand Headwinds and Inflation\n\nWhilst falling spot trading volumes across crypto major cryptocurrency exchanges are indicative of overall subdued demand for cryptocurrencies right now, the poor demand problem seems to be particularly acute for Ether.\n\nA batch of Ether futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) went live in the US last week, but despite a lot of hype, only managed to attract very weak trading volumes, suggesting institutions remain on the sidelines for now.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise given Ether future trading volumes have been shrinking sharply now since March.\n\nAs per data presented by The Block, Ether future trading volumes were only around $250 billion in September, down from around $770 billion in March.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just trading data that suggests fading demand.\n\nVarious on-chain metrics such as active users, number of transfers, total transfer volume and new addresses have been stagnating now for some time.\n\nThat has culminated recently low gas fees and the Ether supply turning inflationary.\n\nAs per Glassnode, the Ether supply was last just over 119.98 million, up from under 119.9 million in late August.\n\nDemand for Ether staking had been a bright spot for the token this year.\n\nBut ETH staking yields are currently consistently below 4%, as opposed to closer to 5% for long-term US government bonds.\n\nThese bonds are considered a risk-free asset, so investors may continue to prefer parking their cash in the safe haven bond market, rather than risking it with Ether for a lower yield.\n\nBitcoin Looks Like the Better Near-term Bet\n\nAs well as facing technical and demand headwinds, Ether also faces greater regulatory risks in the US than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, after all, is the only cryptocurrency that the current SEC leadership has explicitly said it doesn\u2019t think is a security.\n\nThe SEC has been on a rampage in 2023 suing major US firms and labeling cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nWhile the agency hasn\u2019t yet explicitly stated their view that Ether is a security, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has in the past argued that he thinks ETH is a security.\n\nThat means that investors will remain on edge about the regulatory outlook for ETH in the US until there is more certainty, which will probably only come from 1) Congress passing comprehensive crypto legislation or 2) a series of decisive defeats for the SEC in its various lawsuits against US crypto firms (which are unlikely to culminate any time soon).\n\nBitcoin thus remains a safe haven within the crypto space.\n\nWith bullish narratives around Bitcoin likely to grow into 2024, with the SEC expected to greenlight various spot Bitcoin ETFs and the halving coming up in April, now is probably a good time to pivot towards the world\u2019s foremost cryptocurrency."

        "content": "A multi-platform staking solution Lido faces its first serious penalty after its validators misbehaved.\n\nLido, a decentralized finance protocol for staking cryptocurrencies, faces a penalty worth 23 ETH (around $35,500) after 20 of its validators have been slashed.\n\nIn an X post on Thursday, Oct. 12, Lido confirmed the incident, saying the slashed validators have been operated by Launchnodes, a pre-synchronized Geth node for staking, which is part of the Lido protocol.\n\n20 slashings have occurred relating to validators operated by the @launchnodes node operators as a part of the Lido protocol.\n\n\n\nLaunchnodes and DAO contributors are investigating.\n\n\n\nThe validators are offline and slashings have ceased while the root cause is being investigated. \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 11, 2023\n\nNo further details were given so far. Launchnodes is investigating \u201cthe root cause\u201d of the issue while the slashed validators are offline. The team behind the protocol reassured users they are \u201cnot affected apart from a reduction in the daily rewards that will be reflected in tomorrow\u2019s rebase.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: Staking rewards are now taxable, says IRS\n\nAs per Lido\u2019s calculations, the penalty represents about 2.25% of average daily protocol rewards (or 0.00023% of the total value locked in the protocol). The project also noted Launchnodes \u201cimmediately expressed their desire to compensate stakers at the soonest possible time.\u201d It means that stakers will see \u201cno reduced rewards for the day resulting from the outage and slashing.\u201d\n\nOnce future penalties and missed rewards for the slashed validators are finalised (i.e. the validators are withdrawn), a final calculation will be made and @launchnodes have indicated that they will also cover this amount resulting in no lost rewards for stETH holders. \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 12, 2023\n\nWhat is slashing on Ethereum\n\nSlashing is a severe form of penalty in the Ethereum blockchain that results in the forceful removal of a validator from the network and an associated loss of their staked ETH when a validator breaches the proof-of-stake consensus rules.\n\nHowever, this practice is pretty rare in the ecosystem. In early 2023, a pseudonymous Ethereum community consultant Superphiz pointed out that only 0.04% of Ethereum validators have been slashed over the past three years.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin cautions against staking pools adopting DAOs\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz has countered the Cardano founder\u2019s comments about possible motives behind the United States regulators\u2019 determination that Ether (ETH) is not a security.\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson addressed the much-debated ETHgate theory in an AMA session on Oct. 8, arguing that the government\u2019s actions were not about corruption.\n\nETHgate is a conspiracy theory alleging that Ethereum received a free pass from U.S. regulators, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been reiterating its stance that ETH isn\u2019t a security for years.\n\nDespite SEC director William Hinman defining Ether as not a security in 2018, U.S. regulators have been struggling to establish the status of other coins, including XRP (XRP), which has created significant impediments to their adoption.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, Hinman\u2019s speech drafts on the regulatory status of Ethereum \u2014 which were released in June 2023 \u2014 do not prove corruption but favoritism.\n\n\u201cNone of that activity presupposes corruption, just favoritism,\u201d Hoskinson argued in the AMA, adding that \u201cthis is how the internet works, and it can\u2019t be fixed now.\u201d\n\nThe Cardano founder emphasized that there has been no evidence proving anything apart from favoritism by the SEC. \u201cWhat evidence do you have of that? Where are the emails? Where are the meetings?\u201d Hoskinson asked. He also argued that XRP serves different customers, doesn\u2019t even have smart contracts and has an entirely different business model. He added:\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that dilute your entire goal of making Ethereum not a security to also do that? Are you so scared of XRP that\u2019s going to happen? You really believe that? If you do, you\u2019re a crazy person in my book.\u201d\n\nHoskinson\u2019s fresh ETHgate-related remarks have quickly triggered a response from the XRP community, particularly executives like XRP chief technology Schwartz. The XRP community specifically clashed with Hoskinson over the definition of corruption.\n\n\u201cI would argue that a government actor showing favoritism aligned with the personal interests of themselves and their friends is corruption,\u201d Schwartz wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Oct. 12.\n\n\u201cSo saying word \u2018corruption\u2019 in much polite way is \u2018favoritism\u2019,\u201d one commenter stated on X.\n\nRelated: Sam Bankman-Fried just like Bernie Madoff, Cardano founder says\n\nSome community members also alleged that Hoskinson\u2019s questions about ETHgate evidence might be related to the fact that he allegedly has a lot to hide about his early days in Ethereum.\n\nApart from his role at Cardano, Hoskinson is also one of the eight Ethereum co-founders alongside Vitalik Buterin and even briefly held the position of Ethereum\u2019s CEO between 2013 and 2014. Following a public fall-out between the co-founders, Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 to subsequently launch Cardano.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives \u2014 Mt.

It can be followed by additional penalties.\n\nThese penalties are charged over the next 36 days before the validator can withdraw their staked amount, per Ethereum.org. Currently, a validator exit is only possible after November 17.\n\nLaunchnodes notified that the problem occurred because of \u201cinfrastructure and web3 signer configuration issues.\u201d\n\nThe node operator told Decrypt that \"all of Launchnodes' infrastructure is back up and fully operational, and Lido has been reimbursed in full for all losses incurred to date, ensuring that no stETH holder has suffered any loss.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLido Finance did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLast slashing, best slashing\n\nDuring the last major slashing event, when 12 validators were slashed at once on August 26, the loss in penalties to each validator was less than 1.10 ETH.\n\nIn response to such events, the Lido team also highlighted that the protocol has built a reserve \u201ccover fund of approximately 6,200 ETH to help mitigate the slashing impact.\u201d\n\nThe Lido DAO has a cover fund of ~6,200 stETH to help mitigate the slashing impact, but it does not trigger automatically.https://t.co/E0vHMMybbN In all previous instances, damages have been covered by the relevant operator(s), or through this fund. \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) October 11, 2023\n\nThe team is waiting to determine the extent of the losses, which it said cannot be known \u201cahead of time.\u201d\n\nThe community will later decide whether the \u201cLido DAO cover fund should compensate affected holders.\u201d"

        "content": "After a brief uptick, Ethereum faced a significant rejection, causing the price to retreat towards the critical support zone at $1.5K.\n\nCurrently, there is a strong attempt to break below this crucial support. If successful, the market may experience sharp declines.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nLooking at the daily chart, Ethereum initially showed strong bullish momentum after finding support around the $1.5K range. However, upon reaching the 100-day moving average at around $1.7K, Ethereum was rejected, leading to a steep downtrend.\n\nThis downtrend returned to the broken 100-day moving average, indicating a highly bearish trajectory for ETH\u2019s price. It has now revisited its previous major swing low at $1529, aligning with the significant support level of the 61.8% Fibonacci threshold. This zone serves as the final defense for the bulls, and a breach below it could trigger a rapid market cascade.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, we can see a period of sideways consolidation marked by a descending wedge pattern. This consolidation range is bounded by the significant $1.5K support and the notable $1.7K resistance. However, the price recently faced rejection from the upper boundary of this range, leading to a steep downtrend that approached the lower boundary.\n\nThe market is on the verge of breaking below the $1.5K support, with prevailing bearish sentiment strengthening the sellers\u2019 position. A break below this support has become a distinct possibility.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that if buyers manage to overpower the sellers, a sudden reversal could occur, potentially resulting in the liquidation of numerous short positions.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe chart below illustrates the Estimated Leverage Ratio metric in relation to ETH\u2019s price. It provides insights into the average leverage utilized by participants in the futures market. Higher values indicate greater leverage and risk taken by traders in the derivatives market.\n\nHistorically, the metric had been in a downtrend, reaching a yearly low. This signaled a period of stability in the futures market, with traders employing lower leverage. However, there has been a notable increase in the Estimated Leverage Ratio in recent weeks. While it hasn\u2019t reached alarming levels yet, this uptick suggests a growing enthusiasm in the futures market, possibly leading to heightened leverage usage.\n\nIf this surge is sustained, it could indicate an overheating of the futures market. Although the situation isn\u2019t alarming at the moment, it is important to view the continued elevation of this metric with caution. Further increases could trigger a short or long-squeeze event, resulting in sudden and significant movements in Ethereum\u2019s price."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a groundbreaking proposal to elevate the security, efficiency and scalability of the network.\n\nOne significant challenge Ethereum faces is the substantial entry barrier for solo staking, requiring users to lock in a hefty 32 ETH. Additionally, there have been concerns about centralization within staking pools and the excessive number of signatures required for each block, which can impact the network\u2019s overall performance.\n\nOn Saturday, Buterin unveiled a proposal in light of these challenges to address these issues and enhance the network\u2019s overall functionality. Notably, the proposal introduced a novel concept: a two-tiered staking system comprising two distinct participant categories, namely node operators and delegators.\n\nNode operators, the first category, will assume the crucial role of running node. They will act as validators, staking a significant 32 ETH while simultaneously managing various tasks, such as transaction processing and block generation.\n\nOn the other hand, the second category, delegators, shall hold stakes below the 32 ETH threshold. These participants enjoy the freedom to choose and endorse specific node operators. Their involvement in the network\u2019s consensus process will be more lightweight, imposing no minimum commitments or strict obligations beyond providing collateral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, Buterin underscored that the proposal harbours significant potential advantages for Ethereum and its vibrant user community. From the network\u2019s perspective, he emphasized that its implementation would result in a noteworthy reduction in the number of signatures needed per block, lowering it to around 10,000. According to him, this optimization would attract more delegators and enhance scalability while simultaneously reducing computational overhead.\n\n\u201cThis would also aid decentralization by making it much easier for everyone to run a validating node,\u201d he added.\n\nMoreover, Buterin\u2019s proposal addressed the potential to fortify network security. It introduced hurdles that would make it increasingly challenging for potential attackers to acquire a controlling stake within the network. Furthermore, it unlocked avenues for innovative and flexible staking solutions by leveraging smart contracts, adopting liquidity tokens, and exploring various other mechanisms.\n\nThat said, Buterin clarified that the proposed changes can be implemented at multiple levels of abstraction. These adjustments could find their place within staking pools, in interactions between these pools, and even within the Ethereum protocol itself."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLeading decentralized exchange Uniswap released a mobile crypto wallet for Android on Thursday, months after doing the same on Apple\u2019s iOS platform.\n\nThe app is currently in beta while the company invites members of the DeFi community to help it test the wallet before it\u2019s released more widely to users. As per Uniswap\u2019s Twitter feed, some 35,000 users have already signed up to the waitlist.\n\nIn line with the beta launch, the Uniswap Labs team will also open-source the code as part of its Trail of Bits audit. Trail of Bits is a cybersecurity company that offers blockchain auditing, and develops Web3 tools that identify and fix vulnerabilities in smart contracts and other parts of code.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWEN ANDROID?\u201d How about now? \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 \ud83e\udef3\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 The Uniswap wallet is coming to Android users \ud83c\udf10 The beta is LIVE \u2014 sign up here to get early access \u2705https://t.co/9OHhpSqbez pic.twitter.com/vXsn2NS5Sx \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) October 12, 2023\n\nBridgett Frey, a spokesperson for Uniswap Labs, told Decrypt that the Android app is launching today in beta to \u201censure we iron out\u201d any issues as the firm onboards new users, with a broader release expected before the end of the year.\n\nAccording to the Uniswap team, the newly unveiled wallet comes with a set of features for what the firm thinks \u201cmakes a great swap.\u201d A blog post announcing the app\u2019s beta launch promises split-second swaps, easy discovery of new tokens, and transparent pricing that seeks to highlight fees that aren\u2019t readily apparent to traders.\n\nAnother feature is automatic switching between blockchain mainnets, like Ethereum, and layer-2 scaling networks like Optimism or Arbitrum.\n\nFor users looking to swap between layers, Uniswap Labs says the Android wallet will automatically guess the desired target and make the switch. It will offer access to Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Base and BNB Chain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo common exploits in DeFi are known as sandwich and frontrunning attacks. The former refers to when an attacker sandwiches a swap between two transactions to make a profit; the latter occurs when an attacker sees a pending transaction, and knowing the price for which a token will be swapped, submits their own swap.\n\nIn order to defend users against these types of attacks, Uniswap has added \u201cswap protection\u201d to the Android mobile wallet. Essentially, swaps will now default to a private transaction pool, defending users from such MEV attacks.\n\nToday\u2019s launch comes six months after Uniswap launched a version of the app for the Apple iPhone, which the Uniswap Labs team said became a top three download the month it launched. A Uniswap Labs spokesperson did not immediately provide download statistics.\n\nReferring to today's release, Frey told Decrypt that Uniswap Labs \u201calways knew that we would want to quickly follow the iOS launch with an Android app, as Uniswap is a global product and much of the world does not use Apple.\u201d\n\nThe protocol has been under regulatory fire in recent months, after a class action lawsuit was filed against it. The case against Uniswap was ultimately tossed out by New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla, in a ruling that a legal scholar dubbed \u201ca strange kind of anomaly.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were struggling on Thursday as the buyers remained on the sidelines despite a strong rally in the equity market and a fall in a bond-yields. The US PPI for September was a bit stronger than expectations, while US Fed's minutes showed most expect another round of rate hikes to complete the current tightening cycle.\n\n\n\nIn other reports, the Hamas terrorist organization and its affiliates have received millions, about $93 million, in crypto donations between August 2021 to June 2023, said Wall Street Journal based on data from Elliptic, a forensics firm, and BitOK, a Tel Aviv software company. Crypto is often accused and criticized as a subterfuge financing method for such militant groups.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was seen in the falling trajectory as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but managed to hold $26,500-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in red, falling maringally but it was holding above $1,560-mark. Action in the altcoins was on the mixed side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's price dipped below $27,000 as market participants await the US inflation data for September. This signals an active effort by bears to gain control of the market, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex. \"Bitcoin will now need to break through the $27,000 resistance or could potentially receive support around $26,600. Ethereum is trading around the $1560 mark,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading mixed on Thursday. Among the losers, Litecoin dropped about 3 per cent, while Solana was down about 2 per cent. Dogecoin and Polkadot shed about a per cent each. Among the gainers, Chainlink rallied more than 2 per cent, while Toncoin was up about a per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, dropping to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it declined less than half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes rose over 2 per cent to $25.81 billion.\n\n\n\nBTC gained a significant downward momentum as it has continued to slide for three days in a row post touching the all-important $28,500-mark. Even though the $26,500 mark is currently acting as support, any further decline may again lead to a further sell-off that is likely to take Bitcoin down to $24,000 or beyond, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, big development has been seen in the traditional banking sector as one of the world\u2019s largest banks- JPMorgan\u2019s in-house blockchain Onyx has launched its tokenized collateral network,\" he said. \"Investors across financial markets, including crypto, are looking forward to the US CPI data, which is expected to be out later in the day.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe REQ utility token, introduced in 2017, plays a crucial role in upholding the reliability and robustness of the Request Network, a decentralized payment system built on the Ethereum platform that empowers individuals to request payments and securely receive funds.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Request\n\n\n\nOn the weekly time-frame, the price for REQ/USDT surged by nearly 50% in the last week. The trend is traversing within a descending channel pattern and has recently bounced off from the bottom trendline and is on the verge of a pattern breakout with a considerable buildup of volume. The next resistance is expected at 0.14 USDT and a strong support is expected at 0.061 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Ethereum has struggled alongside Bitcoin through the current bear market climate but this has not stopped bullish predictions for the digital asset. The most recent bullish prediction comes from British multinational bank Standard Chartered which believes that the Ethereum price could climb higher than $8,000.\n\nFactors That Could Trigger The Rise\n\nGeoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank has revealed his forecast for the Ethereum price in a research note. According to the researcher, he sees big things in the future of the digital asset which could climb higher than $8,000 in the coming years.\n\nTalking about the asset\u2019s valuation, Kendrick points toward the many use cases for Ethereum that have emerged over the years but also sees more use cases emerging as time goes on. One of those is the much-coveted gaming and asset tokenization sector.\n\nAlso, the Standard Chartered researcher said that they expect that Ethereum will see more growth than the pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While he expects Bitcoin to rise 3.5x, they believe Ethereum will rise 5 from current levels.\n\n\u201cWe think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\u201d the researcher said.\n\nHe also believes that Ethereum would go on to further register its dominance in the space, especially with the Layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum that have popped up to enhance the network. This, he believes, would lead to an increase in the Ethereum profit-earnings ratio (P/E ratio).\n\nETH price succumbs to bear pressure | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Could Climb Above $8,000\n\nIn terms of actual dollar values, $8,000 is not the only figure that the researcher dropped for the Ethereum price. The expectations for the digital asset exceed this four-digit figure right into the five-digit territory as Kendrick believes ETH could rise to anywhere between $26,000 and $35,000.\n\nAs for when this might happen, the researcher seems to be targeting the next bull market as he expects the factors that will drive this value growth to happen between 2025-2026. \u201cWe see the $8,000 level as a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,\u201d he said in the note. Then beyond this, the researcher expects the price to continue to rise.\n\nThis is not the first time that Kendrick has released a bullish prediction for cryptocurrencies. He previously said he expects the price of Bitcoin to reach $120,000 and the entire crypto market to rise as well. However, it seems the researcher is much more bullish on ETH.\n\nNot everyone has provided bullish forecasts for ETH though. One crypto analyst actually believes that the digital asset is set for more decline. In the analyst, FieryTrading suggests that Ethereum\u2019s price could fall as low as $900.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Thu 12 Oct 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nThe crypto sphere is abuzz, and Ethereum (ETH) is at the heart of this excitement. As the second-largest cryptocurrency prepares for a potential rise to $8,000, many experts and financial institutions have expressed their opinions, ranging from the most optimistic to the most cautious. Let\u2019s delve into the intricacies of this prediction and discover the factors that could support or contradict this view.\n\nEthereum: A Potential 5x Increase?\n\nBlackRock and JPMorgan are major players, and their entry into the crypto industry is significant. However, alongside them, specialists are deciphering every nuance of the market.\n\nTheir goal? Predict the next major developments. In this dynamic context, every decision matters.\n\nRecent studies by Standard Chartered Bank have sparked enthusiasm among investors. According to their analysis, the value of Ether could reach $8,000 by 2026, as reported by Reuters.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, a respected expert from the bank, relies on the evolution of Ethereum\u2019s use cases. While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) currently dominate, he anticipates a massive shift towards gaming and tokenization.\n\nThis change would not only represent significant demand but also mark the entry of many traditional industries into the crypto sphere, seeking to capitalize on the advantages offered by Ethereum.\n\nDouble-Edged Perspectives\n\nHowever, despite this optimism, caution is warranted. After an impressive start in October 2023, Ethereum faced selling pressure, falling below the $1,600 mark. Currently, this cryptocurrency hovers around $1,550.\n\nFurthermore, a report from JPMorgan Chase has signaled a 12% decrease in daily transactions on the Ethereum network, with a notable 20% drop in active addresses and an 8% decrease in total value locked.\n\nThe introduction of Ether Futures ETFs has also disappointed, causing ETH to lose ground against its long-time rival, Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto : Entre espoirs et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s\n\nRenowned analyst Benjamin Cowen has a less optimistic view. According to him, Ethereum could even drop to less than $1,200 in the coming months.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to note that Ethereum whales, those investors holding substantial amounts of the currency, remain active.\n\nThe ten largest ETH wallets have recently added 40 million ETH, which could indicate a persistent confidence in the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s path to $8,000 is filled with obstacles, challenges, and uncertainties. If the predictions of Standard Chartered Bank come true, it could mark a historic turning point in the crypto world.\n\nHowever, in the crypto industry, caution remains essential. It is crucial to stay well-informed, not to invest beyond one\u2019s means, and to monitor the movements of key players, such as Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent ETH sale.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with prices of individual coins rising and falling dramatically over short periods. Two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), have seen significant price movements over the past year. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the correlation between their price movements and analyze which of the two might be a more profitable investment. Let\u2019s take a look at this Ethereum vs Cardano article in more detail.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Price Movements Over the Past Year\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nMonth Price (USD) Nov 2022 $1,572.65 Dec 2022 $1,295.77 Jan 2023 $1,196.71 Feb 2023 $1,586.49 Mar 2023 $1,606.04 Apr 2023 $1,821.70 May 2023 $1,868.89 Jun 2023 $1,873.91 Jul 2023 $1,933.32 Aug 2023 $1,856.19 Sep 2023 $1,645.58 Oct 2023 $1,671.16\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nMonth Price (USD) Nov 2022 $0.4063 Dec 2022 $0.3189 Jan 2023 $0.2464 Feb 2023 $0.3909 Mar 2023 $0.3525 Apr 2023 $0.3989 May 2023 $0.3973 Jun 2023 $0.3744 Jul 2023 $0.2870 Aug 2023 $0.3075 Sep 2023 $0.2554 Oct 2023 $0.2540\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Correlation Analysis\n\nFrom the data, it\u2019s evident that both Ethereum and Cardano experienced fluctuations in their prices over the past year. Ethereum\u2019s price ranged from a low of $1,196.71 in January 2023 to a high of $1,933.32 in July 2023. On the other hand, Cardano\u2019s price saw a low of $0.2464 in January 2023 and a high of $0.3989 in April 2023.\n\nWhile both cryptocurrencies experienced their lowest prices in January 2023, Ethereum\u2019s price rebounded more significantly than Cardano\u2019s in the subsequent months.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Profit Predictions for Christmas 2023\n\nTo determine which cryptocurrency would have been more profitable:\n\nEthereum (ETH) : If an investor purchased 1 ETH in January 2023 at $1,196.71 and sold it in July 2023 at $1,933.32, the profit would be $736.61.\n\n: If an investor purchased 1 ETH in January 2023 at $1,196.71 and sold it in July 2023 at $1,933.32, the profit would be $736.61. Cardano (ADA): If an investor purchased 1,000 ADA in January 2023 at $246.40 (total) and sold it in April 2023 at $398.90 (total), the profit would be $152.50.\n\nFrom the above calculations, it\u2019s clear that an investment in Ethereum would have been more profitable than Cardano over the past year, with a profit margin almost 5 times greater.\n\nTo predict the potential profitability of Ethereum and Cardano by Christmas 2023, we can use their current prices as a starting point and consider their historical performance and market trends.\n\nAssuming a linear growth based on their past year\u2019s performance:\n\nEthereum (ETH) : Predicted Price = $1,671.16 + (Average Monthly Growth * 2.5 months)\n\n: Predicted Price = $1,671.16 + (Average Monthly Growth * 2.5 months) Cardano (ADA): Predicted Price = $0.2540 + (Average Monthly Growth * 2.5 months)\n\nWithout exact average monthly growth rates, it\u2019s challenging to provide a precise prediction. To compute the monthly growth rates, we\u2019ll use the formula:\n\nGrowth Rate=(End Price\u2212Start Price/Start Price )\u00d7100\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the monthly growth rates for both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) based on the provided data:\n\nEthereum (ETH) Monthly Growth Rates:\n\nETH/USD Monthly Rate- TradingView\n\nNov to Dec 2022: (1295.77\u22121572.65/1572.65)\u00d7100 = -17.60% Dec 2022 to Jan 2023: (1196.71\u22121295.77/1295.77)\u00d7100= -7.65% Jan to Feb 2023: (1586.49\u22121196.71/1196.71)\u00d7100 = 32.56% Feb to Mar 2023: (1606.04\u22121586.49/1586.49)\u00d7100= 1.23% Mar to Apr 2023: (1821.70\u22121606.04/1606.04)\u00d7100 = 13.43% Apr to May 2023: (1868.89\u22121821.70/1821.70)\u00d7100 = 2.59% May to Jun 2023: (1873.91\u22121868.89/1868.89)\u00d7100 = 0.27% Jun to Jul 2023: (1933.32\u22121873.91/1873.91)\u00d7100 = 3.16% Jul to Aug 2023: (1856.19\u22121933.32/1933.32)\u00d7100 = -3.99% Aug to Sep 2023: (1645.58\u22121856.19/1856.19)\u00d7100 = -11.34% Sep to Oct 2023: (1671.16\u22121645.58/1645.58)\u00d7100 = 1.55%\n\nCardano (ADA) Monthly Growth Rates:\n\nADA/USD Monthly: TradingView\n\nNov to Dec 2022: (0.3189\u22120.4063/0.4063)\u00d7100 = -21.54% Dec 2022 to Jan 2023: (0.2464\u22120.3189/0.3189)\u00d7100 = -22.75% Jan to Feb 2023: (0.3909\u22120.2464/0.2464)\u00d7100 = 58.65% Feb to Mar 2023: (0.3525\u22120.3909/0.3909)\u00d7100 = -9.82% Mar to Apr 2023: (0.3989\u22120.3525/0.3525)\u00d7100 = 13.14% Apr to May 2023: (0.3973\u22120.3989/0.3989)\u00d7100 = -0.40% May to Jun 2023: (0.3744\u22120.3973/0.3973)\u00d7100 = -5.77% Jun to Jul 2023: (0.2870\u22120.3744/0.3744)\u00d7100 = -23.36% Jul to Aug 2023: (0.3075\u22120.2870/0.2870)\u00d7100 = 7.14% Aug to Sep 2023: (0.2554\u22120.3075/0.3075)\u00d7100 = -16.96%\n\nBased on the current prices, Ethereum seems to have a higher potential for profitability by Christmas 2023, given its more substantial price and historical performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile past performance is not indicative of future results, the data suggests that Ethereum has been a more profitable investment compared to Cardano over the past year. However, investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

The move appears to be the first to formally engage its community on how to react to the SEC\u2019s probe.\n\nBarnBridge community can vote in favor of its founders Tyler Ward and Troy Murray, to comply with the regulator\u2019s orders against the firm. They can also vote in favor for the BarnBridge Treasury to pay all \u201cdisgorgement\u201d amounts or fines required by the SEC order.\n\nBarnBridge products are powered by Ethereum, focusing on tokenizing risk exposure. They provide users new ways to hedge their positions.\n\nHolders can also vote to authorize Douglas Park, the legal counsel to BarnBridge, to sign the final version of the SEC order on behalf of the DeFi protocol, the snapshot post read.\n\nBarnBridge Token Holders Voted to Retain Legal Counsel\n\nIn July, the protocol\u2019s token holders were asked to vote on a proposal whether to retain the law firm Douglas Park for the DAO \u201cfor various legal work.\u201d\n\nThis came after Douglas Park posted on the platform\u2019s Discord channel in July, revealing that the platform and individuals have come under the eyes of the SEC investigation. Park suggested \u201call work\u201d on BarnBridge-related products including liquidity pools should halt in order to \u201creduce potential further legal liability.\u201d\n\nSome decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) members raised suspicions over the announcement made by Douglas Park. However, co-founder Tyler Ward shortly after confirmed Park\u2019s message was true regarding the regulator\u2019s probe on BarnBridge."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were struggling on Friday, marking the fourth consecutive session of decline. The lower-than-expected inflation numbers in the United States pushed the dollar index and treasury yields higher, denting the sentiments for the riskier asset class.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was seen in red once again as the last crypto token declined marginally but managed to hold above 26,500 levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped more than a per cent to slip below $1,550-level. Pain in the altcoins continued to weigh on the market sentiments.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has been witnessing a slight dip for the sixth consecutive day. The dip in the crypto markets can be attributed to the September CPI data that came out the previous day, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures. \"The US Dollar Index has climbed, pressuring \u2018risk-on\u2019 asset classes like equities and crypto,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. Toncoin and Solana dropped about 3 per cent each, while Tron, Polkadot and Polygon shed about a per cent each. Shiba Inu inched up maringally, while the US dollar pegged USD Coin also inched maringally up in the early trade.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, dropping to $1.04 trillion-mark, as it declined about half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes tanked about 13 per cent to $22.64 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has been trading around the $26,600 level. The US CPI for September rose by 0.4 per cent instead of the anticipated 0.3 per cent and triggered rise in the US Dollar index. This may have made investors slightly cautious regarding their investments, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Traditional markets have been impacted similarly. Bitcoin will now need to breach the resistance at $26,900 or will potentially seek support around the $26,500 mark. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently at its weakest point since March 2023 and is trading above $1,500,\" he added.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)is currently facing difficulty breaching a previous resistance level ($0.061) and is in a downward momentum. DOGE attempted a rebound to this level this week that coincides with its 50-day moving average but price has instead broken down from a horizontal channel.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-DOGE\n\n\n\nIn case of a further decline, the recent low (at $0.056) serves as an early support level, with the $0.052 zone providing the next line of defence. Price may consolidate in the near term if it continues to hold $0.056 support. Its14-day RSI is in the oversold territory and is currently at 30.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.056, $0.052\n\nResistance: $0.061, $0.064, $0.067\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Ethereum DeFi Exchange AirSwap Rolls Out NFT Marketplace - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAirSwap launched several new features for users of its decentralized exchange on Tuesday, including a decentralized NFT marketplace, new over-the-counter (OTC) trading features, and voter rewards.\n\nThe move to support a broader decentralized economy aligns with AirSwap\u2019s ethos, co-founder Don Mosites told Decrypt in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cThe underlying mission is to bring the idea that decentralized trading is good for everyone to NFTs,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cCentralized venues over the years have grappled with multiple issues, whether its hacks or mismanagement\u2014you run the same risk with NFT platforms.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched in 2017 by founders Michael Oved and Don Mosites, AirSwap is a cryptocurrency exchange that lets users buy and sell digital assets without a third-party intermediary. In 2020, AirSwap\u2019s original developer, Fluidity, was acquired by blockchain software technology company ConsenSys in May 2020. The last major update to the AirSwap decentralized exchange launched in November 2021. (Disclosure: ConsenSys Mesh is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAlso known as a DEX, a decentralized exchange uses smart contracts to facilitate trading between individuals but does not require them to deposit the coins before the trade can occur. Other popular decentralized exchanges include Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, Balancer, and Curve.\n\nWhile proponents of decentralized exchanges champion the benefits of their peer-to-peer systems, DEXs have become a tempting target for cybercriminals.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Department of Justice charged engineer Shakeeb Ahmed with defrauding an unnamed decentralized exchange and allegedly stealing $9 million in crypto in 2022. In August, RocketSwap\u2014the second-largest decentralized exchange by trading volume on Base\u2014was hacked for around $866,500 after a private key was compromised on their servers.\n\nIn addition to the new NFT marketplace, another feature of the updated AirSwap platform, Mosites said, is a more robust OTC trading service, built because the development team wanted to create a space for digital collectibles and design an open-source front-end that can be adapted by community members.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImage: Airswap\n\n\u201cWe wanted to produce a front end that projects can take for themselves, configure, and run on their own,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cSo they have their own decentralized NFT marketplace for their collections that their communities can rally around.\u201d\n\nIntegral to the AirSwap ecosystem is the AirSwap DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). A DAO is a business structure where control is spread out amongst members. Like DEXs, DAOs use smart contracts, with participants using governance tokens to vote on topics such as fund allocation.\n\nThe DAO label in recent years has often been liberally applied in the Web3 space. However, Mosites insists that token-based voting remains at the heart of a genuine DAO.\n\n\u201cThe purest form of a DAO is a token-based voting system that's able to execute changes in an autonomous way,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cWhatever power you give, it\u2019s up to the designers and is a limited set of functions. It's really a decision-making engine that anyone can participate in, and it is economically driven.\u201d\n\nThe updated AirSwap DAO voter rewards program aims to incentivize community members to actively participate in the DAO and uses the popular decentralized voting system Snapshot to incentivize DAO activity.\n\nImage: Airswap\n\nAs Mosites explained, members stake swapped tokens to gain voting power, and a portion of the protocol fees goes into a reward pool for those participating in the decentralized governance of the DAO. AirSwap claims that since 2021, over 32 million AirSwap AST tokens from over 350 active members have been staked to the existing voter rewards system.\n\n\u201cA lot happens in six years,\u201d Mosites said. \u201cWe look forward to the next six years and welcome other projects and companies to join us on the path to opening up their missions\u2014by putting power into the hands of builders and the people and groups they serve.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify members of the founding team.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) is Skyrocketing while Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) Decline - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The dynamic crypto landscape is marked by fluctuations, with investors often on the lookout for bullish waves. In the current scenario, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are witnessing a decline.\n\nMeanwhile, Tradecurve Markets (TCRV), an up-and-coming token, emerges as a promising contender with the potential to mint crypto millionaires.\n\n>Visit The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nWill Ethereum (ETH) Bounce Back?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is often regarded as the pioneer of smart contracts. Notably, it is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, ETH. Ethereum functions as a platform for several cryptocurrencies as well as for the execution of smart contracts.\n\nHowever, the recent downturn in its price has led investors to reconsider their strategy. This Ethereum decline can be attributed to a shift in sentiment, profit-taking, and the bearishness of the broader crypto market.\n\nNevertheless, as a blue-chip token and the second-leading token after Bitcoin, Ethereum will rally in the future. Certainly, a bounceback is on the cards.\n\nIs Cardano (ADA) Dead?\n\nCardano (ADA) is popular for its focus on sustainability and scalability. As a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform, it allows the creation of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts with modularity. At the heart of the Cardano ecosystem is ADA, which primarily functions as a governance token.\n\nThe answer to this question, whether Cardano is dead or not, depends on the timeframe being used as a metric. For instance, since June 2022, ADA has been hovering around or below $0.6. In addition, it has significantly declined from its peak by over 90%.\n\nOn the other hand, with an ROI of over 1,000% since its launch, Cardano is far from dead. The decline in its price can be linked to the bearish sentiment around the broader market. Hence, it is expected to rally alongside the larger market during the bull season.\n\n>>Visit The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nWhat is Tradecurve Markets (TCRV)?\n\nAmidst the decline in the price of Ethereum and Cardano, Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) has positioned itself as a compelling alternative investment. Its innovative concept aims to solve several problems in the trading world. To this end, it will combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Therefore, it will become a hybrid trading platform where users will be able to trade diverse financial instruments and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIts unique value proposition will make it an all-in-one trading platform for the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, commodities, and several other financial instruments. That isn\u2019t all; user privacy will be protected as investors will be able to trade global assets without KYC checks. In addition, all assets, regardless of their type and nature, can be traded from one account.\n\nFurthermore, it will offer deep liquidity across thousands of assets, making up one of its several competitive edges. Additionally, retail traders will gain access to leveraged products, advanced trading tools, zero commission, and tight spreads.\n\nThis novel trading platform will function in three simple steps. First, users will open an account via their email address without KYC, which should take about 2 minutes. Next, traders will decide which crypto they want to add and make the deposit. Finally, the crypto balance can then be used as collateral to trade assets using leverage.\n\nIn light of the points mentioned above, Tradecurve Markets is poised to revolutionize the trading world. Hence, it will skyrocket in value. Moreover, over 18,000 users have already been onboarded, proof of its impending adoption.\n\nThe token, in its current presale stage, is priced at $0.03 per token. However, industry experts predict a rally of 80x before the end of 2023, minting crypto millionaires from early investors in the process.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) presale:\n\nBuy presale: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "For the first time since April\u2019s major Shapella upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s backlog of new validators awaiting activation has nearly emptied.\n\nThe queue\u2019s remarkable shrinkage signals a slowdown in demand to stake Ether after initial pent-up fervour was unleashed.\n\nEthereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model in September\u2019s Merge upgrade. Validators must stake Ether to help secure the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nHowever, strict limits on new validator entries created a long waitlist following the upgrade.\n\nThe queue ballooned to 45 days in June amid excitement over the newly withdrawable staked Ether. But as of Thursday, the expected wait dropped below 5 hours as the blockchain\u2019s staking mania cooled.\n\nValidator numbers have grown exceptionally since the merger, which also enabled staked ether withdrawals for the first time. Removing this lockup risk unleashed a wave of ether inflows.\n\nHowever, staking rewards have since fallen to around 3.5% due to declining network fees. Meanwhile, low-risk US Treasury yields now exceed 5% as the Federal Reserve hikes rates. This makes staking\u2019s yield less appealing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking ratio has risen to 22% from just 6.5% before the merger. But it still lags behind proof-of-stake chains like Solana, Cardano and Avalanche. Their staking ratios range from 53% to 69%.\n\nIndustry analysts say the emptying activation queue implies slowing growth in Ethereum\u2019s staked Ether supply.\n\nThe network\u2019s breakneck pace of new validators has evidently moderated as yields drop and investors evaluate options.\n\nFor now, the blockchain\u2019s once-packed waitlist for securing its future has nearly vanished entirely. The fading mania signals Ethereum\u2019s success at opening access to stakes rather than any loss of long-term enthusiasm."

Bitcoin, XRP , Solana, Litecoin , and Dogecoin were trading in the red, while Ethereum, Cardano, Tron, Toncoin , and Polygon were trading in the green.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.24% to around $1.05 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was down 0.8% at $26,897 as of 12:12 p.m., while Ethereum was just above the $1,550 level.\"Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a consistent four-day decline, indicating a bearish trend in the market. From a technical perspective, it's notable that both crypto's are currently trading below the critical 50 and 200 EMA Daily, with BTC below Rs 23,97,000 ($27,000) and ETH below Rs 1,40,700 ($1,575),\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, ZebPay Trade Desk, said, \"The crypto market is currently facing pressure with Bitcoin and major altcoins experiencing a downturn. This decline is partially attributed to the release of the September Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which revealed a surge in wholesale inflation to 0.5%. This exceeded market expectations, indicating higher inflationary pressures.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $1.88 billion, 7.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $23.5 billion, which is 94.41% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, declined to $524 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.87%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.39% to $12.38 billion.\"Bitcoin is consolidating at $26,800 while altcoins bleed against it. At the same BTC price, Ethereum was trading at $1,800 in July but now it is trading at $1,560. This trend will likely continue through this month. BTC has to reclaim $27,400 in the upcoming days to negate its bearish momentum. Risks of increased oil prices and negative jobs outlook continue to dampen spirits in the crypto ecosystem,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin demonstrated its technical position at $26,780, with a critical point set at $27,000. Notable resistance levels include $27,300, $27,745, and up to $28,280. Conversely, immediate support lies at $26,414, with additional levels at $26,186 and $25,989. Investors and traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price action, particularly at the pivot point, to assess its future trajectory."

Gas is the unit of measure for computational work on the Ethereum network. When users interact with Ethereum through transactions or smart contracts, they need to pay a fee, denominated in gas, to compensate miners for processing these operations.\n\nThe Basics: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?\n\nGas is a unit of measurement for computational work on the Ethereum network. Every transaction or operation executed on Ethereum consumes a certain amount of gas, which is paid for in Ether (ETH). This fee compensates miners for their computational efforts in verifying and processing transactions.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees and NFTs\n\nEthereum gas fees and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are intricately connected within the Ethereum ecosystem. Gas fees are an essential component of the Ethereum blockchain, as they ensure the secure and efficient execution of smart contracts, including those related to NFTs. In this detailed explanation, we\u2019ll explore the relationship between Ethereum gas fees and NFTs, the factors that influence gas costs for NFT transactions, and potential solutions to mitigate the impact of gas fees on NFT operations.\n\nGas Fees and NFTs: How They Are Related\n\n1. Minting NFTs:\n\nMinting an NFT, which means creating a unique digital asset and recording it on the blockchain, involves executing a smart contract. This process consumes gas, as it requires computational work to validate and record the new NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n2. Transferring NFTs:\n\nWhen NFTs change hands, whether through sales, trades, or auctions on NFT marketplaces, these transactions are also smart contract executions and, thus, involve gas fees. The seller incurs the cost when transferring the NFT to the buyer.\n\n3. NFT Marketplaces:\n\nNFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The operations conducted on these platforms, such as listing NFTs for sale, making offers, or accepting bids, all consume gas. Therefore, users engaging in NFT trading on these platforms must pay gas fees associated with their transactions.\n\n4. Gas Costs and Rarity:\n\nThe rarity and uniqueness of an NFT can influence the gas fees associated with it. High-value NFTs, especially those with unique characteristics or from well-known artists, tend to have higher gas fees when minted or transferred. The more complex the smart contract, the higher the gas cost.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Everything To Know About NFT Gas Fee\n\nFactors Impacting Gas Fees for NFTs\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the variability of gas fees for NFTs:\n\nNetwork Congestion:\n\nGas fees tend to rise during periods of high network congestion. When there is a surge in activity on the Ethereum network, such as during the release of a popular NFT collection or a DeFi craze, gas fees can skyrocket, making NFT operations more expensive.\n\nGas Price Setting:\n\nEthereum users can set the gas price they are willing to pay for a transaction. When demand for block space is high, setting a low gas price may result in slower confirmation times or even failed transactions. On the other hand, setting a high gas price can lead to substantial fees.\n\nGas Limit:\n\nEach Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which defines the maximum amount of gas you\u2019re willing to pay. Setting a low gas limit may save costs but could lead to incomplete transactions or even failed minting or transfer attempts for NFTs.\n\nSmart Contract Complexity:\n\nThe more complex the smart contract associated with an NFT, the more gas it consumes. Highly intricate NFTs, such as those with dynamic characteristics or interactive features, can result in higher gas fees.\n\nMitigating the Impact of Gas Fees on NFTs\n\nGiven the influence of gas fees on NFTs, several strategies and solutions are emerging to mitigate their impact:\n\n1. Layer 2 Solutions:\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Optimism are gaining traction in the NFT space. They provide faster and cheaper transactions by offloading some of the computational work from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n2. Gas Optimization:\n\nSmart contract developers are increasingly focused on optimizing their code to reduce gas consumption. This benefits not only NFT creators but the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n3. Gas Price Monitoring:\n\nTools and services exist to monitor gas prices in real-time. Users can wait for periods of lower network activity to perform NFT operations when gas fees are more affordable.\n\n4. Cross-Chain NFTs:\n\nSome projects are exploring cross-chain NFTs that operate on multiple blockchain networks, potentially reducing gas fees and providing more flexibility for users.\n\nEthereum gas fees are intimately linked to the NFT ecosystem. The creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs all involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the costs can vary significantly based on network congestion, gas price settings, and smart contract complexity. While high gas fees can be a challenge for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions, such as Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization, offer hope for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the relationship between gas fees and NFTs will remain a key consideration for users and developers within this vibrant and dynamic space.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees and DeFi\n\nEthereum gas fees and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) are closely intertwined within the Ethereum ecosystem. Gas fees are a fundamental aspect of Ethereum, while DeFi represents a groundbreaking financial ecosystem built on the Ethereum blockchain. In this detailed explanation, we\u2019ll explore the relationship between Ethereum gas fees and DeFi, the impact of gas fees on DeFi users, and potential solutions to address the challenges posed by high gas fees in DeFi.\n\nThe benefit of the low liquidity right now in the #Crypto markets is the fact we have incredibly cheap #Ethereum gas fees That will change once we get liquidity back in the markets, so enjoy it while it lasts \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) October 12, 2023"

        "content": "Fri 13 Oct 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\n\u25aa Blockchain\n\nEthereum Fails to Attract Validators: Recent statistics have shown that Ethereum is no longer a strong magnet for validators, which has surprised many crypto observers.\n\nIs Ethereum Becoming Less and Less Attractive?\n\nLast June, the developers of Ethereum came up with a brilliant idea to revolutionize the blockchain. In their view, capping the MAX_EFFECIVE_BALANCE at 2,048 ETH, at that time set at 32 ETH, would enable instant composition of rewards and reduce the number of validators.\n\n\uf4e2 Ethereum's validator queue is finally clearing out! \uf680 As the demand for staking declines, this opens up exciting opportunities for new validators to join the network. \uf4aa Don't miss your chance to be part of the #Ethereum revolution! \uf525 #CryptoNews #BlockchainTechnology #NFTs\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZwCQnJJ4qs \u2014 \u26a1 Mr. Crypto Giants\ud83d\udc0b (@CryptoGiants_) October 12, 2023 Declining interest from Ethereum validators?\n\nWhile crypto influencer Mr. Crypto Giants thinks so, Coinjournal sees a rather paradoxical situation compared to the track record of this popular blockchain. Yesterday, the Ethereum queue comprised just 377 validators, the crypto media outlet points out.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, however, the list peaked at 96,000 validators.\n\nWhat can we make of this significant drop? It\u2019s akin to a reduction in demand for Ethereum staking. At one time, candidate validators on the same network complained about the slow approval of their applications: 45 days waiting time. In addition, they were confronted with ETH staking application rejections.\n\nNevertheless, Validator Queue data revealed a major improvement in waiting times. Instead of the 45 days mentioned above, the duration has dropped drastically by 4 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s high praise for Ethereum\u2019s spectacularly successful Shapella upgrade in mid-April 2023. Shapella, a contraction of Shanghai and Capella, represents the final stage in the blockchain\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work (PoR) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nETH Staking Rewards Decrease\n\nShapella therefore represents a crucial milestone for Ethereum. Some analysts firmly believe that its advent will coincide with an ETH bull run of up to $5,000. Moreover, a few days after the announcement, CoinShares spoke of an increase in institutional investor interest in the Ethereum blockchain thanks to Shanghai-Capella.\n\n\u201cEthereum saw inflows totaling $17 million last week, suggesting that investors are increasingly confident following the implementation of Shapella,\u201d CoinShares had concluded on April 24.\n\nWhich seems entirely logical, given that The Merge, Ethereum\u2019s successful September 2022 upgrade, opened up several exits for ETH investors.\n\nBut this drop in staking demand is worrying some observers. It has led to a reduction in staking rewards. Whereas at the beginning of the year, the figure was 5-6%, it has now fallen to 3.5%.\n\nIn other words, the Ethereum network\u2019s fee-generating activities have also fallen, and its staker numbers have risen.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market saw a sell-off in the last one week, mainly owing to the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $26,800, down over 3 per cent in the last one week. Ethereum was down 5.2 per cent and was trading at $1,549, according to CoinMarketCap. Most of the crypto tokens like Solana, Cardano and Ripple were trading in the red too.\n\n\"Crypto markets were trending downwards last week as the world witnessed a rise in tensions amidst Israel and Palestine, sending global investors into a risk-off mode,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"Overall the global crypto market cap fell just below the $1.1 trillion mark, as all major crypto assets witnessed a sell-off, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum following over the course of the week, trading below the $27,000 and $1,600 levels, respectively.\"\n\n\"Ethereum's performance is at its weakest since March 2023, with its trading value resting above $1,500,\" said Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Mudrex. Ethereum's price fall was steeper as investors reacted to the Ethereum Foundation's bulk sale of the token for operational use.\n\nAccording to the research team of CoinDCX, higher-than-expected US inflation also resulted in a sell-off pressure in the market. US inflation rose 0.4 per cent month-on-month (M-o-M) in September, higher than the expectation of 0.3 per cent.\n\n\"This decline was due to a cautious market mood, influenced by a slightly higher-than-expected inflation report, which led to increased US Treasury rates and a stronger dollar,\" it said.\n\n\"Bitcoin will now need to breach the $26,900 resistance or potentially discover support near $26,500,\" added Patel.\n\nAnother major development, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) under India's presidency, released a joint communique in Marrakech, Morocco. It adopted the roadmap proposed in the Synthesis Paper as a G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets and to collectively mobilise more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support the low and middle-income countries to meet the global challenges.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, the finance ministry said, \"In the spirit of #OneEarthOneFamilyOneFuture and following full consensus by the #G20 members, the fourth #G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors communique was adopted today in #Marrakech, Morocco.\"\n\nIndustry welcomed the development.\n\n\"The adoption of the G20 Roadmap on crypto assets by the FMCBGs represents a progressive stride in fostering international collaboration for the regulation of crypto assets. This comprehensive roadmap can guide and shape global policy, evolve risk-mitigation strategies, and establish adaptable regulations for the dynamic crypto market. It emphasises addressing the distinct challenges encountered by Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, reflecting a forward-looking approach to a rapidly evolving financial landscape,\" said Patel.\n\n\"Ahead of Financial Action Task Force's India mutual evaluation next month, G20's support to global implementation of FATF standards on crypto-assets is welcome,\" added Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEO of CoinSwitch in a post on X (formerly Twitter)."

Get in now to reach potential ROIs of 400-500% or maybe even higher..\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Titan\u2019s Struggle\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH), once the darling of the crypto world, is currently grappling with challenges. With its price plummeting to a seven-month low, the crypto community is rife with speculations and concerns. Investment advisory firm ByteTree has even suggested investors reconsider Ethereum (ETH) weightage in their portfolios, citing its ongoing struggles.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been on a rollercoaster ride, with its recent dip to $1,523 being the lowest since March. Although it has shown signs of recovery, bouncing back to $1,531, it\u2019s still trailing by 1.9% over the last day.\n\nDespite Ethereum (ETH) commendable long-term vision, it\u2019s currently losing its allure as an investment option. Factors such as reduced network revenues from fees, a dwindling number of tokens being burned, and a steady decline in staking yield are exerting bearish pressure on Ethereum (ETH). Given its continued underperformance, it might be wise for investors to recalibrate their exposure to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nRipple (XRP): Rising from the Ashes\n\nRipple (XRP) had its fair share of challenges, especially leading up to 2020. The primary culprit for its decline was negative publicity, largely attributed to the SEC lawsuit. However, the tides have turned post Ripple (XRP) triumphant win against the SEC, not only bolstering its reputation but also elevating the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe technical prowess of Ripple (XRP) is undeniable. Offering cost-effective and swift transactions, it\u2019s gradually being embraced by leading banks and financial institutions.\n\nGiven its recent victory against the SEC and its technological advantages, Ripple (XRP) is poised for a resurgence. The adoption of its technology by major financial players further cements its potential for a bullish future.\n\nSolana (SOL): A Beacon of Speed and Efficiency\n\nSolana (SOL), with its unique architecture, has carved a niche for itself by processing thousands of transactions per second while maintaining minimal costs. Despite facing a decline in its value during the 2022 bear market, Solana (SOL) ecosystem remains one of the most robust in the crypto sector.\n\nThe recent v1.16 upgrade to the Solana (SOL) mainnet has brought about significant enhancements, including improved zero-knowledge proof capabilities. This allows users to transact Solana-based SPL tokens while keeping crucial transaction details, like the amount, confidential. Additionally, the update has optimized RAM usage for Solana (SOL) validators, marking a significant reduction.\n\nWhile not all features of the v1.16 update are active on the Solana (SOL) mainnet, they will be rolled out in phases, prioritizing the more crucial ones. Given these advancements and its already established reputation, Solana (SOL) is poised for growth, making it a promising choice for future investments.\n\nPolkadot (DOT): The Interconnecting Web of Blockchains\n\nOften dubbed as the \u201cinternet of blockchains,\u201d Polkadot (DOT) primary value proposition lies in its ability to connect and secure a network of specialized blockchains. This facilitates interoperability between different blockchains, enabling cross-chain transfer of data or assets.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) native utility token, plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem. It serves multiple core functions, including facilitating network governance, staking for security and operation, and bonding tokens to connect parachains.\n\nGiven its innovative approach to scalability and cross-chain communication, Polkadot (DOT) stands out among its peers. Its unique proposition of connecting various blockchains positions it as a frontrunner in the crypto space, making it a potential powerhouse in the coming years.\n\nSamoyedcoin (SAMO): The Meme Ambassador of Solana\n\nSamoyedcoin (SAMO) brought the meme coin frenzy to the Solana blockchain, aiming to act as its ambassador. Its primary goal is to onboard users and educate them about navigating the blockchain, setting it apart from other meme coins.\n\nApart from its ambassadorial role, Samoyedcoin (SAMO) has ventured into the NFT space with its SAMO NFTs. These NFTs have gained significant traction on the Solana blockchain, amassing over 1,453 SOL ($270,000) in total trading volume since their inception.\n\nWhile Samoyedcoin (SAMO) does rely on the \u2018hype\u2019 for its price movements, its unique positioning on the Solana blockchain and its divergence from the typical \u2018doge-themed\u2019 aesthetic make it an intriguing option. Its educational focus and NFT collection indicate potential growth, making it a coin to watch in the meme coin space.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, resilience and innovation are key. While established players like Ethereum (ETH) face market challenges, emerging platforms like ScapesMania are showing significant promise. ScapesMania, with its innovative mechanisms and transparent tokenomics, is rapidly gaining traction and is poised to make a substantial impact in the crypto sector. Alongside Ripple (XRP), Polkadot (DOT), and Samoyedcoin (SAMO) the crypto landscape is diverse and offers varied opportunities.\n\nFor investors, understanding these market shifts and the potential of platforms like ScapesMania is crucial for making informed decisions.
