        "title": "Ethereum, Arbitrum, and why L2 solutions are such a mess - Fortune",
        "content": "A hot topic in crypto circles these days is how to process more transactions on a blockchain, leading many pundits to say it can\u2019t be done in a decentralized fashion. This opinion is a popular one but also belies a superficial understanding of the problem with Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions in particular\u2014a problem that stems from the financing models driving these solutions.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the debate, Ethereum and Bitcoin have for years struggled with congestion and high fees arising from their failure to keep up with demand on their blockchains. This has in turn created opportunities for projects offering \u201con-top\u201d solutions as a means to handle that extra demand. The result is a plethora of so-called layer-2, or L2, sidechains\u2014Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon among them\u2014that are intended to increase transaction capacity while keeping the chain orderly.\n\nIn the Bitcoin network, these efforts have largely focused around Lightning, a system of secured peer-to-peer channels that allow for quick and cheap transactions. In the case of Ethereum, developers have taken a more baroque approach that typically looks like this: A technical team claims to have a novel solution to scale Ethereum by capturing transactions on their network, and that idea is pitched to venture capitalists. But instead of integrating this software directly into the main protocol, so Ethereum as a network can scale, a new token\u2014an L2 token\u2014is issued to transact using this new software.\n\nDoes this have to happen? Well, no. Strictly speaking, there is nothing stopping Ethereum leadership from incorporating scaling solutions at the protocol level to lower its costs and make the network more efficient. But instead of working to make the scaling happen directly, the Ethereum crowd has instead relied on the L2 route. (It\u2019s worth noting that Tezos, the blockchain I cofounded, recently deployed an L2 solution without introducing a token.)\n\nWhile L2 solutions on Ethereum have succeeded in offering faster and cheaper transactions, their insistence on adding their own proprietary tokens add friction. To make matters worse, the L2 projects often rush to market with underdeveloped solutions, creating a reliance upon Ethereum contracts under their control and centralized oversight to address security issues later. While this tokenized approach funds development and generates hype, it quickly leads to disillusionment as inflated token market capitalizations fail to meet expectations.\n\nSo why does Ethereum continue to embrace these half-baked L2 solutions? Look no further than Sand Hill Road.\n\nTraditionally, venture capitalists offer financing for new businesses\u2014the word \u201cventure\u201d connoting newer, riskier investments, unlike those perhaps preferred by other private equity firms. VCs typically look to exit their positions through IPOs or acquisitions, often on five- or seven-year time horizons.\n\nIf VCs had a chance speed up their exits\u2014the big moment everyone gets paid\u2014to an order of months, you can bet they would leap on it. And so enter a new model facilitated by crypto.\n\nIn Crypto VC speak, exit strategies don\u2019t come from the creation of a useful, flourishing business. Since 2018 or so, VCs have acted as providers of bridge capital to teams until a token is created and sold. It\u2019s about short-term storytelling because, ultimately, the value of the token isn\u2019t defensible. Often, it\u2019s a solution in search of a problem or, in the case of scaling, a source of additional friction. The last two months have served as testament to the instability of L2 tokens for a variety of business reasons.\n\n\n\nLast month, Coinbase announced it was launching an L2 solution based on Optimism. This was poetic: Optimism already has an unnecessary token and a staking mechanism for its distribution. Unfortunately, it lacks fraud proofs, or the basic security ingredient that makes a scaling solution more secure than a hope and a prayer. What we have here is a token in search of its own technology.\n\nMore recently, Arbitrum, an L2 on Ethereum that\u2019s raised over $100 million from VCs such as Lightspeed, issued a governance token called ARB to justify its place outside the base Ethereum protocol. As part of its first \u201cgoverning\u201d act, the community was asked to vote on a proposal that would send 750 million of its tokens, worth around $1 billion, to its nonprofit foundation. When rank-and-file community members balked at this plan, the Arbitrum Foundation clarified that these funds were already being allocated\u2014and, indeed, had been spent. It was a lucky day for those folks who gave them money last year in a private transaction, and virtually nobody else who bought into the gold-plated resumes of its founding team and the characterizations of their project.\n\nQuite the arbitrage, indeed.\n\nScaling solutions that create more costs and hoops to jump through for users by issuing pernicious tokens aren\u2019t solutions at all. Ethereum will evolve once it weens off venture capitalists and embraces a model that seeks to disintermediate, rather than subsidize, the well-heeled financiers of Web2.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "title": "Ether is rallying ahead of major upgrade that will let holders more easily access their tokens - CNBC",
        "content": "Ethereum underwent a huge network upgrade called the merge which proponents say will make transactions much more energy efficient. Following the merge, ether prices have dropped following a huge run up ahead of the event. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nEther has spiked this week to a nine-month high, ahead of a major network upgrade that some crypto enthusiasts say will make the digital currency a more profitable long-term investment. The world's second-biggest cryptocurrency is up about 6% over the past three days, surpassing $1,900, while bitcoin is roughly flat over that stretch. Beginning next Wednesday, an upgrade to the blockchain, dubbed \"Shapella,\" will allow owners of ether to withdraw their assets. Up to this point, investors would have to use centralized exchanges like Coinbase or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like Lido, to essentially exchange their locked-up ether for a token of equivalent value. The recent rally has followed a similar pattern to past bouts of enthusiasm surrounding network upgrades. In September, ethereum ran up ahead of a historic transition to a more energy-efficient way of securing the network, called proof-of-stake. Ethereum previously had a vast network of miners all over the planet running highly specialized computers that crunched math equations in order to validate transactions. After the so-called \"Merge\" upgrade in September, ethereum migrated to a proof-of-stake system, swapping out miners for validators. Instead of running large banks of computers, validators leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Ether itself becomes a productive asset,\" said Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, regarding the September upgrade. \"It's not something you might just speculate on, but it's something that can earn returns.\" In the post-merge era, ether has taken on some characteristics of a traditional financial asset, paying interest to holders. \"It's probably the lowest-risk return inside of the ethereum ecosystem,\" said Ryan, adding that yield in other corners of DeFi involve smart contracts and other types of counter-party risk. So far this year, ether has underperformed bitcoin , but recent gains have helped to close the gap. Ether is up nearly 59% this year, versus bitcoin's gain of 70% in 2023. Currently, over 18 million ether tokens worth about $32.5 billion are staked, meaning that 15% of ether's total supply are considered locked assets. While the coming upgrade will unlock much of that value, giving holders more control over their assets, there's some concern that the release of so many tokens will have a flooding effect of sorts on the market. Even with capped withdrawals, some $2.4 billion worth of ether could hit the open market, K33 Research said in a note on Tuesday. \"A plunge is likely to happen shortly after the completion of the upgrade, as a huge amount of ETH will be unlocked, and many people will also be selling their ETH,\" said Ilya Volkov, who runs a blockchain-based fintech platform. Volkov said he's bullish over the long term.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe ratio between the open interest of ether put and call options reached its highest level since May on Tuesday, according to data presented by crypto data analytics and news firm The Block. That could signal a buildup of bearish bets leading up to the network upgrade. According to research from Bernstein, of the 18 million ether tokens locked on the blockchain, almost 70% are staked through protocols like Lido, creating a measure of liquidity for investors. \"Liquidity for 70% of staked ETH is not new, they could do it anyways,\" Bernstein wrote. The firm described the remaining 30% of holders as \"original believers,\" who are unlikely exit their positions at this price. Having the ability to deposit and withdraw tokens might encourage more investors to stake ether, and some analysts said they expect a significant influx of capital onto the network once it proves that money that's been staked can be taken out with relative ease.

        "content": "In brief Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork that took place in April 2023.\n\nThe Shanghai fork implemented EIP-4895, which allows validators to withdraw ETH that have been staked since as long ago as December 2020.\n\nAbout 14% of all ETH are currently staked, accounting for 16 million tokens and a current value of over $26 billion.\n\nThe Shanghai fork also has several other EIPs, mostly designed to reduce gas costs for Ethereum developers.\n\nThe fork notably does not include EIP-4844, which facilitates the \u201csharding\u201d of the Ethereum blockchain into multiple chains in order to facilitate scalability.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, also known as the Shapella upgrade, is a hard fork that took place on April 12, 2023. One of the biggest developments associated with the fork is that it enables stakers and validators to withdraw assets from the Beacon Chain\u2014a blockchain launched in 2020 to transition to the \"Merge.\" Shapella is a portmanteau word for \"Shanghai\" and \"Capella,\" two of the proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nBecause staked Ether accounts for about a seventh of the total supply of the token, or roughly 16 million coins, this has massive implications. The current value of all staked Ether is over $26 billion.\n\nEIP-4895\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most important development of the Shapella upgrade\u2014allowing validators to withdraw staked tokens\u2014is in line as Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, or EIP-4895. Validators have staked around 16 million ETH as a way of helping to secure the mechanism. Validators have been especially crucial to the Ethereum blockchain since September 2022, when the Merge began the process of shifting Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. According to the new rules post-Merge, validators that stake 32 ETH in the chain can then participate in validating blocks, and each staked ETH ups the likelihood of a validator receiving block rewards.\n\nThe Merge required that validators lock up their ETH as well as any rewards they earned until a later chain update. Even though the Merge took place in 2022, validators have actually been staking ETH since December 2020. It was at this time that the Beacon Chain, relying on proof-of-stake as a mechanism, was released.\n\nWhat it Means for Validators\n\nThe most notable development of the Shapella hard fork for validators is that they can finally unlock all of their staked ETH. So validators could theoretically get in line to recover their staked tokens and pull them from the system. Some analysts view this outcome as unlikely, however, given Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the DeFi space and the strong staking yield. Further, after the Shapella upgrade validators will be able to withdraw staked assets freely, so they won\u2019t have to worry about locking up a significant sum of money (32 ETH has been valued at as much as $150,000 or so at its peak) for an indeterminate amount of time.\n\nValidators that do wish to unstake ETH after the Shapella fork can do so in a couple of ways. One is to create a \u201cwithdrawal credential\u201d to unstake any rewards accrued in the last several years. The second and more consequential option is to exit the Beacon Chain completely by unstaking all 32 ETH.\n\nOther Improvements\n\nEIP-4895 is the key development for the Shapella fork, but there are several other smaller EIPs included as well. These other proposed improvements aim to reduce gas fees during periods of high activity to benefit Ethereum developers. They include EIP-3651, which proposes lowering gas costs related to Maximal Extractable Value payments when accessing the COINBASE address (COINBASE in this case is not related to the crypto exchange of the same name, but to software which allows developers to receive new tokens), EIP-3855, which aims to lower gas costs generally for developers, EIP-3860, which caps developer gas costs in certain cases, and EIP-6049, which addresses a similar concern.\n\nShapella remains a relatively small upgrade, particularly compared to the Merge. But it will have the potential for significant impact for those with staked ETH on the chain. And other upgrades to the Ethereum protocol are likely to come later in 2023, including some aiming to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine and another hoping to split the Ethereum blockchain into several different \u201cshards\u201d in order to enhance scalability. This last proposed improvement, known as EIP-4844, had at one point been considered for inclusion in the Shapella upgrade, though it was later pushed back.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has given another major breakout just a week before the Shanghai upgrade. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading up by 5.68% at a price of $1,911 and a market cap of $230 billion.\n\nOn the weekly chart, ETH has outperformed the rest of the altcoins as well as Bitcoin with 7.3% gains. It is for the first time since August 2022 that the ETH price has surged past the $1,870 level.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment explains that this 8-month high comes due to the steady accumulation of ETH sharks over the past few months. It reported:\n\n\u201cEthereum jumped back over $1,870 today for the first time since August 17, 2022. This near 8-month high comes as sharks have been accumulating steadily since last summer. Addresses holding 100-10k $ETH have accumulated $4.24B in the past 9 months\u201d.\n\nWith today\u2019s price surge above $1,900, Ethereum (ETH) extends its 2023 gains to more than 60% closing the gap with Bitcoin. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted:\n\nOn-chain data reveals that the next critical resistance area is between $2,100 and $2,150, where over 200K addresses had previously purchased over 18M $ETH.\n\nEthereum Liquidity on the Downtrend\n\nAlthough the crypto market has registered a strong recovery this year in 2023, liquidity remains one of the major concerns for the top two digital assets \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain analytics firm Kaiko reported that ever since the FTX exchange collapse, the Ethereum market depth has been on a downtrend. The report notes:\n\nWhen charting the quantity of bids and asks within 2% of the mid price on USD/USDT order books, we can observe an unsurprisingly similar downwards trend. In mid-March, ETH market depth hits its lowest level since last May.\n\nWhen compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s drop in market depth is less extreme. While BTC\u2019s drop in market depth is at 50%, ETH\u2019s is at 41%. Kaiko adds: \u201cOverall, both assets have suffered in the aftermath of the FTX collapse and banking crisis, with fewer market makers supplying liquidity to order books\u201d."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) rose by around 5% during the past week against Bitcoin (BTC) as the community awaits the highly anticipated Shappella upgrade.\n\nDuring the last 24 hours, ETH increased 2.11% against BTC, rising to as high as 0.067965 on Binance before retracing to 0.067965 at the time of writing.\n\nThe improved performance has seen ETH\u2019s dominance rise to 19.84% for the first time since March 12, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nETH\u2019s USD value rises to an 8-month high\n\nWhen ETH\u2019s value is denominated in U.S. Dollars, it rose above $1900 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nHowever, the asset has retraced to $1894 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nThe price movement continues its positive performance for 2023. ETH spiked 7.1% in the last seven days and has risen 22% over the past month. On the year-to-date metric, ETH is up roughly 60%.\n\nMarket sentiments surrounding the Shappella upgrade\n\nWith the Shappella upgrade confirmed for April 12, market sentiment surrounding ETH has turned largely positive, while some analysts believe that the move would increase the selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Shappella upgrade would allow Ethereum stakers to withdraw their staked tokens from the blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain analytical firm Nansen reported that the selling pressure on ETH from unstaking could be between $1.9 billion \u2013 $4.6 billion. According to the firm, this could hurt the asset because of the relatively thin liquidity of its spot markets.\n\nHowever, Nansen added that the positive effects of the Shanghai upgrade on ETH would likely counteract the initial selling pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, another blockchain analytical firm Santiment pointed out that ETH\u2019s supply on exchange is currently at its lowest \u2014 10.31%. The firm pointed out that investors are favoring self-custodial services for their assets.\n\nMarket analysts on Twitter have interpreted this to mean that holders strongly believe in ETH\u2019s potential as a store of value. Since ETH completed the merge event in 2022, the asset has turned deflationary, and the volume held by long-term investors has risen.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "ETH is trading above $1,900 for the first time since August 2022.\n\nEther is pumping despite ETH staking withdrawals being enabled next week.\n\nLSD tokens like LDO and RPL have also seen a significant increase in value in the past few days.\n\nThe crypto industry has been in one of the roughest bear markets ever. The majority of alternative tokens have plummeted more than 90% from their highs. Blue chip coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also dropped over 70%.\n\nHowever, the market has been improving lately. For example, ether has just broken $1,900 despite the Shapella upgrade happening next week.\n\nEthereum Breaks $1,900 Ahead of Shapella Upgrade\n\nEthereum\u2019s native currency has enjoyed a steady upside in the past few weeks. On Wednesday, ETH broke $1,900 for the first time since August 2022.\n\nETH is currently trading at $1,915, up 2.8% on the day and 7.6% on the week, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether\u2019s market cap has climbed over $230 billion and currently stands at $230.7 billion.\n\nETH price action. Source: CoinGecko.\n\nEther pumping is exciting to see, given the upcoming Shapella upgrade. Shapella is a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two Ethereum upgrades that are going to enable staked ETH withdrawals on April 12.\n\nSome believe that the enabling of ETH withdrawals will lead to a significant dump in ether\u2019s price. That\u2019s because there are currently 18 million ETH staked worth around $34.5 billion that will become available for withdrawing and, potentially, selling.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH staking withdrawals are bullish for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs), which offer a more convenient way of staking ETH. Many believe that at least some portion of the current locked ETH will be instead staked with LSDs.\n\nLSD Tokens Boom\n\nLSD governance tokens have also significantly increased in value in the past week.\n\nFor example, the most popular LSD protocol Lido\u2019s governance token, LDO, is up 6.5% on the day and 15.2% on the week. It\u2019s currently trading at $2.69 and is the 31st most valuable token.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s RPL is also trading at 6.5% higher than yesterday. One RPL is currently worth $48.26.\n\nThe increase in LSD token value aligns with the belief that the current stakers that have ETH locked will move it to LSDs. That\u2019s because LSDs offer a liquid token in exchange for ETH that can be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe rise in ETH\u2019s price can be a bull trap as weakening economic data points to a potential recession in the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nETH is one of the most desired assets in the crypto market. However, users should always do their own research before deciding where to invest and what asset to choose, especially in these uncertain economic times.\n\nRead more about Shapella\u2019s potential impact on the price of ETH:\n\nETH Staking Withdrawals Confirmed: Ethereum Devs Reveal Date\n\nRead more about a huge NFT sale on Polygon:\n\nPolygon Sees Biggest 24-Hour NFT Sale with y00ts Fetching 75 ETH"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has regained its bullish momentum and is continuing its bull run. The cryptocurrency has managed to break multiple significant resistance levels since rebounding from the $1,000 area in November 2022, signaling a potential upward trend in the market.\n\nEthereum is trading just below the $1900 mark, representing uncharted territory since August 2022. Despite breaking its correlation with Bitcoin, the question remains whether Ethereum can continue its upward trend and reach new yearly highs by surpassing the $2,000 milestone.\n\nWill Ethereum Maintain Its Bullish Trend?\n\nAccording to a recent Twitter post by crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez, on-chain data reveals a potential breakout above the $1,900 level. According to Martinez, the next critical resistance area for Ethereum is between $2,100 and $2,150.\n\nIn addition, over 200,000 addresses had purchased over 18 million ETH at the $2,100-$2,150 level, as seen in the chart above, making it a crucial resistance area for Ethereum\u2019s price action in the mid-term.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum can maintain its momentum and surpass this resistance level to establish it as support. In that case, the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to reach new yearly highs and potentially consolidate above the $2,000 mark, further solidifying its upward trend.\n\n2019 Fractal Mirrors Bullish Pattern For ETH\n\nAnother interesting trend has emerged in Ethereum\u2019s price action, dating back to its diagonal breakout in 2019. Crypto Analyst under the pseudonym \u201cWoetoe\u201d has identified a blue fractal in ETH\u2019s charts that could offer valuable insights into the cryptocurrency\u2019s future price movements.\n\nAccording to Woetoe\u2019s fractal, Ethereum could potentially experience a significant uptrend shortly. This prediction is bolstered by the upcoming Shappella upgrade, represented by the vertical red line, which could further drive Ethereum\u2019s price upwards.\n\nIn addition to its recent surge, Ethereum has also seen a high rate of liquidations, with approximately $30 million worth occurring within just 24 hours at the $1,880 level, as Glassnode data shows.\n\nIt is now crucial for ETH to maintain its current level as a support and potentially consolidate above the $1,900 mark. However, if Ethereum fails to consolidate at this level, it is likely that a healthy pullback will occur, potentially pushing its price action toward the $1,830 mark.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,867, reflecting a gain of more than 2% over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has posted significant gains in wider time frames, with 8.5% and 7% profits in the seven-day and fourteen-day periods, respectively.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "3 key Ethereum price metrics cast doubt on the strength of ETH's recent rally - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) price had been battling the $1,850 resistance level, but it broke through on April 4 when Ether rallied to a seven-month high above $1,900. Recently there has been a lot of speculation on Ether price catalysts. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s possible to identify any fundamental factors behind the price movement.\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai hard fork could be one factor in Ether\u2019s recent bullish momentum. On April 12, the ability for validators to withdraw their deposits opens, giving staking participants freedom of movement but also creating a sell-off risk for Ether.\n\nThere are now 17.81 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, though some safeguards have been put in place to prevent a flood of Ether from disrupting the market. For example, because there is a daily limit of 2,200 withdrawals, the maximum daily unlocks are 70,000 ETH.\n\nScalability and selfish validator risks are still present\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai fork, however, does not address some of the most pressing issues currently plaguing the Ethereum network. Scalability continues to be a major issue for most users, as the average transaction fee has hovered around $5 in recent weeks, driving users away from decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nFurthermore, the current consensus mechanism favors rogue miners who outperform other network participants, a phenomenon known as miner extractable value (MEV). They can quickly duplicate all winning deals from the mempool and execute their transactions ahead of others by ultimately deciding which transactions are completed in the block.\n\nA recent example, highlighted on April 3 by security firm CertiK, resulted in $25 million in losses to arbitrage bots that were attempting to purchase and flip tokens in a short period of time for a profit as a selfish validator replaced the transactions.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the top 10 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw an 18% drop in active addresses, possibly reflecting investor dissatisfaction with the ongoing issues with miners front-running and high transaction costs.\n\n30-day Dapp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,850 level can effectively become a support according to ETH investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH derivatives show no improvement despite the price rally\n\nThe annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (backwardation) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nDespite ETH\u2019s 35% rally in 25 days, the Ether futures premium has been unable to break above the 5% neutral threshold. However, the absence of leverage longs demand does not always imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. For instance, in bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nRelated: Ethereum projects unite to protect users from MEV-induced high prices\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nSince April 1, the delta skew has been close to zero, indicating a similar demand for protective put options and neutral-to-bearish call instruments. Since March 22, when Ether options last showed extreme optimism, this has been the norm.\n\nEven after adjusting for the additional negative pressure from the Shanghai hard fork token unlock, Ether faces serious problems due to scalability and transaction front-runs. As a result, derivatives and on-chain DApp metrics increase the likelihood of ETH falling below $1,850.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular and widely-used blockchain protocols. While its native coin ether (ETH) can be used to make payments like cryptocurrencies such as litecoin (LTC) or bitcoin cash (BCH), Ethereum was designed to be a far more flexible and feature-rich blockchain protocol. Ethereum allows for the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It also allows for tokens to be built on top of its core protocol.\n\nOne of the most innovative ERC standards to date is the ERC-4337 standard. Like earlier token standard releases, it was designed to enable additional features and options that weren\u2019t possible using the previously available token options.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s tokens are one reason it has garnered such a sizeable share of the crypto market. These Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) tokens create concrete rules and frameworks that allow ERC tokens to be sent and received on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the most popular token standards is ERC-20, which allows you to issue new fungible tokens on the Ethereum protocol. Another popular option is the ERC-721 token standard, which allows for the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This is one reason why many of the most popular NFT collections and fungible tokens are found on Ethereum.\n\nThere are a number of ERC token standards (ERC-777, ERC-2222, and more) on Ethereum, with new suggestions called Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) continually being proposed and discussed. Some EIPs are ultimately rejected, while others end up being released on Ethereum. Once an EIP is improved and implemented, it becomes an ERC (ERC-4337 was previously EIP-4337).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFunded through Ethereum Foundation grants, the launch of ERC-4337 was announced at WalletCon 2023. Let\u2019s discover what ERC-4337 enables on the Ethereum protocol \u2014 and why the community decided it needed to be approved.\n\nERC-4337 Brings New Features to Ethereum\n\nERC-4337 makes enhanced crypto transaction options possible. To differentiate it from standard crypto transactions, these ERC-4337 transactions are referred to as UserOperations. This sort of blockchain enhancement would typically be done through a blockchain update and not through a new ERC standard release (more on that later).\n\n\n\nA core new feature is that it allows for account abstraction on Ethereum in a decentralized manner (more on that below). Additionally, it allows for dApp developers to partially or fully subsidize transaction fees for users; on many dApps the user must pay these fees. ERC-4337 also allows users to pay fees with ERC-20 tokens (as opposed to ETH). This should create a decentralized fee market for smart contract operations. On top of that, it enables some privacy-preserving features and supports the use of aggregated signatures. ERC-4337 is also available on networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) such as Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and several others.\n\nFor sending transactions, ERC-4337 enables you to bundle (combine) multiple transactions to save time and lower transaction fee costs. You will also be able to pre-approve transactions in an automated way. Most current wallets require you to manually approve every transaction. Now, you can create review processes that require additional manual approval only for certain transactions \u2014 such as transactions that send over a specified amount of crypto (more than $1,000 USD equivalent, for example).\n\nERC-4337\u2019s User-Friendly Wallet Features\n\nThrough a process known as account abstraction, ERC-4337 allows for the use of smart accounts that are expected to be more user friendly for beginners. This update is expected to catalyze crypto adoption as technical barriers to entry are continually being lowered \u2014 or removed. While somewhat technical, in essence, account abstraction turns a user\u2019s crypto wallet into a smart contract-enabled account. For this reason, many don\u2019t call ERC-4337 a \u201ctoken standard\u201d and simply call it an ERC standard; it doesn't really fit categorically with the previous ERC token standards.\n\nOne core benefit is how account abstraction simplifies both the use and creation of wallets. Prior to ERC-4337, users generally had to memorize a seed phrase (or store this phrase offline) to create a backup of their crypto wallet. Through abstraction, a crypto wallet\u2019s private keys can be stored on a smartphone\u2019s standard security module. This would create what some would consider a hardware wallet within their phone \u2014 although some express concerns about a smartphone\u2019s vulnerabilities through the touchscreen or some other avenue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nERC-4337 allows for the use of smart accounts that are expected to be more user friendly for beginners.\n\nERC-4337 allows you to sign transactions biometrically through a fingerprint or face scan as an additional safety measure. Should you lose your phone, you could regain access to your account through the use of time-locked social recovery. This requires multiple users to sign a recovery transaction through a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet. You could give a group of trusted friends or family the ability to regenerate your account. If that doesn\u2019t suit you, you could pay a commercial third-party service to recover your account should the need arise.\n\nLosing their wallet and the associated crypto \u2014 and being unable to recover it \u2014 is one fear people have when it comes to using non-custodial crypto wallets. There are horror stories of people losing large sums of crypto in this way. This safeguard is designed to give you some of the features and peace of mind you may have when using a bank \u2014 without having to trust a bank \u2014 thus preserving the core crypto ethos of trustlessness and permissionlessness.\n\n\n\nIn general, the implementation of account abstraction is intended to provide two benefits for wallets:\n\nMake crypto wallets more user friendly. Prevent the loss of crypto or crypto wallet access.\n\nWhy Not Update the Underlying Ethereum Protocol?\n\nFor many blockchain protocols, changes require a code update to the blockchain that is called a fork. Oftentimes, there is heated debate about whether to implement changes to a blockchain. These updates sometimes lead to a blockchain splitting into two separate networks. Called a hard fork, this has led to the 2017 Bitcoin fork that created Bitcoin Cash and even a previous splitting of Ethereum (which created Ethereum Classic). The other fork option is a soft fork. Soft forks are backwards compatible \u2014 giving users and validators the option to implement an update or not.\n\nWith the time and work that has gone into transitioning Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network (known as The Merge), the proposal for ERC-4337 noted that it may be some time before Ethereum goes through another significant update. For that reason, ERC-4337 was implemented as a way to enable updates that don\u2019t change the core Ethereum protocol. Taking this innovative approach has ostensibly saved a lot of time and effort. In addition, ERC-4337 will not create compatibility issues in the way some blockchain forks have.\n\nBy taking these changes to a higher-abstraction layer (the ERC-4337 standard itself), it negates the need to implement changes to the core Ethereum protocol (the Ethereum blockchain). While this has sped up the implementation of account abstraction on Ethereum, the goal is to eventually implement this feature into the primary Ethereum protocol.\n\nWhat ERC-4337 Means for Ethereum Adoption\n\nWith its notable medley of ERC-20 tokens, the popularity of ERC-721 NFTs, and the outsized presence of Ethereum within decentralized finance (DeFi), ERC-4337 will likely help Ethereum remain one of the premier blockchains as the enhanced functionality will benefit all of these disparate \u2014 but connected \u2014 niches within the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith crypto wallet security and user friendliness at the forefront of the ERC-4337 update, we may end up seeing newcomers to the crypto space choose to start with Ethereum (and EVM-compatible blockchains) as opposed to other blockchain ecosystems. Enticed by the core benefits and ease of use enabled by ERC-4337, this may allow Ethereum to keep \u2014 or grow \u2014 the already sizable market share that it occupies within the wider crypto market. For other blockchains to remain competitive and gain market share, they may need to incorporate their own versions of higher-level account abstraction. This will let them appeal to new crypto users that want to experience Web3 with the ease of use and simplicity more commonly found in the Web2 experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCheat Sheet:\n\nERC-4337 allows you to bundle and automate transactions on Ethereum.\n\nERC-4337 allows for social recovery of crypto wallets, biometric authentication of transactions, and the ability to store a wallet\u2019s private keys on a smartphone security module.\n\nThe features made possible by the ERC-4337 standard are also available on EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard adds new features to Ethereum without the need for a major Ethereum blockchain protocol update.\n\nThe goal is to eventually provide the features made possible through ERC-4337 through a major Ethereum protocol update."

        "content": "A new decentralized layer has been added on top of Ethereum to make smart accounts possible with the introduction of ERC-4337 and account abstraction \u2014 but infrastructure providers suggest it may be tricky to participate profitably right now.\n\nERC-4337, commonly called \u201csmart accounts\u201d or \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d was deployed on the Ethereum mainnet on March 1. \u201cSmart accounts\u201d are essentially a supercharged version of an Ethereum wallet. Although smart contract wallets already exist, they rely on centralized components. ERC-4337 changes that with a distributed network of \u201cBundlers\u201d and \u201cPaymasters.\u201d\n\nUnder the hood, there are a few subtle but significant changes \u2014 namely the addition of the \u201cUser Intent Layer,\u201d explained Matt Cutler, the co-founder and CEO of Blocknative, a core Ethereum infrastructure provider.\n\nAccording to Cutler, an Ethereum transaction today involves several discrete steps.\n\nA model explaining the current Ethereum transaction flow. Source: Blocknative\n\nA user accesses their standard externally-owned account (EOA) or private key to compose a signed transaction \u2014 for example, transferring a nonfungible token (NFT) to another user.\n\nThis transaction is then sent to the public mempool \u2014 which could be described as a shared queue for transactions \u2014 to be plucked out by a \u201cBuilder\u201d who organizes it into a \u201cprofitable block.\u201d From there, the block is proposed to a Validator, who ultimately proposes and publishes it on-chain, completing the transaction.\n\nUnder ERC-4337, the new \u201cUser Intent Layer\u201d is introduced before the current EOA step.\n\nA mental model explaining the new Ethereum transaction flow with ERC-4337. Source: Blocknative\n\nThis additional layer allows a user to initiate more complex transactions in a single step. To make this possible, ERC-4337 introduces an \u201cAlternative Mempool\u201d and a network of transaction Bundlers, and along with it \u2014 a new way to earn fees.\n\nBecoming a Bundler\n\nA Bundler is a node that does a very similar job to the block \u201cBuilder.\u201d Instead of organizing signed transactions from the public mempool to assemble a profitable block, a Bundler grabs User Operations, or userOps, from the Alt-Mempool to create the most profitable bundle which is signed and submitted to the network as a single transaction. This is all part of the newly added layer that makes smart accounts possible.\n\nBundlers get compensated via userOp gas fees for providing their much-needed service.\n\nWill Account abstraction bring a billion people to crypto?\n\n\n\nNO. Solving a problem that billions of people have will bring a billion people to crypto.\n\n\n\nAccount abstraction enables the distribution of the solution. \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) March 24, 2023\n\nWhile anyone can be a Bundler in theory, in reality, being a successful one might be another story, Cutler warned.\n\nLike Builders, Bundlers are \u201cspecialized actors\u201d made up of \u201crelatively sophisticated development teams operating substantial computational, storage, and networking infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 is trustless and permissionless. So if you\u2019re technically adept, by all means, you can stand up and operate your own Bundler. The challenge is Bundling is a competitive market. So you will be competing against relatively sophisticated teams that are investing heavily into being a competitive Bundler,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBundlers are not the sort of tooling that you just stand up, forget about and it starts printing you money. We expect Bundling to be substantially more technically sophisticated than being a validator, for instance.\u201d\n\nCutler noted there are already a number of open-source bundler code repositories.\n\nRelated: Ethereum ERC-4337 'smart accounts' launch at WalletCon: Account abstraction is here\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about whether ERC-4337 will have an impact on Ethereum gas fees, particularly given the increase in transaction complexity associated with the introduction of the new User Intent layer.\n\nERC-4337 and AA are all over the news, but with that comes a lot of misinformation. Here are some common misconceptions (and valid concerns): https://t.co/MkVoOvR44y \u2014 ZeroDev (@zerodev_app) March 9, 2023\n\n\u201cWhile it is still too early to tell, my current expectation is that, on average, gas fees will not change all that much. If ERC-4337 has an impact, it\u2019s going to be pretty slight \u2014 either up or down. We do not expect transaction fees to suddenly go to zero or suddenly become 100x more expensive,\u201d said Cutler.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "A Guide to Base, Coinbase's Ethereum L2 - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum network speeds can be slow, and the cost of using it can be prohibitively expensive, especially for small transactions.\n\nIn 2023, Coinbase stepped in to help solve the problem. Its approach: to build a layer-2 (L2) network atop Ethereum.\n\nThis explainer will quickly get you up to speed on L2s and other projects working to scale Ethereum, and then dive into what Base says it can bring to the table.\n\nWhat Are Layer-2s Again?\n\nLayer-2 networks are blockchains that run atop other (layer-1) blockchains, such as Ethereum. Since Ethereum is near its upward limit of roughly 1 million transactions per day, any additional demand on the network results in higher prices for users (i.e., you pay more to get your transaction through) and/or slower speeds (e.g., you wait until congestion ebbs). So, while Ethereum is decentralized and secure, it lacks a third property of a Platonic blockchain: It\u2019s not scalable.\n\nL2s help solve this by moving bunches of transactions to another blockchain, processing them there, and then sending compressed data back to the L1. Popular L2s include Optimism, Arbitrum, and Loopring. [For an overview, check out our quick history of Ethereum scaling.]\n\nWhat Is Base?\n\nBase is a layer-2 blockchain that\u2019s, er, based on Optimism\u2019s open-source stack of software. Coinbase is working on the network with the OP Labs team that created Optimism. That\u2019s right, instead of taking aim at a competitor, the centralized exchange is collaborating with it\u2014for now, at least.\n\nWhile Optimism took steps in 2022 to decentralize control of the protocol, Base will be built by Coinbase in-house. Unlike Optimism, Coinbase says it doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently\u201d plan to issue its own token. It does say, however, that it will \u201cprogressively decentralize the chain.\u201d\n\nBase has the, ahem, basic setup of many other L2s:\n\nIt\u2019s designed to get its security from Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s EVM-compatible, meaning its smart contracts are recognized by computers running the Ethereum software.\n\nTransaction costs on the network are generally much lower than on Ethereum alone.\n\nThough Base says it\u2019s \u201crollup agnostic,\u201d by building off of Optimism\u2019s stack, it\u2019s sticking its flag in the ground for a particular type of rollup. There\u2019s an ongoing battle in L2 land between zk-rollups and optimistic rollups. Protocols using the latter type assume that transactions are valid, but they contain a mechanism for users to prove fraud. The former employs zero-knowledge (zk) proofs to demonstrate that a legitimate transaction took place\u2014without showing their work. [See our guide to zkEVMs for more.]\n\nThere\u2019s some disagreement between the groups as to whether zk-rollups are ready for prime time; many optimistic rollup devs assert that the technology isn\u2019t as mature as optimistic rollups.\n\nBase joins Optimism, Arbitrum, Boba, and others in the optimistic rollup camp.\n\nWhy Another L2?\n\nIt\u2019s clear from Coinbase\u2019s February 2023 introductory announcement that the exchange sees the L2 as a home base for decentralized applications. In other words, L2s can make individual users\u2019 transactions faster and more affordable, but the big money is in getting DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications to integrate.\n\nTo that point, Base is promising developers \u201caccess to Coinbase\u2019s products, users, and tools.\u201d\n\nThe Future of Base\n\nBase\u2019s testnet went live in February 2023. The next step is a mainnet launch that would open the platform up to everyone."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCrypto analyst Miles Deutscher points to an important indication on the Ethereum vs. Bitcoin daily chart. Deutscher points to the fact that Ethereum is currently attempting a breakout and a successful support/resistance (S/R) flip on its Bitcoin daily chart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n$ETH is currently attempting a break out + a successful $ETH/BTC S/R flip on the daily.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re seeing the makings of a capital rotation into ETH ahead of the Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade.\n\n\n\nSustained strength would bode well for alt performance. Let\u2019s see if it holds. pic.twitter.com/pXmIHylbOF \u2014 Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) April 4, 2023\n\nEthereum's price turned oversold against Bitcoin after reaching near eight-month lows of $0.062 on March 21. This was followed by a relatively short period of range trading before a rise started on April 3.\n\nAccording to Deutscher, the newfound strength Ethereum is seeing on its Bitcoin BTC chart might reflect the makings of capital rotation ahead of the Shanghai update.\n\nStaked ETH withdrawals will be made possible by the Shanghai upgrade, also known as \"Shapella,\" which completes Ethereum's entire transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. The long-awaited Shanghai hard fork has an April 12 target date, according to Ethereum developers.\n\nThe fact that the last time Ethereum traded at such oversold levels to Bitcoin, it produced fresh highs on the ETH/BTC chart raises the possibility of a sustained rebound in the coming weeks.\n\nSustained strength might bode well for altcoins\n\nDeutscher notes that the sustained strength of Ethereum against Bitcoin would bode well for the altcoins' performance. Oftentimes, the altcoin market tends to benefit from Ethereum's show of strength against Bitcoin, with this often an indicator of altcoins' performance.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum faces a barrier that coincides with the moving averages on its Bitcoin chart. A successful flip into support might dictate the next move in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, going back to the ETH/USD chart, crypto analyst Ali says Ethereum appears to be breaking out. According to him, on-chain data reveals that the next critical resistance area is between $2,100 and $2,150, where over 200K addresses had previously purchased over 18 million ETH."

        "title": "Experts Expect Ethereum (ETH) To Break $2,000 Shortly, Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a strong upswing, outperforming Bitcoin, which has been able to extend its dominance on the crypto market in recent weeks. Even Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing sideways phase does not seem to worry Ethereum investors, who managed a breakout above $1,900 today.\n\nThe psychologically important price target of $2,000 is thus within reach. Eight days before the highly anticipated Shapella update on April 12, the Ethereum chart looks extremely bullish.\n\nMoreover, the trading month of April is statistically one of the most bullish months of the year for the crypto market. Also, ETH is getting tailwinds from the continued weakness of the US Dollar Index (DXY).\n\nAnalysts Predict Ethereum To Break Above $2,000\n\nJonah Van Bourg, head of trading at the crypto asset trading firm Cumberland, published a very bullish analysis on Ethereum via Twitter. As the analyst explains, ETH (unlike Bitcoin) has just broken out of its trading range, which has been in place since mid-March.\n\nAnd the fact that this is happening against the backdrop of a generally bearish regulatory climate makes it even more special. Moreover, various metrics confirm the strong bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cDoge-themed redesign of Twitter notwithstanding, ETH gas spiked to 68 gwei yesterday \u2013 the highest we\u2019ve seen since the Luna crisis of 2Q22 and its associated flurry of DeFi activity,\u201d Van Bourg declared, pointing to the Shapella update as an actually bearish event.\n\nAfter more than two years, numerous holders will be able to access their staked ETH for the first time, theoretically making large amounts of out-of-the-money ETH units liquid and available for sale. \u201cThat said, the exit queue is empty,\u201d Van Bourg noted.\n\nAlso bullish is that leverage in the futures market is at a minimum and robust price action suggests that positioning is low and excess longs have already been flushed.\n\nAccording to the Cumberland analyst, Ethereum\u2019s strength could also be an early indicator for an altcoin rally if the recent past repeats itself. Most recently, it has been seen time and time again how the initial BTC strength spilled over to ETH and then to altcoins.\n\nThus, all eyes are on ETH at the moment \u2013 a solid retracement would represent an important leading indicator and potentially herald a lucrative trading environment.\n\nCup & Handle Pattern Signals Buying Opportunity\n\nAksel Kibar, a chartered market technician (CMT) has tweeted that ETH/USD could be two days ahead of the BTC/USD trading pair, according to the bullish flag chart pattern breakout that ETH has is forming, while Bitcoin is trailing.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum has also formed a Cup & Handle pattern over four months on the 1-day chart, as Kibar notes. As the name suggests, the chart pattern resembles a cup with a handle, with the cup shaped like a \u201cU\u201d and the handle drifting slightly downward.\n\nThe pattern is considered a bullish signal that extends an uptrend and is usually seen as a buying opportunity.\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $1,912, up 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The mid-\u201890s playground sensation is back in action: POGs are making a comeback, this time pairing the physical milk caps and slammers with NFT discs and an online game.\n\nPOGs first entered Web3 about a year ago, first launching on the Solana blockchain with a handful of collections, including digital collectibles featuring Solana\u2019s Okay Bears project.\n\nBut this week, POGs will make the jump over to Ethereum with a new NFT mint that corresponds with the debut of an online version of the classic POG-slamming game experience.\n\n\u201cNow that we're going to Ethereum, it does feel like we're kind of stepping up to the major leagues,\u201d POGs NFT founder Kyler Frisbee told Decrypt, citing increased trading volume and liquidity compared to the Solana NFT space.\n\nPOGs NFT, a subsidiary of The World POG Federation, has tapped Origin Protocol\u2019s Origin Story NFT platform to develop a custom marketplace for the drop. On April 6, the company will launch 3,800 Ethereum NFTs spanning a mix of POGs and slammers with unique artwork for each, at a price of 0.049 ETH (about $90 as of this writing).\n\nThe NFTs can be used within a slate of upcoming Ethereum-based video games, which are set to launch this summer. The first play-to-earn POG game, called Stack and Slam, will first debut on Solana this week. Frisbee said that it mimics the classic slammer-tossing playground experience, relying on a combination of timing, skill, and luck for players to succeed.\n\nSome of the NFTs will feature artwork from popular NFT projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Moonbirds. Bored Ape holders can use or license out their owned artwork for commercial products, while the open-source Moonbirds artwork is free for anyone to commercialize. Other POGs NFTs are based on projects like Neo Tokyo and Viva La Vandal.\n\nBeyond this week\u2019s mint, Frisbee and team plan to release physical packs of Web3 project-themed POGs in May via a token-gated platform, letting owners of POG NFTs access the marketplace to purchase limited edition POGs based on the NFTs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Doodles Plans to Scale From Genesis Box to Millions of NFT Avatars\n\nFrom there, Frisbee has a number of ideas on how to further embrace Web3 with POGs. He envisions a potential play-for-keeps physical game that uses NFC chips within the POGs themselves, and then automatically transfers the tokenized ownership from the loser\u2019s wallet into the winner\u2019s.\n\nThe goal with POGs NFTs, he said, is to deliver digital collectibles that feed into video games, but also pair with the physical POGs experience.\n\nHe teased plans to bring physical POGs back in a big way, with the NFT expansion and celebrity partners intended to \u201cbring the right buzz for when the official distribution of those POGs comes back globally.\u201d"

        "content": "April 12 cliff-edge for entrepreneur fighting for return of $22 million in crypto assets, currently subject to a freezing order by the BVI court\n\nArman Oyekenov alleges the funds were stolen by Julian Svirsky and Denis Donin, his former partners in the crypto real estate fund Tensigma. The funds are frozen pending resolution of the dispute\n\nOyekenov warns the approaching \"Shanghai upgrade\" \u2013 a technical upgrade that increases users\u2019 direct control over their staked ether funds \u2013 will empower the pair to abscond with more than $10 million of the disputed funds\n\nTensigma assets worth over $6m have allegedly already been stolen and hidden. Judge previously noted \"real risk\" of Svirksy and Donin dissipating their assets in order to \"frustrate any judgment\" against them\n\nSvirsky worked previously for Renaissance Capital, BNP Paribas and Sberbank\n\nNEW YORK, April 04, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A renowned Kazakh entrepreneur says he is fighting against time for the return of crypto assets worth millions of dollars, after they were allegedly misappropriated by his former business partners.\n\nArman Oyekenov claims that imminent changes in the way certain funds in the Ethereum network are housed will give Julian Svirsky, an American-Russian banker who formerly worked at Renaissance Capital, the opportunity to flee with millions of dollars in stolen money, despite an international court order freezing the disputed funds.\n\nThe case is being closely watched by legal experts and raises important questions about the ability of regulators, the courts and the criminal authorities to combat fraud and money-laundering on crypto networks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other agencies are being alerted about the case.\n\nOyekenov, a one-third owner of Tensigma, established the crypto real estate business with Svirsky and Denis Donin before suing the pair for alleged fraud. In May 2021, the British Virgin Islands High Court (Commercial Division) granted a worldwide freezing order prohibiting Svirsky and Donin from dealing with the assets of Tensigma Limited up to the value of $23 million. The freezing order was continued in December 2021 and remains in force today.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn apparent breach of the freezing injunction, more than $6.2 million of cryptocurrency has since been stolen and funnelled through cryptocurrency \"mixers\", rendering efforts to trace the Bitcoin and Ethereum almost impossible.\n\nTensigma\u2019s only remaining cryptocurrency asset, worth about $10 million, is Ethereum staked on the Beacon Deposit Contract. The so-called Shanghai Upgrade to the Ethereum platform, scheduled for April 12, allows holders to \"unstake\" their assets for the first time. Parties will be watching closely what happens to the staked Ethereum at that point.\n\nCANDEY LLC in New York has been instructed to refer Julian Svirsky and Denis Donin to the US criminal authorities for extradition to the United States on charges of wire fraud and theft.\n\nBackground \u2013 ICO to shareholder dispute\n\nThe funds at the centre of this dispute were raised through an initial coin offering in late 2017 in connection with the Atlant.io platform and two ventures known as uvas.com and karta.com.\n\nOyekenov is a one-third owner of Tensigma and claims that the theft and appropriation of cryptocurrency by Svirsky and Donin has resulted in the destruction of his shareholder value. Tensigma is now in liquidation.\n\nIn their Defence, Svirsky and Donin say that Oyekenov obtained his shareholding in Tensigma through coercion and was only an employee. It is also alleged the cryptocurrency no longer belongs to Tensigma having been transferred to a Gibraltar company named Digital Asset Exchange Limited for $559,279 in July 2020. Oyekenov refutes the claim that he was merely an employee and alleges that DAE transaction was a sham transaction, as the true value of the cryptocurrency was millions of dollars.\n\nFreezing Injunction \u2013 \"Mr. Svirsky and Mr Donin are ready to lie\"\n\nIn reaching his decision to grant the worldwide freezing injunction, Mr Justice Gerhard Wallbank commented that:\n\n\"If it is right, as it appears to be, that Mr. Svirsky and Mr Donin are ready to lie about the position of the Claimant within their business, and basically to try and mislead the Court into pretending that the Claimant was a mere employee as opposed to a partner. If that\u2019s right, and on the documents it appears to be right. [\u2026]\n\nThey also have, reading those text messages, what I think can best be called a macho vulgarity in the obscenity of their language that they use between them such that they seem to be rather crude individuals. I don\u2019t think for one moment that they\u2019d lose sleep over putting assets a few steps further, may using nominees to pretend that they don\u2019t have them.\"\n\nAppeals\n\nSvirsky and Donin have appealed various orders in the proceedings including the grant of the freezing injunction itself. The appeals are due to be heard by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal in May 2023.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230404005094/en/\n\nContacts\n\nMedia enquiries:\n\nPalatine Communications: Conal Walsh / Victoria Fell\n\nVictoria.fell@palatine-media.com"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is bullish on XRP and says one Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is about to surge.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 194,400 Twitter followers that he is picking a support level for payments platform Ripple\u2019s utility token XRP using the Fibonacci retracement tool.\n\nThe trader is predicting an XRP retracement to the $0.46 level, the 0.5 Fibonacci level, and then a move to the upside.\n\n\u201cXRP: I\u2019m bidding $0.466 for the standard.\u201d\n\nXRP is trading for $0.50 at time of writing.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is the decentralized borrowing protocol Liquity (LQTY), which he says is forming a bottom and could soon break out.\n\n\u201cLQTY: Still think this is one of the better-looking swing trade charts out there IMO. Looks like accumulation / big compression with all EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) and lots of volume transacted here. Buy and hold for a bit and watch it go up. One downside is it could take a while though.\u201d\n\nLiquity is worth $2.46 at time of writing.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Ethereum, saying a bottom may have formed on the ETH/BTC chart. He says that based on historic patterns after a bottom ETH and other altcoins generally surge in the near term. However, he also predicts a dip for ETH/BTC in the long term.\n\n\u201cETH: Checking out the ETH/BTC chart here, if this one has short-term bottomed then we should see an altcoin run. I don\u2019t know if this is going to happen here because I ultimately believe Ethereum eventually goes to the .055 level or lower.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for $0.66 BTC, or $1,869.\n\nHe notes that if a bottom is forming, it could chop around at the current price level for a while longer before a surge.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while to form good strong bottoms. Days and weeks chopping is healthy and the longer the consolidation, the stronger the move. We\u2019ve chopped here for about two weeks now and let\u2019s see if this is a short term bottom or not.\u201d\n\nLastly, Sherpa weighs in on Dogecoin (DOGE) following the meme token\u2019s rally by more than 30% after its most famous supporter, tech billionaire Elon Musk, changed Twitter\u2019s icon to the DOGE logo. He predicts Dogecoin will soon give up its gains.\n\n\u201cDOGE: To be determined if this pump has any legs; typically we see some sort of illiquid move up followed by a swift retrace. First resistance area approaching; IMO this goes all the way down after the Twitter icon is changed.\u201d\n\nDOGE is swapping hands at $0.0952 at time of writing, down from Tuesday\u2019s high of $0.102.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLeading NFT attendance badge service POAP announced Tuesday that it will soon begin charging commercial clients for access to its services, ending the company\u2019s years-long policy of offering all users unlimited POAP minting for free.\n\n\u201cOur goal for the long run is to bring POAPs to humanity more broadly, and getting there will require long-term sustainability to be more of a priority,\u201d the company said in an email sent to POAP users today.\n\nPOAP, or Proof of Attendance Protocol, is an Ethereum-based app that helps event organizers give out attendance badges in the form of NFTs, minted using the ERC-721 token standard. Those badges, called POAPs, can be used to show proof of attendance at a physical or virtual event, as well as to unlock a variety of benefits and experiences post-mint, including access to group chats, discounts, and ticketing for future events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPOAP raised $10 million in a seed funding round last year to further its development. According to the company, over 6.5 million POAPs have been minted since it launched in 2019.\n\nPOAPs will still be free for personal use, per the company. Companies and individuals who distribute POAPs at commercial events, though, may be subject to charges based on the number of POAPs they issue, beginning April 17.\n\nAccording to Isabel Gonzalez, POAP\u2019s co-founder, prices for commercial clients will likely converge around $1 per POAP issued. Current commercial users, however, will be able to opt into special pricing at one quarter that cost, for an unspecified period of time.\n\nNot all commercial customers will be charged for their use of POAPs, though. Certain ventures that further POAP\u2019s artistic and creative mandate may continue to be subsidized by the company on a case-by-case basis, according to Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cWe like people creating true precious digital collectibles more than we care that they pay,\u201d Gonzalez told Decrypt. \u201cThe efforts that go into good storytelling are worth their own weight in gold.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParticularly in Web3, where the line between community and company is often razor-thin, determining whether an event or project is personal or commercial can pose a daunting task. POAP has released detailed guidelines outlining the telltale diferences between a personal event (a wedding with under 200 attendees where collectors know the issuer directly) versus a commercial one (a concert with thousands of attendees where a POAP unlocks financial perks).\n\nSome factors taken into consideration in determining whether a project is personal and commercial\u2014such as whether \u201can emotional connection\u201d exists between a POAP issuer and collector (telltale sign of personal usage)\u2014may prove harder to parse. As a general rule, according to the POAP guidelines, events requiring large amounts of POAPs (especially in an automated fashion) will most likely be considered commercial ventures.\n\nGonzalez, who said ideas for a commercial use tier have been floating around POAP since early last year, hopes the move will encourage its users to consider the best applications for its services, in addition to cementing the company\u2019s staying power.\n\n\u201cWe believe this evolution will expand the range of possibilities for how POAP can be used sustainably, in part by giving issuers tools to align their plans with POAP\u2019s mission of creating precious digital collectibles,\u201d she said."

A sandwich attack refers to a type of front-running, where the MEV bot places a trade right before and after a large pending trade, benefitting from an artificial change in price.\n\nSomething crazy happened in MEV land\u2026 If you asked me who made money in 2023, I would\u2019ve said the top searchers.

Proposer equivocation is when an eligible proposer makes two or more conflicting proposals. \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) April 3, 2023\n\nAlthough the validator was penalized by being slashed from the network, to some users, it seemed like a small price to pay compared to the profit earned from the attack.\n\n\u201c25,000,000 profit for 1,800 penalty?

On April 6, the company will launch 3,800 Ethereum NFTs spanning a mix of POGs and slammers with unique artwork for each, at a price of 0.049 ETH (about $90 as of this writing).\n\nThe NFTs can be used within a slate of upcoming Ethereum-based video games, which are set to launch this summer. The first play-to-earn POG game, called Stack and Slam, will first debut on Solana this week. Frisbee said that it mimics the classic slammer-tossing playground experience, relying on a combination of timing, skill, and luck for players to succeed.\n\nSome of the NFTs will feature artwork from popular NFT projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Moonbirds. Bored Ape holders can use or license out their owned artwork for commercial products, while the open-source Moonbirds artwork is free for anyone to commercialize. Other POGs NFTs are based on projects like Neo Tokyo and Viva La Vandal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond this week\u2019s mint, Frisbee and team plan to release physical packs of Web3 project-themed POGs in May via a token-gated platform, letting owners of POG NFTs access the marketplace to purchase limited edition POGs based on the NFTs.\n\nFrom there, Frisbee has a number of ideas on how to further embrace Web3 with POGs. He envisions a potential play-for-keeps physical game that uses NFC chips within the POGs themselves, and then automatically transfers the tokenized ownership from the loser\u2019s wallet into the winner\u2019s.\n\nThe goal with POGs NFTs, he said, is to deliver digital collectibles that feed into video games, but also pair with the physical POGs experience.\n\nHe teased plans to bring physical POGs back in a big way, with the NFT expansion and celebrity partners intended to \u201cbring the right buzz for when the official distribution of those POGs comes back globally.\u201d"

Will the Shanghai upgrade, hype pump the market and take ETH above $2K.\n\nOverall cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 1.44% to $1.21 trillion today. The bullish momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum lead to this growth in the market. However, BTC already reached its new 2023 high of $29,184 on March 30 and ETH did the same today.\n\nEthereum today overcame its key seven-month resistance at $1,900 and headed for the next conceptual round level of $2,000. The Shanghai upgrade and rise in Bitcoin price are the two vital reasons behind the ETH surge.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade, the latest hard fork of Ethereum, scheduled for April 12, 2023, further implements the key Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4895 and several others. As a result of this EIP-4895 implementation, validators and stakeholders in Ethereum will be able to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade also known as the Shapella upgrade, a combination of words \u201cShanghai\u201d and Capella\u201d, two of the anticipated Ethereum growth proposals.\n\nThe rise in the price of bitcoin since last night could also be another reason for the rise in ETH.

Not only did it come true a week ago when Polygon launched its version of the zkEVM, but the project has also been gaining traction lately.\n\nThe growth of Polygon zkEVM is evident in its soaring total value locked (TVL) and blue chip projects wanting to deploy on the network.\n\nPolygon zkEVM TVL Soars 250%\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has been enjoying a lot of attention from the Ethereum community lately.

This comes as no surprise as Aave had been deployed on Polygon zkEVM testnet for six months prior to the launch.\n\nThe proposal on Aave said that because Polygon zkEVM is EVM-equivalent, Aave V3 would require minimal development work.\n\nHowever, the successful vote was a temperature check vote, meaning that the DAO will have to vote again to confirm the deployment of Aave on Polygon zkEVM.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nPolygon zkEVM is still in beta, meaning that there are multiple optimizations needed to be done in the near future.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nPolygon zkEVM is one of the most exciting technological solutions aimed at scaling Ethereum.

SubQuery has already shown that it is quicker than The Graph (GRT) and provides Ethereum developers with another decentralized option with the imminent launch of the SubQuery Network.\n\nInstead of developing indexing solutions, developers can concentrate on product development and user experience thanks to SubQuery\u2019s proprietary API, which abstracts the backend and frees users from the burden of designing their own indexing systems, as per information about its Web3 data indexing launch shared with Finbold on April 5.\n\nIn particular, the decentralized data indexing solution gives developers the tools they need to quickly organize and query on-chain data for their protocols and apps. Avalanche, Flare, Cosmos (Ethermint), and Polkadot (FrontierEVM) are among the networks that will benefit from this new integration, which expands on SubQuery\u2019s current support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for other networks.\n\nSubQuery is actively working on making the protocol decentralized and tokenized so they may launch the SubQuery Network. From the get-go, the SubQuery Network will be able to index Ethereum projects, as well as those from any other supported Layer-1, and provide services to the worldwide community based on this data.\n\nThe Founder and CEO of SubQuery, Sam Zou, said:\n\n\u201cEthereum has been on our radar since day one. Our experienced engineering team has put a lot of hard work into this integration, so that we can guarantee Ethereum developers will have a smooth and seamless experience indexing with SubQuery\u2019s open-source SDK, tools, and documentation.

However, SubQuery is already 1.85 times quicker than The Graph for common projects like the default Ethereum Name Service project, with just beta support.\n\nSubQuery is 1.85x faster than The Graph. Source: SubQuery\n\nSubQuery can decrease the number of costly database writes by using multi-threading and optimizing the store. Developers may reduce the time between iterations and the release of new features by shortening the sync times.\n\nUnlike The Graph, SubQuery will not be sunsetted. It improves upon existing decentralized indexing solutions by giving developers more freedom to host their own projects and more control over those by supporting large-scale projects in its managed service, which hosts large-scale infrastructure and processes millions of daily requests."

Furthermore, the culprit is yet to be apprehended and currently holds $20 million worth of stolen tokens.\n\nBut before addressing this issue, let\u2019s discuss what sandwich attacks are and how they are carried out.\n\nHow are sandwich attacks carried out?\n\nSandwich attacks are a form of malicious blockchain attack that takes advantage of smart contract vulnerabilities. A sandwich attack, simply put, traps a user\u2019s transaction between two transactions, which is then further manipulated to gain profits. Such assaults are frequently carried out with the assistance of MEV (maximum extractable value) bots operating in a network.\n\nBefore we take a look at an example, it\u2019s important to understand how MEV bots function since they are a crucial component of sandwich attacks. MEV bots are automated software designed to exploit a network by detecting profitable transactional opportunities. They can initiate \u201csandwich trades\u201d by spotting traders attempting to purchase tokens and slipping in between to make a profit. Such a method is often used by validators.\n\nFor example, if a trader places a transaction to buy $5,000 worth of ETH, the MEV bot detects it and places a transaction to buy ETH just before the trader can execute the transaction. These back-to-back buy transactions can inflate the price of ETH. The MEV bot then places a sell transaction after the trader\u2019s buy transaction to make a profit from the price jump.\n\nCertain inefficiencies with how blockchains function make it possible for such attacks to occur. For instance, on the blockchain, transactions with the highest gas fees are picked up first to be added to the block. Thus, MEV places the first transaction with higher gas fees than the victim and places the second transaction with lower gas fees to make sure the first malicious transaction is picked before the victim\u2019s, followed by the second malicious transaction.\n\nHow a rogue Ethereum validator pulled a $25 million theft?\n\nIn a recent sandwich attack, a bad player pretended to be an Ethereum validator by depositing 32 ETH just 18 days before the planned theft. The rogue validator then caused an MEV bot to launch a sandwich assault, replacing several automated trades and stealing $25 million.\n\nIt was later reported that eight addresses from the KuCoin exchange were involved in executing the said sandwich attacks on Uniswap liquidity pools. According to blockchain security firm PeckShieldAlert, the stolen amount is stored in three different addresses out of eight involved in the theft.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the hacker has about $13.4 million worth of wrapped Ethereum (WETH), $1.8 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), $3 million in USDT, $5 million in USDC and $1.6 million worth of DAI stablecoin.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile rug pulls and Sybil attacks are frequently discussed in the crypto space, sandwich attacks have often been overlooked. Data security firm, CertiK, told CoinTelegraph that about $27 million worth of exploits have occurred via MEV bots (bots that execute sandwich attacks) since September 2022, with the latest attack accounting for a great majority."

        "title": "Ethereum Locked-in Beacon Contract Surpasses 18 Million - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": ".\n\nThe number of validators on the Ethereum blockchain has increased rapidly, with 67,500 new validators arriving on the network from January 1, 2023, to the end of Q1.\n\nCurrently, the number of ETH locked in the Beacon contract is over 18 million, representing 15% of the total supply, and the ETH price has risen 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network currently operates with 13,299 physical nodes in 81 countries, and the USA, Germany, and Finland have the highest node density.\n\nLess than 10 days to Shanghai upgrade. With this upgrade, ETH stakers on the ETH 2.0 contract can withdraw their funds if they wish. This allowed the number of validators on the Ethereum blockchain to increase rapidly.\n\nAccording to BeaconScan data, 67,500 new validators arrived on the network from January 1, 2023, to the end of Q1. The number of validators, which was 495,270 on January 1, increased to 562,787 as of April 1. On January 12, an important milestone was passed in the Ethereum blockchain, the number of validators exceeded 500,000. The biggest jump took place between February 25 and March 1. 16,700 new validators joined the network with the official date set for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network currently operates with 13,299 physical nodes in 81 different countries. The three countries with the highest node density are the USA (36.57%), Germany (17.50%), and Finland (6.18%).\n\nNumber of Ethereum Validators to Decrease After Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe process of staking ETH on Ethereum 2.0 started in December 2020. Since then, anyone who has locked their 32 ETH on the Beacon Chain can become a validator in the network and have a say in the consensus mechanism. The function of validators in the Ethereum network is to validate that transactions and blocks are valid\n\nIt is expected that the number of validators will first decrease and then increase again. Individuals and institutions can choose to stake ETH by being able to withdraw at any time.\n\nValidators are currently rewarded with 5.2% APR for this. Someone who staked 32 ETH with an average price of $600 in December 2020 would have made a profit of around 3.5 times with staking rewards after about 2 and a half years. The profit rate will vary based on factors such as when the person stakes their coins and at what price they will sell them.\n\nWill There Be Pressure To Sell?\n\nAs of April 12, anyone who wants to can withdraw their funds also means they can sell their funds. This can lead to both a rapid price drop and a liquidity crisis. Santiment data shows that only 10.3% of the circulating ETH supply is found on crypto exchanges, the lowest amount since July 2015.\n\nCurrently, the number of ETH locked in the Beacon contract is over 18 million. This means there is around $32.5B worth of locked assets. 18 million ETH also represents 15% of the total supply. Delphi Digital has published a chart showing that Ethereum validators have earned 1.1 million ETH since December 2020. That\u2019s almost $2B.\n\nDefiLlama data, on the other hand, shows that 7.9 million ETH has been staked on liquid ETH staking protocols. Since the withdrawal option is open in these protocols, the amount of ETH in these protocols can change daily. Lido has the largest share with 74%, followed by Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH with 15% and Rocket Pool with 5.6%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) price has risen 50% since the beginning of the year. We can expect high volatility in price, especially in the days before and after the Shanghai upgrade."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction - Will ETH Rally as Traders Back New Green Token Ecoterra? Wed, Apr 05, 2023 15:57 CET Report this content\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) surged to $1,873 on Tuesday, up 4% over the previous 24 hours, and up 9.2% on the week.\n\nIts weekly gains have outcompeted Bitcoin\u2019s, helping the #2 crypto asset regain some lost ground against the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. ETH/BTC has risen from 0.064 on April 3rd to 0.066 today \u2013 a 3.6% pump. This brings ETH market dominance up to 18.2%, versus Bitcoin\u2019s 44.2%.\n\nTuesday\u2019s pronounced rally applied to all risk assets, as stock market indices like the Nasdaq 100 and S&P500 continue to trade higher over the past week. In particular, futures contracts tied to the tech-focused Nasdaq index rose 0.35% to an eight month high.\n\nEthereum\u2019s own trajectory mimics this, having not reached the upper $1800 price level since mid-August, when hype for its upcoming Merge upgrade was abounding.\n\nWith the network on the brink of another major upgrade this month \u2013 the Shapella upgrade \u2013 Ethereum may be poised for another bullish breakout back above $2000.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of eco-friendly tokens like ecoterra may continue to attract attention to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem from environmentally conscious investors \u2013 especially amid continuing fervor surrounding Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEthereum Remains Rangebound (TA)\n\nSince mid-March, Ethereum\u2019s price has remain rangebound between the lower $1700 and mid $1800 price levels.\n\nThus far, the asset has shown a strong proclivity to sharply reverse trajectory whenever touching the lower end of that range, such as on March 22 and March 27. While there appears to be strong support at that price level, Ethereum\u2019s movement so far indicates no upside bias.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, there are a range of likely possibilities for Ethereum\u2019s next breakout. On one hand, if the market determines that it needs deeper support, it could retrace back to support found at the lower $1600 level.\n\nAlternatively, the asset may have experienced a shallow retracement to its established $1700 lows on Monday, before breaking out beyond its resitance.\n\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re holding $1717, I\u2019m in favor of a breakout scenario,\u201d said price analyst More Crypto Online on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s likely, but it\u2019s not for sure.\u201d\n\nShapella On the Way\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade \u2013 the name for its joint \u201cShanghai\u201d and \u201cCopella\u201d upgrades \u2013 is scheduled to roll out at block 6209536 on April 12th \u2013 less than a week from today.\n\nThe long awaited hardfork will allow Ethereum users to withdraw their staked assets from the network for the first time since the Beacon Chain rolled out in November 2020. Each upgrade will make changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and consensus layer, respectively.\n\nThe change is a follow up to the Ethereum\u2019s \u201cMerge,\u201d which shifted the main network\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake. This reduced the network\u2019s energy consumption by 99.9%, a feat praised by environmentally conscious businesses and regulators as a step toward responsible innovation in crypto.\n\nPrior to the Merge\u2019s rollout, Ethereum appreciated significantly compared to rival cryptocurrencies, rising from $1000 in July to nearly $2000 in August. Ethereum could experience a smaller, albeit significant price runup similar to that as Shapella makes proof of stake on the network fully functional.\n\nIts successful rollout could also make Ethereum a more attractive asset to investors who no longer need worry about being unable to withdraw their stake.\n\nThat said, Shapella could also mimic the Merge in terms of being a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event, meaning its price plummets directly after the upgrade actually takes place. Some have even theorized that the upgrade willspark a market dump, as it will unlock billions of dollars in ETH that can now be potentially sold and drive Ethereum\u2019s price down.\n\nStill, a fully functional proof of stake Ethereum retains a strong value proposition to environmentalists who were once put off by the network\u2019s energy intensive mining industry. Furthermore, environmentalist projects built atop the Ethereum blockchain \u2013 such as ecoterra \u2013 only strengthen that value proposition.\n\nNew Token Ecoterra Backed for Big Gains as it Enters the Recycle2Earn Economy\n\nEcoterra is a new crypto project that many people are backing to be the next big green crypto, having raised over $50,000 shortly after launching its presale. This initiative leverages blockchain technology and tokenization to encourage recycling and efficient energy use.\n\nThrough the ecoterra app, companies can reward consumers in ecoterra tokens (ECOTERRA) for proving that they have engaged in a number of green initiatives, including puchasing PET plastic, glass, aluminum, and green energy packages.\n\nUsers will also be rewarded for scanning barcodes of recyclable products, and for recycling and uploading their RVM receipts to their accounts. They are also provided with a carbon-offset marketplace to help all parties reach their emissions targets, even if personal efforts are not enough.\n\nOnce earned, ECOTERRA may be donated to fund green initiatives around the globe, such as tree planting, cleaning projects, and climate change education. It can even be used to purchase eco friendly products for everyday use.\n\nECOTERRA features a max supply of 2,000,000,000 tokens, and trades as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. The token\u2019s presale process is still active, now being offered on its website for $0.004, purchasable via USD, USDT, or ETH.\n\nWhile low right now, ECOTERRA\u2019s price is being periodically increased as the presale continues, so new investors will need to enter early to get the best bargain.\n\nThe project is certified and audited by the blockchain security company Certik, including 90+% scores in code security and fundamental health.\n\nAmid continued public scrutiny and regulatory pressure against proof of work blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum will continue to benefit from its standout position as a low-energy network \u2013 and so may the tokens on its platform."

        "title": "Should You Buy This New Crypto With Explosive Upside Potential? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When the new Arbitrum (CRYPTO:ARB) token started trading in crypto markets on March 23, it was arguably the most highly anticipated token debut of the year. Arbitrum had sparked tremendous investor interest as well as hype and speculation online after announcing earlier in the month that it would distribute more than 1 billion tokens to users, developers, and investors within its ecosystem in what is known as a crypto airdrop. As part of this airdrop, if you were an active user or developer of Arbitrum, you were entitled to claim free tokens that would be sent to your online crypto wallet.\n\nBut in many ways, the hype and speculation surrounding the airdrop was Arbitrum's downfall as soon as the token started trading. Many saw this as an opportunity to become a crypto millionaire overnight. On the first day of trading, Arbitrum fell by 90% from its early price of more than $11 as new token owners sold en masse and locked in profits. Arbitrum now trades for about $1.20.\n\nNonetheless, despite this early volatility, some Arbitrum bulls now predict that the token could double by the end of April. Here's the case for and against buying Arbitrum.\n\nThe Ethereum factor\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH 1.60%), much like Polygon (MATIC 2.06%) or Optimism (OP), and was created with one primary goal in mind: to make Ethereum run faster, better, and more efficiently. Instead of processing individual transactions on a one-by-one basis, Arbitrum \"rolls up\" tens of thousands of transactions into a single batch to reduce congestion on the Ethereum network. Because of this, Arbitrum can handle 40,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum can manage fewer than 40.\n\nIn terms of its prospects, Arbitrum is very much a leveraged bet on the future of Ethereum. As a Layer 2 token, Arbitrum essentially sits on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. Thus, if you have confidence in the growth prospects of Ethereum, then you should have confidence in the growth prospects of Arbitrum. At some point, Ethereum might not need Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum. However, until Ethereum reaches its long-promised goal of 100,000 transactions per second, there is still a need for Arbitrum.\n\nGrowth prospects\n\nArbitrum already ranks No. 4 in total value locked (TVL), one of the most important blockchain metrics used to evaluate how much activity is really happening on a blockchain. In fact, Arbitrum has already surpassed its Layer 2 peers in this regard. While Arbitrum now accounts for 4.48% of all TVL, Polygon can claim only a 2.15% share. Optimism is even lower, at 1.85%. Even Ethereum rivals such as Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) have lower TVL metrics than Arbitrum.\n\nThus, while it might be tempting to say that Arbitrum was overhyped, the numbers speak for themselves. Developers obviously trust Arbitrum and are using it for new blockchain projects. During the first week of trading, Arbitrum's TVL spiked by 20%.\n\nA crowded field\n\nWhile the long-term growth thesis for Arbitrum is attractive, the big thing to watch out for is that the Layer 2 field is getting more and more crowded. After The Merge, Ethereum still needs help in getting rid of congestion on its blockchain and settling transactions more quickly and cheaply. One of the biggest misconceptions about The Merge was that transaction speeds on Ethereum would increase dramatically. As a result, new Layer 2 competitors are continually entering the ring. That might be good news for Ethereum, but it could hurt future market share projections for any Layer 2 solution.\n\nInvestors recognize the importance of these Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, so their prices are soaring this year. Polygon is up almost 50% for the year, while Optimism is up 140%.\n\nEarly performance issues\n\nTheoretically, Arbitrum, as the newest Layer 2 competitor, should also be skyrocketing in value. So it's a bit concerning that the price of Arbitrum is just $1.20, which is nearly 90% below its all-time high of $11.80, which it set in its first hours of trading. If you look at a chart for Arbitrum, it's easy to see what happened: the price fell off a cliff immediately as anyone who had Arbitrum tokens sold as quickly as they could to lock in profits. Since that plunge on the first day of trading, Aribitrum has basically traded sideways in the $1.20 to $1.40 range.\n\nTo make a stock investing analogy, it would be much as if shares of a heavily hyped initial public offering (IPO) plummeted right out of the gate as insiders dumped everything they owned. For that very reason, there are specific IPO lockup periods to avoid an instant, mass sell-off. In the crypto world, however, lockup periods are optional, and not mandatory. Nevertheless, some analysts point to similar experiences with tokens such as Polygon as proof that a price reversal could be coming sooner rather than later for Arbitrum.\n\nShould you buy Arbitrum?\n\nRight now, there's an interesting situation in the Layer 2 market. There are several high-profile Layer 2 tokens (Polygon, Arbitrum, and Immutable) trading between $1.15 and $1.25. Optimism is an outlier here, trading at about $2.20. All of them do roughly the same thing -- help Ethereum run more efficiently -- and their prices appear to have clustered in the same range.\n\nIf you have to pick winners and losers in this crowded field, it might be easier simply to invest in Ethereum, which is the base layer blockchain responsible for all this growth. While I'm impressed with all the traction that Arbitrum has made in the Layer 2 market, I'm very much turned off by how the token traded straight out of the gate. In terms of a crypto that I can buy and hold for the long term, my preference is still Ethereum."

        "content": "BNB Chain was the king of rug pulls in the first quarter of 2023, with over 73.3% of such scams in the entire crypto ecosystem happening on the network, according to an April 4 report from blockchain security firm Immunefi.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cCrypto Losses in Q1 2023,\u201d investigated a variety of crypto hacks and scams in the first quarter of the year. It found that Ethereum and BNB Chain were the two largest targets for hackers and scammers, with 68.8% of total losses from these networks combined. BNB Chain, in particular, made up 41.3% of total losses from hacks and scams.\n\nOne type of scam, in particular, reigned supreme on BNB Chain: rug pulls, a type of scam where developers raise funds and then close up shop without delivering a product or service. Immunefi stated that 73.3% of all rug pulls in the crypto ecosystem happened on BNB Chain in the first quarter.\n\nRelated: Uniswap launches on BNB Chain ecosystem to drive growth and liquidity\n\nImmunefi tech Lead Adrian Hetman speculated that the large number of rug pulls on the chain may be due to a culture that promotes forking open-source code:\n\n\u201cBNB Chain still has a serious issue with developers using forked code. Its community lacks a security-first approach and attracts many users looking for a quick way to earn money. That\u2019s why we continue to see the biggest number of exploits and rug pulls in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nDespite the prevalence of these scams on BNB Chain, Immunefi also stated that rug pulls and other frauds are a much smaller problem in the crypto community than hacks or exploits. Hacks were the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d of losses in Q1 2023, the report said, whereas all frauds combined (including rug pulls and other scams) made up only 4.3% of total losses.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has seen spectacular hacks and exploits, draining millions of dollars from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. On Feb. 1, the DeFi lending app BonqDAO was the victim of an oracle hack, losing $120 million in crypto. On Feb. 17, decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible was hacked for over $2 million. And on March 13, Euler lost over $195 million of crypto in the largest DeFi attack of the quarter."

        "content": "PancakeSwap V3 will drastically reduce fees compared to V2.\n\nCAKE\u2019s TVL remained stagnant, but metrics and indicators looked bullish.\n\nPancakeSwap [CAKE] announced the launch of its much-awaited PancakeSwap V3, bringing several new changes to the table. The DEX\u2019s official tweet on 3 April confirmed that V3 was live on both BNB Chain and Ethereum [ETH].\n\n1/14 ?GM ev3ryone! The anticipated #PancakeSwapv3 is now LIVE on both BNB Chain and Ethereum!? ?Upgrade offers:\n\n?Lowest fees in the industry\n\n?Increased fee earnings for liquidity providers\n\n?\ufe0fNew tools for seamless user experience Read more : https://t.co/l7GQVxqVC3 pic.twitter.com/5G9TnFzxOb \u2014 PancakeSwap?Ev3ryone's Favourite D3X (@PancakeSwap) April 3, 2023\n\nRead PancakeSwap\u2019s [CAKE] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAll you need to know about PancakeSwap V3\n\nThe official announcement mentioned several new features and changes that PancakeSwap\u2019s V3 brought with it. For instance, V3 will offer considerably lower fees\u2014up to 25 times lower compared to the previous version.\n\nAs noted earlier, CAKE\u2019s revenue had been on a declining trend. V3\u2019s lower fee could attract new users, which could then result in an increase in the network\u2019s revenue.\n\nApart from low fees, another key aspect of PancakeSwap V3 is capital efficiency. By selecting a specific price range when providing liquidity, liquidity providers could now \u201cconcentrate\u201d their capital into smaller price intervals with V3. It was also interesting to note that PancakeSwap V3 was built on top of Uniswap V3 with added refinements.\n\nWill V3 propel MATIC?\n\nThough the update looks promising, PancakeSwap\u2019s network value does not seem to have been affected positively yet. This was evident from a look at DeFiLlama\u2019s data, which pointed out CAKE\u2019s stagnant TVL. However, the V3 launch brought hope for a change in the coming weeks, as it might help increase CAKE\u2019s TVL.\n\nBefore the launch, CAKE\u2019s price was under the bears\u2019 influence. However, things seemed to have started to change as CAKE\u2019s declining momentum slowed down. According to CoinMarketCap, CAKE was trading nearly 0.4% lower than yesterday. At the time of writing, it was valued at $3.68 with a market capitalization of over $673 million.\n\nThanks to the relatively better price action, CAKE\u2019s MVRV ratio also recovered slightly on 4 April. Whales\u2019 interest in CAKE also increased as whale transaction counts spiked lately. CAKE\u2019s volume increased considerably, reflecting investors\u2019 interest in trading the token. Another positive development was that CAKE\u2019s weighted sentiments drifted up swiftly, which indicated the crypto community\u2019s confidence in the token.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 CAKEs worth today?\n\nGoing forward\n\nThe effects of V3\u2019s launch might soon be reflected in CAKE\u2019s chart, as suggested by a few market indicators. The MACD displayed a slight bullish crossover, suggesting a price hike in the near term. PancakeSwap\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a slight uptick and was headed towards the neutral mark, which looked bullish.\n\nHowever, nothing can be said with utmost certainty as CAKE\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) went down and was resting below the 50 mark."

LSDs are financial instruments that allow investors to retain their staked assets\u2019 earning potential while maintaining liquidity. They enable token holders to participate in various DeFi applications and earn yields while still having the flexibility to trade their staked assets.\n\nAccording to analyst Dynamo Patrick, LSD\u2019s have become increasingly popular in the crypto space and have overtaken many sectors in the DeFi space, and have managed to rank second in terms of deposits made in the sector.\n\nPopular LSDs in the crypto space include Lido, Frax Finance, and Rocket Pool.\n\nA large majority of the staked ETH has been deposited through Lido. According to Dune Analytics\u2019s data, 31.4% of all staked ETH has been deposited through the protocol. Due to the dominance of Lido, the protocol has seen a massive surge in TVL over the last few months.\n\nCoupled with that, the revenue generated by Lido increased by 22.1% over the last month. The main reason for the spike in revenue on the network would be the increased daily activity on the protocol.\n\nNot just Lido\n\nHowever, it won\u2019t just be Lido that is impacted by the interest in staking, other protocols, such as Frax Finance and Rocket Pool also stood a chance of benefiting from the attention on LSDs.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s XRP\u2019s market cap in LDO\u2019s terms\n\nEach protocol\u2019s token, LDO, RPL and FRAX has started to witness a rise in interest as a result. Investors and traders alike are buying tokens of these protocols to benefit from the interest being generated through staking. This was showcased by the growing market cap of each of these tokens over the last few days.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the interest in these tokens will continue long after the Shanghai Hardfork."

        "content": "In a recent post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delved into the potential integration of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zk-EVMs) at Ethereum's base layer, which could expedite the verification process without sacrificing decentralization and security.\n\n\n\nAccording to Buterin, the use of zk-EVMs could execute smart contracts on the blockchain through ZK proofs.\n\nButerin emphasized Ethereum's \"multi-client philosophy,\" which fosters decentralization at the protocol level. Introducing zk-EVMs at Ethereum layer 1 would result in a third type of client, joining \"consensus\" and \"execution\" clients. The consensus client employs proof-of-stake to ensure agreement among network nodes, while the execution client processes new transactions using standard EVM and maintains an up-to-date copy of the blockchain state.\n\nIn weighing the pros and cons of treating layer 1 protocols as a \"clearinghouse\" by transferring most activities to layer 2, Buterin cautioned that layer 1-based apps could become \"economically nonviable.\" Furthermore, small funds may get \"stuck\" if gas fees escalate.\n\nButerin elaborated that an \"open\" zk-EVM system would necessitate different clients with distinct zk-EVM implementations, wherein each client awaits a proof compatible with its implementation before validating a block. This approach would preserve the \"multi-client\" paradigm and facilitate the development of new clients, further decentralizing Ethereum at the base layer.\n\nAccording to Buterin, zk-EVMs might be the solution to \"The Verge,\" an aspect of the Ethereum roadmap aimed at simplifying base layer verification. Although the zk-EVM infrastructure could create data inefficiency and latency challenges, Buterin believes these obstacles are surmountable.\n\nThe implementation of the zk-EVM ecosystem would simplify the process of running a full Ethereum node. As Buterin explained, Ethereum blocks would be smaller, and anyone could operate a fully verifying node on various devices, including laptops, phones, or browser extensions, all while maintaining the benefits of Ethereum's multi-client philosophy. The core argument here, at least in Buterin's stance, is the effective decentralization of political power, especially in the case of DAOs and emerging Ethereum-based and Ethereum-compatible projects.\n\nSignificant strides have been made with zk-EVM by Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform Polygon, which recently open-sourced its zkEVM to the Polygon mainnet on March 27. The move promises to decrease transaction costs and increase the throughput of smart contract deployments. Other organizations, such as StarkWare, ConsenSys, Scroll, zkSync, and Immutable, are also working on zk-EVM scaling solutions.\n\nButerin's contemplation of zk-EVMs at Ethereum's base layer showcases a commitment to balancing scalability with the platform's core values of decentralization and security. As layer 2 solutions progress and zk-EVMs move closer to implementation, the Ethereum ecosystem wloud also, by extension, experience significant advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and decentralization.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Blockchain/Bitcoin Incore Bank Signs Maerki Baumann as First Client For SDX Ethereum Staking by Fintechnews Switzerland April 5, 2023\n\nInCore Bank can now offer Ethereum staking capabilities that are fully compliant with Know-Your-Client (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) regulations to their clients.\n\nIn this collaboration, InCore Bank provides crypto brokerage, banking operations and custody services, while SDX Web3 provides crypto custody and non-custodial-staking services.\n\nThe Zurich-based private bank Maerki Baumann launched its crypto strategy in 2019. Apart from corporate accounts for companies focusing on blockchain technology and crypto applications, it offers services in crypto trading and custody in collaboration with InCore Bank. Maerki Baumann will continue to expand its crypto offering by making the new Ethereum staking services available to its private and corporate tech banking clients.\n\nMark Dambacher, CEO InCore Bank, stated,\n\n\u00abWe perceive an increasing interest in staking and ways to participate in the decentralized economy. InCore Bank\u2019s fully integrated and future-oriented staking services via segregated wallets, enable us to offer staking to our clients within a convenient, secure, regulated and tax compliant setting. We are proud to be part of this strategic alliance with SDX\u00bb.\n\nDavid Newns, Head of SDX, adds,\n\n\u00abThis collaboration between established digital asset institutions is the first of its kind in Switzerland. We are strengthening the Swiss digital asset ecosystem by enabling key market players to provide value adding capabilities like Ethereum custody and staking that their clients are asking for\u00bb.\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nBlockchain networks are based on the principle of decentralisation, there is no central entity that decides on the correct transaction history. Nevertheless, a consensus mechanism is needed to ensure in a decentralized pattern that transactions are validated in correct order and in a secure manner. Blockchains typically reach consensus in two ways, either by so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms.\n\nIn PoS blockchains like Ethereum, to guarantee consensus, no power-intensive computing power is used. Rather, capital needs to be expended in the form of the blockchain\u2019s own coin. These coins must be \u00abstaked\u00bb, i.e. made available to the network and bound by it for the staking period. For individuals who hold digital assets of proof-of-stake networks, staking is mandatory in order to avoid dilution of their own position. Due to this fact, it can be assumed that in the near future, there will be an increasing merger of custody and staking.\n\nStaking is an umbrella term used to denote the act of pledging crypto-assets to a cryptocurrency protocol to earn rewards in exchange. Staking allows users to participate in securing the network by locking up tokens. The \u00abstakers\u00bb become validators who add new transactions to the respective blockchain. At the same time, the validators follow the so-called consensus rules. These set the rules of the game according to which the various network participants have to comply. If, as a validator, you violate the network\u2019s consensus rules during this process, you put your own capital at risk in the form of the coins you have staked. This ensures validators have an incentive to abide by the rules.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from freepik"

They include enabling liquidity providers to focus their capital on smaller price ranges, a characteristic that leads to better fee earnings from the same amount of deposits.\n\nPancakeSwap V3 offers four trading charge tiers; 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%. V2 only offered one tier, which was 0.25%. Each fee tier can have a liquidity pool for each token pair, with asset pairs tending to gravitate toward the fee tier with the best incentives for both liquidity providers and traders.\n\nBy encouraging the largest amount of liquidity from Liquidity Providers, this strategy aims to strike a balance between traders paying the lowest fee tier and other participants.\n\nTwo additional features will be added to PancakeSwap V3 in the future: a position management function and the V3 \u201cVIP\u201d trading rewards program.\n\nThe VIP program is a tiered structure that rewards traders for their trading volume with special advantages including the potential to receive a 5% trading fee rebate \u2013 which may encourage more platform activity and increase PancakeSwap\u2019s revenue.\n\nUsing the \u201cposition manager\u201d feature, traders can seamlessly deposit liquidity and gradually optimize that position based on costs and benefits.

Hence, Big Eyes Coin has launched the BULLRUN250 bonus code, which offers crypto users a massive 250% bonus when purchasing BIG tokens or Loot Boxes.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Loot Boxes is the project\u2019s ongoing video game feature parallel to the BULLRUN250 bonus code, which offers its community a maximum ROI of 5000%. It features the Saver Tin, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, Super Saiyan Box, and Excali-Paw Master Chest, and each loot box carries a maximum return of $500, $5000, $25,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000 worth of BIG tokens, respectively.\n\nSo if a user enters the BULLRUN250 bonus code when purchasing a Cute Box loot box, the user will get a potential return of $5,000 plus $250 in BIG tokens.\n\nWe can see that while the use of cryptocurrency has seen overwhelming growth and popularity over the years, investors remain uncertain as the regulatory landscape surrounding the industry remains rather blurry as the heavy crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission appears to take a heavy toll on digital currencies, creating challenges for investors and lenders alike.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Cross-chain messaging protocol developer LayerZero Labs has raised another $120 million, according to an April 4 announcement. The company plans to use the capital to increase its headcount and expand its reach into the Asia-Pacific region. The company had previously raised $135 million in March 2022.\n\nLayerZero Labs is best known for its cross-chain messaging protocol, LayerZero, which is often used to create asset bridges between blockchain networks. It is also a supporter of the Stargate multichain bridge.\n\nWith the completion of this fundraising round, the company now has a $3 billion valuation. Over 33 investors participated in the latest funding round, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, BOND, Circle Ventures, Christie's, OpenSea Ventures and Samsung Next.\n\nRelated: Uniswap DAO debate shows devs still struggle to secure cross-chain bridges\n\nRyan Zarick, co-founder and chief technology officer of LayerZero Labs, said the new fundraise will help to create a multichain environment where applications can make the best use of each network\u2019s unique benefits:\n\n\u201cImagine a future where a single user-facing application can harness the speed of Solana, the security of Ethereum, and the cheap file storage of Arweave, while also being fully abstracted to the user.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis is our vision, made possible by the LayerZero protocol that seamlessly connects all blockchains and enables chain-agnostic applications to be built across various blockchains to create a best-in-class user experience. The days of choosing one chain to build on are over; the future is omnichain applications.\u201d\n\nThe issue of securing cross-chain messages has become acute in recent years, as more than $3 billion was stolen from blockchain bridges in 2022, according to a report from Chainanalysis. LayerZero has attempted to solve this problem by using a relayer and oracle to secure messages, where a message is only confirmed if both the relayer and oracle agree that it is valid.\n\nOn January 31, LayerZero received 37.58% of the vote to become Uniswap\u2019s bridge protocol for cross-chain governance between Ethereum and BNB Chain, coming in second behind Wormhole. On March 30, Gnosis announced that LayerZero would integrate with its multi-bridge platform, Hashi, to further increase the security of blockchain bridges."

        "title": "SubQuery Launches Web3 Data Indexing in Ethereum - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Singapore, Singapore, April 5th, 2023, Chainwire\n\nSubQuery, the universal web3 data indexing toolkit, takes a significant step forward with today\u2019s announcement of beta support for Ethereum. Despite being a beta release, SubQuery has already proven to be faster than The Graph, offering Ethereum developers another decentralised alternative upon the impending launch of the SubQuery Network.\n\nSubQuery\u2019s decentralised data indexing solution provides developers with the tools needed to easily organise and query on-chain data for their protocol and applications. Abstracting the backend, SubQuery provides a custom API and lets developers focus on product development and user experience rather than building their own indexing solutions. The latest integration builds on SubQuery\u2019s existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support for other networks including Avalanche, Flare, Cosmos (Ethermint) and Polkadot (FrontierEVM).\n\nSam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, said: \u201cEthereum has been on our radar since day one. Our experienced engineering team has put a lot of hard work into this integration, so that we can guarantee Ethereum developers will have a smooth and seamless experience indexing with SubQuery\u2019s open-source SDK, tools and documentation . We can\u2019t wait to collaborate with teams building on Ethereum with the power of our fast, flexible and universal indexer.\u201d\n\nUntil now developers in the Ethereum ecosystem have had to rely on services such as The Graph for their data indexing requirements. However, with its existing beta support, SubQuery is already 1.85x faster than The Graph for common projects such as the standard Ethereum Name Service project. SubQuery achieves this by using multi-threading and optimisation of the store to reduce costly database writes. With faster sync times, developers can iterate faster and deliver features to market quicker.\n\nSubQuery also brings some major improvements to existing decentralised indexing solutions which include far more flexibility and better controls for developers to run projects in their own infrastructure, plus the ability to support enterprise level projects in its managed service which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles hundreds of millions of requests each day and unlike The Graph, will not be sunsetted.\n\nSince its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. The success in Polkadot spurred SubQuery to integrate with other Layer-1 blockchains to become a truly universal solution, which will also extend to other EVM chains and Layer-2 scaling solutions, like Polygon, BNB, and Arbitrum in future.\n\nSubQuery is currently focused on decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the SubQuery Network. The SubQuery Network will index and service data from projects to the global community in an incentivized and verifiable way and support indexing Ethereum projects, and those from any other supported Layer-1 from the outset.\n\nThe Ethereum integration is currently being tested with a small group of beta projects. If you would like to join SubQuery as an Ethereum launch partner or migrate from The Graph, please reach out to james.bayly@subquery.network.\n\nAbout SubQuery\n\nSubQuery is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Algorand, Cosmos, NEAR, Avalanche, and now Ethereum projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.\n\n\u200b\u200bLinktree | Website | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Matrix | LinkedIn | YouTube\n\nContact\n\nDan Edelstein\n\nPR@marketacross.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This article will show you the best ways to earn Ethereum for free. In this article, we have mentioned the top 10 legit sites to earn Ethereum for free.\n\nCoinApp\n\nAs a geo-mining app, Coin App makes it incredibly simple to make a little money by just running on your phone while you\u2019re out and about. You can earn more money if you drive a lot. If you wish to increase your profits, it also provides more engaging ways to make money.

        "title": "As MicroStrategy Buys Up BTC Tokens, Which Cryptocurrency Could Be Good Investments? A Look At Bitcoin ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "With the software solution provider MicroStrategy buying up Bitcoin (BTC) it underlines the growing institutional investment in cryptocurrency. But it also shows the faith that is held in major cryptos such as Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH) which have dominated the crypto market for the past several years. As we look at what has made these two so successful, we will look at an exciting presale coin Dogetti (DETI), and examine what could make it one of the breakout coins on the market.\n\nBitcoin Is The Oldest And Biggest Cryptocurrency To Purchase\n\nBitcoin tokens were bought in large droves by MicroStrategy, an enterprise data warehouse analytics and reporting tool that provides business intelligence software solutions. MicroStrategy has acquired a lot of Bitcoin, purchasing another 6,455 BTC tokens for approximately $150m across the past five weeks, roughly around $23,238 for every coin.\n\nThe depth of MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin investment underlines why the BTC token remains the largest and most widely used cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nBitcoin trading is popular amongst investors due to the resilience of the BTC token and is the most lucrative coin on the market. Right now Bitcoin trading is around $28,440 per token with a market cap of around $549 billion. The value in deciding to buy Bitcoin is that as the oldest cryptocurrency, it is essentially the gold of the crypto market, and is the most utilised and most trusted.\n\nEthereum Is The Most Trusted Blockchain For DeFi Projects\n\nOne of the most successful cryptocurrencies to date is Ethereum. The second-largest crypto, it has cultivated a reputation of trust, accessibility, and reliability. It might be smaller than Bitcoin, but its blockchain technology surpasses Bitcoin in many aspects and makes its platform a favourite for developers, particularly those in DeFi spaces.\n\nOn top of this, Ethereum is due for a major software upgrade called Shanghai which will allow Ether users to withdraw staked ETH coins freely. It\u2019s believed that with millions of ETH coins currently tied up, this upgrade would be a major boon as they can now stake and withdraw Ethereum tokens freely.\n\nWhat Could Make Dogetti A Successful Cryptocurrency?\n\nThe simplest description of Dogetti (DETI) would be as a crypto mafia dog. It borrows from famous gangster tropes to sell you a pitch on the importance of family and loyalty and regards its members as part of its family.\n\nDogetti\u2019s selling point is in how it embeds its members into what it does. This gives investors a stake in the meme-based cryptocurrency that they may not find elsewhere. It\u2019s reflected in the ecosystem of Dogetti (DETI). Take, for example, its NFT Marketplace which allows Dogetti members to buy, sell or trade digital assets. There is a 6% on transactions and from this 2% is shared among those holding DETI tokens. In addition, its feature DogettiDAO enables members of the Dogetti (DETI) family to have a say on the meme coin\u2019s future.\n\nDogetti (DETI) is appearing to be a potentially lucrative cryptocurrency for investors.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Key Highlights\n\nThe cryptocurrency market posted a bullish performance in March, with Bitcoin leading the way with a 23.03% gain. The cryptocurrency market capitalization gained 10.19%, while the altcoin market gained 2.03%.\n\nFive cryptocurrencies to watch out for in April 2023 are Bitcoin, BNB Chain\u2019s BNB, Ethereum\u2019s Ether, XRP, and Conflux\u2019s CFX.\n\nThe article provides an overview of the performance of each of these cryptocurrencies in March, highlighting key events that impacted their prices and market trends.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space in March, saw it post a bullish performance pushing it into the fourth consecutive month of gain.\n\nDespite the gains seen, the market was crowded with a lot of regulatory and market FUD. However, despite these occurrences, the market still posted a massive bullish performance to end the first quarter of the year.\n\nFlagship cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin, posted a bullish performance, as the rest of the market followed in its trend. It began trading from $23,147.35 at the beginning of the month and ultimately ended the month at $28,478.48, representing a 23.03% gain.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market capitalization in March gained 10.19% for the month, from $1.08 trillion at the start of the month to the end of the month at $1.19 trillion. The cryptocurrency market capitalization traded as high as $1.20 trillion during the month.\n\nThe Altcoin market experienced similar bullishness, gaining 2.03% in March, from approximately $622.1 billion to currently standing at $634.7 billion at the end of the month. During the month, we saw the altcoin market capitalization trade as high as $646 billion.\n\nWith the current bullish trend seen in the market, here is a look at 5 cryptocurrencies investors should watch out for in April 2023:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s BTC\n\nFor Bitcoin, a key point of resistance from earlier in its current halving cycle indicates that the current trading zone represents a major hurdle for bulls to overcome. Should they manage it, price targets extend beyond the $30,000 mark. Matthew Hyland, a crypto analyst, summarized in his latest tweet on BTC that, \u201cBitcoin has been consolidating below the biggest resistance/support of the last 2+ years. A whole new ballgame if BTC breaks it. NASDAQ & S&P went strong into the weekly close. Still, major pessimism and disbelief while major milestones are close to being made for Stocks/BTC.\u201d\n\nPopular Twitter account Byzantine General predicted that a breakthrough of resistance immediately above the spot price would result in a sea of liquidations, leading to further upward momentum. The account tweeted, \u201cIt feels like some bear is very desperately trying to defend the 29k to 30k region. I think that when this level breaks massive liqs will come in. And it does feel like a matter of \u2018when\u2019 not \u2018if\u2019 because there\u2019s zero froth in the market, only some spot supply.\u201d\n\nTo add, according to data from Coinglass, the 23% gain seen in March almost matches its 2021 performance, with 2013 remaining its most volatile. This is relevant because Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory mimics both years, seeing at least three months \u201cin the green\u201d before significant consolidation began.\n\nBitcoin ended the month\u2019s trading at $28,478.48.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s BNB\n\nOn March 27, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, alleging that the company illegally offered crypto derivatives services to Americans and facilitated illicit financial activity.\n\nBNB dropped by over 5.5% to $305 on the announcement day, logging its worst daily performance since Feb. 13, when its price dropped by over 5.8% due to another regulatory crackdown involving Binance-branded stablecoin Binance USD. BNB\u2019s price stabilized on March 28, wobbling between gains and losses as CZ refuted CFTC\u2019s allegations. However, the BNB/USD pair risked falling further if one considers its recent response to regulatory actions. For instance, the New York regulator\u2019s BUSD crackdown in February 2023 preceded a 15%-plus BNB price decline.\n\nBNB ended the month\u2019s trading at $317.04.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether\n\nIn the digital assets space, Ethereum remains the largest smart contract platform, hosting a plethora of financial products, innovation, and automation, with varying degrees of decentralization (generally referred to as DeFi).\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, Ether\u2019s short-term and long-term trends look skewed toward the bulls. Most Ethereum whale cohorts have increased their ETH accumulation in recent weeks, according to the latest data from Santiment. For instance, the supply of Ether held by addresses with a 1,000-10,000 ETH balance (blue in the chart below) has grown by 0.5% in March.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 million-10 million ETH and the 10 million-100 million ETH balance cohorts have witnessed 0.4% and 0.5% rises, respectively. The growth appeared amid what appears to be the absorption of selling pressure introduced by the 100,000-1 million ETH (pink) and 10,000-100,000 ETH address cohorts. At the same time, the growth could be attributed to the network\u2019s proof-of-stake contracts, directly or by using third-party stakers such as Lido DAO (LDO).\n\nThe net Ether deposited at the official Ethereum 2.0 address crossed above 18 million ETH after rising about 3.5% in March. The deposits have grown ahead of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades on April 12, which would enable stakers to withdraw ETH from the PoS smart contract. Currently, this is not possible.\n\nEther ended the month trading at $1,822.02.\n\nXRP\n\nRipple\u2019s chances of winning the court case against the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) improved on March 21 after the presiding judge, Analisa Torres, decided to exclude an expert\u2019s opinion explaining how could be a security. On March 27, another U.S. regulatory move was a blessing in disguise for XRP holders. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the U.S. charged Binance with improper compliance procedures and market manipulation.\n\nThe regulatory body classified Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin as commodities in the filing. Some believe that this classification will extend to XRP as well. Thus, effectively refuting the SEC\u2019s claim of XRP being a security. The market\u2019s expectation of Ripple winning the case against the SEC has pushed XRP\u2019s price to new yearly highs already this month and if Ripple goes on to win the case against SEC, the bullish momentum in XRP will likely continue in the medium to long term. To add, XRP was the fourth largest gainer for March 2023, as it hit a 10-month high.\n\nXRP ended the month\u2019s trading at $0.5385.\n\nConflux\u2019s CFX\n\nConflux (CFX) is a public layer-1 blockchain that was made to power decentralized applications (dApps), e-commerce, and Web 3.0 infrastructure by being more scalable, decentralized, and secure than existing protocols. The protocol makes it easier to transfer valuable assets by making the process quick, effective, free of network congestion, and with low transaction costs. The platform is based on the Tree-Graph consensus mechanism, and it combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithms to achieve consensus. The protocol uses Turing-complete smart contracts written in Solidity, just like those on Ethereum, and is compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).\n\nConflux Network continued its positive run from February, nearly doubling its price in March. The project\u2019s team continued to strengthen its partnerships in China by adding XCMD, the world\u2019s third-largest construction machinery manufacturer, and Zen Spark Technology. The Conflux team also supports the development of permissionless applications. It has established a grants program to promote its ecosystem development.\n\nOver the years, Conflux has earned the reputation of a Chinese enterprise blockchain with partners in Oreo China, McDonald\u2019s China, and Chinese Instagram equivalent Little Red Book. The blockchain also hosts a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese yuan with the approval of the Chinese government, which is highly encouraging given the strict influence of the authorities over state policies.\n\nThe Conflux Network deploys both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms to increase scalability and decentralization. The network processes between 3,000 to 6,000 transactions per second, which is considerably faster than Ethereum\u2019s speed of 15 tps.\n\nWhile Conflux has established partnerships with leading Chinese brands, the activity on the blockchain has yet to justify the 500% increase in CFX\u2019s price rally in the last two months. Data shows that the number of new Conflux addresses and NFTs minted on the platform has stayed at par with previous months with no evident spike.\n\nCFX ended the month\u2019s trading at $0.4134."

        "title": "Ethereum's Upcoming EIP-4844 Upgrade Has Game-Changing Potential, Says Bitwise CIO - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Investments, recently shared his optimism for the future of Ethereum (ETH) and its upcoming upgrades.\n\nAccording to an article by The Daily Hodl published on Tuesday (April 4), during an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Hougan expressed his excitement about the development activity in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly regarding Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844). This upgrade aims to significantly reduce transaction costs, which could unlock many new applications.\n\nHougan said,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s going on in the Ethereum ecosystem and particularly EIP-4844 and how it will quash costs on layer-2 solutions. I think people don\u2019t understand how important that is. They don\u2019t understand the value of a price that\u2019s effectively zero. If you think about the cost of crypto transactions, it has gone from a few dollars on average with spikes into the hundreds to a handful of 20 cents,10 cents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be sub-penny by the end of this year if Ethereum executes on its roadmap. And the applications that open up at sub-penny that aren\u2019t open at 10 or 20 cents per transaction are really enormous. And I know that sounds very theoretical, but I think it\u2019s a game changer. So I\u2019m really excited about that.\u201c\n\nHougan also touched upon the current state of the crypto market and noted that investor confidence is beginning to return. He emphasized that we are in a bull market and expects more people to realize this fact as the year progresses.\n\nAccording to Binance Academy, EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal to enhance the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability. Sharding, a method of partitioning databases into smaller segments, improves efficiency and performance. When applied to the blockchain, specifically Ethereum, it can help lower transaction costs and increase throughput.\n\nDanksharding, a type of sharding proposed for Ethereum, is anticipated to increase Ethereum\u2019s transactions per second (TPS) to around 100,000. To put this into perspective, Ethereum\u2019s base layer processes about 15 TPS, and its layer 2 rollups handle roughly 100 TPS as of Q1 2023.\n\nEIP-4844 serves as the initial step before full danksharding implementation, aiming to increase TPS to approximately 1,000. One of its key features is the introduction of a new transaction type that accepts \u201cblobs\u201d of data, crucial for enabling full danksharding. The implementation of EIP-4844 is expected in the second half of 2023, though it could face delays.\n\nBinance Academy also highlights innovations in danksharding, such as the merged fee market, where a single proposer selects transactions for all shards, and proposer/builder separation to address the issue of maximal extractable value (MEV). These innovations contribute to Ethereum\u2019s potential growth and increased scalability.\n\nTwo months ago, Hougan appeared on the \u201cMaking Money with Matt McCall\u201d podcast, offering insights into the cryptocurrency market and assets investors should consider. He underscored the importance of having both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in one\u2019s portfolio, with Bitcoin being the go-to choice for institutions.\n\nRegarding Ethereum, Hougan praised the ecosystem\u2019s technological progress, with an impressive number of developers and rapidly decreasing transaction costs. He also suggested looking into Cosmos (ATOM) as an exciting alternative to the two major cryptocurrencies, pointing out its potential to drive the market forward in the future."

        "title": "Shiba Inu: Shibarium To Become More Decentralized Than ETH - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Shibarium, the layer-2 scaling solution of Shiba Inu could become more decentralized than Ethereum \u2013 the layer-1 technology on which the Meme Coin is built \u2013 in the future. This is the goal of development firm Unification, which is considered the main developer of Shibarium.\n\nRingoshi Toitsu, a well-known validator of the Unification (FUND) network shared this news on Twitter. In a tweet dated April 5, Toitsu posted a screenshot of an interaction with a community user and the Unification Foundation.\n\nIn the conversation, Unification is addressing the critical issue of the centralization of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) node operations. SHIB\u2019s layer-2 technology will therefore use Unification\u2019s upcoming tool UNODE for decentralized applications (dapps) in the Shibarium ecosystem.\n\nFUND, Unification\u2019s native token will also play a major role. Toitsu explained that FUND will be the only cryptocurrency that UNODE will use. He also declares that UNODE will play an important role for the entire SHIB ecosystem. On Twitter, he wrote:\n\nUnification is now tackling the next major point of centralization for Shibarium operations \u2013 EVM node operations. UNODE\u2019s launch in 2023 offers a more secure and decentralized infrastructure for developers & Dapps \u2013 using FUND as the gas!\u201d.\n\nWhy This Is Of Major Importance For Shiba Inu\n\nNodes are a critical part of the Ethereum infrastructure. For quite some time, there have been discussions about how centralized Ethereum is in terms of nodes. A Messari study found in fall 2022 that over 70% of leading Ethereum applications run on just four centralized node providers.\n\nUnification picks up on this in a blog post, writing that centralized industry incumbents Alchemy, Infura, Moralis, and Quicknode provide the bulk of ETH nodes, creating a vulnerability in the technology stack of decentralized applications.\n\nAlso many are permissioned and identifiable because they require card payments through dapps. Thus, tracking could potentially be turned on at any time, the article notes and further explains:\n\nUnification\u2019s UNODE addresses this Achilles\u2019 Heel, by democratizing, decentralizing, and incentivizing EVM node operations. In accordance with our ethos, this will be pure Web3.\n\nUNODE is scheduled to launch before the end of 2023. This will not only be beneficial for the SHIB ecosystem but will also bring exclusive utilities to the FUND token.\n\nIn addition, Shiba Inu will receive other critical infrastructure from Unification. As Toitsu explained in an interview, Unification\u2019s technology includes the Oracle of Oracles (OoO), a permission-free master oracle that combines data from centralized and decentralized exchanges to provide real-time asset prices.\n\nThe OoO service will be widely integrated into the SHIB ecosystem. This includes ShibaSwap, Shiboshi NFTs, and Shibarium.\n\nRegarding the current development status of the layer-2, Toitsu revealed:\n\nUnification is doing an excellent job with their technology for Shibarium, and no one else can match it. We\u2019re still in an early beta stage with a focus on delegating/staking. People know that BONE is gas, there will be REAL governance, and TRUE SHIB users will be able to earn rewards from using the blockchain.\n\nAt press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00001092, down 3.5% within the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from ShibaSwap, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade / Shapella Hard Fork is here: Report - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum to bring much-awaited Shanghai upgrade / Shapella Hard Fork on April 12.\n\nPeople are ambiguous about its effects on the market.\n\nEthereum is coming up with the Shanghai upgrade on April 12; investors and analysts are ambiguous about the results. Ethereum requires its validators to lock or stake their ETH for the blockchain\u2019s functioning, and they are rewarded with ETH over time. These staked ETHs cannot be un-staked. The Shanghai upgrade would allow un-staking while providing efficiency to the blockchain.\n\nWhat Will Shanghai Upgrade or Shapella Hard Fork Do?\n\nWhen the update goes live, approximately 15% of all Ethereum in circulation shall be available for un-staking. Masses have different thoughts about its possible effect; some feel this could bring a negative influx and drop the value considerably. In comparison, bulls think the Shanghai upgrade would encourage staking.\n\nAfter the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum is expected to reveal \u201csharding.\u201d This would break the larger blockchains into smaller parts; after that, the capacity to handle transactions per second would noticeably increase, with a considerable drop in gas fees.\n\nShapella Hard Fork / Shanghai Upgrade Could Invite Sell-off\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade or Shapella hard fork around the corner, the market seems afraid of the scenario where ETHs deposited on the network have been unlocked in the name of boosting security, which could invite holders for the liquidation of their tokens. Observers feel that the supposed selling pressure could be in billions of dollars.\n\nAnalysts say approximately 1.1 million ETH would come for withdrawal, and Celsius might sell their 158k staked balance to help their bankruptcy process. These two alone amounts to nearly 1.3 million ETH, or around $2.4 billion. Dealing with such intense selling pressure would not be easy for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIs the Phobia Legit?\n\nAlthough people claim impending influx and drop in ETH, the study shed light on the brighter side. Not every staker is expected to un-stake their assets all at once, but still, a partial withdrawal is supposed to take 5 to 6 days, while a full withdrawal is supposed to take anywhere from three weeks to four months.\n\nIn simpler terms, the much-hyped selling pressure force will be distributed in multiple days, where buyers can also match the selling pressure. There is already a fair limit of 16.27 million ETH per day, which could distribute the selling pressure over a longer period. Researchers found that the majority of stakers are, in fact, long-term investors and are not likely to liquidate their holdings.\n\nEthereum Prices are Rising as Shapella Nears\n\nAs the Shapella hard fork is nearing, ETH is experiencing a wave of positive sentiments supported by upward-moving EMA. If the signals from MACD were also towards the north, then chances for a rally would have been great. The price is closer to the supply zone and might enter or consolidate between immediate support present at 1717.77.\n\nSource: ETH/USDT; TradingView\n\nAfter the launch of Shapella, the prices could go either way; if it drops below immediate support, it might enter the demand zone, but a clean breakdown is highly unlikely.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nEthereum token crosses the $1,900 threshold.\n\nETH/BTC sees the largest weekly boost since January 2023.\n\nIt is too early to call for an altseason.\n\nEthereum token ETH on its way to $2K outpacing Bitcoin \u2013 altseason ahead?\n\nYEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s token ETH enjoyed 12% weekly gains, broke the $1,900 resistance, and reached $1,910 in the European session on April 5, year-to-date gains to 60%.\n\nETH eyes a path to $2,000, charts say\n\nNotably, the Ethereum token traded in a technical pattern dubbed the \u2018symmetrical triangle\u2019 from May 2022 to January 2023. The setup entails two converging trendlines with a similar slope. The price action fluctuates between them, retesting the said lines consecutively.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on its way to $2K. Source: TradingView.com\n\nAfter a break in either direction, the symmetrical triangle forecasts a move equal to the maximal triangle height without specifying the bias.

The daily trading volumes have been declining since mid-March, but several other factors point to a bullish scenario:\n\nETH/BTC chart prints consecutive green candles\n\nThe ETH/BTC chart showed a choppy performance year-to-date. However, the Ethereum coin gained a 7% weekly advantage against Bitcoin, the highest weekly achievement since January.\n\nIn retrospect, Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 rally was mainly due to a questionable narrative that projects it as a safe haven against the banking crisis. As a result, BTC outperformed not just Ether but almost all the top-ranking cryptocurrencies amid the collapse of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and others.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s recent success raised speculation that the altcoin season might be approaching.\n\nToo soon to ring Altseason bells\n\nGenerally, altcoin season arrives when 75% of all altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. On the other hand, if Bitcoin beats more than 25% of all altcoins, the market is witnessing a Bitcoin season.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCenter.net, a platform tracking crypto \u2018seasonality,\u2019 the digital asset market left the Bitcoin season, but it is still early to call for an altseason. The platform\u2019s altseason index stood at 27 out of the possible 100.\n\nAltcoin season index at 27.

As of April 5, the leading cryptocurrencies have a $320 billion gap in market cap, which could be difficult to breach. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance reached nearly 20, the largest advance since November 2022."
