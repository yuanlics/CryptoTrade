        "content": "Ethereum is the leading blockchain app platform that was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and went live on July 30, 2015.\n\nThere are many different strands to this project and getting your head around it all can be quite the challenge. That\u2019s why we have put together this comprehensive guide for those of you wondering \u201cWhat is Ethereum?\u201d and \u201cHow does Ethereum Work?\u201d\n\nAs the harbinger of the second generation of blockchains and home to the second largest digital currency in the world, Ether (ETH), the Ethereum project has started a new era of blockchain development that enables a global community of developers to unleash their creativity in the space.\n\nThe ability to craft smart contracts gave developers a chance to think about new use cases for blockchain technology that previously remained largely connected to cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum also gave enterprises, organizations, and startups the ability to issue their own tokens, and build their own unique blockchain ecosystem using the Ethereum framework.\n\nTill date, Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens have been the most popular means for launching Initial Coin Offerings.\n\nOf course, Ethereum is still in development and has faced some hurdles. It has faced problems related to scalability, which was highlighted when the popular game dedicated to internet-bred cats called CryptoKitties managed to clog its network in December 2017.\n\nHowever, with a unique concept, upcoming developments, a strong developer community and the first-mover advantage (second only to the mighty Bitcoin), Ethereum is one blockchain project that continues to remain at the forefront of DLT and crypto development.\n\nSo\u2026 What is Ethereum?\n\nIn a nutshell, Ethereum is an open source Smart contract and Decentralized Application Platform.\n\nThe Ethereum whitepaper describes the project as the next generation distributed computing platform, that provides a decentralized virtual machine known as the Ethereum Virtual machine EVM.\n\nThe latter is able to execute Peer-to-Peer contracts by means of Ether (ETH), its proprietary crypto fuel.\n\nBlockchain technology is used as a tool of shared consensus, while Ether is the digital asset that is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nSince the advent of the Ethereum project in late 2014 and its explosion of popularity within the confines of the nascent crypto space and beyond, Ethereum has always been compared to Bitcoin.\n\nAll being similar to the use of Blockchain as the underpinning technology, both projects are fundamentally different. The main difference between them is the purpose of each one.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin was built as an alternative to regular money. Bitcoin can be used as a medium of value exchange, a means of payment and a store of value with no central authority to issue or control it and no intrinsic value or physical existence.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is rather a platform for developers to build and run Peer-to-Peer executable contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nBlock time generation (seconds in the case of Ethereum and minutes in the case of Bitcoin), the rate at which new coins are mined (constant in Ethereum and halves every 4 year in the case of Bitcoin), the proof of work hashing algorithm (Ethhash in Ethereum, and Sha 256 in Bitcoin), and the total supply (capped to 21 millions in the case of Bitcoin and uncapped in that of Ethereum) are the other differences that set both projects apart.\n\nEthereum Bitcoin Release Date July 30, 2015 January 9, 2008 Release Method Presale Genesis Block Mined Founder Vitalik Buterin Satoshi Nakamoto Blockchain Proof of Work (Will transition to Proof of Stake) Proof of Work Purpose Blockchain app platform, smart contracts & digital currencies Digital Money & store of value Native Cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Algorithm Ethash SHA-256 Block Time 12 \u2013 14 seconds 10 minutes\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is a 256-bit quasi-turning-complete virtual state machine that forms the runtime environment for smart contracts and specifies the execution model for such contracts.\n\nNote: \u201cquasi\u201d in here comes from the fact that computation is intrinsically bounded by a parameter, which is gas. The latter limits the amount of computation done\n\nThe machine is stack based, altogether separate from the main Ethereum Network, and has its own independent storage model.\n\nIn fact, all the nodes on the Ethereum Network run the EVM in addition to validating transactions.\n\nThe EVM could be seen as a testing ground for Smart contracts because once these contracts are deployed to the mainnet, such a step can\u2019t be reversed.\n\nAny developer that wants to build on Ethereum, could deploy his/her untested code on this network of computers and see how it muddles along.\n\nThe most powerful aspect of the EVM is that it can be implemented into various different programming languages. So far, EVM iterations have been deployed in C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Rust, Erlang, WebAssembly and more \u2013 promoting adoption and ensuring all developers can have fair access.\n\nThis is particularly important for interoperability with other blockchains, as it means that any other blockchain could essentially run and iteration of the EVM which could power smart contracts and DApps on their chain, without building a specific virtual machine for their own chain.\n\nBlockchains which currently use or offer versions of the EVM include Telos, Hyperledger Fabric, EOSIO, and others \u2013 and blockchains like Tron use virtual machines which are based on or compatible with EVM.\n\nEther (ETH) and Gas\n\nIn Ethereum each operation or work performed by the network has a cost assessed by the network which is known as a gas limit.\n\nIn order to execute a smart contract, for example, developers need to pay for all the operations featured in their code.\n\nSending Ether from one wallet to another one involves four gas units.\n\nThese gas units are checking your balance, transferring ETH to a receiving address, subtracting ETH from your balance and adding ETH to the receivers.\n\nSo gas units refer to the smallest measurement of work needed to settle a given operation but don\u2019t have a monetary value.\n\nThe cost is paid in Ether. Gas is that unit that translates into Ether.\n\nSince Ethereum can only compute a limited number of gas units at any given time, miners are sort of bribed by network users to pace up the stream of request that is being sent over to the network.\n\nTo pay miners, small fractions of ETH named Gwei are attached to each gas unit, which sets the gas price.\n\nWhat everyone should remember is that the gas price is how much you pay per gas unit, and the gas limit is how much work you are requesting from the network.\n\nSmart Contracts \u2013 What Are They and How Do They Work?\n\nSmart contracts refer to computer codes that facilitate the exchange of value whether it is money, property or content.\n\nThey are called contracts because they translate the terms of an agreement, and smart because they automatically execute themselves once specific triggers are met.\n\nThe notion of smart contracts was around way before the advent of Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nQuick Fact: Nick Szabo a computer scientist, cryptographer, and law scholar, started pioneering work on the concept in 1977, with the aim to establish a distributed ledger for storing contracts.\n\nSimply put smart contracts are just like regular contracts in the real world, where two parties or more agree to specific terms of an arrangement and commit to sticking to it once signed.\n\nThe main difference is that Smart contracts are fully digital.\n\nFurthermore, when running on a Blockchain like the Ethereum Network, a smart contract acts as a self-operating computer code that automatically executes itself once specific conditions are met.\n\nBlockchain-based smart contracts are immutable and would run exactly as programmed once deployed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, reversing, or third-party interference.\n\nOther Blockchains Which Utilize Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contract enabling Blockchains are regarded by many as the \u201creal deal,\u201d this whole Blockchain revolution came up with since its rise to prominence.\n\nPut by Nick Szabo, the blockchain pioneer, himself:\n\n\u201cNew institutions and new ways to formalize the relationships that make up these institutions are now made possible by the digital revolution. I call these new contracts \u201csmart\u201d because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.\u201d\n\nWe crafted a list of ten blockchains, other than Ethereum, that support Smart Contract programming and deployment.\n\nCardano: a project that caught a lot of media attention, and that is allegedly developing a smart contract platform that seeks to deliver more advanced features than its competitors do.\n\na project that caught a lot of media attention, and that is allegedly developing a smart contract platform that seeks to deliver more advanced features than its competitors do.

Other interesting blockchain projects that could play an important role in the future of smart contracts, are Hyperledger Fabric, Lisk, NEO, Qtum, Stellar Lumens, and Tezos.\n\nEthereum Use Cases\n\nSmart contracts make Ethereum flexible, providing it with more real-world use cases than its predecessor Bitcoin.\n\nA combination of smart contracts and dApps keep developers intrigued and users interested in the network.\n\nAccording to ConsenSys, some industries and sectors where use cases for Ethereum can be found include:\n\nBanking and Financial Services:\n\nLarge banks routinely spend more than $200 million per year on cybersecurity. If the servers of a central bank were to go down, you would see the collapse of a country\u2019s payment clearing system.\n\nHowever, if every bank within a payment network instead transacted through a blockchain, there would be no single point of failure.\n\nTherefore, a country\u2019s interbank payment network could be maintained even if multiple servers were to go down.\n\nAlso, because the basic idea behind blockchains- creating a distributed, public and immutable ledger with a never-to-be-tampered with the record of transactions remains the same, the data behind the credit score of a user becomes more reliable for financial companies.\n\nRelated industries like insurance can also be hugely benefitted as they can disburse payments more easily to their customers.\n\nStartups and ICOs:\n\nEthereum empowers startups by letting them launch their own Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\n\nThese tokens, usually created using the ERC20 protocol, help startups in raising the funds needed to realize their goals.\n\nInterestingly, one of the largest crypto exchanges and companies in the world, Binance, used funding generated through the sale of BNB, a coin that follows the ERC20 standards.\n\nEven Tron, one of the largest blockchain projects in the world started out with an ERC20 token offering.\n\nDigital Identities:\n\nSince data and identity theft is such a menace, a smart contract solution is a good fit for this problem.\n\nUsing information hidden behind a dedicated smart contract, users could not only take their identities digital but rest assured that they do not reveal more than what they are comfortable sharing.\n\nServices like uPort allow users to take back control of their identities and share only the information they choose through their mobile devices.\n\nInformation can only be shared upon authentication from the user and the data is always stored safely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSupply Chain:\n\nA major application for Ethereum smart contracts looks set to be in supply chain management where it could benefit both consumers and suppliers through more efficient tracking.\n\nWhether you want to know about the freshness of produce or the origins of the diamonds you bought for your wedding, blockchain-based smart contracts can help to deliver this. The supply chain system of the world is currently broken but not beyond repair.\n\nUsing an extensive network of smart contracts, companies can track their raw materials and the transportation of goods. They can accurately measure their manufacturing processes, related logistics and the process through which a product reaches a consumer.\n\nThe consumer, on the other hand, is provided with reliable information that instantly proves whether a product is fresh, authentic, fair trade, locally produced and more.\n\nOther major industries and applications where Ethereum could find many uses include Real Estate, Law, Oil and Gas, Energy Grid, Government, and Commodity Trade Finance and more as stated by ConsenSys.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Most Popular dApps\n\nHere are some of the most popular dApps that run on the Ethereum blockchain:\n\nCryptoKitties:\n\nThe internet\u2019s obsession with cats knows no bounds and when CryptoKitties was launched, it was evident that there would be more than a handful of interested players.\n\nThe game allows players to buy, sell, collect, and breed digital cats. Each cat is unique and has its own value.\n\nCryptoKitties received widespread attention from the media, the crypto community and the \u201cuninitiated\u201d people who may have never heard about cryptocurrencies and blockchains before when cats on the game started selling for thousands of dollars.\n\nCryptoKitties remains one of the most popular dApps and should be credited for evolving the scope of dApps from \u201cwork\u201d to \u201cplay\u201d while adding value to \u201cdigital asset ownership.\u201d\n\nLocalEthereum:\n\nThe second-generation blockchain cousin of LocalBitcoins, LocalEthereum solves one BIG problem for buyers- removing middlemen from the crypto ecosystem.\n\nYou buy ETH over the counter using smart contracts and escrow services available on the platform.\n\nThe seller\u2019s Ethereum is locked via a smart contract and is released only when they receive the agreed fiat currency from the buyer.\n\nIDEX:\n\nThe IDEX decentralized exchange is considered by some a thing of beauty, especially as it introduces Ethereum users to the idea of giving up on \u201ccentralized exchanges.\u201d\n\nSome of the most popular dApps on Ethereum are decentralized exchanges- they are new, innovative and remove a big hurdle from the world of digital currencies, providing more power to the users.\n\nThe first adopters of IDEX were speculators, and the exchange enables a huge range of Ethereum and ERC20 tokens to be traded and exchanges.\n\nHowever, popular cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin and Tron is not possible.\n\nEthlance:\n\nGiving other freelancing job platforms a run for their money, Ethlance allows users to work on gigs or projects of their choice without paying a hefty fee.\n\nThis could mark the beginning of the end of freelancers having to give away over 20% of their earnings to centralized platforms such as Upwork in \u201cfees\u201d and part with even more dollars to get the money in their local currency.\n\nEthlance, the decentralized freelance hiring platform allows you to work for zero fees. The only payment here is the gas utilized on Ethereum.\n\nUniswap Protocol Part decentralized application and part decentralized protocol, Uniswap provides automated liquidity on Ethereum, for Ethereum-based tokens \u2013 such as ERC20 tokens and certain ERC721 non-fungibles.Uniswap has quickly become one of the most popular apps on Ethereum, and many developers and liquidity providers use the protocol to make trading low market cap tokens easy and simple. Users can integrate Uniswap with Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask, which automatically links users tokens with the Uniswap protocol and lets traders easily swap their tokens for others.\n\nPart decentralized application and part decentralized protocol, Uniswap provides automated liquidity on Ethereum, for Ethereum-based tokens \u2013 such as ERC20 tokens and certain ERC721 non-fungibles.Uniswap has quickly become one of the most popular apps on Ethereum, and many developers and liquidity providers use the protocol to make trading low market cap tokens easy and simple. AAVE One of the most popular decentralized finance (Defi) lending protocols, AAVE has taken the crypto finance world by storm. AAVE is an open-source money market protocol build atop Ethereum, which lets users borrow assets, and lend out their assets in order to gain fixed interest back.AAVE, which means Ghost in Finnish to show the protocol\u2019s transparency, has over $1.8 billion staked with it in assets which include DAI, USDC, TUSD, USDT, BUSD, ETH, BAT, LINK, REP, and a whole host of other popular assets. Users have either a \u2018Deposit APY\u2019, which is the interest that they will earn on their deposited assets and \u2018Variable APY\u2019 which is the amount borrowers pay back into the lending protocol. Many users leverage the AAVE protocol to borrow assets for short-term trading opportunities and to take advantage of market swings.\n\nOne of the most popular decentralized finance (Defi) lending protocols, AAVE has taken the crypto finance world by storm.

Other popular Ethereum dApps include FCK, Kyber, ForkDelta, Etheroll, and more.\n\nPros and Cons of dApps\n\nThe pros \u2013 Here are some of the key benefits of decentralized applications:\n\nFault tolerance \u2013 Systems use redundancy to remove the risk of accidental failure. If one element goes down the network still works, this means applications can run with zero downtime. Attack resistance \u2013 There is no single point of failure, as the applications run on the blockchain. This makes them impervious to denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Tamper & corruption proof \u2013 Applications run precisely as programmed removing the possibility of fraud, censorship or third-party interference. This makes it more difficult for an individual or group to act for its own benefit at the expense of everyone else. No middlemen \u2013 This removes exuberant fees and allows users to interact directly with each other (peer-to-peer). This can lead to greater transparency, trust, and privacy. Open source \u2013 An open-source protocol enables anyone interested in the dApp to collectively contribute to its development for the benefit of everyone.\n\nThe Cons \u2013 Here are some of the negatives of decentralized applications:\n\nSpeed \u2013 Currently the dApps can be quite slow with transactions also taking a long time. Scalability \u2013 The limit on how many transactions can be processed per second might be quite low which limits the dApps scalability. Fees \u2013 While in some ways the \u2018compensating system\u2019 is a benefit, it also means users have to pay each time they use the dApp.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that solutions and new innovations are constantly occurring in the nascent dApp and blockchain industries, so the current \u2018cons\u2019 may well be overcome in the future.\n\nThe DAO Hack\n\nThe DAO was a project that crystallized most of what blockchain technology stood for since its inception, in both its business model and management structure.\n\nIt was created in 2016 by members from within the Ethereum community, notably the Slock.it developer team.\n\nThe DAO was conceived as a form of investor-oriented, stateless, decentralized venture capital firm after raising a record-breaking crowdfund sale of around $150 million worth of Ether in May 2016.\n\nUnfortunately, when things were looking up for the project, it turned out that there was a flaw in its source code, and that flaw was eventually preyed on.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, some hacker(s) exploited a loophole in the DAO smart contract and drained as much as 3.6 million ETH (around $70 million at the time) to a subsidiary account in just a few hours of the attack.\n\nIn fact, the attack was found to be made possible when the hacker(s) realized that the smart contract was mistakenly coded to check the internal balance after sending coins not the other way around.\n\nThe attacker(s) proceeded by requesting funds from the smart contract several times before the smart contract could update its balance.\n\nThe hack marked the beginning of the end for the DAO and had far-reaching consequences on the Blockchain space that are still tangible today.\n\nBesides delisting the DAO token off major exchanges in the months following the hack, and hard forking the Ethereum main chain, the incident caught the eye of regulatory watchdogs all over the world, and put a special emphasis on the necessity of placing the crypto sphere under close scrutiny.\n\nEthereum Classic Fork\n\nIn the wake of the DAO hack, the Ethereum community gathered and debated on the proper actions the foundation should take in order to handle the disastrous situation the hacking incident has cast over the project.\n\nThe community split into two fundamentally opposed groups.\n\nWhile one side suggested a hard fork to contain the hack, reverse it, and send the stolen funds back to their original wallets, the other side strongly opposed the move invoking ideological reasons, and arguing that prevailing with the code and trusting the smart contract under all circumstances, is the philosophy behind Blockchain, and failing to commit to it, could open the door for similar actions in the future.\n\nA vote took place in July 2016 and the decision to implement a hard fork to the Ethereum code and move the stolen Ether away to a new smart contract was agreed upon by a vast majority of the community including co-founders Gavin Woods and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nConsequently, a hard fork occurred on the main Blockchain at height 1,920,000, right before the hacking incident took place.\n\nThe offshoot kept the name Ethereum and named its fuel Ether, ETH.\n\nHowever, the other group, or \u201cthe code is law\u201d advocates, decided to stick with the original chain, which became known as Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Mining\n\nDid you know that Google CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s 11-year-old son mines Ethereum? The young one, Pichai says, understands a lot about cryptocurrency and has corrected him on occasion.\n\nDo you know as much about Ethereum mining as Pichai\u2019s son?\n\nWell if not, don\u2019t worry as we have all the information you need here to boost your knowledge on the subject.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ethereum mining is similar to Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe concept of mining, i.e., giving rewards to \u201cminers\u201d who create new blocks in the network in the form of a native cryptocurrency of the blockchain, is the same.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum blockchain is faster than Bitcoin\u2019s, which means that blocks are created at a faster rate.\n\nIn the Bitcoin Network, a new block is created every 10 minutes while Ethereum achieves the same in 15 seconds.\n\nMiners on the Ethereum network receive ETH tokens along with all the gas contained within their block (gas is the fuel of all Ethereum transactions which manifests as code-processing and transaction fees on the blockchain).\n\nCan You Mine Ethereum With ASIC?\n\nYes, it is currently possible to mine Ethereum with ASIC.\n\nHowever, an Ethereum Core Development meeting recently pushed forward a proposal called \u2018ProgPoW\u2018 that would make Ethereum ASIC resistant.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Nodes Are There?\n\nAccording to Ethernodes.org, the Ethereum mainnet hosts about 8,752 nodes at the moment. However, this figure changes on a daily basis.\n\nOf these, the largest majority of nodes are based in the USA while China, Canada, Germany, the UK, Russia, and more trail quite far behind.\n\nAre These Nodes Full Nodes?\n\nA full node is any computer that enforces all the rules of consensus on the Ethereum network and is connected to it.\n\nA full node must have the entire Ethereum blockchain downloaded on its computer.\n\nBy definition, all miners in the Ethereum network have to be full nodes. However, all full nodes do not have to mine the currency.\n\nThe nodes have a few important functions.\n\nThey have to ensure that all the miners are given the correct block rewards. They must ensure all transactions have the right signatures. They must check that all blocks and transactions are in the right data format. They must make sure there is no double-spending in the blocks.\n\nHow Can I Use Ether (ETH)?\n\nEther is one of the most versatile coins available in the cryptocurrency space today.\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, Ether has many holders.\n\nPer the most recent CoinMarketCap data, Ether is valued at over $15 billion with 104 million coins in circulation currently.\n\nHere are a few of the common uses of ETH:\n\nFor making transactions:\n\nEther can be used as an alternative to using credit cards and wire transfers. However, to make a transaction with Ether both the sender and receiver must have an Ether wallet set up. For cross-border payments, Ether could work to be much cheaper and faster than traditional methods.\n\nFor buying ICO tokens:\n\nWhen participating in token sales, Ethereum is often a popular cryptocurrency of choice. As a large number of Initial Coin Offerings are offered using the Ethereum blockchain, it means that buying tokens from these projects using ETH becomes easier.\n\nFor making purchases in the real world:\n\nSeveral cryptocurrency startups are pushing for the adoption of digital currencies and helping in the installation of PoS machines and other methods that enable purchases using ETH.\n\nFor making digital purchases:\n\nMany websites now accept payment in Ether, and your dApps could also accept ETH payments, enabling you to purchase anything from extra lives in games to subscriptions of a magazine.\n\nFor trading/investing:\n\nEther is one of the most commonly available trading pairs for digital currencies used in exchanges around the world. You can purchase Ether and hold it as an investment or exchange it directly for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Can I Store Ether (ETH)?\n\nOnce you have bought Ether, you will need an Ethereum wallet to store it securely.\n\nYou have the option to use hot wallets, cold wallets, hardware wallets, paper wallets, desktop or mobile wallets. There is one for all platforms; some options will be better suited in comparison to others.\n\nNote: Hot Wallets are connected to and can be accessed on the internet, whereas, cold wallets are very rarely or never connected to the internet. Due to this many consider cold wallets to be more secure than hot wallets.\n\nLet\u2019s look into each option:\n\nHot wallets- exchange wallets:\n\nYou will most likely buy ETH on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These exchanges will provide you with a wallet where you can store your ETH.\n\nExchange hot wallets are easy to use, very simple and it\u2019s usually easy to liquidate your holdings since your coins can be accessed on the exchange\u2019s website.\n\nTherefore, exchange wallets can usually be accessed from multiple devices as long as you have a connection to the internet.\n\nThe problem with these wallets is that they could be more vulnerable to theft than others depending on the security of the exchange and your account.\n\nIf you trade regularly, then this is likely the best and most convenient option.\n\nCold wallets- hardware wallets:\n\nHardware wallets can offer their users extremely strong security when used correctly.\n\nThey are usually USB devices, and the market-leading provider of hardware wallets currently is Ledger.\n\nYou can store your Ether holdings on a hardware wallet for as long as you wish and rest assured that they cannot be reached by a hacker.\n\nJust make sure that you do not lose the device or tell anyone else your passwords.\n\nCold wallets- paper wallets:\n\nPaper wallets are considered the most secure way of storing your Ether safely away from malware and cyber-attackers.\n\nWith a paper wallet, you print your private keys, and Ether addresses and store them in a safe location.\n\nHowever, to many, this can seem like a big inconvenience when compared to using an exchange wallet for example.\n\nAgain, like with hardware wallets, it\u2019s important to keep your paper wallet somewhere safe and never share the information with anyone else.\n\nDesktop and mobile wallets:\n\nAs the name suggests, desktops and mobile wallets can be distinguished based on the devices where they are being used.\n\nDesktop wallets can be more functional, while mobile wallets provide more convenience.\n\nMobile and desktop wallets can usually only be used on the device where they are installed. Therefore, if you lose the device, this will put your funds at risk.\n\nSome mobile/desktop wallets will be specifically designed for storing Ether and ERC20 tokens, whereas some will allow you to hold a wide range of cryptocurrencies together.\n\nWhich Is the Best Ethereum Wallet?\n\nGiven that there is such a wide range of wallet options out there, it begs the question, which ones are best?\n\nWell, to help answer that question, here are some of our handpicked favorites:\n\nHardware wallet \u2013 Ledger Nano S\n\nThe Ledger Nano S squeezes both advanced security and ease of use into one package.\n\nOur guide to storing cryptocurrencies securely on a Ledger Nano S can be found here.\n\nDesktop wallet \u2013 MetaMask\n\nThis simple, easy to install and easy to use browser-based wallet lets you connect to Ethereum and a host of dApps hosted on the blockchain instantly.\n\nMetaMask is a highly popular wallet which has also received funding and support from ConsenSys and Ethereum.\n\nFake versions of this wallet are out there so be sure to download a legit version.\n\nBasic Wallet \u2013 Mist Wallet\n\nIf you are looking for nothing but the bare basics, then the Mist Wallet is the right choice for you.\n\nIt was created by the Ethereum Foundation for a no-frills, no-distraction experience and is listed as the most basic wallet available on ethereum.org.\n\nMulticurrency Wallet \u2013 Exodus\n\nIf you hold numerous cryptocurrencies and want a well-designed wallet that eliminates the need for multiple crypto wallets, then Exodus could be a good choice.\n\nExodus is is fairly popular amongst crypto users and some cool features, including the portfolio feature where you can track your holdings.\n\nWeb Wallet \u2013 MyEtherWallet\n\nMyEtherWallet is one of the most popular Ether wallets out there.\n\nAs a web wallet, it allows you to log in from any device, which does bring some security risks.\n\nHowever, these risks can be mitigated if it\u2019s paired with a hardware wallet such a the Ledger Nano S.\n\nMobile Wallet \u2013 Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is now Binance\u2019s official cryptocurrency wallet, and the app is available to download on both iOS and Android devices.\n\nIt supports Ether and all Ethereum network tokens such as ERC20 tokens, as well as many other leading cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Tron, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and more.\n\nWhere Can I Buy or Sell Ethereum?\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are the most common choice for buying or selling Ethereum.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges can be centralized or decentralized.\n\nThe world\u2019s three largest cryptocurrency exchanges are:\n\nBinance OKeX Huobi\n\nOther prominent exchanges include:\n\nCoinbase\n\nBitfinex\n\nUpbit\n\nKraken\n\nDigifinex\n\nEther is available to buy, sell, and trade on all of these exchanges. As Ether is a leading digital coin, it is available on most cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nDifferent payment methods for purchasing Ether on exchanges include by credit/debit card, with fiat currencies, and with cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. The fees charged by different exchanges will vary and will also depend on the payment method.\n\nOther options include cryptocurrency ATMs where you can buy Ether with cash, trading Ether peer-to-peer on LocalEthereum, and using conversion exchanges like Changelly and Shapeshift to swap fiat-to-ether or crypto-to-ether instantly.\n\nIs Coinbase Safe?\n\nCoinbase is a leading and popular cryptocurrency exchange based in the US. Currently, over 18% of the platform\u2019s volume comes from ETH/USD trades.\n\nFor people using the exchange\u2019s services, Coinbase provides a hot wallet which can be used to store currencies.\n\nCoinbase holds over 98% of its user\u2019s funds offline and takes other security measures, which prevents thefts and hacks from damaging user\u2019s holdings.\n\nAny funds stored online by Coinbase are covered by insurance.\n\nCoinbase also enables two-factor authentication for the users, further protecting them from unauthorized access of accounts.\n\nCoinbase also runs a bug bounty program with an active community of security researchers that help to keep the platform safe.\n\nNone the less, some users still may want to take full control of their security rather than rely on an exchange. If so, using one of the secure methods mentioned above such as a hardware wallet or paper wallet would be a good option.\n\nHow Much Is Ethereum Worth?\n\nAs of December, 2021, the price of Ether currently stands at $2248 with a market capitalization of $274 billion.\n\nIn November and December 2015, Ether traded below the $1 mark.\n\nHowever, a year later, between October and December 2016, Ether\u2019s price was nearing $10.\n\nIn June 2017, prices went as high as $377.56 with market capitalization reaching over $34 billion.\n\non January 13, 2018, the price of Ether reached an all-time high near $1,400, with a market capitalization of $133 billion.\n\nSince then, Ethereum has witnessed a massive sell-offs and tumbling prices in an unwavering bear market.\n\nHowever, like with all markets, a boom and bust cycle exists, and now everyone is waiting for a new bull market, with hopes that Ether could one day make an all-time high again.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions From Big Names\n\nEthereum has caught the attention of many crypto enthusiasts as well as prominent personalities from the traditional finance sector. Some have also made predictions about Ethereum\u2019s price. Let\u2019s look at what they had to say.\n\nJeff Reed considers Ethereum more valuable than Bitcoin:\n\nCrypto author Jeff Reed believes that Bitcoin and Ethereum have little in their way to stop them from becoming alternative currency systems. He said:\n\n\u201cYou can conceivably trade anything using Ethereum, but this is not Ethereum\u2019s strength in comparison to other cryptocurrencies \u2013 they can all do this. It\u2019s rather the computing language that allows the smart contracts to exist that makes Ethereum more valuable than BTC (in my opinion).\u201d\n\nSteven Nerayoff predicted $3,000:\n\nCo-creator of Ethereum, Steven Nerayoff noted that billions of dollars were being poured into the Ethereum ecosystem in Jan 2018, through ICOs. He was vouching for a $3000 price tag on Ether by the end of 2018, but unfortunately, this did not materialize.\n\nNigel Green sticks to $2,500:\n\ndeVere Group CEO Nigel Green suggested that Ethereum could reach $2500 by the end of 2018, followed by further increases in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum is predicted to increase significantly this year, and could hit $2,500 by the end of 2018 with a further increase by 2019 and 2020. This general upswing will be fueled by three mains drivers. First, more and more platforms are using Ethereum as a means of trading. Second, the increased use of smart contracts by Ethereum. And third, the decentralization of cloud computing.\u201d\n\nWho Is the Founder of Ethereum?\n\nRussian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nBREAKING NEWS: I hereby announce that I, Vitalik Buterin, am the founder of ethereum. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 2, 2016\n\nVitalik conceived the idea of Ethereum and released a white paper in 2013 describing in detail its design and rationale.\n\nVitalik had already been interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies since 2011. He co-founded the news website named \u2018Bitcoin Magazine\u2019 where he published hundreds of articles and was also involved with the privacy-focused Dark Wallet project.\n\nIt was during this time that Vitalik came up with the idea of a single blockchain that could be reprogrammed to create custom decentralized applications rather than having to develop a whole new blockchain.\n\nIn January 2014 Vitalik formally announced Ethereum at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami and started working with Dr. Gavin Wood who he went on to co-found Ethereum with.\n\nIn July 2014 they launched a 42-day public sale of Ethereum tokens known as \u2018Ether\u2019 raising more than $18 million, which was the most successful ever crowd sale at the time.\n\nThe Ethereum platform went live and launched a year later on June 30, 2015, allowing developers to start creating and running decentralized applications.\n\nThe Founding Team\n\nApart from Vitalik Buterin, other people were also involved in designing and perfecting the concept of Ethereum.\n\nThe most prominent among them is doctor Dr. Gavin Wood who wrote the \u201ctechnical bible\u201d called Ethereum yellow paper, which outlines the details of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nDr. Joseph Lubin is another prominent name who later built ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based startup focusing on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhen the project was publicly announced in 2014, the core team consisted of Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Lorio and Charles Hoskinson.\n\nHow Can Programmers Use Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a single blockchain with a built-in programming language. It serves as a platform where programmers can create, use and run many different types of decentralized applications.\n\nThis has led to Ethereum being described as \u2018The World Computer\u2019 where just like with conventional computers the potential uses depend in part on the creativity of its users.\n\nTo get started, programmers can start learning more about the foundational concepts of blockchains- decentralization and cryptography.\n\nThey must familiarize themselves with the key feature of the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, as well as other components like GAS, Ether (ETH), and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nProgrammers will also need to learn Solidity, the programming language used for Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Solidity?\n\nSolidity is the programming language used for creating smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Blockchain Council, Solidity is a high-level programming language, and the syntax is similar to the JavaScript scripting language.\n\nSolidity was initially proposed by Gavin Wood in August 2014.\n\nIt was then developed by Gavin Wood, Alex Beregszaszi, Christian Reitwiessner, Yoichi Hirai, Liana Husikyan, and other former Ethereum core contributors.\n\nIt was designed to enable the writing of smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum.\n\nFor programmers who are well versed in JavaScript or C, Solidity will seem relatively proverbial.\n\nWhile Solidity is a fairly new language, there are numerous experts working on it, and there is ample documentation available to help new programmers who want to learn the basics.\n\nEthereum has struggled with some scalability issues which could be a hurdle to the widespread adoption of the platform and Ether.\n\nEthereum wants to overcome these hurdles with Ethereum 2.0, also called the \u2018Casper\u2019 Upgrade. The upgrade was originally expected to arrive in 2019, although there are still many technical hurdles to overcome.\n\nIn August 2020, Ethereum 2.0 developers outlined several issued with the Medalla testnet, which was the first testnet that Ethereum 2.0 community members could use. The first issue was staking participation, which was fairly low \u2013 especially with Nimbus and Lodestar clients failing to verify some blocks and causing a 10% gap in expected staking \u2013 with a 57% staking participation. This number was also lower because some staking participants were offline when the network went live.\n\nIt will include concepts like sharding which is expected to make the blockchain faster and more efficient. We will examine more on sharding later in this article. Once successfully upgraded, Ethereum 2.0 will then start on its journey moving towards Ethereum 3.0 which will provide the network with security against the power of quantum computers.\n\nScaling\n\nScaling could be considered the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Ethereum network; however, a lot of work is being done in the background to try and overcome this.\n\nAs Ethereum is not just a single blockchain, it also allows users to create their own blockchain-based projects on the original Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, over 1400 dApps are running on Ethereum currently which means that the network already has a large number of users and processes millions of transactions.\n\nThe problem begins when the number of apps, projects, and users increases to a level where the Ethereum blockchain nodes are unable to handle the ever-increasing amount of transactions.\n\nIn fact, when the CryptoKitties game on the Ethereum network went viral in late 2017, the network became congested and saw a 600% increase in pending transactions. This surge resulted in the network slowing down and expensive transactions fees, therefore, reducing the usability/viability of Ethereum applications.\n\nThe solutions currently being developed to overcome the scaling issue include:\n\nCasper \u2013 The upgrade that will set to bring about Ethereum 2.0 and move Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake protocol. It is expected to occur in 2019.\n\n\u2013 The upgrade that will set to bring about Ethereum 2.0 and move Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake protocol. It is expected to occur in 2019. Sharding \u2013 Splits up the entire network into separate \u2018shards\u2019. Each independent shard and its allocated nodes can process certain transactions, rather than the entire network processing each transaction, therefore, increasing throughput.\n\n\u2013 Splits up the entire network into separate \u2018shards\u2019. Each independent shard and its allocated nodes can process certain transactions, rather than the entire network processing each transaction, therefore, increasing throughput. Serenity \u2013 A new blockchain system that would be connected to Ethereum. The goal would be to move all the existing Ethereum applications here where they would be \u201csort of folded into a contract on one shard of the new system.\u201d\n\nProof of Stake vs. Proof of Work\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) are two popular types of blockchain consensus mechanisms.\n\nA consensus mechanism is used to verify and validate the information that\u2019s being added to the blockchain ledger. This ensures that there is no double-spending or other invalid data is being added to the blockchain. It also prevents the networks from being harmed through constant forking.\n\nThere are pros and cons to each consensus mechanism, but, they all aim to serve the same purpose. A primary difference between consensus mechanisms is how the verification of transactions are delegated and rewarded.\n\nEthereum currently uses a Proof of Work system, but the Casper upgrade will start the transition of Ethereum to a Proof of Stake system. The new system will also have a penalty system built in to punish malicious actors.\n\nGood Audience state that:\n\n\u201cThe penalty system has the additional benefit of deterring 51% attacks. In a PoW system, a 51% attack is costly but repeatable as long as enough hashing power has been collected. With PoS, the attackers run the risk of losing their stake should the attack fail. In such a case, the only way to relaunch an attack would be to acquire new Ether.\u201d\n\nCasper, Sharding & Ethereum 2.0\n\nThe roadmap to Ethereum 2.0 consists of two combined upgrades, which are Casper and Sharding, as is designed to bring scalability and security benefits to Ethereum. It may take several years for these both to be implemented fully and form Ethereum 2.0.\n\nDespite that Casper and Sharding will be combined to form Ethereum 2.0, both are separate projects that will have different phases and implementation and completion times.\n\nThe Casper protocol is a proof of stake consensus mechanism that forms a major part of Ethereum 2.0 roadmap. With Casper, validators will have to set aside part of their Ether as a stake.\n\nWhen blocks are discovered by validators which they think should be added to the Ethereum blockchain (validated), they will make a bet on it in Ether. If the block is appended to the chain then the validators are rewarded based on their bet sizes.\n\nAs mentioned above it will have built-in mechanisms for punishing malicious actors on the protocol which will ensure that they cannot game the system and that the system remains trustless. Validators acting badly will have their stakes removed.\n\nSharding, on the other hand, will divide the network into separate shards. Each shard will be designated to process specific transactions, which it can do so on its own.\n\nCurrently, the entire network is needed to process each transaction, which is likely an excessive use of the network\u2019s resources. That\u2019s why implementing sharding could significantly increase throughput on Ethereum and enable greater scaling.\n\nThis is how Vitalik Buterin explains sharding:\n\n\u201cImagine that Ethereum has been split into thousands of islands. Each island can do its own thing. Each of the islands has its own unique features, and everyone is belonging on that island, i.e., the accounts, can interact with each other AND they can freely indulge in all its features. If they want to contact other islands, they will have to use some sort of protocol.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s contribution to the blockchain/crypto world is enormous. Ethereum has opened up new possibilities with blockchain through the introduction of smart contracts, decentralized applications, and tokenized economies.\n\nThere is no doubt that Ethereum is still a work in progress. It has some issues, especially those related to scaling and the solutions needed will not just come overnight.\n\nThe future of Ethereum depends on how widely adopted and powerful the network becomes as well as the creativity and talent of the developers who use the platform. Ethereum indeed appears to be heading in the right direction, gaining the attention of many large corporations and institutions.\n\nThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance currently has over 386 members that support and back Ethereum related developments. Members include heavy hitters like Intel, JPMorgan, Microsoft, BP, and even the Indian Government.\n\nNo one can predict for sure what impact Ethereum will have, just like in the 1990\u2019s no one knew how much the internet would impact the world. It\u2019s still early days for Ethereum, but it certainly has the potential to be a revolutionary platform."

        "content": "Leading crypto exchange Bybit has analyzed trader behavior during the wild market swings since 2022. Their asset allocation research explores how different groups shifted holdings across coins, stablecoins, and alt tokens as prices whipsawed.\n\nWith crypto buffeted by crises like Terra\u2019s collapse and FTX\u2019s implosion, traders employed strategies aligning risk profiles and sentiment. However, significant differences emerged between institutions, wealthy individuals, and retail investors.\n\nKey Takeaways from Bybit\u2019s Asset Allocation Analysis report:\n\nInstitutions kept half in Bitcoin and Ethereum combined.\n\nRetail piled into stablecoins, while institutions redeployed them.\n\nBitcoin holdings diverged greatly between groups in September.\n\nEthereum interest waned after an initial spike around the Merge.\n\nAltcoin exposure steadily declined as institutions avoided risks.\n\nInstitutional Players Take Advantage of Chaos\n\nBybit\u2019s data underscores retail traders\u2019 vulnerability in markets increasingly driven by big money. Institutions stuck firmly to blue-chip crypto assets, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as extreme volatility ravaged many altcoins and tokens.\n\nAccording to the report, 45% of institutional traders\u2019 crypto holdings sat in stablecoins as a tempering influence on volatility. Nevertheless, they readily redeployed some of that buffer into what they viewed as relatively safe havens like Bitcoin and Ethereum during periods of optimism.\n\nThis ability to rapidly shift allocation allowed institutions to capitalize on temporary upswings and market green shoots while protecting capital from flash crashes.\n\nIn contrast, retail investors consistently held higher stablecoin levels, with most of their non-stablecoin allocation locked in more speculative plays.\n\nInstitutional investors spiked Bitcoin exposure in September\n\nFor example, when looking at the percentage of their portfolios held in actual Bitcoin, institutions and wealthy traders spiked exposure in September as sentiment improved temporarily.\n\nBut at the same time, retail barely nudged above year-to-date lows in BTC allocation hit during the summer doldrums. Institutions rapidly capitalized on periodic market optimism, while retail traders suffered forced liquidations.\n\nInstitutional investors kept 50% combined in Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAccording to Bybit, outside the 45% stablecoin allocation, institutions kept 50% combined in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBybit also noted plunging interest in altcoins around Ethereum\u2019s major Merge upgrade. Institutions barely nibbled other tokens despite occasional retail trader surges.\n\nEthereum holdings have dropped since Shapella\n\nEarlier this year, the percentage of ETH holdings increased in anticipation of Shapella. However, despite Ether maintaining a stable price after Shapella in April and May, the rate has declined across most traders. An unusual surge in the holding percentage of institutional investment in Ethereum has been observed since September.\n\nNature of stablecoin holdings\n\nHistorical patterns indicate that during bullish markets, retail traders tend to reduce their stablecoin holding percentage. Conversely, in directionless or bear markets, they tend to increase it.\n\nIn contrast, INS holders display a decrease in stablecoin percentage during bearish markets and an increase in bullish markets, suggesting adept market timing by institutional investors.\n\nSeptember witnessed a notable drop in stablecoin holding percentages, coinciding with a significant rise in BTC and ETH holding percentages.\n\nThe report comes at a time when Bitcoin and Ethereum are surging in value in comparison to the past 18\u201319 months. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin is up by 144% year-to-date and 19.7% in the last 30 days. BTC briefly surpassed the $42,000 level before falling to its current price of $41,508.\n\nEthereum is not far behind, as it has surged by 76.2% year-to-date. ETH is up by 21.3% in the last 30 days and has breached the $2,200 level after quite some ups and downs. However, it remains uncertain as to whether this is the beginning of another bull market or just any other sell-the-news event in anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF."

Over the weekend, the second-largest digital asset by market cap surged nearly 10%, extending the momentum it gained over the last month.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,248.11, up 3.91% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nIn a quote shared with AMBCrypto, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst of Bitget Research, ascribed the latest upswing to strong expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cGiven the potential for a recession in the U.S. economy, fund managers are predicting an 80% consensus level for a trend of interest rate reduction in 2024, marking the highest consensus level ever recorded. The crypto market has already factored in this positive news.\u201d\n\nAdd to this, the enthusiasm around spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was reaching a fervor pitch. The number of spot Ether ETF applications submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rose to seven in November.\n\nBig expectations from ETH\n\nIt was but natural for investors to be optimistic about ETH.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) dated the 3rd of December, crypto technical analyst Ali Martinez predicted that ETH could move to $3,500, provided the weekly candlestick closed at $2,150.\n\n#Ethereum | If $ETH secures a sustained weekly candlestick close above $2,150, the path might be set for an exciting uptrend.

Previously, as many as 5.85 million addresses bought 43.8 million ETH in this range, indicating a probable surge in purchasing in the days ahead.\n\nWill profit-taking interrupt the flow?\n\nHaving said that, the momentum could be stemmed if traders decide to lock in gains. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Glassnode\u2019s NUPL metric, all holders would make profits if they sold their assets at the time of writing.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAMBCrypto digged in further using Santiment\u2019s MVRV ratio. It came to light that all holders stand to gain 7.73% if they sell their holdings at the prevailing price.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if holders allow ETH to ascend or make some money after a challenging bear market."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSolana founder Anatoly Yakovenko has denounced the Ethereum killer narrative.\n\nYakovenko said he thinks Ethereum will eventually have enough bandwidth for all of Solana\u2019s data.\n\nSolana-Ethereum interoperability has benefits for Web3 users and developers.\n\nIn recent years, the idea that upstart \u201cEthereum killer\u201d blockchains will be able to replace the world\u2019s most preeminent smart contract platform has faded away, replaced by new accounts of the technology emphasizing coexistence in place of cutthroat competition.\n\nNow, even the Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko has denounced the ETH killer narrative as \u201clame.\u201d Stating that he doesn\u2019t anticipate a future in which Solana thrives while Ethereum dies, Yakovenko pointed to technology upgrades that could enhance interoperability between the 2 platforms instead.\n\nAdvances in Blockchain Technology\n\nIn a post on X, Yakovenko suggested that Ethereum upgrades hold the key to bringing the 2 technologies closer. \u201cI am certain that eventually danksharding will have enough bandwidth for all of Solana\u2019s data,\u201d he said.\n\nThrough protocol upgrades planned for the years ahead, \u201cdanksharding\u201d refers to an emerging Ethereum technology designed to scale its capacity that could accelerate Web3 innovation in the months and years ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nIf, as Yakovenko believes, Ethereum can one day house all of Solana\u2019s data, what would be the point in doing so?\n\nFrom DeFi to NFTs and beyond, the notion that Ethereum is here to stay has been vital for its success. Other blockchains may be more efficient, but none can compete with Ethereum\u2019s network effect and expected staying power. Embracing Ethereum interoperability could therefore help Solana and others like it endure too.\n\nBenefits Of Interoperability\n\nWith Solana\u2019s founder even abandoning the Ethereum killer myth, Solana-Ethereum interoperability holds enormous promise for Web3 builders and developers.\n\nAlready, new platforms like NeonEVM are realizing the kind of \u201coverlapping features\u201d described by Yakovenko. Launched this year to bring Solana\u2019s superior processing power to Ethereum smart contracts, for decentralized app (dApp) developers, NeonEVM promises the best of both worlds.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f NEW WEBINAR ALERT \u26a1\ufe0f In this episode we take a deep dive into blockchain interoperability \u2013 and who else better to discuss this topic with than our friends at @deBridgeFinance ! Take a look! \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/bS8jVm6WtE \u2014 Bware Labs (@BwareLabs) November 29, 2023\n\nTo bridge assets between the two blockchains, NeonEVM utilizes the decentralized interoperability layer deBridge. As CEO Alex Smirnov explained to CCN, for users, blockchain interoperability means they can browse Web3 \u201cwithout the need to think about the underlying infrastructure.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum price jumped above the $2,100 level and cleared $2,200. ETH is gaining pace and might surge further above the $2,220 level.\n\nEthereum is showing a lot of positive signs and recently cleared the $2,200 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $2,190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its rally if it clears the $2,220 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 5%\n\nEthereum price remained well-bid after it settled above the $2,000 level. ETH gained bullish momentum and cleared the $2,120 resistance. The bulls even pumped it above the $2,200 level, like Bitcoin above $40,000.\n\nA new multi-month high was formed near $2,229 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,147 swing low to the $2,229 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $2,190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,220 zone.\n\nThe first key resistance is near the $2,250 level. The next resistance sits at $2,320. A clear move above the $2,320 level could send the price toward the $2,450 resistance zone.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance is near $2,500, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,650 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,800 level.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,220 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,190 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $2,165 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,147 swing low to the $2,229 high. The main support is now near $2,120. A downside break below $2,120 might start a steady decline. The key support is now at $2,050, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $2,000 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,165\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,220\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Weekend - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a weekend it has been in the crypto world. Three of the world's largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC 1.36%), Ethereum (ETH 0.93%), and Dogecoin (DOGE 4.39%), have seen impressive rallies, with a few key psychological thresholds broken through. As of noon ET, these three tokens are up 5.8%, 6.4% and 6.4%, respectively, since Friday at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nGiven the rapidly changing economic backdrop and volatility we've seen in everything from bond yields (discount rates) to alternative asset prices, it's wroth diving into what's catalyzing these moves today.\n\nWhat's driving this rally?\n\nBitcoin's rally to more than $42,000 per token in early trading this morning represented the largest level the megacap cryptocurrency has seen since early 2022. Interestingly, this move in Bitcoin has been correlated to a surge in the price of spot gold, which recently broke through a record high of $2,100 earlier today, as investors appear to be increasing their bets that inflation could pick up.\n\nSinking bond yields and heightened geopolitical concerns appear to be driving investors to alternative assets, such as Bitcoin, propping up the entire sector today. Additional interest continues to form around Bitcoin due to its upcoming halving event, which is anticipated to take place in 2024, as well as capital inflows from incoming spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe direction Bitcoin moves often informs how Ethereum performs on a given day, and certainly some of Ether's recent rise can be attributed to this bullish narrative forming in alternative assets. However, Ethereum has also benefited from some token-specific catalysts worth pointing out. Most notably, Mantle has rolled out a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum's main network, suggesting that the Ethereum staking markets could become more decentralized. Ethereum's price has surged above $2,200 per token at the time of writing, marking a high not seen since mid-2022 as well.\n\nFinally, Dogecoin's rally appears to be closely correlated to the broader move in the overall sector, with speculators and traders continuing to focus on this meme coin as a way to play the crypto sector's momentum in either direction. This correlation can be seen in the liquidation data for Dogecoin, with roughly $2 million of perpetual futures contracts liquidated yesterday, one of the largest spikes we've seen in recent months.\n\nAre these cryptos worth buying into at year end?\n\nFor investors seeking diversification or are particularly interested in hedging some of their equity exposure with alternative assets, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain top of mind (in addition to gold, of course) as ways of both generating better alpha (higher returns) during bull markets, and potentially providing some downside protection via these assets' lower beta (lower correlation moves) in down cycles.\n\nThat said, the 2022 bear market highlighted some of the risks of putting cryptos in the same bucket as other alternative assets. Gold and other commodities performed much better than crypto last year, so betting on these digital assets as any sort of hedge against uncertainty is still a strategy that's unproven (considering the world's first crypto, Bitcoin, was conceived post-great financial crisis).\n\nOverall, these three tokens certainly appear to reflect a growing consensus that some sort of soft-ish landing is ahead. While I'm not as certain as many of the top economists and talking heads that such a landing can be achieved, it's possible. And for those looking for a way to ride any positive momentum right now, these three assets are certainly in high demand.\n\nI'm remaining cautious on crypto until there's more clarity, but I can also certainly see why investor positioning is favoring these assets right now."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's (ETH) market indicators are presenting a rare confluence of bullish signals, suggesting the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be poised for a significant price surge. There are three key data points that might become a foundation for a new rally.\n\nInstitutional pivot: ETH Futures gain traction\n\nThe first sign comes from the futures market, where ETH's performance on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is turning heads. Ethereum futures are now trading at a 5% premium compared to Bitcoin's basis, a notable shift in institutional focus.\n\nInteresting to see the futures basis for ETH on CME is now trading at a 5% premium to the basis for BTC and open interest for ETH on CME is now starting to pick up after lagging BTC.\n\n\n\nEarly signs of tradfi starting to rotate into the ETH ETF trade? pic.twitter.com/o12EXjWsmZ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) December 4, 2023\n\nMoreover, open interest in ETH on the CME has seen an uptick, starting to outpace BTC after a period of lagging. This shift could indicate growing interest from traditional finance (TradFi) investors in Ethereum, potentially as a reaction to the burgeoning ETF market for ETH.\n\nBullish technical outlook on ETH charts\n\nThe provided price chart offers a bullish technical outlook for Ethereum. A closer analysis reveals a strong uptrend, with ETH's price action forming higher highs and higher lows \u2013 a classic indicator of bullish momentum. The moving averages have aligned in a way that typically precedes bullish conditions: the 50-day moving average is well above the 200-day moving average, and the price is currently trading above both, confirming a \"golden cross\" formation. This technical pattern often attracts further buying from momentum traders, reinforcing the positive trend.\n\nDeFi as catalyst amid BTC's potential correction\n\nLastly, the potential for a correction in Bitcoin's (BTC) price may drive investors toward Ethereum, particularly as the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector gains more traction. Ethereum is the foundational platform for DeFi applications, and as this industry grows, ETH is likely to benefit from increased utility and demand. This, combined with a possible redistribution of capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum, could provide the necessary fuel for Ethereum's price growth."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the 45-day comment period on a proposed rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to an SEC filing released on Dec. 5th.\n\nNYSE Arca originally submitted the proposed rule change to the SEC on October 10th of this year. Typically, the SEC has 45 days from the publication of the proposal in the Federal Register to make a decision, but the regulator has opted to extend this timeline to January 25th, 2024, in order to take more time to consider the implications.\n\nThe proposed rule change would allow the $5 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust, one of the largest institutional investment vehicles for Ether, to convert into a spot ETF. Unlike the current trust structure, which does not allow redemptions, an ETF would provide more liquidity and could eliminate the long-standing discount at which the trust has historically traded compared to the net asset value of its underlying Ether holdings.\n\nGrayscale has stated that they see conversion to an ETF as \u201cthe natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution,\u201d bringing Ethereum further into the regulated financial system. However, the SEC has yet to approve a spot crypto ETF in the U.S., having delayed decisions on several Bitcoin ETF applications earlier this year.\n\nETF mania\n\nThe extended timeline for an SEC decision comes as other major financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock have filed their own proposals for spot Ethereum ETFs over the past month. The SEC also recently opened a comment period to solicit public feedback on Fidelity\u2019s filing.\n\nWhile institutional interest continues to grow, the SEC has maintained a cautious stance, pushing back decisions and calling for more comments to fully assess market manipulation risks, surveillance mechanisms, custodial qualifications, and other factors related to the crypto asset class.\n\nWith the Grayscale decision likely to come in early 2024, all eyes are on the SEC to see whether it finally gives the green light to accessible, regulated crypto investment vehicles in the U.S. markets."

In terms of where we are this cycle, you can just see it.\n\nYou might also like: Analyst sees potential XRP breakout\n\nThe analyst explained that similar price spikes have occurred in past market cycles, only to be followed by sharp pullbacks. The analyst says he would not be surprised to see Bitcoin revisit lower support levels around $30,000 to $35,000 in the coming weeks.\n\nThe analyst highlighted some key differences with this market cycle, including growing institutional interest and the possibility of SEC approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF in 2023. In his view, these developments could fuel dramatically higher prices both before and after Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event in spring 2023.\n\nThe analyst remains upbeat on the long-term outlook, stating multiple times that he expects this bull cycle to bring \u201cthe most fun we\u2019ve ever had\u201d tracking the crypto markets. For now, though, he preaches exercising patience and discipline amid the volatility.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Developers have a new way to build social logins into blockchain applications following a partnership between smart contract wallet Safe and Web3Auth.\n\nThe tool, SafeAuth, combines Web3Auth\u2019s social login technology with Safe\u2019s Account Abstraction software development kit (SDK)\n\nSmart accounts were introduced via the ERC-4337 standard, built to improve the general Ethereum user experience through more intuitive and customizable crypto wallets.\n\nSafeAuth enables users to set up smart wallets using an existing email address, removing the need to remember lengthy seed phrases.\n\nThese smart accounts will also be interoperable, meaning that users will be able to link and interact with different blockchain applications through a single smart account.\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard was deployed to Ethereum mainnet in March and data shows adoption has remained relatively slow, with weekly retention of smart wallets that use ERC-4337 dropping to as low as 1% for accounts older than five weeks.\n\nLukas Schor, a Safe co-founder, told Blockworks this should not be surprising as adoption often takes longer than people wish.\n\n\u201cThe ERC-4337 standard is still in \u2018draft mode\u2019 and occasional changes \u2026 are still happening, making it harder for in-production solutions to adopt it,\u201d Schor said.\n\nSchor said that ERC-4337 also introduced additional smart contract risk, meaning it may take time for larger applications and wallets to opt in.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the primary use-case for ERC-4337 is sponsored transactions for \u2018free NFT drops\u2019 or similar applications; we are still missing applications to leverage more complex features of accounts abstraction like recovery or sessions keys,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 Account Abstraction Smart Contract is Live\n\nTobias Schubotz, Safe\u2019s product lead, shared optimism about the future of smart accounts. He said Safe itself has seen a 201% increase in monthly average users, now totaling more than 376,000.\n\n\u201cThis indicates that Safe is being adopted faster than the overall crypto space, suggesting a growing interest and potential for smart accounts in the broader blockchain ecosystem,\u201d Schubotz said.\n\n\u201cAt the core of this solution is adaptability, users can choose additional authentication, such as multiple email addresses, as they deem necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilar to how one might employ a social login or email for various online platforms, SafeAuth offers a unified access method.\u201d\n\nSchubotz added that developer tooling such as SafeAuth can also assist in increasing the adoption of smart account standards such as ERC-4337.\n\n\u201cBy offering an SDK that enables developers to seamlessly integrate a social login feature into their platform, Safe is further encouraging the adoption of smart accounts,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum price is gaining pace above the $2,200 resistance. ETH is up over 8% and might continue to rise toward the $2,500 resistance in the coming days.\n\nEthereum is gaining pace and recently surpassed the $2,250 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its rally if it clears the $2,275 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Follows Bitcoin\n\nEthereum price started a strong increase above $2,000, like Bitcoin. ETH cleared many hurdles near $2,120 to enter a positive zone. The price even surged above the $2,200 level to set the tone for a larger increase.\n\nA new multi-month high was formed near $2,275 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,148 swing low to the $2,275 high. However, Ethereum is still trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,250 zone.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,275 level. A clear move above the $2,275 zone could send the price toward the $2,320 level. The next resistance sits at $2,350. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nAre Dips Limited in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,250 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,220 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next key support is $2,175 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,148 swing low to the $2,275 high. The main support is now near $2,150 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A downside break below $2,150 might start a steady decline. The key support is now at $2,080, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $2,020 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,175\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,250\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a resurgence, marking its best performance since May 2022. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading digital assets, have breached significant price levels. Bitcoin [BTC] surpassed $41,000 and Ethereum [ETH] reached $2,200. The cumulative effect of this rally has elevated the total crypto market cap to an impressive $1.54 trillion, setting a high for 2023. Amidst this fervor, institutional investors are playing a crucial role in shaping the market dynamics.\n\nSource: ETF Trends\n\nBitcoin Dominance and Institutional Enthusiasm\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2023, institutional traders have exhibited a notable increase in their Bitcoin holdings, nearly doubling their positions. By September, half of their assets were denominated in Bitcoin, a trend driven by positive market sentiment and heightened anticipation regarding the potential approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This stands in stark contrast to the lower Bitcoin holdings observed among retail traders, a phenomenon possibly attributed to their higher leverage levels, as highlighted by Bybit\u2019s research.\n\nAltcoins Face Institutional Skepticism\n\nThe same report from Bybit Research suggests that institutional traders and large holders of Bitcoin, commonly referred to as whales, are adopting a skeptical stance toward altcoins. Despite a brief surge in altcoin holdings in May, there has been a general decline in these assets, particularly since August. This decline is more pronounced among institutions, signaling a cautious approach toward the inherent volatility associated with altcoins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Rollercoaster Journey\n\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has witnessed fluctuating fortunes. Data reveals a consistent decline in Ether holdings since the Shapella upgrade of the Ethereum network. However, a noteworthy exception occurred in September, when institutional traders displayed renewed interest, coinciding with positive market sentiment surrounding ETF news. Despite this, the overall trend indicates a decrease in Ether holdings.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Back To Spotlight Amid Ethereum\u2019s Poor ETF Performance\n\nComparing Performance: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum\n\nThe year-to-date performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum paints an interesting picture. The Bitcoin price has surged by approximately 140%, showcasing its resilience and attractiveness to investors. In contrast, Ethereum has experienced an 87% increase, reflecting a robust but comparatively less spectacular performance.\n\nIn an October report, K33 Research conveyed a significant shift in asset allocation stance, advising a pivot back to Bitcoin. This shift was influenced by Ethereum\u2019s prolonged slump against Bitcoin since July 2022 and a lukewarm response to the newly launched futures-based Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: ETF Rally: Ethereum is a Better Buy Than Bitcoin, Analyst Says\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing a dynamic interplay of factors, with institutional investors taking center stage. While Bitcoin enjoys heightened institutional enthusiasm, Ethereum faces headwinds amid fluctuations and a changing market sentiment. The cautious approach towards altcoins further underscores the complexities inherent in navigating the diverse cryptocurrency market. As institutional players continue to shape the trajectory of the crypto space, their preferences and sentiments will likely have a lasting impact on the broader market dynamics."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Bull Run Continues Beyond $2,200 \u2013 Is a $10,000 ETH Possible in 2024?\n\nThe Ethereum price has dipped by 2% in the past 24 hours, falling down to $2,207 as the wider crypto market slips by 0.5% today.\n\nYet ETH has had a good week overall, with the altcoin remaining up by 9% in the last seven days and also by 17% in the last 30.\n\nThese gains provide it with enough ongoing momentum to produce further rallies in the next few days and weeks, with ETH likely to be one of the main beneficiaries of an expected end-of-year rally.\n\nAnd when combined with its enviable fundamentals, ETH could potentially reach new highs in 2024.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Bull Run Continues Beyond $2,200 \u2013 Is a $10,000 ETH Possible in 2024?\n\n\n\nAtheneum\u2019s chart continues to look bullish, even with today\u2019s little misstep.\n\nIts 30-day average (yellow) is still racing further above its 200-day (blue), implying that the altcoin remains in the middle of a medium-term uptrend.\n\nSimilarly, its relative strength index (purple) remains close to 70, a level which indicates ongoing buying pressure that\u2019s likely to keep pushing up the coin\u2019s price.\n\nJust as bullishly, ETH\u2019s support level (green) has been climbing steadily ever since the middle of October, meaning that if the coin is to lose ground at any point during the current rally, any dips are likely to be small.\n\nAnd compared to September and early October, ETH\u2019s trading volume is extraordinarily healthy, standing at about $30 billion, in contrast to levels as low as $3 billion.\n\nThis makes ETH the most-traded non-stablecoin alt in the market, implying that it\u2019s likely to benefit from an expected end-of-year rally more than most other altcoins.\n\nSomeone has to say it. ETH price at $2.2k is hilarious. Everyone out here trading \"what ifs\" this cycle when Ethereum has fundamentals. Let my tell you why $2.2k ETH is stooopid. Ethereum now makes $2.7 billion in annualized profits \u2013 the only profitable chain \u2013 a P/E ratio\u2026 \u2014 RYAN S\u039eAN ADAMS \u2013 rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) December 4, 2023\n\nIndeed, ETH\u2019s fundamentals remain unparalleled among the vast majority of tokens, with the Ethereum blockchain accounting for 56% of the entire sector\u2019s total value locked in.\n\nOn top of this, Ethereum has enjoyed some highly significant adoption news this year, with PayPal launching its own Ethereum-based stablecoin and with Coinbase releasing its own Ethereum layer-two.\n\nThis all points to a steadily rising Ethereum price over time, with the altcoin set to hit $3,000 in the next couple of months.\n\nOther Altcoins With High Growth Potential\n\n\n\nAs reliable as ETH remains as a major token in the market, it isn\u2019t the only coin with potential right now, with some traders even likely to prefer newer coins set to enjoy early growth spurts.\n\nSuch coins include presale tokens, which can often generate enough momentum during their sales to enjoy big listings on exchanges.\n\nOne new coin likely to do this is Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $2.5 million in its presale.\n\nWhat's the aim of the #BTCETF #Token? This #BitcoinETF token, operating as an ERC-20 token, commemorates the anticipated introduction of #Bitcoin ETFs into the American financial markets. \ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/nybwFgMwwH \u2014 BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) December 5, 2023\n\nAs the tweet above indicates, Bitcoin ETF Token has distinguished itself with some novel tokenomics, which are linked to the progress of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn particular, the coin will burn 25% of its total supply over time, with 5% tranches being burned whenever Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs reach certain milestones.\n\nAccordingly, Bitcoin ETF Token will process its first 5% burn when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF reaches a volume of $100 million.\n\nIts final burn will come when the BTC price reaches $100,000, with the token also featuring a transaction burn tax that will decline over time.\n\nTo join the coin\u2019s presale, investors can simply go to the official Bitcoin ETF Token website and connect their software wallets, such as MetaMask.\n\nThey can currently buy BTCETF at a price of $0.0062 per token, although the sale will up this price in just under a day.\n\nAnd it\u2019s likely to rise even higher once the token lists on trading platforms, especially when its deflationary mechanisms kick in.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Indicators Signal Imminent Price Rally: Details - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) could be looking to register a more substantial price rally, as signals from its daily and monthly indicators suggest an imminent price upswing.\n\nThe asset\u2019s latest uptrend began on the back of Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation, as the leading asset moves to conquer the $42,000 psychological price territory. ETH, whose price action correlates with Bitcoin\u2019s, has recorded similar price gains, helping it to reclaim the $2,200 price level for the first time since last May.\n\nThe journey to the reclamation of this lofty price position was not without hurdles. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s latest price momentum picked up the pace at the end of November after it recovered the $2,000 level in mid November. ETH had continued to face resistance at $2,000 until it flipped it into support on Nov. 30.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe asset then began December with a favorable outlook, looking to conquer the resistance points above $2,000. Its mission has been largely successful with less than a week into the new month. ETH turned $2,100 into support on Dec. 2 and used this point as a launchpad to reclaim $2,200.\n\nIndicators Signal a Potential ETH Surge\n\nNow, it looks to solidify its position above $2,200, currently changing hands at $2,204. Amid these bullish prospects, ETH\u2019s technicals are looking good, adding weight to sentiments surrounding a continuation of the bull run and an imminent price surge.\n\nOne of these indicators is the 21-day EMA, which Ethereum recently broke above. Notably, breaking above the 21-day EMA is a sign of a looming price upswing. The last time ETH broke and closed above the 21-day EMA was on March 11.\n\nThe asset eventually soared 51% to $2,140 in April, a new yearly peak at the time. With Ethereum now trading above the pivotal moving average for the second time this year, it has never been in a better price position.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA second indicator of Ethereum\u2019s favorable position is its price above the 50-day EMA ($1,958) and 200-day EMA ($1,807). Currently trading for $2,204, ETH is way above these moving averages, signaling bullish momentum in the short and long terms. In addition, the 50-day EMA recently crossed above the 200-day EMA, marking a golden cross.\n\nGrowing Buying Interest\n\nMoreover, on the monthly timeframe, things are also looking good for Ethereum. Despite the recent price surge, the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in a fairly stable position, currently at 55.\n\nAn RSI of 55 during an uptrend suggests a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. It indicates that the upward price movement is steady without being excessively overbought, providing room for further upside potential. This reading suggests a healthy trend with the possibility of sustained buying interest in ETH.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum whales have shown an affinity toward the asset of late, with buying interest on the high side. IntoTheBlock recently confirmed that the percentage of ETH supply held by whales has increased to 35%. This rate was 22% in January."

        "content": "Ethereum has exploded through critical resistance levels in recent days, surging over 9% in the last week to peak above $2,250. The powerful rally comes as on-chain data reveals a frenzy of accumulation between $1,900-$2,100, leading analysts to believe this zone will now become the support floor for Ethereum\u2019s next leg up.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum price surged past $2,200, up over 9% in the past week\n\n43.8 million ETH were purchased between $1,900-$2,100 recently per on-chain data\n\nThis price zone could now become a support level per analyst Ali Martinez\n\nNext key price targets for Ethereum are $2,600, then $3,000\n\nSolana also seeing bullish momentum, up 13% past week and 236% past 3 months\n\nAccording to data aggregation site IntoTheBlock, 43.8 million ETH were scooped up by 5.85 million addresses within the narrow price channel between $1,900 to $2,100 in recent weeks. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests this intense period of accumulation will turn the price range into a solid support zone for Ethereum moving forward.\n\nThe rally has already powered Ethereum past the $2,150 threshold needed to confirm the bull market is back in full swing according to Martinez\u2019s previous analysis. With prices consolidating above $2,190 and bullish sentiment surging across crypto markets, analysts eye the next key price levels for Ethereum at $2,600 and then $3,000 in short order.\n\nFueling optimism around Ethereum is the parabolic trajectory of so-called \u201cEthereum killer\u201d Solana, which has gained over 236% across the last three months. Solana recently passed $64 and could be establishing a new price floor in the $50 range. The stunning Solana breakout may ignite a similar euphoria around Ethereum as investors pile back into the smart contract platform.\n\nBitcoin also crossed over the momentous $40,000 mark this week after adding 11% across the last seven days. Some analysts attribute Bitcoin\u2019s rise to building anticipation around the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US. An SEC decision could set the stage for billions in institutional inflows. But regardless of the catalyst, the reawakened bullish exuberance appears to be spilling over to the wider crypto sphere.\n\nWith Ethereum trending upwards after its decisive move past $2,000, piercing above $2,600 would firmly signal the next bull market is underway. A subsequent breach of $3,000 would confirm the breakout as Ethereum vies to surpass its all-time high near $4,850. For crypto investors, this week may mark the turning of the tide back into a rising sea of green."

        "content": "Today AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) said it purchased a \u20ac5 million tokenized green bond issued by Societe Generale using the CoinVertible for settlement. That\u2019s a stablecoin issued by Societe Generale FORGE. The transaction on the public Ethereum blockchain is part of a new joint experiment. In July AXA IM was a judge in SocGen Forge\u2019s tokenization hackathon.\n\nCoinVertible isn\u2019t designed as an average stablecoin, but instead for institutional usage. As in this case, there\u2019s a need for trusted on-chain settlement assets.\n\n\u201cThe aim of this initiative, carried out in collaboration with Societe Generale \u2013 FORGE, was to enable us to experiment the use of a stablecoin as a settlement asset to purchase a digital bond,\u201d said Laurence Arnold, Head of Innovation and Strategic Initiatives. \u201cOur ultimate objective is to optimise our existing processes by adopting the most advanced technologies, so we can offer the best possible services to our clients.\u201d\n\nSocGen\u2019s first digital green bond\n\nMeanwhile, the digital bond reports the carbon footprint of the security token issuance infrastructure on chain. Societe Generale issued a \u20ac10 million bond, with AXA IM taking half and Generali Investments the balance. It\u2019s a three year, senior preferred unsecured bond.\n\nDespite the stablecoin\u2019s launch in April, this is the first real use of it. The original stablecoin had zero transactions and was burned in October and updated to a new contract to support instant settlement. AXA IM\u2019s purchase of the stablecoin and transfer in exchange for the bond took place on Friday. SocGen Forge holds \u20ac10 million of the stablecoin, with another \u20ac500,000 issued to an unknown wallet last week.\n\nSince Friday there have also been some small transactions involving the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nAXA IM previously participated in the European Investment Bank Ethereum bond that was issued on Ethereum via SocGen FORGE\u2019s infrastructure. In March the French regulator AMF granted AXA IM its digital asset license. SocGen FORGE received its first license in September 2022 and an expanded version this July.\n\nUpdate: added details re bond amount and Generali"

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past several hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a downturn following their recent highs at approximately $42,000 and $2,300. Analysis of on-chain data indicates that short-term investors are taking this chance to sell their holdings and exit the market with gains. Despite this, strengthening support levels suggest that Ethereum\u2019s price is poised for a recovery and likely to resume its upward trend.\n\nETH price faced resistance slightly under $2,300, leading to a wave of sell-offs by investors eager to secure their profits from the recent rally. According to Coinglass data, short-term traders sold off more than $3.5 million in long positions following the price\u2019s failure to maintain its upward momentum. Consequently, ETH\u2019s value dipped just below the immediate Fibonacci retracement levels.\n\nIn a recent statement by Santiment, a prominent on-chain analytics company, it was noted that Ethereum\u2019s market value has surged, reaching $2,250 for the first time in over one and a half years. This significant milestone brings an increase in open interest and long positions in the Ethereum market.\n\nSantiment highlighted that this trend is indicative of a growing sense of FOMO traders. While there is potential for further price increases, on-chain data cautioned that the market is also facing increased risk of a correction. This is primarily due to traders engaging in increasingly leveraged positions driven by greed, which could lead to greater market volatility and potential corrections.\n\nDespite the recent dip, the downturn appears to be a temporary setback, as the price of ETH showed a strong refusal to fall further and bounced back quickly. The long-short ratio has surged past 1, currently trading at 1.2012, indicating that 55% of holders are now anticipating a rise in price. On the other hand, bears are putting up a strong resistance, with 45% holding short positions.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther recently experienced a strong recovery from its 23.6% Fib channel after sellers failed to plunge the price below $2,200, showing that buyers are actively defending this price level. However, buyers are facing resistance to push the price beyond $2.3K. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,217, surging over 3% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nLooking forward, the bulls will attempt to drive the price towards the significant overhead resistance at $2,464, a crucial level to monitor in the short term. A successful break through this resistance could complete an ascending triangle pattern, a bullish indicator. The completion of this pattern could set a target price around $2,800.\n\nOn the flip side, the 20-day EMA serves as a critical support level. If the price falls below this, it will signal a weakening of the bullish momentum. Such a break could potentially lead to a decline towards the crucial $2,000 mark."

        "content": "Mantle, the DAO-led web3 ecosystem, today unveiled its Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP) as a key addition to the Mantle Ecosystem, offering users a novel way to engage with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) validator network, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nThe Mantle LSP is a permissionless and non-custodial Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking protocol, functioning on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle. It stands as the second core product of the Mantle Ecosystem, following the Mantle Network L2. Mantle posits that the introduction of Mantle Staked Ether (mETH), a value-accumulating receipt token, is a pivotal step in their protocol.\n\nMantle detailed that the genesis of Mantle LSP began with a proposal in a Mantle forum on July 14, 2023. Following the acceptance of the Mantle Governance Proposal MIP-25, the staking of Mantle Treasury ETH was sanctioned, leading to the phased deployment of Mantle LSP. This process culminated in the protocol\u2019s full operational launch on Dec. 4, transitioning it into a Permissionless Mode.\n\nMantle LSP distinguishes itself by offering instant and sustainable rewards. Users staking ETH receive mETH, a token embodying their staked value and accumulated rewards, while also unlocking additional yield opportunities within the Mantle Ecosystem. Mantle states that the ETH to mETH exchange rate is deterministically calculated, thus mitigating the impact of stake size on slippage. Furthermore, mETH is available for trade on various exchanges, with its pricing governed by market dynamics.\n\nMantle emphasizes that their protocol underscores a commitment to user experience, security, and yield optimization. Mantle states its LSP features a streamlined architecture, focusing on the ETH to mETH conversion process on L1, and avoids complexities associated with other PoS tokens and chains. The protocol\u2019s design incorporates robust risk management strategies, including non-custodial core smart contracts and off-chain services that impose strict risk limits. Additionally, Mantle LSP\u2019s security framework involves dividing responsibilities among various roles, ensuring the safeguarding of staked ETH within smart contract addresses.\n\nWith the launch of Mantle LSP, Mantle intends to enhance its DeFi offerings by exploring the adoption of mETH across various applications within its ecosystem and beyond. This expansion aims to bolster the utility and efficiency of mETH, contributing significantly to Mantle\u2019s growth in the DeFi space.\n\nThe broader Mantle ecosystem, anchored in Ethereum technology, now includes the Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solution, Mantle Governance, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and Mantle Treasury, one of the largest on-chain treasuries. The ecosystem is facilitated by the Mantle token (MNT), which serves as a product and governance token."

        "content": "The transition from November to December has brought a bullish wave to the crypto market, primarily driven by the Bitcoin price recovery. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has also gained momentum, particularly over the last week When the ETH price rebounded from the significant psychological level of $2,000. In the past six days, the Ether value has increased by approximately 11%, now trading around $2,251. Despite this positive trend, the buyers are currently confronting a long-standing resistance trendline, which poses the risk of a bearish reversal.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Breaks Above $2200 As ETH Open Interest Surges Above $8 Bln\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready for $3000?\n\nThe upper boundary of the wedge pattern could stand as a strong supply pressure\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would intensify the buying pressure for a rally past $3000.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nThe ETH price has demonstrated an impressive recovery in the last two months, with its price soaring from a low of $1,522 to the current level of $2251, marking a 47.8% increase. This growth has been largely attributed to the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF and applications by large asset management firms for Ethereum spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, From a technical standpoint, this recovery can be viewed as a bullish swing within a wedge pattern carrying a modest recovery path for the past 19 months. Historical data suggests that when the Ethereum price retests the upper trendline of this pattern, it often faces increased selling pressure, leading to a substantial correction back to the lower trendline.\n\nShould the current resistance level push the altcoin price below the new support level of $2,133, this could signal a shift in favor of sellers and potentially initiate a bearish reversal.\n\nConversely, a breakout above the wedge pattern could further accelerate the ETH recovery, potentially driving prices toward targets of $2,500 and then $3,000.\n\nETH Staked Realized Price Surpasses $2K\n\nThe Ethereum network recently witnessed a significant development as the average unit price of $ETH staked surged past $2,000. This milestone is particularly noteworthy as it represents a crucial support and resistance level for long-term investors. According to Julio, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, this price point is pivotal because it reflects the average unit price for those committed to holding $ETH for extended periods. Surpassing the $2,000 mark indicates that most long-term investors are now in a profitable position. This shift is expected to solidify $2,000 as a key support level, potentially influencing future market dynamics and investor sentiment toward Ethereum\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator reflects the buyers currently dominating this asset .\n\nAverage Directional Index: the ADX slope at a high of 34%, reflects the BTC price may witness minor pullbacks to replenish bullish momentum."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been steadily increasing since mid-Oct. and recently broke the $2,200 mark for the first time since the Terra collapse in May of last year.\n\nETH is up by 3.8% in the past 24 hours and is trading at around $2,250 at the time of writing \u2014 reaching a 20-month-high. The asset\u2019s market cap rose to $270 billion with a market dominance of 17.3%.\n\nETH price, whale activity and total open interest \u2013 Dec. 4 | Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour trading volume also registered a 15% hike, surpassing the $11 billion mark.\n\nAccording to data provided by the market intelligence platform Santiment, the number of wallets holding between 0.1 and 1 ETH reached a 14-week high of 3.35 million, a level last seen in mid-August.\n\nYou might also like: Attorney recommends SEC disbar attorneys over misconduct\n\nOn the other hand, the number of whale wallets consisting of between 100 and 1,000 ETH, per Santiment, has been constantly declining since early March \u2014 currently standing at 40,779 unique addresses.\n\nMoreover, Santiment data shows that ETH\u2019s total open interest (OI) has been constantly rising since Nov. 26.

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) has risen sharply today, hitting a new 2023 high of $2,250 as the cryptocurrency market continued to trend higher toward a successful year-end.\n\nThe recent strong upward trend in Ethereum aligns with Bitcoin\u2019s continuous attempt to break above $41,000, which it did today. As of the time of writing, the price of bitcoin was $41.437.\n\nAnalysts say the approval of a BlackRock spot ether instrument would result in an influx of institutional capital into Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network globally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Surge\n\nThe most recent charts show an upward trajectory that has many analysts and investors upbeat about the cryptocurrency hitting the coveted $3,000 barrier in the upcoming weeks or months.\n\nAs this transpired, a crucial on-chain trade statistic reveals that, just 24 hours prior to the most recent price breakout, Ethereum 2.0 stakers made an unexpected $330 million move.\n\nETH Staking Flows. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn December 2, investors pulled out a massive 169,220 ETH (about $337 million) from ETH 2.0 beacon chain Proof of Stake contracts, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\nInterestingly, since the Ethereum Shapella Upgrade enabled withdrawals in April 2023, this is the second-highest staking withdrawal amount.\n\nResilient Rebound And Bullish Market Signals\n\nToday, when the price of Bitcoin broke beyond the coveted $41,000 barrier, the cryptocurrency market is starting to feel more optimistic again.\n\nThe price of ETH recovered from the psychologically critical $2,000 threshold in response to this positive change, showing an 8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,250.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,244.7 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe classic sign of a bull market is a sequence of higher lows and higher highs, which is what we observe when we look at Ethereum\u2019s daily chart. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages served as dynamic resistance, but the price has now overcome both.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of lower yields, cryptocurrency has been going pleasantly higher, along with Gold,\u201d crypto data firm Amberdata stated in a newsletter on Sunday.\n\nIn a note, Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst at Metalpha, stated that there is increasing market expectation for a rate reduction in the coming year.\n\nInvestor optimism on the potential for Bitcoin ETF applications from significant asset management firms is also growing.\n\nShe states:\n\n\u201cThis is an official declaration of a bull run, and there may be additional price increases in the upcoming weeks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, laws may also have an impact on Ethereum\u2019s price in the future; although favorable developments may encourage investment, harsher laws may provide risks. Important factors also include investor sentiment and the state of the economy.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if ETH will overtake Bitcoin in market valuation; this will depend on things like adoption rates and network improvements. Right now, Bitcoin is in the lead with a far larger market capitalization.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

For perspective, I think there\u2019s a very strong chance it starts marking up considerably like LINK and others that had similar structures.\u201d\n\nThe crypto strategist also says that Ethereum is starting to flash signs of strength against Chainlink and Solana (SOL).\n\n\u201cA lot of pairs that have been in monster uptrends like LINK and SOL are finally starting to look bearish against ETH.\n\nI think it\u2019s ETH\u2019s turn to finally have its moment in the sun.\u201d\n\nBluntz is not the only analyst who\u2019s bullish on Ethereum.

        "content": "Investors seem content with the current performance of major cryptocurrencies led by prominent assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other leading altcoins have not been sidelined, including tokens like Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Polygon, and more.\n\nEthereum price extended the rally from the previous week over the weekend, with a spillover on Monday rising 3.3% to $2,229. The last 30 days were extremely bullish for the leading smart contracts token, cumulatively achieving a 21% ascent.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSeveral factors are driving Ethereum price rally including the fear of missing out (FOMO), attributed to the likely approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.\n\nThe ability to uphold higher support levels, starting with $2,000 cannot be overemphasized. It assures traders of the uptrend\u2019s longevity and the possibility of Ethereum price blasting to $3,000 before the end of the year.\n\nRecommended for you: Coinbase Stock Price Surges 7.25% In Tandem With Bitcoin, Buying COIN Now?\n\nEthereum AUM Weekly Inflows Hit $30 Million\n\nWeekly inflows into assets under management (AUM) products totaled $176 million in the previous week, according to the latest report by CoinShares. This underscores the growing risk appetite among investors, rising to a 10-week sum of $1.76 billion\u2014the highest level since October 2021 when Bitcoin futures ETFs launched in the US.\n\nEthereum recorded at least $31 million in inflows while Bitcoin saw weekly inflows reaching $133 million. Investors also pushed funds into Solana products which saw $4.3 million in weekly inflows.\n\nThe bullish trend will likely continue as more investors focus on the impact of Bitcoin spot ETF approval possibly in January in addition to the generally up-trending crypto market.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How Soon Can Bulls Close Gap To $3k\n\nEthereum holds above a new support formed at $2,200 as it consolidates gains from the weekend. A buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is backing the uptrend as momentum behind the token increases.\n\nIn case of a correction, support at $2,100 and $2,000 will come in handy but if nothing drastic occurs and changes the technical structure, dips would be brief and serve as opportunities to collect more liquidity for incoming breakouts.\n\nKey milestones moving forward would be to break resistance at $2,300 and the subsequent hurdle at $2,500. FOMO could then drive the price to $3,000 and provide a path for Ethereum to reclaim all-time highs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s position above all three bull market indicators; the 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue), the 50-day EMA (red), and the 200-day EMA (purple) is another validation for the bullish theory.\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) entering the overbought region (70 and above), the ongoing uptrend is strong and unlikely to snap. However, traders should be alert and watch out for sudden pullbacks. These would manifest with the RSI falling back into the neutral zone.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "A crypto analyst has explained how the range around $2,000 could become a major Ethereum support base for years, making it not too late to buy ETH right now.\n\n43.8 Million Ethereum Was Acquired Between $1,900 And $2,100\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about why Ethereum could still be worth getting into at this point. The analyst has cited data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock to explain this, referring to the on-chain acquisition distribution of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe data for the cost basis distribution of the asset | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nIn the above graph, the dots represent the number of investors or addresses who bought their coins within the corresponding price range. Naturally, the larger the size of the dot, the more is the density of holders who bought inside the range.\n\nIt appears that out of all the price ranges that ETH has visited in its entire history, the $1,900 to $2,100 one hosts the cost basis of the largest number of holders.\n\nETH was just recently consolidating inside this range, and as trading occurred inside it, the investors slowly gained their cost basis there, which is why the range has now swelled so large.\n\nNow, what relevance does this range have for Ethereum? To understand this, how investor psychology works must first be known. To any investor, their cost basis is a particular price level, as their profit-loss situation can flip when the asset\u2019s spot price retests it.\n\nBecause of this reason, the holder might be more likely to show some kind of move when this retest takes place. If the investor had last been in profits, they might expect the same level to be profitable again, so they may just buy more.\n\nA few investors doing such buying won\u2019t make the market budge at all, but if a large number of investors bought inside the same tight range, the levels might just end up providing support to Ethereum should it make a retest.\n\nThe $1,900 to $2,100 buyers are obviously in profits, so this range, which hosts the cost basis of 5.85 million addresses who acquired 43.8 million ETH there, could show a major buying reaction if ETH dips towards it. Ali explains, \u201cthis range could become a significant support level for years ahead. So, it\u2019s not too late to get in on ETH!\u201d\n\nIn another post yesterday, the same analyst had posted the Ethereum weekly chart, noting that if ETH could secure a sustained candle close above the $2,150 mark, the asset could be set for some exciting uptrend.\n\nETH may be breaking out of the triangle | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nAs is visible from the chart, the ETH weekly price could be breaking above an ascending triangle pattern. \u201cTargets in sight? We could be looking at ETH marching towards $2,600, and possibly even soaring to $3,500!\u201d says Ali.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has enjoyed some fresh bullish momentum during the past few days as it has now soared above the $2,200 mark.\n\nLooks like the price of the asset has been going up recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) joins the Bitcoin market rally past $40,000. At press time, ETH is trading 2.54% up at a price of $2,212 with a market cap of $266 billion. With this move, ETH has also extended its weekly gains to more than 9%.\n\nEthereum Mega Rally to $3,500?\n\nReports suggest that Ethereum\u2019s mega price rally shall continue going ahead amid its recent breakout past $2,200.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that the current Ethereum (ETH) price surpassing $2,000 presents a potentially favorable buying opportunity. Martinez points to data provided by IntoTheBlock, indicating that a substantial volume of tokens, specifically 43.8 million ETH, were acquired in the range of $1,900 to $2,100 by 5.85 million wallets.\n\nThis data leads Martinez to propose that this particular price range may evolve into a significant support level for Ethereum in the years to come. Hence, Martinez asserts that it may not be too late for investors to consider entering the Ethereum market.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez further anticipates a promising trajectory for Ethereum (ETH) if the cryptocurrency achieves a consistent weekly candlestick close above $2,150. In such a scenario, Martinez envisions the potential for an exciting uptrend in the price of ETH.\n\nMartinez outlines specific targets for Ethereum, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could rally towards $2,600, with the possibility of reaching even higher levels, potentially soaring to $3,500. This analysis further points to a bullish outlook for Ethereum in the coming period.\n\nWhat Happens to the ETH Price In December?\n\nIn the recent surge, Ethereum\u2019s price exceeded the critical resistance level of $2,133, indicating a potential for further upward movement driven by buyers. Although experiencing a minor intraday decline of 0.5%, a potential retest of the previously surpassed resistance holds significance. Confirming this level as new support could affirm the buyer\u2019s capability to maintain elevated price levels.\n\nIn a long-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum, it becomes evident that both cryptocurrencies have experienced significant momentum since mid-October. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery stands out, showcasing a more robust performance marked by a consistent pattern of achieving higher highs and lows.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum blockchain continues to make key progress while slashing its energy use by a staggering 99% in the latest sustainability report."

The last time ETH open interest was noted to be higher than it is now was in November 2022.\n\nThe major open interest data was recorded from Binance, Bybit, and OKX of $2.56 billion, $1.56 billion, and $1.32 billion respectively.

        "content": "Crypto investor Ryan Sean Adams argued on December 4 that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) current valuation of around $2,200 is almost \u201chilarious\u201d given the strengthening on-chain activity and the blockchain\u2019s role in the sphere.\n\nVenture Capitalist: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Is Grossly Undervalued\n\nAdams cited data like the first smart contract platform generating billions annually in \u201cgas\u201d fees, transitioning to becoming deflationary after merging in September 2021, and the over one million validators staking earning over 5% as rewards. Moreover, the venture capitalist pointed out the potential of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs in the long run.\n\nFor now, BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the world\u2019s most prominent traditional finance players, have applied to issue these derivative products. Though the SEC has yet to approve any spot crypto ETFs, the agency will authorize one or multiple, likely in early Q1 2024.\n\nOverall, the crypto market expects any spot ETF, including that of Ethereum, to attract billions in institutional capital. Beyond external factors like the SEC and ETFs talk, Adams also pointed out the rising demand for mainnet block space from the multiple layer-2 solutions running off-chain rollups parallel to Ethereum.\n\nETH Value Draws From On-Chain Activities\n\nAccording to L2Beat, Ethereum layer-2 solutions have over $14.9 billion as total value locked (TVL), with the most prominent platforms, including Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, Starknet, and Base, commanding billions and processing tens of thousands of transactions daily. In the past week, Adams observed that leading layer-2 rollups were the top 10 consumers of Ethereum block space.\n\nComparing Ethereum using traditional metrics like price-earnings (P/E) ratios that compare favorably to technology companies like Amazon and Zoom, Adams suggested that Ethereum\u2019s upside is almost mathematically unavoidable this cycle.\n\nThe venture capitalist, based on the above factors, thinks Ethereum could likely be 10x, pushing the coin to over $22,000 per coin. Even so, the investor can\u2019t precisely gauge how long the markets will \u201cstay irrational,\u201d grossly undervaluing the second most valuable coin.\n\nIn response, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams agreed Ethereum fundamentals would fuel appreciation. Even so, the founder thinks Ethereum derives strength not from speculation attributes, as Ryan Sean Adams laid out. The Uniswap founder is confident that demand from active protocols launching on the mainnet and competing for scarce block space will directly pump prices.\n\nAccording to Ultra Sound Money, Uniswap helps Ethereum burn the most coins. In the last month alone, Uniswap took over 14,900 ETH out of circulation, helping the network become more deflationary.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "NFT Trading Activity on Ethereum Surges, Reaching a Six-Month High - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "NFTs are not dead, these are instead experiencing a resurgence in trading volume following a two-year low.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain are resurging, hitting their highest trading activity across all marketplaces in six months, following a recent two-year low.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume for the week ending on Monday, Dec. 4 exceeded 105,000 ETH, a more than 250% increase since the week ending on Oct. 9, Nansen data shows. A local trough in early October saw the lowest recorded level since July 2021, right before the first explosion in NFT trading.\n\nThese trends may be indicating an end to NFT winter.\n\nData\n\nfrom CoinGecko shows CryptoPunks, one of the earliest major NFT collections, have experienced an almost 45% jump in floor price over the past 30 days to 57.24 ETH. That figure remains well shy of its all-time high of 125 ETH, however.\n\nThe boom since October suggests that the \u201cmarket basically agrees that NFTs bottomed,\u201d blockchain analytics firm Parsec CEO Will Sheehan wrote to Unchained on Telegram. \u201cThe Punks rally was equivalent to a BTC rally for the NFT market. Now you see pockets of net buying in NFTs, Pudgies the most notable, but in general liquidity and attention in NFTs has inflected,\u201d said Sheehan.\n\nThe surge in NFT trading coincides with ETH rising to around $2,200, a price point that hasn\u2019t been seen since May 2022. \u201cMuch of the spike in NFT trading volume has to do with the price movement of ETH,\u201d wrote Cameron Thompson, community manager and editor for NFT gallery Tonic, in an email to Unchained. \u201cETH\u2019s 20% increase in the past month has not only driven the buying and selling of NFTs, but has also reinforced positive sentiments around tokenized collectibles \u2014 sentiments that have not been felt among the Web3 community in many months.\u201d\n\nThe majority of NFT trading volume these days takes place on Blur, the leading marketplace tailored for high-frequency traders, which launched in October 2022, with former market leader OpenSea coming in second.\n\nRenewed Interest and General Appeal Outside the Crypto Ecosystem\n\nCarlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, expressed two noteworthy reasons for the increased trading volumes for NFTs. The first is renewed interest in \u201cmeme\u201d NFTs, like Pixelmon and Milady. \u201cThese often serve as proxies for leveraged ETH, so as ETH rises the store of value narrative rises,\u201d Mercado wrote to Unchained via Telegram. In the past 30 days, the floor prices of Pixelmon and Milady have increased 210% and 48%, respectively, per CoinGecko.\n\nThe second, wrote Mercado, is the \u201cnoticeable success (led by Nouns & Pudgy Penguins) in breaking out of crypto into the broader culture.\u201d In September, Pudgy Penguins debuted its toy collection across 2,000 Walmart stores in the United States. OpenSea\u2019s Pudgy Penguins page showed that in the past 30 days, volume increased 114% to 15,770 ETH, while its number of sales jumped 58% to 2,267 and floor price grew 83% to 9.7 ETH.\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that Blur\u2019s lending smart contract holds the most Pudgy Penguins, with 477 NFTs, a roughly 9% increase in the past 24 hours. The second biggest holder of Pudgy Penguins is a smart contract associated with Flooring Protocol, which fractionalizes NFTs to lower barriers to entry for new participants.\n\nPseudonymous Blur co-founder Pacman did not return a request for comment as of press time."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nThe year 2023 has marked a shift in the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Despite Ethereum\u2019s substantial dollar value growth of 88%, it has significantly underperformed compared to Bitcoin, being down by 25% against the lead digital asset. The ratio currently sits at a precarious 0.053, teetering near year-to-date lows.\n\nThis trend invites speculation as to whether the crypto landscape may soon witness a further dip in Ethereum\u2019s performance. The BTC-ETH Dominance metric, an oscillator that tracks the macro outperformance trends between Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides some relevant insights. It gauges the Bitcoin Market Cap\u2019s dominance over the combined market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum, normalized around a long-term mean using a 0.765 factor.\n\nHigher values and uptrends point towards Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum, while lower values and downtrends signal Ethereum\u2019s superior performance. Currently, we are technically in an era of Ethereum dominance, with the metric at -0.016, which is the lowest level since Ethereum dominance began in May 2021. Traditionally, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during bull markets, raising the question: Could this be the first bull market where Bitcoin outpaces Ethereum?"

        "content": "The crypto markets are experiencing a notable uptick as Bitcoin (BTC) surpasses the $40,000 mark for the first time in 18 months, accompanied by Ethereum (ETH) breaching $2,200. These milestones come amidst a subdued but widespread rally in the crypto space. Bitcoin's resurgence has been attributed to optimistic sentiments fueled by dovish comments from U.S. central bankers and the anticipation of a potential approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nEthereum, too, has witnessed a similar resurgence, trading at $2,205, marking a significant rise over the past 24 hours. While most top-10 cryptocurrencies recorded smaller gains, the BNB coin, affiliated with the Binance exchange, saw a minor decrease of about 0.1% in the past day. These developments signify a positive trajectory for major cryptocurrencies after a period of consolidation.\n\nIndustry Executives Forecast a Bull Run with $100,000 Bitcoin in 2024\n\nExecutives within the cryptocurrency industry are signaling the commencement of a new bull run, projecting fresh all-time highs for Bitcoin in 2024, potentially exceeding $100,000. This optimism is underpinned by several factors, including the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and the upcoming bitcoin halving scheduled for May 2024. The resolution of significant industry issues, such as the FTX case and Binance settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, is seen as a positive development that could further bolster market confidence.\n\nWhile acknowledging the speculative phase, industry leaders believe that the focus will shift towards technological advancements and real-world problem-solving as the sector evolves.\n\nKeep Reading Kraken Unveils New Platform for Institutional Clients amid ETF Boost\n\nPositive Developments and Potential Catalysts\n\nThe conclusion of the FTX case and Binance settlement is seen as a turning point, drawing a line under issues that have plagued the crypto market. Two key developments are contributing to the positive outlook: the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF and the upcoming bitcoin halving in 2024. The approval of an ETF is perceived as a significant milestone, indicating bitcoin's mainstream acceptance and attracting traditional investors. The halving, which occurs every four years, is expected to contribute to a new rally, given its historical impact on bitcoin's supply dynamics.\n\nBold Predictions for Bitcoin's Future\n\nSeveral institutions and analysts have made bold predictions for Bitcoin's future. Standard Chartered reiterated its April price call, forecasting that bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, driven by the approval of multiple ETFs.\n\nAnd while projections can greatly vary, predictions such as these align with a positive macroeconomic environment, anticipating support from monetary policy and geopolitical factors.\n\nAs the industry anticipates potential upward momentum, market participants are closely watching key levels, such as $38,000, which is viewed as a critical threshold. Some suggest that a breakout beyond this level could pave the way for a rally to $45,000 to $48,000. However, caution is advised, as the success of the rally is contingent on regulatory decisions, particularly regarding the approval or rejection of the ETF, which could significantly impact market dynamics.\n\nConclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape in Anticipation\n\nIn conclusion, the recent milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with optimistic forecasts for a bull run, indicate a renewed sense of confidence in the crypto market. As the industry moves beyond recent challenges, stakeholders are optimistic about the transformative potential of key catalysts such as ETF approvals and the bitcoin halving. However, participants remain vigilant, recognizing the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape and the potential impact of regulatory decisions on market trends."

The bond\u2019s proceeds are designated for financing or refinancing activities that align with Societe Generale\u2019s Sustainable and Positive Impact Bond framework.\n\nAXA Investment Managers and Generali Investments, representing two major institutional investors, fully subscribed to the bond through a private placement.

First, it provides continuous access to data on the carbon footprint associated with the digital bond infrastructure through its smart contract. This allows for effective monitoring of the environmental impact of financial securities.\n\nSecondly, the bond offered an innovative settlement method using EUR CoinVertible, a digital asset issued by SG-FORGE in April 2023, alongside traditional cash settlement options.\n\nThe issuance underscores SocGen\u2019s strategic focus on developing expertise in crypto services and digital instruments. It also demonstrates the lender\u2019s commitment to enhancing its debt capital market capabilities to meet the growing demand for digital assets, particularly those with ESG considerations."

        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is back on track with its mission to ensure that Ether is deflationary following a significant increase in the burn rate. Several factors are said to have contributed to this milestone, including voluntary exits by validators.\n\nOver 106,000 ETH Burned In The Last 30 Days\n\nAccording to data from Ultra Sound Money, over 106,000 ETH have been burned in the last 30 days. In that same period, only just over 70,000 ETH have been issued. This has caused a significant decrease in Ethereum\u2019s supply, with it being down by over 35,000 ETH.\n\nThis is a welcome development, as the disparity between the burn and issuance rate hasn\u2019t always been this obvious. That led to concerns as to whether ETH was truly deflationary or not. It also began to seem like the London Hard Fork wasn\u2019t effective. Ahead of the Merge, Ethereum introduced this upgrade in its efforts to make ETH deflationary.\n\nETH investors are sure to be delighted with the fact that the token has once again become deflationary. Such development could propel ETH\u2019s price to new heights. Moreover, it comes at a time when the market is preparing for an imminent bull run. As such, this macro factor, alongside other ones, places it at the forefront to be one of the biggest gainers.\n\nETH price recovers above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFactors That Have Contributed To The Ethereum Deflationary Status\n\nA report by Glassnode provided insights as to why Ethereum is deflationary once again. One of them happens to be the fact that the number of validators onboarded has slowed in recent weeks. Instead, Ethereum has an increasing number of validators exiting the ecosystem. This development has ultimately caused ETH issuance to slow.\n\nThis trend of exits notably began at the start of October. This seems to be when investors actually began to take full advantage of the Shanghai upgrade that had taken place in April. Before October, the exiting event is reported to have been at an average of 309 validators per day. That increased to 1018 validators per day at the start of October.\n\nMeanwhile, the burn rate during this period is said to have increased significantly due to the growing network activity. The increase in network usage has led to higher gas fees. The daily amount of transaction fees burned through the EIP1559 protocol has also increased as a result. The accumulated fees burned between October and November are reported to have reached 5,368 ETH.\n\nEthereum is flying high at the moment, and this could be partly due to its recently achieved status. At the time of writing, the crypto token is trading at around $2,240, up by over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from CryptoTV, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Data from Kaiko indicates that the 60-day correlation between the two digital currency giants fell to a multiyear low of 75% in November.\n\nHistorically, the correlation between these two cryptocurrencies has been high.\n\nEthereum's lag\n\nBitcoin has been experiencing a surge, with its price reaching above $41,589.73 and achieving a 12.90% increase over the past week. Ethereum, on the other hand, appears to be lagging.\n\nDespite its respectable gains, Ethereum's price increase stands at 10.09% for the same period, trailing behind Bitcoin's more robust performance.\n\nThe rally behind Bitcoin's impressive performance has been partly attributed to speculation around interest rate cuts, which has fueled the most recent rally.\n\nThis widespread market optimism suggests that investors are gaining confidence in the face of regulatory clarity and the resolution of high-profile criminal cases within the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin's growing dominance\n\nBitcoin's market dominance has reached a significant milestone, surpassing the 51% mark. This means that over half of the total market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space is now attributable to Bitcoin alone.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are valued at $814 billion and $267 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEthereum's market dominance often sees a notable increase during bull markets due to growing speculation and appetite for riskier cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Mantle has recently unveiled its liquid staking protocol (LSP) on the Ethereum mainnet. This move comes after their successful deployment of a Layer 2 network. Mantle\u2019s protocol introduces a non-custodial system allowing users to stake Ethereum (ETH) through validator nodes. In return, participants receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH), representing their stake. This approach offers a fresh perspective on network staking, aiming to decentralize the process significantly.\n\nChallenging Major Stakeholders\n\nA vital aspect of Mantle\u2019s strategy is to address the growing concentration of staked ETH in the hands of dominant providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Binance. Mantle\u2019s chief strategist, Jordi Alexander, highlights the issue stemming from a feedback loop driven by name recognition and user preference. Mantle counters this by promoting mETH in the Liquid Staking and DeFi (LSDfi) ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe goal is to provide diverse options for users and improve capital efficiency to sustain yields. Mantle\u2019s DAO, following the MIP-25 governance proposal, has commenced staking ETH from its treasury. This move adds to its $80 million in ETH staked with Lido Finance.\n\nMantle\u2019s Financial Footprint\n\nGiven its substantial financial footprint in the crypto market, mantle\u2019s entry into the liquid staking arena is noteworthy. With assets amounting to $470 million in ether and an additional $200 million in stablecoins, Mantle\u2019s approach could significantly impact the decentralized finance landscape on the Ethereum network. Their strategy represents a shift towards a more inclusive and decentralized staking environment.\n\nAs a result, despite opening the day in a bearish trend, Mantle (MNT) has gained positive momentum in the last 24 hours. During the rally, bulls drove the MNT price from a low of $0.5406 to a 6-month high of $0.5677 before a slight drop. At press time, MNT was trading for $0.5651, a 4.61% increase over the previous day.\n\nMNT/USD 1-day price chart (source: CoinGecko)\n\nMNT\u2019s market capitalization and 24-hour trading volume increased by 4.26% and 30.59%, respectively, to $1,767,894,161 and $133,598,064. This price and trading volume increase implies that investors and traders have grown interested in and confident in the staking approach. As more people participate in Mantle\u2019s decentralized staking ecosystem, the bullish trend is anticipated to propel MNT\u2019s price upwards.\n\nRead Also: Binance Lists LUNC, IOTA, & Other Spot Trading Pairs As Terra Classic Price Rallies"

Discover SCENE\n\nRising tides lift all ships\u2014apparently even those of the battered, beleaguered, and oft-eulogized NFT market.\n\nAs top altcoins including Ethereum and Solana continue to steadily pump, largely on the winds of Bitcoin\u2019s tremendously persistent, now weeks-long price rally, NFT collections associated with those blockchain networks now appear to be along for the ride.\n\nPudgy Penguins, for example, an Ethereum NFT collection and longtime bear market favorite, has jumped 74% in USD floor price in the last week alone, according to NFT Price Floor. Floor price refers to the lowest listed price for a single NFT in any given collection. Trading volume on Pudgy Penguins has also shot up 394% this week, per CryptoSlam, to nearly $7.5 million worth of NFT sales.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Pudgy Penguins has enjoyed better fortunes during the ongoing crypto winter than many other Ethereum NFT collections\u2014largely thanks to the project\u2019s prioritization of mainstream partnerships and other IP tie-ins\u2014this week\u2019s gains are distinct. It currently costs $21,289 worth of ETH to buy the cheapest Pudgy Penguin NFT on offer. Before last month, the highest floor price the collection ever reached was just north of $9,000 worth of ETH.\n\nOther Ethereum NFT collections have similarly shot up amidst the crypto market\u2019s tentative comeback. The USD floor price for Azuki, the popular anime-inspired NFT series, is up 28% since Thursday, to $14,803 a pop. Dominant Ethereum NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks have spiked 31% and 17% since Thanksgiving, respectively, in that same metric.\n\nEthereum NFT project Milady Maker also appears to have benefited tremendously from the market\u2019s current mood\u2014USD floor price for the controversial collection has spiked 79% in the last week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s steady price increase over the last few weeks, also, can only account for a portion of these good fortunes: Since Turkey Day, the cryptocurrency has climbed just 7.7%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe NFT rebound doesn\u2019t appear relegated to just Ethereum, either. On Solana, several NFT collections are seeing massive upswings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMad Lads, which has remained Solana\u2019s buzziest NFT project since launching earlier this year, is up 52.6% in the last week\u2014to an eyebrow-raising $10,219 floor price at writing, per Solana Floor. While the project has certainly benefited from Solana\u2019s impressive rally over the last month, it has also gained attention for the perks holders receive in connection to the Backpack app, and the company\u2019s soon-to-launch crypto exchange of the same name.\n\nBut as with Ethereum, no single project-specific factor appears to be driving recent gains for NFTs on Solana. The trend appears decidedly market-wide.\n\nIn the last week, Solana NFT collection Claynosaurz has shot up 62% in floor price; trading volume for the series soared 324% in the same period.\n\nFloor prices for the Solana NFT collection Chads have pumped eight times over, from $44 to $359, in the last seven days. In that period, Chads has seen $357,935 worth of trading volume\u2014that\u2019s up 12,914% from the week prior.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could flip $43,860 into a support floor, bringing the $50,000 psychological level into view.\n\nEthereum price could climb 7% to the $2,500 level as bulls show determination.\n\nRipple price could extend 10% north as bulls make a comeback in the XRP market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains steadfast on the higher timeframe, amid news that spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) discussions are now at the technical stage of approval. Specifically, talks with Spot BTC ETF issuers have advanced to key technical details, with Reuters indicating that it could signal a shift toward a potential approval.\n\nAlso Read: This is the level to beat as Bitcoin eyes $50,000 next\n\nBitcoin price could overcome $43,860\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting the $43,860 critical support, marking the midline of a weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A decisive candlestick close above this mean threshold on the weekly timeframe would confirm the continuation of the primary trend, flipping the supply barrier into a bullish breaker and using it as the springboard for a race to the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, indicating momentum continues to rise. Meanwhile, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remain in positive territory, flashing green to show that bulls are leading the BTC market. These bolster the case to the upside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, Bitcoin price could face a rejection, deflecting south to lose the support offered by the $40,000 psychological level. In a worse case, the fall could extend to the $30,000 psychological level, with a weekly candlestick close below this level invalidating the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hits $44,000 as Coinbase CEO speculates BTC could be key to extending Western civilization\n\nEthereum price could climb 7%\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action remains bullish since mid-October, consolidating within an ascending parallel channel. This is a bullish technical formation, promising more growth as long as the asset\u2019s price remains within its confines.\n\nWith both the RSI and AO indicators supporting the bullish outlook, Ethereum price could rise 7% to the $2,500 level last tested in May 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, should profit-taking kick in, Ethereum price could fail to realize the $2,500 target. The ensuing selling pressure could see ETH dwindle to lose the $2,147 support.\n\nEthereum price could then extend a leg down, converting the midline of the April 18 supply zone extending from $2,049 to $2,107 from a resistance area into a support area by breaking and closing below its midline at $2,075. A daily candlestick close below this level would not only invalidate the bullish thesis but also confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support"

        "content": "Renowned cryptocurrency expert Raoul Pal has stated that he prefers Solana to Ethereum. He mentioned Solana\u2019s remarkable quickness and efficiency as justification for his choice.\n\nIn other news, the market has regained bullish momentum, with Tron and Everlodge leading the charge. This suggests that prices will trend higher in the near future.\n\nSolana (SOL) Faster Than Ethereum, According To Raoul Pal\n\nRaoul Pal, a renowned crypto trader and investor, recently joined the discussion about the supremacy battle between Ethereum and Solana. Pal argued that the Solana blockchain offers a unique and user-friendly experience, making it a strong contender.\n\nIn addition, he explained that Solana is fast, smooth, and user-friendly. This praise for Solana aligned with the overall perception held by many industry leaders after its recovery post-FTX bankruptcy.\n\nCurrently, SOL CoinMarketCap data shows that the Solana coin traded between $53.99 and $61.28 in the past week.\n\nTron (TRX) Price Forecast Bullish\n\nSo far, in 2023, Tron (TRX) has experienced a significant recovery driven by strong growth. Tron competed with top coins like Ethereum and is currently the 10th largest token with a market capitalization of $9.2 billion.\n\nIt has shown bull activity in the last week of November. According to CoinMarketCap, Tron coin moved from a 7-day low of $0.100575 to a 7-day high of $0.109823.\n\nSurprisingly, Tron has recorded 19 green (63%) out of 30 days with 4.04% price volatility over the last 30 days.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Revolutionizes the Real Estate Sector With AI Monitoring Technology\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) has made significant strides in revolutionizing the real estate industry, introducing a fresh approach to property trading. In the past, ownership of luxurious villas was confined to only the rich.\n\nEverlodge\u2019s pioneering platform has disrupted this long-standing tradition. It has opened luxury property investments to a broader audience using NFT fractional ownership. In addition, Everlodge has used AI technology to enhance the real estate sector. Now, users can monitor property prices globally.\n\nThis AI tool is designed to provide real-time property value insights for specific locations and timeframes. It can also predict favorable markets for real estate investments. Everlodge has a native token called ELDG. The token gives its holders various benefits discounts on fees, governance rights, and VIP membership.\n\nThe ELDG token can also be staked to earn passive income. Currently priced at $0.025, some experts have forecasted a potential growth in the future. This price is driven by Everlodge\u2019s integration with the vast $280 trillion global real estate market.\n\nFor more information about Everlodge (ELDG) please visit their website.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been blowing past several resistance levels recently. It is currently surging vertically, and the market participants are optimistic that a new bull market has begun.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nThe daily chart shows that since the price broke above the 200-day moving average around the $1,800 level and the large bullish flag pattern, the market structure has shifted bullish once again. The $2,000 and $2,150 resistance levels have been broken, and the market is currently targeting the next resistance zone at the $2,500 price mark.\n\nYet, the relative strength index is entering the overbought region, and a short-term pullback or consolidation might be near.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart demonstrates more details about the recent Ethereum price action. ETH has been forming a rising wedge pattern around the $2,000 mark but has broken past its higher boundary with ease. Consequently, the market has rallied aggressively and is currently trading above $2,200.\n\nYet, with the relative strength index showing a clear overbought signal and the last few 4-hour candles demonstrating weakness in bullish momentum, a pullback toward the $2,150 support level is expected in the coming weeks.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nFunding Rates\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has risen rapidly over the last few weeks, pushing past the $2,000 level. In the current situation, analyzing the futures market metrics can provide beneficial insights for investors.\n\nThis chart demonstrates the funding rates, one of the most useful metrics for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Positive funding values indicate that the longs are more aggressive. Conversely, negative values are associated with more dominance by the short sellers.\n\nAs the chart depicts, the funding rates are printing highly positive values with the recent surge in price. These values are similar levels previously seen during the $69K all-time high range. Therefore, investors should be cautious as a pullback or even a reversal looks very likely in the short term."

This comes amid the flagship cryptocurrency's massive rally.\n\nBTC clears the $44,000\n\nBitcoin's recent surge has not only bolstered its standing against Ethereum but has also seen it break past the $44,000 mark on the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nThis rally has caught many by surprise and led to a precarious situation for bearish investors. According to data provided by CoinGlass, $159.61 million worth of short positions has been liquidated over the past 24 hours.\n\nA short squeeze, where investors who have bet against the price of an asset are forced to buy back into the market to cover their positions as prices rise, could be on the horizon.\n\nThis phenomenon could propel Bitcoin's price even higher as demand from these covering positions adds to the buying pressure.\n\nBitcoin's dominance keeps climbing\n\nBitcoin has outshone other digital assets, recording superior performance on a 24-hour basis. Ethereum saw a modest 1.9% increase. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price jumped by 4.0%. This has pushed its market dominance to an impressive 51.3%.\n\nThis outperformance is reflective of the market's current confidence in the crypto king, which is enjoying the spotlight because of the ETF hype."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst is outlining his next Ethereum (ETH) price target, saying that the top altcoin has more potential to expand, while updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new thread, crypto trader Kevin Svenson tells his 131,200 followers on the social media platform X that even though the leading smart contract platform has reached new yearly highs, it still has more room to run.\n\nThe trader details a short-term price target near $2,515, which is the next major Fibonacci level on the weekly timeframe.\n\n\u201cEthereum has reached new yearly highs today. There is a lot of room to run. First target: $2,515 (1.618 Fib) targeting 2022 weekly candle close structure.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,252 at time of writing, a 4% increase on the day.\n\nIn an accompanying video update, Svenson also lays out the path for the crypto king to shoot past the $42,000 price tag.\n\nAccording to the analyst, if the top crypto asset by market cap initially rejects $42,000 but successfully bounces off of its support and consolidates, it could spark a bigger bull run. Furthermore, he notes that BTC could alternatively break right through the $42,000 level and simply continue rising.\n\n\u201cIf we hit 42,000 and reject [it] and come back to support and we consolidate right there, remain above that trend line and we don\u2019t get a quick rejection or a breakdown, I should say this is probably going to result in a major continuation, major bullish price action.\n\nAnother possibility, another way to know if it\u2019s going to be bullish or not or at least be more sure if it\u2019s going to be bullish is if we get up to that 42,000 zone and we don\u2019t reject it.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $41,411 at time of writing, up over 5% during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Hit $28K Following BlackRock ETF Approval as BTC ETF Token Presale Passes $2M - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum will skyrocket in price should BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF gain the SEC\u2019s approval, according to analysts. This will result in more than 10x growth based on its current price.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF Token presale recently hit $2m as analysts provide 10-100x price predictions.\n\nUnprecedented Institutional Captial Anticipated as Key Price Driver\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a notable spike in November when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled down on its crypto efforts, filing for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be listed on Nasdaq, opening the door to a broad new audience previously deterred from buying ETH for technical, security, or liquidity reasons.\n\nThis would propel cryptocurrency to a legitimate investment opportunity, even for traditional investors. As such, it is no surprise that Ethereum\u2019s price is rising in anticipation, currently at $2.09K, up 15% in the last month.\n\nYet, some analysts are significantly bullish on where Ethereum could be headed in the upcoming market cycle.\n\nIn a breakdown on TheStreet, prominent analyst Austin Arnold said, \u201cThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, is now backing both Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d suggesting this is of monumental importance for the assets\u2019 future.\n\nHe then considered BlackRock\u2019s assets under management (AUM), how much it may allocate to the ETH ETF, and how this could impact the asset\u2019s market cap.\n\nArnold then discussed a bull case following the ETF approval, contemplating Ethereum could climb to highs of $41,000. However, he stated, \u201cI do not see Ethereum getting that far.\u201d\n\nInstead, the analyst sees a more realistic prediction being $28,000, or $10,000.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s $28,000, $45,000, $10,000, I\u2019d be happy with anything, but I\u2019m a long-term holder,\u201d Arnold concluded.\n\nOne of the factors that he highlighted was the difference in Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s structure, tokenomics, and utility. He explained, \u201cOne\u2019s digital gold, it\u2019s aiming to be a store of value. While Ethereum is like digital oil, used to power a global, decentralized supercomputer, build apps. Just like a car needs gasoline to be able to run, Ethereum is the gas that makes the system work.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also referenced Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism, which makes the token deflationary by destroying a small part of each transaction fee. Coupled with the incoming ETF liquidity inflows, Arnold believes this could significantly bolster its price.\n\nHowever, he understands there is a ceiling to how far it can go in the next market cycle. \u201c$10,000 ETH is the most realistic scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nThis represents less than a 5x gain from its current price. While this is a significant return for those with large portfolios, it is unlikely to render sufficient returns for those with limited financial resources.\n\nOne alternative with a lot of upside potential is Bitcoin ETF Token, a new trending presale that has raised over $2.1 million in three weeks amid the BlackRock hype.\n\nStake-to-Earn Bitcoin ETF Token ICO Hits $2M Milestone\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is a compelling new project that rewards holders in line with key Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nThe project has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned as Bitcoin ETFs reach five main targets, creating a sense of scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) when the hype is highest.\n\nIt also features a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each milestone. This incentivizes people to hold longer and ensures explosive price action following the project\u2019s IEO.\n\nThese factors make Bitcoin ETF Token deflationary, introducing the scarcity principle into the project, which has been a key driver for Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic price action since its launch in 2009.\n\nAnother exciting factor is its staking mechanism, rewarding its community and incentivizing users to lock up their tokens, further limiting the available supply.\n\nHolders can garner a 118% staking APY, but they must be quick because this decreases as more users stake their tokens.\n\nThe project has experienced significant success lately, with top analysts providing massively bullish predictions. Jacob Bury speculates it will 10x after its launch, while Crypto Boy believes it could 100x.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Share:\n\nFormer ParaFi Capital partner Santiago Santos said Solana could flip Ethereum in the next crypto market cycle.\n\nThe web3 investor said there is a 25% probability that SOL flips Ethereum.\n\nSolana trades at $59.90, losing around 3% on the day.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Empire podcast, Santiago Santos, former Partner at ParaFi Capital, shares his views on how Solana\u2019s market capitalization could exceed Ethereum\u2019s in the next market cycle.\n\nSantos\u2019 views are shaped by expectations of higher capital inflows in the crypto ecosystem, and a larger share for Solana funds.\n\nAlso read: Ripple transaction count exceeds 1.38 million, XRP price likely to extend gains\n\nSolana could flip Ethereum if these conditions are met\n\nSantos recalls his investment in Ethereum and says that when he first purchased ETH, he did not imagine the altcoin\u2019s market capitalization would climb to billions. At the time of writing, ETH market capitalization is $274.51 billion, and Solana is at a $25.51 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko data. ETH price slowly and consistently increased as capital inflows to altcoin climbed and Ethereum funds received capital from institutional investors.\n\nSantos\u2019 argument is that an increase in funding in Solana could help the altcoin flip Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization. The former ParaFi Capital partner explains that the overall crypto market capitalization does not need to increase necessarily. Instead, capital rotation from Ethereum and the ETH ecosystem\u2019s Layer 2 protocols to Solana and the SOL ecosystem could help drive the change.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap doesn\u2019t need to shrink for Solana to flip Ethereum, he said. With its various use cases and boost in utility, SOL and its ecosystem could emerge as a relatively profitable avenue for investment and draw capital from retail and institutional investors in the next crypto market cycle.\n\nSantiago Santos said that the probability of SOL flipping ETH is at 25%. Santos has entertained the idea of selling all his Ether and buying SOL tokens in exchange. The Web3 investor is firm in his thesis of Solana flipping Ethereum in the near future."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge: Bull Run Continues Beyond $2,000, But There's Silver Lining - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has seen its price substantially soar past the $2,000 threshold. This milestone is a significant psychological level for traders and enthusiasts alike, signaling a continuation of the bullish trend for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, upon closer analysis, the momentum underpinning this rally appears less robust than in previous surges, painting a picture that is cautiously optimistic with a silver lining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Bitcoin's dominance rises, it seems to absorb much of the market's momentum, leaving altcoins like Ethereum to trail in its wake. This dynamic is evident in Ethereum's price movements, which, while positive, lack the explosive energy seen in past bull runs. The subdued momentum could be attributed to a range of factors, including the market's hesitant stance on DeFi platforms, which have not regained the explosive popularity they enjoyed in previous cycles.\n\nThe DeFi sector, which is largely built upon Ethereum, has shown weak positions amid regulatory scrutiny and a global downturn in investor appetite for riskier assets. This has undoubtedly played a role in tempering Ethereum's ascent, as the network's intrinsic value is closely tied to the success and innovation within its ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the burgeoning NFT market provides a glimmer of hope. As interest in NFTs revives, Ethereum stands to benefit from increased transaction volumes and renewed enthusiasm for its blockchain, which underpins much of the NFT market. The potential of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which aims to reduce the volatility of transaction fees, also bodes well for the network's future utility and investment appeal.\n\nLooking ahead, the anticipated upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which promises improved scalability and energy efficiency, could serve as a bullish catalyst for ETH's price. Furthermore, the gradual recovery of the NFT space and persistent innovation within the DeFi sector suggest that the current rally could gain fresh momentum, even if the pace at this moment seems tempered.\n\nXRP remains suppressed\n\nXRP has recently shown signs of a breakthrough, but the rally appeared to lack the conviction seen in its cryptocurrency counterparts, such as Bitcoin. The market movement for XRP has been tepid at best, with the asset struggling to enter a significant and sustained rally.\n\nIn the shadow of Bitcoin's impressive surge past the $40,000 mark, XRP's ascent presents a rather underwhelming narrative. As Bitcoin broke numerous resistances, XRP's attempt at a rally seemed too tentative, which might be a bearish signal for the asset that has failed to gain any positions.\n\nTechnical analysis of XRP's chart reveals its struggle to maintain upward momentum. After a spike that captured the market's attention, the price action has since been contained, with XRP facing resistance that it seems unable to break decisively. The moving averages, typically a sign of potential future movement, have converged in a narrow band, suggesting a lack of strong market direction and investor indecision.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI), a measure of market momentum, remains in a neutral zone, neither overbought nor oversold, underscoring the absence of a clear trend. This indecisiveness in the market is compounded by XRP's volume metrics, which have not displayed the surge required to back a robust rally, further solidifying the notion that the recent price action is uninspired and lackluster.\n\nMarket sentiment toward XRP is between cautious and bearish, reflecting concerns over ongoing regulatory challenges and market positioning. While XRP has a loyal community and a firm standing among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, its recent performance suggests a bearish phase.\n\nWithout a significant catalyst or change in market dynamics, XRP may continue to languish in its current range, overshadowed by the more dynamic movements of its peers like Bitcoin."

Meanwhile, SHIB is now listed on Plena, which has sparked some excitement in the community. Nonetheless, while these other altcoins experience major developments, market experts are turning towards Rebel Satoshi\u2019s $RBLZ because of its impressive offering.

Notable features include an NFT collection depicting its origin story and a premium marketplace for seamless asset trading.\n\nHolders of Rebel Satoshi NFTs enjoy exclusive privileges such as discounts on merchandise and access to private events. The project\u2019s later stages will introduce a play-to-earn game. Following in the footsteps of top crypto coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin, Rebel Satoshi aims to expand its network development progressively.\n\nJoining the $RBLZ community is a straightforward path to valuable crypto involvement. Analysts recognize the uniqueness of $RBLZ, positioning it as a top crypto to buy.\n\nAfter the Early Bird Round in November, the $RBLZ public presale entered the Rebel\u2019s Round 1, offering $RBLZ at $0.013. Projections hint at a possible rise for $RBLZ to $0.018 in the next round, signifying a 38.46% increase from the present Round. If the listing price reaches $0.025, as anticipated by top ICO experts, Early Bird Round investors may see a substantial 150% return on investment.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: The Latest Update Could Lift ETC\u2019s Value\n\n\n\nOn November 28, the Ethereum Cooperative unveiled the Ethereum classic contributions app. This is in a bid to allow a wide range of contributors to Ethereumclassic.org, thereby increasing the information pool for Ethereum Classic.\n\nIn the last week, ETC has increased from $18.15 on November 22 to $18.84 on November 28, signifying a 3.80% rise. Regarding the ETC price prediction, experts are also optimistic about Ethereum Classic moving forward, because of the rapid developments which are being planned on the platform. They foresee that ETC will reach $30 by 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, some market analysts are bearish about ETC in the short term based on Ethereum Classic\u2019s historical price patterns. They predict that ETC could dip to $16 before the end of December.\n\nShiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Could Soar Ahead Of Bull Season\n\n\n\nPlena Finance, a blockchain technology-focused company, has expanded its cryptocurrency super app to incorporate Shiba Inu\u2019s SHIB. The app is recognized for seamlessly integrating self-custodial wallet features with centralized applications\u2019 user-friendly experience. Commentators believe this is a good development for Shiba Inu.\n\nIn the last week, SHIB traded for $0.000007774 on November 21, but it increased by 6.90% to $0.000008311 on November 28. Meanwhile, experts are quite bullish about the Shiba Inu coin, as they predict that the SHIB price could reach $0.000009800 by the start of January 2024.\n\nHowever, some other Shiba Inu experts are cautious about entering the SHIB market right now because of market volatility. They expect SHIB to dip to $0.000008100 by mid-December.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

        "content": "Binance has expanded its free trading options for the spot and margin trading pairs of the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin pairing with six digital assets, including BNB, Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, according to a Dec. 5 statement.\n\nBinance users will see zero maker and taker fees for these pairs starting Dec. 8 for an undisclosed period. The exchange explained that the free trading option would exclude these pairs from BNB fee discounts, rebates, and other adjustments.\n\nHowever, the firm stated that it \u201creserves the right to disqualify trades deemed to be wash trades or illegally bulk account registrations, as well as trades that display attributes of self-dealing or market manipulation.\u201d\n\nBinance is actively pushing FDUSD.\n\nThe free transaction promotion is part of Binance\u2019s ongoing efforts to encourage its users to use the FDUSD stablecoin.\n\nLast week, the crypto platform said it would phase out support for Binance USD (BUSD) by Dec. 15. Binance urged users to convert their BUSD holdings into the new stablecoin before the end of the year, saying it would end BUSD withdrawals by Dec. 31 and that BUSD balances would be automatically converted to FDUSD.\n\nBinance\u2019s decision relates to the BUSD stablecoin\u2019s regulatory issues. Earlier in the year, the BUSD issuer, Paxos, suspended the stablecoin issuance following scrutiny from U.S. regulators. At the time, the company received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which classified the stablecoin as a security.\n\nWhile Binance and Paxos have vehemently rejected this classification, the crypto community promptly deserted the stablecoin, with its circulating supply dropping to less than $2 billion as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nConcurrently, Binance has been heavily pushing FDUSD as a viable alternative, introducing new products for the digital asset and incentivizing its use. However, FDUSD\u2019s circulating supply remains less than 1 billion and is only available on less than five crypto exchanges."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price continued its remarkable rally this week as demand for cryptocurrencies continued surging. The coin surged to a high of $2,260 on Monday, its highest point since May 2022. It has had a spectacular rally after bottoming at $881 in June last year.\n\nEthereum\u2019s surge has also had an impact on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has over $6 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund has moved from having a discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) to having a premium of about 2%.\n\nThis performance is primarily because most investors believe that the SEC will also approve Ethereum ETFs. While the SEC is expected to approve a Bitcoin ETF, the challenge is that the agency views Ethereum as a financial security because of its staking features. As such, it might reject an ETH ETF just as it has done so for BTC several times in the past.\n\nEthereum and ETHE prices have jumped in line with the ongoing Bitcoin price surge. Bitcoin has rallied to over $40,000 as demand for the coin rises. Investors are waiting for the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and spot ETF approval. There is also growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in the coming months.\n\nEthereum also has a dominant role in the blockchain industry even as competition from layer-1 networks like Avalanche and Solana rose. It is also competing with other layer-2 networks like Base, Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum.\n\nFeatured Broker Looking to invest?

Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic have all pointed upwards, pointing to high momentum.\n\nTherefore, the outlook for Ethereum price is bullish, with the next level to watch being at $2,500 followed by $3,000."

Only Junaury\u2019s 30% surge beats the last two in growth metrics.\n\n\u201cAll the top 10 coins ended November with positive gains, with SOL and LINK followed with a 29.11% increase.

The disparity was fueled by the increasing demand of Bitcoin Ordinals, the popularly described non-fungible token of the market leader which boosted activities on the network clogging the mempool earlier this year.\n\nAccording to recent data from CryptoSlam, Ordinal transactions were at the highest in November with about $367 million culminating in the high number outpacing Ethereum.\n\nDeFi volumes soar\n\n\n\nThe bull run has led to an uptick in DeFi volumes including the rapid movement of institutional funds into digital asset products. Overall, total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms has surged 11% in the past 30 days with Solana (SOL) registering a 56% increase.\n\nThis year, Solana has been described as an institutional investor favorite after weeks of record inflows even when altcoin figures were at a record low. Altcoin leader Ethereum also notched an increase in institutional inflow in recent weeks as its asset price broke through the $2,000 mark.\n\nOptimism and Avalanche also recorded gains in DeFi TVL of 17% and 16% respectively. NFT volumes posted a turnaround from plunging volumes in previous months. Last month, NFT volumes stood at $0.91 billion marking a 200% growth."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSome creators of Ethereum NFT projects are scrambling to secure their collections after Thirdweb, a prominent crypto development platform, disclosed issues with its smart contracts late Monday.\n\nThirdweb wrote that a security vulnerability in a \u201ccommonly used open-source library for Web3 smart contracts\u201d was discovered, and that it affects pre-built contracts offered by Thirdweb among others. Smart contracts hold the code that power autonomous decentralized apps (dapps) and NFT collections.\n\nDue to the apparent seriousness of the vulnerability, Thirdweb is not disclosing which open-source library was the root of the exploit, or details on what the issue entails. OpenZeppelin, a widely used open-source library for smart contracts, has since come out to say that the issue isn\u2019t tied to its repository.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBased on our investigation, the issue is inherent to a problematic integration of specific patterns, and not particular to the implementations contained in the OpenZeppelin Contracts library,\u201d it tweeted\u2014but added that it would still \u201clead the effort to assess who in the community is affected and provide them with mitigation strategies.\u201d\n\nIMPORTANT On November 20th, 2023 6pm PST, we became aware of a security vulnerability in a commonly used open-source library in the web3 industry. This impacts a variety of smart contracts across the web3 ecosystem, including some of thirdweb\u2019s pre-built smart contracts.\u2026 \u2014 thirdweb (@thirdweb) December 5, 2023\n\nThirdweb said that it does not believe that any smart contracts have yet been exploited, but it recommends that projects undertake a mitigation process that includes locking down their current smart contract and migrating to a new one, then airdropping tokens to current holders. The company said that it would help cover network fees associated with migrating holders from an affected smart contract.\n\nAccording to Thirdweb, it became aware of the contract vulnerability on November 20 and rolled out a fix to its pre-built smart contract templates on November 22. As a result, any Thirdweb smart contracts deployed after 10 p.m. ET on November 22 are believed to be safe, but those deployed prior to then may be affected.\n\nThe exploit is tied to NFT smart contracts that use the Ethereum ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, but also fungible tokens minted via the ERC-20 standard. A full list of affected contract types is available via Thirdweb\u2019s blog post, along with a mitigation tool that can identify any impacted contracts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany major industry players have come out to weigh in on how the issue may impact their users, NFT holders, and NFT project creators.\n\nWe are in touch with @thirdweb about the security vulnerability impacting some NFT collections. Stay tuned for more info on how we can assist affected collection owners with any changes on OpenSea tied to contract migration. Please read @thirdweb\u2019s post below for more detail. https://t.co/HU6bmXWU7U \u2014 OpenSea (@opensea) December 5, 2023\n\nMajor NFT marketplace OpenSea tweeted that users should \u201cstay tuned for more info on how we can assist affected collection owners with any changes on OpenSea tied to contract migration.\u201d Rarible, another NFT marketplace, said that some NFT drops on its platform are also affected across Ethereum and sidechain scaling network Polygon.\n\nCoinbase said that some collections created on its NFT platform are impacted, while smart contract startup Manifold said that its own contracts are unaffected. Base, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network that Coinbase incubated, also said that some project contracts utilized on Base are affected, but the network itself is secure.\n\nMoca Transparency Tuesday - TL;DR: Mocas are SAFU, Funds are SAFU, Wallets are SAFU On Dec 2 at 11:17am HKT, we were made aware by @thirdweb, our smart contract development partner for the Mocaverse collections, that there was a need for a security update to the smart contracts\u2026 \u2014 Mocaverse\ud83d\udcbc\ud83e\ude90 (@MocaverseNFT) December 5, 2023\n\nEthereum profile picture (PFP) project Cool Cats said that while its main NFTs are safe, it will migrate its Avatar System packs to a new contract. Meanwhile, Animoca Brands\u2019 Mocaverse gaming platform said it has migrated its various NFT collections to new contracts, and will let holders claim the new versions.\n\nIn addition to covering fees for migrated projects, Thirdweb wrote that it has doubled its bug bounty payments from $25,000 to $50,000, and will utilize \u201ca more rigorous auditing process\u201d going forward.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to clarify language around the nature of the vulnerability."

        "content": "Spanish officials detained Alejandro Cao de Benos, a Spanish aristocrat.\n\nHe allegedly enlisted Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions.\n\nSpanish officials detained on Thursday a pro-North Korea political activist aristocrat accused of aiding North Korea in circumventing international sanctions through crypto, according to a statement by the Spanish police.\n\nAlejandro Cao de Benos, the founder of advocacy group Korea Friendship Association, was indicted last year by US authorities for allegedly recruiting Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to unlawfully provide crypto services to North Korea.\n\n\u201cSuch accusations are totally false. There is not a single piece of evidence that proves that I hired or solicited the services of Virgil Griffith,\u201d Cao de Benos said in a public statement posted Sunday on X.\n\nThe police said investigation for his location began in mid-October, when the agents received a tipoff from Interpol indicating that Cao de Benos could be in Spain.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCao de Benos was released after a one-day detention.\n\n\u201cIt is a disgrace that the US empire abuses Interpol and Spain to carry out what is purely political persecution,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum researcher Virgil Griffith\n\nGriffith, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, was arrested in 2019 after a trip to North Korea to allegedly consult the regime on how to use crypto to evade international sanctions.\n\nHis keynote speech at the Pyongyang conference allegedly contained information on how to bypass sanctions, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut Griffith\u2019s advocates and his legal team have argued that the presentation did no more than recapitulate widely available information, which could be readily accessed online.\n\nGriffith\u2019s lawyer said that the trip was \u201cthe culmination of Virgil\u2019s unique and unfortunate curiosity and obsession with North Korea.\u201d\n\nHe received a 63-month prison sentence last year after pleading guilty to a charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The act forbids US citizens from exporting goods, services, or technology to North Korea without a licence from the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nHis lawyer told the Wall Street Journal that Griffith was \u201csincerely remorseful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Emms dodges the bullet\n\nBritish national Christopher Emms was also charged last year, alongside Cao de Benos, with the conspiracy to help North Korea access crypto. He had attended the same conference as Griffith.\n\nIn June, Emms said he received political asylum in Russia.\n\nAppearing on Russian state media RT yesterday, Emms called Cao de Benos\u2019 detention \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and said the \u201cUS government doesn\u2019t like when someone stands up to them.\u201d\n\nEmms told Blockworks last year that Cao de Benos contacted him through LinkedIn and invited him to the conference in Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cI did the typical crypto bro thing: I googled it. I checked the Foreign Office website as a UK citizen. I checked the UN website and I didn\u2019t see that speaking at a conference in North Korea was breaking any laws,\u201d Emms said.\n\nThe North Korea trip was \u201cincredibly naive,\u201d Emms said, but \u201cthe way we [the crypto industry] approached things was so different than we would right now. There was a lack of clarity on so many things.\u201d\n\nCrypto: North Korea\u2019s \u2018treasure sword\u2019\n\nNorth Korea calls crypto its \u201ctreasure sword,\u201d according to David Maxwell, senior fellow at the think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, who spoke with DL News in April.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s crypto arm known as Lazarus Group has stolen at least $3.4 billion in crypto since emerging in 2007, according to calculations by DL News.\n\n\u201cAll the money [the North Korean hackers] cash out goes to fund their missile programme,\u201d Erin Plante, vice-president of investigations at Chainalysis, told DL News in April. A report by Recorded Future last week said that North Korea loots enough crypto to fund almost half of its military budget.\n\nLast year, Lazarus hacked a record a $625 million in crypto, raiding the web3 game Axie Infinity.\n\nThat attack, said Plante, was \u201ca turning-point event where suddenly the US National Security Council cared and wanted to hear about it.\u201d"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe DOJ says CZ is a flight risk. Ethereum (ETH) could get a spot ETF. Meanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) presents a golden opportunity for investors.\n\nHow does the DOJ\u2019s verdict on CZ affect BNB (BNB)? How does a spot ETF application affect the Ethereum price prediction? And how can investors take advantage of VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) opportunity? Let\u2019s find out!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nBNB (BNB) could have a good year once regulatory issues are solved.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is the best crypto to invest in now.\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction for 2024 is $6,369.08.\n\nBNB Price Prediction: US Department Of Justice Designates Binance Ex-CEO A Flight Risk\n\nOn November 27, 2023, the US DOJ argued that former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is a flight risk. DOJ prosecutors challenged the judge\u2019s pronouncement that CZ was not a flight risk even while in UAE.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s challenge comes despite CZ voluntarily presenting himself in court and also agreeing to a $175 million bond. The DOJ wants CZ to remain in the US to minimize the flight risk, especially as UAE does not have an extradition agreement with the US.\n\nSo far, the judge has stayed the decision permitting him to return to the UAE.\n\nThe decision to block the initial ruling has sent BNB coin price tumbling. BNB lost 1.4%, decreasing from $231.98 to $228.73.\n\nHowever, analysts say BNB coin price might reach $1,361.70 in 2024 if the authority\u2019s case with Binance is settled soon. Negotiations are ongoing between Binance and the authorities on the amount of fine the exchange will pay as punishment for its rule-breaking.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Investors Prepare For More Surges\n\nSince VC Spectra (SPCT) began its presale, the price of the token has soared to unimaginable levels. The VC Spectra (SPCT) token has gained an astounding 862.5% in just five presale stages.\n\nImportantly, there are more surges ahead for VC Spectra (SPCT). Experts say VC Spectra (SPCT) will surge over 1000% during the presale. This means that investors who join the train now can still enjoy substantial gains.\n\nTo enjoy the gains, these investors have to purchase SPCT from the VC Spectra website at the current price of $0.077. Other benefits of holding SPCT include quarterly dividends and buybacks, voting rights, and access to exclusive pre-ICOs.\n\nHowever, VC Spectra (SPCT) offers more than price increases. It is a platform for investors to enjoy the best blockchain investment services. With VC Spectra (SPCT), they can invest in early-stage blockchain startups, growth-potential Web3 companies, and specific niches and trades. They can also stake and lend their tokens and trade arbitrage.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) ensures its users are investing in profitable ventures and trades. The protocol utilizes AI, trusted trading strategies, and a sustainable investment approach to achieve this.\n\nAll these make VC Spectra (SPCT) the top crypto to buy ahead of BNB and ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: BlackRock Readies ETH ETF Application\n\nA November 9 report revealed that the top asset manager in the world, BlackRock, was taking steps to offer a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF. According to the report, BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware. This Trust is a forerunner to the ETF application because BlackRock took this same route before filing for its spot BTC ETF.\n\nAnalysts say the same excitement surrounding the Bitcoin ETF could also infect Ethereum if BlackRock eventually files for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nInterestingly, the news about the Ethereum Trust registration has pushed Ethereum (ETH) price past $2,000. The premier altcoin has surged from $1,888.94 to $2,091.94. This is a 10.7% increase.\n\nIf BlackRock\u2019s imminent spot Ethereum ETF filing is approved soon, ETH could soar to $6,369.08 in 2024. Experts believe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF applications will pave the way for the acceptance of the Ethereum ETF.\n\nShould I buy Ethereum?

        "content": "Loading... Loading...\n\nCryptocurrency Ethereum ETH was launched in 2015 and has become the second most valuable asset in the crypto sector over time. Here's a look at how an investment in Ethereum could turn you into a millionaire in the future, with the price trading higher over the last week.\n\nWhat Happened: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the cryptocurrency with a white paper released in 2014. Buterin's goal was to add scripting to make it easier for application development and to set up binding contracts.\n\nEthereum launched on July 30, 2015. During its first calendar year, Ethereum traded between $0.42 and $1.39.\n\nThe addition of Ethereum to cryptocurrency exchanges helped lead to increased value and interest from investors. On Coinbase, Ethereum became the second cryptocurrency to be added to the platform, following Bitcoin.\n\nMajor events like the fork of Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum Classic ETC/USD and the surge of interest in Ethereum based non-fungible tokens helped propel Ethereum further. A record sale of a Beeple NFT created interest in NFTs and Ethereum.\n\nEthereum hit an all-time high in November 2021, a time when many cryptocurrencies experiences their top levels.\n\nThe year 2022 brought several bankruptcies of cryptocurrency companies and sent the price of Ethereum lower. The year also brought on the Ethereum merge that took the cryptocurrency from being a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Ethereum\n\nBecoming an Ethereum Millionaire: With Ethereum trading well below its all-time high, here's a look at what an investor would need to do today to become a future millionaire based on the cryptocurrency.\n\nIf Ethereum returns to an all-time high of $4,891.70, a holder would need to have 204.43 ETH to be a millionaire.\n\nToday, the 204.43 ETH can be purchased for $456,338.87. This represents the cost today to become a future millionaire if Ethereum can return to all-time highs.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Ethereum will go up in 2023 or in the future. Over the last seven days, Ethereum is up 12% and hitting new 52-week highs. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum is up over 80% year-to-date in 2023.\n\nRead Next: 5 Things That May Surprise You About Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Mantle offers 'mETH' to the masses, as a 'lighter weight Lido' - Blockworks",
        "content": "After nine months in development, Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle has launched its second core product, Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP).\n\nThis new protocol, deployed on Mantle and Ethereum mainnet, introduces a non-custodial and permissionless ether liquid staking solution, Mantle Staked Ether (mETH).\n\nMETH acts as a value-accumulating receipt token within the Mantle LSP, very similar to Lido\u2019s staked ether (stETH). Mantle aims to achieve the highest sustainable core yield by exploring maximal extractable value. It also shares yield from the Mantle treasury, according to a statement released Monday.\n\nThe idea for mETH came from Mantle \u201calchemist\u201d Jordi Alexander, chief information officer at Selini Capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just created a lighter weight, more modern Lido,\u201d Alexander told Blockworks. He champions the idea of offering a native staking yield on an Ethereum layer-2. The premise is \u201cwe should do all of DeFi, but first start by having the 5% yield,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis is the same promise of the planned Blast layer-2, which has attracted deposits of ether (ETH) and stablecoins now topping $750 million over the past two weeks.\n\nBlast, despite its rapid growth and ambitious plans, faces scrutiny over its security model and the centralization concerns related to its reliance on Lido.\n\nRead more: Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate\n\n\u201cKudos to the Blast team because it\u2019s the same idea that I had but just a very different implementation,\u201d said Alexander, who has been advising Mantle since March and serves on investment and treasury committees.\n\n\u201cI was pretty excited [when Blast launched] because they\u2019re educating the market on this idea\u201d of having native staking yield available for DeFi on a layer-2, he said.\n\nThe Mantle LSP development process represents a more traditional, structured approach with a focus on security and integration within its ecosystem.\n\nThe team decided to build a solution from scratch, but also talked to Lido about the idea of white labeling their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe talked to everybody \u2014 we literally went through every single [liquid staking team] out there \u2014 including Lido of course \u2014 we had multiple chats with them to decide [if] there [is] a way that we can take the easy way out,\u201d Alexander said, adding \u201cwe decided to go the hard route, and it\u2019s taken many months to do it properly and get all the audits and everything.\u201d\n\nThe various components of the Mantle LSP have been audited by Hexens, MixBytes, Secure3 and Verilog, and the contract upgradeability is the responsibility of the Mantle Security Council, a 6 of 12 multisig, which is also used for maintenance of the Mantle Network itself.\n\n\u201cIf you trust Mantle, it\u2019s the same security,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nUnlike Blast, Mantle LSP doesn\u2019t force anyone to stake or bridge. METH will work just fine on Ethereum mainnet and Alexander stressed that it is an independent product from the Mantle Network.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some people that just want to stay on [Ethereum] mainnet and we do want to cater to them as well,\u201d but, he adds, \u201cI expect that most of it eventually will get incentivized to move because we\u2019ll make it really juicy to ship it over.\u201d\n\nThese incentives can be seen as a vampire attack on Lido, which Alexander says should appeal to members of the Ethereum community concerned over excessive Lido centralization.\n\nWhat\u2019s cooking in \u201cthe mETH lab\u201d?\n\nThe Mantle team has a number of ideas in the works to expand upon the LSP\u2019s use within its network, which will be proposed to holders of the MNT governance token in the coming weeks.\n\nMNT is also used to pay transaction fees on the Mantle Network.\n\nAlexander originally considered mETH as a good candidate for the Mantle gas token \u2014 \u201clike a self-replenishing gas,\u201d he said \u2014 but ultimately Mantle\u2019s mainnet launch schedule led to the introduction of MNT.\n\nThe team might consider a dual gas token model, make use of account abstraction to reduce user friction, or outline other new utilities for MNT.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have it be sort of like ATOM where you get airdrops and it\u2019s kind of like a launch pool token,\u201d Alexander said, referring to the native asset of the Cosmos Hub.\n\nHe agrees with the critique that Ethereum has too many layer-2 networks proliferating, suggesting that most lack a creative new idea.\n\n\u201cIs there something unique or some imagination that\u2019s gone into it instead of just deploying a tenth version of Aave and just doing the same USDT pair or whatever?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\n\nAnd as for the name and its natural association with illicit drugs?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to just lean into it. I\u2019m going to launch an unofficial meme contest on my Twitter.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Societe Generale Issues First Digital Green Bond as Security Token on Ethereum Blockchain - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Societe Generale Issues First Digital Green Bond as Security Token on Ethereum Blockchain\n\nSociete Generale, the third-largest bank in France, has marked a significant milestone by issuing its inaugural digital green bond on the Ethereum public blockchain.\n\nSociete Generale announced Monday that it issued its first green bond on the Ethereum blockchain. The bond, valued at 10 million euros (approximately $11 million), was executed in late November and carries a three-year maturity. This initiative was facilitated through Forge, a subsidiary of Societe Generale.\n\nThis pioneering digital green bond is dedicated to financing or refinancing products and companies falling under the eligible green activities category. The \u201cgreen\u201d status underscores Societe Generale\u2019s commitment to environmentally responsible financing. The net proceeds generated from the bond will be directed towards financing or refinancing products and companies falling within the eligible green activities category.\n\nOne of the key innovations accompanying this digital bond is its transparent and accessible digital infrastructure. Through the bond\u2019s smart contract, stakeholders, including issuers and investors, gain 24/7 open access to data pertaining to its carbon footprint.\n\nThe bank aims to leverage the Ethereum blockchain as a data repository and certification tool for issuers and investors, particularly in the context of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. The issuance of tokenized bonds aligns with the bank\u2019s commitment to enabling greater transparency on ESG matters.\n\nThis empowers market participants to measure the carbon emissions associated with their securities directly on the financial infrastructure. The smart contract governing the green bond includes comprehensive carbon footprint information accessible to the public.\n\nSociete Generale Embraces Blockchain for Tokenized Bonds to Boost Transparency and Efficiency\n\n\n\nIn a bid to enhance transparency, traceability, and efficiency in financial transactions and settlements, Societe Generale emphasized the tokenized nature of these bonds. The move towards blockchain technology is a strategic initiative by the bank\u2019s crypto team to harness the advantages of decentralized ledger technology.\n\nBy leveraging the Ethereum blockchain to provide increased transparency and traceability, it also improves fluidity and speed in transactions. Additionally, the bond introduces a technical option for investors to settle securities on-chain using the EUR CoinVertible, a stablecoin pegged to the euro that Forge issued in April 2023.\n\nThis approach not only enhances efficiency in settlement processes but also positions the bank to navigate the evolving landscape of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The bank acknowledges the ongoing experimentation with CBDC solutions and positions itself as a provider of a comprehensive range of on-chain services.\n\nThe Third-Largest Bank in France Continues Crypto Initiatives with Tokenized Bond and Focuses on Environmental Impact\n\n\n\nBeyond its collaborative efforts, Societe Generale has been an active participant in the cryptocurrency space. Prior to this digital green bond on Ethereum, the bank had successfully issued Eurobonds on the Ethereum blockchain and security tokens on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nMoreover, Societe Generale has proposed Dai stablecoin loans in exchange for bond tokens. The team\u2019s proactive approach resulted in the acquisition of the highest access license to operate as a digital asset service provider in France in July.\n\nIn November, Societe Generale-FORGE, in collaboration with the Lamarck Group, Institut Louis Bachelier, and the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, released a report focusing on the lifecycle of security tokens. The report aimed to establish a methodology for calculating the carbon footprint of financial products issued in token form on the Ethereum public blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThe report specifically focused on Ethereum\u2019s network due to its relatively low greenhouse gas emissions following the merge in September of the previous year.\n\nIn June, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a tokenized bond using Credit Agricole CIB and SEB\u2019s blockchain-based bond platform. The EIB\u2019s bond was denominated as a Swedish Krona 1 billion bond, equivalent to approximately $95 million, with a maturity period of 2 years.\n\nWhile this is SocGen\u2019s first tokenized bond, the bank had previously collaborated with the EIB on its inaugural digital bond issuance in 2021."

        "content": "Just a over month ago, the cryptosphere resembled a post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nThe FTX FTT/USD fallout, regulatory headwinds and global economic tremors had left investors cowering under a blanket of fear.\n\nBitcoin BTC/USD, the once-mighty digital messiah, was dethroned, its price unceremoniously down below $20,000. Altcoins, once vibrant ecosystems, lay dormant.\n\nBut amidst the despair, whispers of hope began to flicker.\n\nA small band of crypto pundits, refusing to succumb to the prevailing pessimism, dared to predict a coming resurrection.\n\nThey were ridiculed and dismissed. Yet, today, those voices echo with the triumphant thunder of a market reborn, roaring back to life, each green tick a vindication of their audacious pronouncements.\n\nLet's take a moment to commemorate these modern-day Oracles and revisit their pronouncements.\n\nStandard Chartered: Leading the charge were the analysts at Standard Chartered.\n\nIn late October, amidst the smoldering ashes of FTX, they boldly reaffirmed their April prediction: Bitcoin hitting the six-figure mark by 2024's end.\n\nTheir gospel?\n\nA potent cocktail of a potential a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval and institutional investors finally warming up to the digital gold rush.\n\nMatrixport: Standard Chartered wasn't the only one raising the hallelujah chorus.\n\nMatrixport, a crypto financial services Goliath, upped the ante, predicting Bitcoin's ascent to $56,000 by year-end and a mind-boggling $65,000 by early next year.\n\nTheir conviction stemmed from the belief that the FTX saga and Binance's regulatory truce had cleansed the air, paving the way for a laser focus on blockchain's revolutionary potential.\n\nTim Draper: The ever-optimistic venture capitalist, Draper remained unfazed by the market's nosedive. In November, he doubled down on his $250,000 Bitcoin prophecy by 2025, citing the likes of Tesla Inc TSLA and Microsoft Corp MSFT embracing the crypto as a testament to its inevitable mainstream adoption.\n\nAlso Read: Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson Holds Bitcoin, Ether, Sushiswap, Uniswap In Her Portfolio\n\nSamson Mow: The CEO of crypto firm JAN3, took a victory lap into the future, predicting Bitcoin's potential to breach the $1 million mark within the next five years.\n\nHis reasoning?\n\nBitcoin's inherent scarcity and its potential to dethrone gold as the ultimate store of value.\n\nMike Novogratz: The Galaxy Digital CEO is the Bitcoin evangelist who was singing the praises for a $500,000 target in five years.\n\nHis melody?\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell found \u201chis central banking superpowers,\u201d he said.\n\nARK Invest: Cathie Wood's ARK Invest remained steadfast in her unwavering belief in the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.\n\nShe maintained her unwavering optimism that Bitcoin's value could soar to astounding heights, potentially reaching between $1 million and $1.5 million in the foreseeable future.\n\nBrian Armstrong: Even the ever-cautious Coinbase Global Inc Inc. COIN CEO conceded the possibility of a \"significant rally\" in the near future.\n\nArmstrong's reasoning? Institutional FOMO (fear of missing out) and a flight to quality towards established players such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThese are just a few of the many who dared to hope when all seemed lost.\n\nTheir predictions, while not engraved in stone, serve as a beacon of faith in the inherent resilience and boundless potential of the cryptosphere.\n\nAs we move forward, it will be a thrilling spectacle to witness whether their targets are met, and if their optimism paves the way for a golden age of mass adoption and groundbreaking innovation.\n\nRead Next: El Salvador's Bitcoin Success: President Bukele Weighs Next Steps After $3.6 Million Profit\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the week in great form, with BTC soaring past $41,800 and ETH trading above $2,200.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm around these two cryptos continues to ramp up due to optimism around institutional adoption and more favorable regulation.\n\nWith altcoin season now looking imminent, all eyes are turning to hot new projects like Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), which has raised over $4.7 million ahead of its exchange debut.\n\nBitcoin Rockets Past $40k as Spot ETF Hopes Build\n\nBitcoin has reclaimed the symbolic $40,000 level for the first time since April 2022, soaring nearly 6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis new high marks a stellar comeback for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, now up over 151% year-to-date.\n\nFueling this impressive rise is mounting optimism that a spot Bitcoin ETF may soon be approved in the US, with over a dozen proposals pending before the SEC.\n\nMajor players like BlackRock and Grayscale have reportedly met with regulators recently to iron out details.\n\nBullish projections also support this positive narrative \u2013 with Matrixport predicting that Bitcoin will hit $60,000 by April 2024.\n\nMatrixport also forecast that BTC could top $125,000 by the end of next year, citing historical trends around Bitcoin halvings.\n\nWith the next halving set for April 2024, there\u2019s a growing belief among traders that Bitcoin could continue climbing in the coming months.\n\nEthereum Trades Above $2k as Buying Pressure Ramps Up\n\nEthereum is also riding high, trading above $2,200 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nETH has gained over 22% in the past month, buoyed by the same tailwinds boosting Bitcoin and other altcoins.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s price spike also comes as excitement builds around a possible spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US.\n\nJust last week, the SEC opened public commentary on Fidelity\u2019s proposed rule change to list a spot Ethereum ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nThe filing argues that US investors lack regulated and safe exposure to ETH, forcing them into riskier alternatives.\n\nETH\u2019s price has responded positively to this development, as investors bet an ETF greenlight could boost institutional investment in the token.\n\nMany investors point to the futures ETFs that were approved in 2021 as a precedent, suggesting that the regulatory environment may be turning more favorable.\n\nAs such, expectations are mounting that 2024 could be the year that Ethereum finally cements itself as a mainstream financial asset.\n\nTrending Bitcoin Minetrix Token Introduces Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine Concept\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum continue surging, a new altcoin is also capturing the crypto community\u2019s attention \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nThis unique project introduces the concept of Stake-to-Mine, allowing users to earn BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt represents a groundbreaking model that requires no expensive mining equipment, instead letting users earn cloud mining credits to redeem for hash power.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix has already raised over $4.7 million in its ongoing presale, demonstrating the massive interest in this project.\n\nInvestors are also being drawn to Bitcoin Minetrix due to its high staking yields, which currently exceed 127% APY.\n\nAs the first project to debut Stake-to-Mine, Bitcoin Minetrix has obtained notable endorsements from crypto influencers.\n\nFor example, YouTuber VoskCoin, who has over 617,000 subscribers, released a video review of Bitcoin Minetrix, highlighting its potential as a game-changer in the crypto mining space.\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix platform has even been audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult, which confirmed the integrity and security of its smart contracts.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin halving potentially leading to further price increases for BTC, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Stake-to-Mine mechanism could become even more attractive to investors.\n\nDue to this, BTCMTX looks well-positioned to become a breakout star in the altcoin space as investors seek innovative ways to gain BTC exposure and tap into mining profits.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Mantle Launches Non-Custodial Liquid Staking Protocol on Ethereum\n\nEthereum layer-2 project Mantle has announced the launch of its new liquid-staking protocol, Mantle LSP.\n\nIn a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter), the proejct said Mantle LSP will allow users to deposit ETH and participate in network staking through validator nodes.\n\nThe introduction of the staking service represents Mantle\u2019s expansion following the deployment of its Layer 2 network.\n\nThe concept of liquid staking, which enables users to free up their capital from staked assets, has gained popularity on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this has resulted in a concentration of ETH stakes with major providers like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance.\n\nMantle aims to address this issue by offering a wider range of solutions.\n\nThe protocol originated from a proposal in the Mantle governance forum in July 2023 and has since undergone an alpha phase in October, followed by a permissionless phase to broaden access and participation.\n\nWith the launch of Mantle LSP, users can stake ether and receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH) as a token representing their stake.\n\n\u201cThe concentration of ETH staking is a result of network effect through a feedback loop of increasing name recognition and use case,\u201d said Jordi Alexander, Chief Alchemist at Mantle.\n\n\u201cBy focusing on mETH\u2019s adoption in LSDfi both in the Mantle ecosystem and beyond, and its capital efficiency in maintaining the highest sustainable yield, Mantle LSP intends to be a part of the solution by creating more options for users.\u201d\n\nSince merging with BitDAO in May 2023, Mantle has accumulated one of the most significant community treasuries in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAccording to DeepDAO, its treasury includes assets worth $470 million in ether and over $200 million in stablecoins.\n\nButerin Expresses Concern About Staking Concentration\n\n\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also joined the cult of those voicing concer regarding the concentration of power among Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking providers.\n\nLido, a prominent liquid staking pool, currently controls over 32% of the staked ether on Ethereum, with holdings distributed across different validators.\n\nAlongside Rocket Pool, Lido is a significant player in the ecosystem, but Buterin highlighted the need for more robust safety mechanisms.\n\nButerin proposed exploring additional solutions to enhance the safety and decentralization of liquid staking.\n\nAs reported, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of Ethereum.\n\nThe rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.\n\nRocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit rule.\n\nHowever, Lido Finance has decided not to commit to the self-limit rule.\n\nBack in June, the project put forward a proposal to impose a limit on Lido\u2019s maximum stake.\n\nLess than one half of one percent of the votes cast were in favor of the self-limit rule, while those holding more than 99% of Lido\u2019s governance tokens, LDO, voted for the protocol to not hold back on its growth.\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest staking provider, holds only an 8.7% market share, according to data from Dune Analytics."

        "content": "Mon 04 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nThis is the bombshell in the crypto sphere: Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana, has just made an unexpectedly mild statement regarding the Ethereum blockchain. While the two projects are often depicted as fierce competitors, Yakovenko sought to ease tensions during a notable address.\n\nA Crypto Plea for the Harmony of Blockchains\n\nContrary to all expectations, Anatoly Yakovenko has publicly taken a stand against the tendency to portray projects like Solana or Polkadot crypto as \u201cEthereum killers.\u201d A label well known to cryptocurrency enthusiasts to designate the potential successors to the Ethereum giant.\n\nYet, according to Yakovenko, such characterizations harm the entire crypto ecosystem, fomenting pointless rivalries between the various protocols. The Solana boss is thus calling for more collaboration, arguing that there\u2019s no need for one project to fail in order for another to thrive.\n\nA rather harmonious vision, especially when you know how intense the competition is in the crypto Wild West!\n\nETH is here to stay, according to the founder of Solana\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. In his diatribe, Anatoly Yakovenko goes so far as to pay tribute to the technical advances made by Ethereum, proving once again that he does not see it as an enemy to be taken down.\n\nThus, the founder of Solana even says he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about a future where both protocols would coexist peacefully. As evidence, he commends the efforts by Ethereum to scale its network through solutions like \u201csharding.\u201d\n\nThis cools the hopes of those who saw Solana as an Ethereum \u201ckiller\u201d! Because according to Yakovenko, not only is harmony possible between the two blockchains, but they are destined to prosper together.\n\nIn the end, Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s message marks a turning point in the crypto universe. By advocating accord over pointless confrontation, the Solana leader paves the way for a more mature approach to competition.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether his peers will follow such an exemplary lead. But it\u2019s reasonable to hope that this outstretched hand to the king Ethereum will contribute, if not to full reconciliation, then to calming tensions that are all too often counterproductive for the crypto ecosystem as a whole.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
