        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again delayed issuing a decision on Grayscale\u2019s application to launch a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF.\n\nAccording to a message on the regulator\u2019s website, the Commission requested public comments on how the regulator should handle Grayscale\u2019s application. The SEC is interested in whether the ETH algorithm \u2013 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the concentration of a large volume of Ethereum in the hands of several individuals could make the fund vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe next application deadline is in May. The company first applied to launch a spot Ethereum ETF in October 2023. The SEC published its first decision on the application on Dec. 5, 2023. The deadline was January 25, 2024.\n\nIn addition to the application for a spot Ethereum ETF from Grayscale, the Commission previously extended the consideration of applications from Fidelity and BlackRock. The new deadline for the other two applications will be in March.\n\nAt the same time, journalists predict the adoption of spot Ethereum-ETFs by the summer of 2024. This will be preceded by a decision by the CFTC and the SEC to recognize that the second-largest cryptocurrency by capitalization does not comply with a security status.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nJournalists suggested that such certainty could arise during the trial with Binance.

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2,200 zone. ETH could start a decent increase if it settles above the $2,240 resistance.\n\nEthereum started an upside correction from the $2,165 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair might start a decent increase if it clears the $2,240 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes Recovery\n\nEthereum price managed to form a support base above the $2,165 level. ETH seems to be consolidating losses near the $2,200 level and might aim for a recovery wave, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a minor upside correction above the $2,200 level, but the bears are still active near the $2,240 resistance zone. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,240 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $2,280 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, above which the price might rise and test the 50% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $2,480 swing high to the $2,165 low. If the bulls push the price above the $2,320 resistance, they could aim for $2,360.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA clear move above the $2,360 level might start a decent increase.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,500 zone.\n\nAnother Failure in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,240 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,165 zone. A daily close below the $2,165 support might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,165\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,240\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Could a forthcoming Ethereum upgrade boost Ether's price? A recent study says yes - DLNews",
        "content": "The price of Ether is seen to increase in the weeks before major upgrades.\n\nA small group of contributors holds significant influence over key decisions regarding Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nThe increase in Ether's price is most significant in the weeks before final discussions regarding EIPs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance decisions have emerged as an underappreciated influence on prices of Ether.\n\nA recent study by a trio of academics shed light on this relationship, particularly regarding EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nAn Ethereum Improvement Proposal is a formal document suggesting new features or changes to the Ethereum blockchain that serves as a guideline for community consensus.\n\nThe study, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s decision-making process, uncovered a striking trend. In the periods leading up to final discussions of Core EIPs, Ether\u2019s price increased about 18%, and relative to Bitcoin it increased 12%.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe research also examined the concentration of power in Ethereum\u2019s governance, and found that a small group of developers and influencers hold significant sway over the EIP process.\n\nThe next major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, which is expected to reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2s, is on track to launch in late February.\n\nEthereum developers will run through tests for Dencun on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 30 and February 7.\n\nThe authors of the study were Cesare Fracassi and Moazzam Khoja at the University of Texas at Austin, and Fabian Sch\u00e4r at the University of Basel. The paper has yet to go through the academic peer-review process.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nData speaks volumes\n\nThe study analysed Ether\u2019s price trends during the final discussions and approvals of successful Core EIPs, looking at hourly price data from May 2016 to November 2023.\n\nOne of the most important findings was the 18% increase in Ether prices in the weeks preceding the last AllCoreDevs call before a major EIP.\n\nAn AllCoreDevs call is a regular meeting when Ethereum\u2019s core developers discuss and make decisions on EIPs.\n\nThis surge in prices was seen to reflect investors\u2019 evolving expectations about the likelihood of a proposal\u2019s approval, and its potential impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nTo ensure an accurate analysis, the researchers focused on a specific period of 80 days, split equally before and after these meetings.\n\nEther\u2019s price began to increase, the study found, about 30 days before the crucial discussions.\n\nA clear pattern was also seen when comparing Ether with Bitcoin.\n\nIn the 25 days leading up to the approval of a Core EIP, Ether\u2019s price against Bitcoin typically increased by about 12%, showing that Ether\u2019s price does tend to increase significantly in anticipation of major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nSuch increases are particularly significant considering the concentrated governance structure where a small group holds substantial influence over key decisions.\n\nFor example, an average of 10 people per client implementation \u2014 each client being a different version of software that runs the Ethereum protocol \u2014 are responsible for 80% of all software changes.\n\nWhen comparing Ether\u2019s performance with the S&P 500, its price movements didn\u2019t always align with the stock market trends, showing that factors influencing Ether are different from those driving the markets.\n\nFor market participants, from casual investors to institutional traders, these insights may offer some potentially valuable perspectives on how governance-related events can be crucial indicators for investment strategies.\n\nFor the Ethereum community and developers, the data highlights the impact their decisions have, not just on the network\u2019s technical trajectory, but on its financial ecosystem as well.\n\nEther's price performance for the last 30 days.\n\nEther\u2019s price is $2,270, up 3.7% on the day, after falling 16% from its yearly high of $2,700 on January 12.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is about one month away from being finalised, which according to the study, should coincide with an increase in Ether\u2019s price."

        "title": "When Will Our Forecasted Price Of $10,000 Ethereum Be Hit? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Ethereum is the cornerstone of decentralized finance and the second-largest coin by market cap. Currently trading above $2,000, the price of ETH would need 5x before it hits $10,000.\n\nSee Related: 2024 Is A Hidden Crypto Bull Market\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that our ETH to $10,000 forecast is based on charting analysis and not minor news, that is often irrelevant to price increases. Such news is usually helpful when taken into account with other information to provide a more accurate context/backdrop.\n\nWe use charts to back up all statements, separating us from typical crypto media and online headlines.\n\nWelcome in the magic world of price forecasting. We will guide you in how we think about our Ethereum price prediction, particularly how we get to an answer to the when can ETH go to $10,000 question.\n\nMaking accurate forecasts on the price of ETH\n\nTime and time again, it has been proven that fundamental news information is not correlated to short or even medium-term price increases in the Web3 space. It does not matter how many partnerships a network signs or what upgrades have taken place \u2013 the token will rise or fall along with the wider market.\n\nSuch information is useful mainly in terms of project longevity \u2013 it\u2019s less likely to go out of business with strong fundamentals. It\u2019s relevant primarily when taken in a much broader context of charting analysis and the wider crypto economy. However, many \u201canalysts\u201d will use standalone fundamental news to make unsubstantiated claims about the price of ETH. A classic example would be Ethereum\u2019s Merge, which did next to nothing regarding its price:\n\nETH to $10,000 after the Merge? Discounted cash flow models are estimating this. If you're stacking ETH for the Merge, you should be earning passively from it too. Top 5 ETH yield strategies \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Ross Booth (@therossbooth) March 31, 2022\n\nEthereum\u2019s \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 moment\n\nThe price of ETH actually dropped after the Merge. While the upgrade was undoubtedly an excellent technical advance for Ethereum\u2018s ecosystem, this will only have a long-term price effect. But the financial trading markets, driven by those looking to make huge returns in a short space of time, are often not concerned with long-term rewards.\n\nIt\u2019s quite simple. Just like in other markets, fundamental news is great for long-term investors who can wait for longer time horizons (2 \u2013 5 years). Executing a trade based on fundamental news and expecting price increases in the near term makes little sense. And regarding Ethereum, we already know it has rock-solid fundamentals, as the home of DeFi. The skill lies in knowing if the fundamentals are already priced into the token.\n\nEthereum charts to the rescue\n\nWhile fundamental information is useful to a degree, it\u2019s the charts that really help when dealing with accurate price predictions. Fundamental news information can also be useful because it indicates where people will be misled. For instance, with all eyes on BTC spot approval pushing up the price of BTC, we knew it was practically exhausted, and placed our attention on ETH.\n\nStated differently, fundamentals alone will not help in understanding whether ETH can go to $10,000. Moreover, the question WHEN can ETH go to $10,000 cannot be answered without decent chart analysis.\n\nWe have 3 ETH charts that paint a clear picture, and tell a great story.\n\nETH daily price chart\n\nFirst, the daily ETH chart which exhibits retracement levels. These retracement levels, represented by different colors on our chart, are important because they create one logic structure. The structure we are talking about is the the big drop (correction) since ETH hit its ATH.\n\nThe point with this retracement analysis is that it helps you understand when the long consolidation, otherwise boring, is entering a bullish period.\n\nAs seen below, in this long and boring consolidation, price is moving above the critical 50% retracement level. This is critical. Why? Because readings above the 50% retracement level are turning the consolidation into a bullish setup (more confirmation is needed before getting very bullish but it\u2019s getting potentially very interesting for investors).\n\nA similar but very different ETH daily chart\n\nNow here is some magic that comes from our top charting team. We take the exact same chart, switch from a horizontal chart view (retracement levels) to a chart pattern view. Suddenly, the colored chart above turns into a dynamic chart exhibiting trends, see below.\n\nThis view of the ETH chart looks extremely promising, to say the least. Suddenly, the $10,000 price forecast for ETH is not such a crazy idea, on the contrary. What clearly stands out from the chart shown below is that $3,525.50 plays a pivotal role in Ethereum\u2019s price evolution. That\u2019s because $3,525.50 is a pivotal price point on ETH\u2019s chart: once above this level, an accelerated uptrend should start. Stated differently, below $3,525.50 the uptrend will be rather soft. In that case, we should not expect those big rallies we have seen in 2017 or 2020.\n\nWeekly ETH chart confirms $10,000 target\n\nAs an investor it is important to take a top-down view. In practical terms, it means that we always should check both the weekly and the daily charts, always. This certainly applies when forecasting the price of a token.\n\nIf we want to know whether ETH can go to $10,000, we must check daily and weekly timeframes.\n\nWhile the daily charts, above, painted a very bullish picture, we must seek confirmation on the longer timeframe.\n\nLuckily, the weekly chart indicates a bullish pattern: a rounded reversal. That\u2019s a bullish pattern provided key support levels hold.\n\nWhat may sound counter-intuitive, especially to the \u2018instant pump\u2019 crowd, is that this consolidation needs to continue for a lot longer before getting strongly bullish.\n\nWhat we are saying is that serious ETH investors would hope for the following to occur:\n\nSupport levels to hold (think 2022 and 2023 lows).\n\nThe rounded pattern to further mature below $3,525.50 in 2024.\n\nIn doing so, create a W-structure.\n\nThis, ultimately, would make for the perfect setup on this weekly ETH chart to move to our forecasted $10,000 ETH target in 2025. In other words, the longer the consolidation, the better, as the result on the weekly timeframe would result in a stronger bullish reversal.\n\nETH to $10,000 \u2013 chart conclusion\n\nThe good news from our charting analysis team is that the acceleration of the uptrend will start around $3525. We expect this to occur in 2025. When it does, it\u2019s a more reasonable 3x increase to $10,000.\n\nThe weekly view also confirms a price rise acceleration to $10,000 in 2025 is perfectly possible, consistent with the daily chart.\n\nMUST READ \u2013 Crypto Markets Almost Ready For Alt Season 2024. Are You?\n\nThe price of ETH in 2024\n\nThis year, the price of ETH could hit between $3,000 \u2013 $4,000, with $3,000 the more realistic estimate. Despite a current freefall in the markets and the rising popularity of Solana-based coins, we\u2019re still very bullish on Ethereum throughout the course of the year. We accurately predicted the current Bitcoin price fall after the overhyped Bitcoin ETF approval and significant bullish momentum.\n\nWe can stick with our estimate that Bitcoin, and Ethereum, could hit all-time highs in 2024. The market is simply clearing house of those who bought at the high and will now sell at the low. There are many discounted coins available at the present time.\n\nOur premium charting service can instantly reveal which ones offer the best ROI. We called many winners in 2023 such as Fetch.ai, Ocean, Render Token, Stargate Finance, Metis Dao, and more.\n\nEthereum price of $10,000 still stands\n\nIn sum, the price of Ethereum could easily rise to $10,000. This will most likely occur in 2025. The level to reach is $3,525. Throughout 2024, the price of ETH will likely move to $3,000 \u2013 $4,000. First, we have to get out of the current bear cycle, consolidate, and push upwards.\n\nThe only point of concern would be a black swan event that pushed ETH below $1,300, in which case estimates would need to be revised. But this is a low-probability event.\n\nEthereum is still up 35% on a yearly basis at the time of this writing, trading around $1,600 at the beginning of 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice.

This pales in comparison to Polygon's meteoric rise \u2013 it onboarded over 15 million new users last year, almost rivaling Ethereum's growth.\n\nEthereum still led overall with 15.4 million new users in 2023. But Polygon followed closely behind with 15.2 million, despite being a layer-2 network built on Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, Base saw an initial spike of enthusiasm fizzle out into sluggish adoption. On the bright side, it now faces competition from alternative layer-2s with more mature ecosystems like Arbitrum (7.3 million 2023 users).\n\nAs one of Ethereum's most prominent scaling solutions, Polygon's explosive user growth demonstrates the immense potential of layer-2 technology. By delivering faster and cheaper transactions, it serves as a blueprint for how Base could also take advantage of Ethereum's mainstream adoption.\n\nBut Polygon had a multi-year head start in building its developer ecosystem compared to the Base network."

        "title": "SEC's Delay on BlackRock Ethereum ETF Decision Signals Cautious Stance - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "The SEC has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed Ethereum ETF to March 10, 2024. This reflects the regulator's cautious approach toward crypto-based investment products and highlights the need for clearer regulatory frameworks in the digital assets space.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that echoes the regulator's cautious approach toward cryptocurrency-based investment products. This decision, announced just a day before the initial deadline of January 25, 2024, marks a significant moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and investment.\n\nThe application for the iShares Ethereum Trust was filed by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock on November 21, 2023, and was published for comment in the Federal Register on December 11, 2023\u200b\u200b. The SEC, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, had a 45-day window to make a decision, which could be extended up to 90 days if deemed necessary\u200b\u200b. The Commission has now designated March 10, 2024, as the new deadline to either approve, disapprove, or initiate proceedings to ascertain the appropriateness of the proposed rule change\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis delay is part of a broader trend of postponements by the SEC concerning cryptocurrency ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that such delays are expected to continue sporadically over the coming months, with significant attention focused on May 23rd as a key date for further decisions on spot Ether ETF applications\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe SEC's cautious stance is indicative of the broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. While some industry insiders like Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, remain optimistic about eventual approval, others like Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko express skepticism, citing the SEC's generally hostile attitude toward the crypto industry\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe implications of these delays are far-reaching. Investors and market watchers are keenly observing the SEC's moves, as they could set precedents for future cryptocurrency-related financial products. The decision-making process also highlights the ongoing debate about the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies as securities, a topic that has been at the forefront of discussions in the crypto and financial sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, the SEC's postponement of its decision on BlackRock's Ethereum ETF reflects the regulator's careful approach in dealing with crypto-based investment products. This move, while causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community, underscores the need for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to navigate the complex and evolving world of digital assets.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Furthermore, 84% of these brands are reported to share or sell this personal data, with 56% potentially sharing it with government agencies upon request.\n\nThis alarming level of data collection and sharing has raised significant privacy concerns among experts and consumers alike.\n\nTechnology and privacy\n\nButerin's post has sparked a discussion on social media about the balance between technological advancements and privacy.\n\nSome users express interest in retrofitting classic cars to avoid modern privacy issues while others accuse Buterin of being a technology denier.\n\nHowever, Buterin clarifies his stance, stating that he supports various modern technologies, including certain AI applications, but he maintains a critical view of specific technologies that pose privacy risks. \"There's a small-but-important subset of things I worry about!\" he stressed."

Singling out Solana as the most distinctive general-purpose blockchain embracing a monolithic architecture, they position it as the primary competitor against Ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain uses validators to secure its network, but there\u2019s a limit to how many validators can join or leave the network in each time period, called an epoch. As Ethereum has grown, the limit for validator entries and exits has also increased. Looking ahead, Galaxy says Ethereum developers may need to \u201cweigh drastic changes\u201d to staking dynamics and monetary policy in 2024 if the network experiences a surge in usage, resulting in increased transactions and staking demand.\n\nRead more: Coinbase to address Ethereum client diversity woes\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, recently outlined three key factors that could herald a bullish phase for Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. One crucial factor he identifies is Bitcoin\u2019s current behavior.\n\nThe analyst pointed out that as the market leader, Bitcoin\u2019s recent signs of bottoming out tend to precede altcoin rallies, hinting at a potential upswing for Ethereum. Moreover, Van de Poppe highlights the growing anticipation surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAccording to Van de Poppe, the increasing buzz about these spot ETFs is a significant catalyst that could drive Ethereum\u2019s value over the coming weeks.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is on the cusp of rolling out critical network upgrades. These updates, aimed at reducing transaction costs by up to 90%, are expected to improve the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability significantly.\n\nThe momentum towards $ETH is probably going to come in the next few weeks. Arguments:\n\n\u2013 #Bitcoin bottoming out is a trigger for altcoins to make a new run.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Spot ETF hype.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum launching new upgrades to reduce 90% of the costs. pic.twitter.com/N8bDi52F8M \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 25, 2024\n\nLatest Update On Ethereum Deacon Upgrade\n\nRegarding updates, Ethereum\u2019s development team is making strides with the upcoming Dencun upgrade, a significant \u201chard fork\u201d that aims to enhance the blockchain\u2019s efficiency.\n\nTim Beiko, a core Ethereum developer, updated the community earlier today on the progress. Dencun, which incorporates \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d is set to reduce transaction costs on layer 2 solutions, making Ethereum more accessible and affordable for users.\n\nAccording to the developer, the upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Sepolia testnet on January 30 and the Holesky testnet on February 7, with mainnet implementation following if these tests succeed.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO Dencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now\u2019s the time to update it! Assuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nBrighter Future Ahead\n\nDespite these positive developments, Ethereum\u2019s market performance mirrors the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, led by Bitcoin. ETH has seen a 13.7% decline in the past week, currently trading at $2,216.\n\nHowever, analysts like Van de Poppe urge caution, particularly regarding the impact of the Bitcoin spot ETF. While there may be short-term selling pressure, Van de Poppe remains optimistic about the long-term prospects.\n\nThe analyst suggests that the influx of new capital from diverse market participants could propel Bitcoin, and by extension, Ethereum, to new heights.\n\nThe markets need to be more accurate with the impact of the ETF. There\u2019s some selling pressure in the short term, but in the long term, a massive amount of new money flows into the markets from new participants. As a result, #Bitcoin might push higher this cycle than we think. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 25, 2024\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed ruling on spot Ethereum ETF applications by Grayscale Investments and BlackRock Inc., the agency said in regulatory filings on successive days.\n\nThe agency said Thursday it would need more time to decide on Grayscale\u2019s proposal to convert its Ethereum Trust product into an ETF. The filing followed a similar announcement by the regulator on Wednesday to extend its deliberations on a BlackRock Ethereum ETF product by 45 days.\n\nThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis,\u201d the SEC said in its Grayscale filing, noting that its decision was consistent with securities law \"\u2018designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices'\" and \"'to protect investors and the public interest.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF products are based primarily on the price of ether, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind bitcoin. Grayscale and BlackRock filed their Ethereum applications last fall amid rising investor optimism that the SEC was looking more favorably at spot crypto products. On Jan. 10, the regulator approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale Ethereum ETFs\n\nAs the SEC neared a decision on those applications, it met frequently with issuers and exchanges on which the products would be traded to address concerns about investor safety. How far the regulator\u2019s thinking has progressed at this point was unclear from the filings, although it seemed to encourage public input in its Grayscale filing.\n\n\u201cWhat are commenters\u2019 views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation?,\u201d the SEC said. \u201cWhat are commenters\u2019 views generally on whether the Exchange\u2019s proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters\u2019 views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the ETH markets and the ETH markets\u2019 susceptibility to manipulation?\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum is a smart contracts blockchain platform used by software developers to build their projects, while bitcoin is primarily used as currency.\n\nEther and bitcoin were both trading flat over the past 24 hours, with ETH perched at about $2,220 and BTC at around $39,900.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe deadline for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is just months away, and analysts are divided on the odds of the regulator greenlighting such a product.\n\nLegal experts Jake Chervinsky and Scott Johnsson have cast doubt on the likelihood of a positive outcome.\n\n\"Many people seem to assume that because the SEC gave up fighting against the spot BTC ETF, they\u2019ll do the same on ETH. I\u2019m not sure,\" Chervinsky said on the X social media platform.\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nScott Johnsson cautioned investors to prepare for the possibility of the ETF's disapproval.\n\nAccording to Johnsson, the SEC might require consistent correlation across the entire 2.5-year sample period to satisfy the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act.\n\nThis stance, while potentially frustrating for proponents of the ETF, is not seen as unreasonable or capricious by Johnsson.\n\nHe also argues that approval is more likely in the following year, making an appeal less attractive and portraying the SEC in a constructive light. \"And more importantly, why would someone appeal such a tough argument when they know with high certainty it will be approved before their appeal is decided,\" he wrote.\n\nThis perspective was further discussed on X, with users debating the arbitrariness of the 2.5-year period and the prospects of an eventual approval.\n\nEarlier this week, the SEC postponed its decision on the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF until March.\n\nDiverging views on approval odds\n\nContrasting opinions have emerged regarding the approval odds for the spot ether ETF. A recent report by JPMorgan gave the ETF no more than a 50% chance of approval by May, citing ongoing lawsuits against crypto exchanges offering staking services for proof-of-stake blockchains, including Ethereum.\n\nThis legal uncertainty adds complexity to the SEC\u2019s decision-making process. On the other hand, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas initially estimated a 70% chance of approval this year, with his colleague James Seyffart offering a slightly more cautious outlook of 60-65%.\n\nSeyffart acknowledges the existence of strong arguments both for and against the ETF's approval, indicating a less confident stance compared to previous Bitcoin ETF approvals."

According to the data, user behavior is shifting \u2014 and with it, crypto markets.\n\n\n\nWe cover it all in The Onchain Crypto User Report \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/IsclNOZhJk \u2014 Flipside \ud83d\udcca (@flipsidecrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nAs per analysts, a substantial portion of EVM users are now actively exploring alternative options to Ethereum due to the allure of lower fees and faster transactions offered by emerging layer-2 solutions. The significance of this shift is underscored by historical patterns, where past bull runs fueled by Ethereum-based protocols resulted in soaring transaction costs.\n\n\u201cThe continued need for cost-effective alternatives to Ethereum, plus the growing number of EVM-compatible layer-2s, will pressure more layer-2 projects to focus on lowering end user costs.\u201d Flipside\n\nYou might also like: SEC delays Grayscale spot Ethereum ETF to May\n\nThe competitive landscape is further shaped by a growing number of EVM-compatible layer-2 networks, compelling layer-2 projects to pivot towards prioritizing cost reduction for end users. As part of this evolution, governance tokens of layer-2 networks such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), and Polygon (POL) are gaining renewed attention.\n\n\u201cThe ability of these governance tokens to impact each network\u2019s competitive advantage will play a central role in the layer-2 narrative.\u201d Flipside\n\nAdding to the dynamics, Ethereum\u2019s planned Dencun upgrade, featuring a new feature known as \u201cblobs\u201d that will allow storing large pieces of data on Ethereum blocks through EIP-4844, is anticipated to amplify the competition. Flipside says blobs will enhance block space on the mainnet and boost throughput for layer-2 networks, further challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominant position.\n\nAnalysts at Mike Novogratz\u2019s crypto bank, Galaxy Digital, echo a parallel sentiment, foreseeing a pivotal 2024 for Ethereum amid increasing stakes raised by other layer-1 blockchains.\n\nGalaxy Digital highlights Ethereum\u2019s modular architecture, specifically diverse rollup types, as a source of potential challenges and technological risks due to their early developmental stage. Singling out Solana as the primary contender with its distinctive monolithic architecture, Galaxy Digital positions it as the main competitor against Ethereum this year.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

However, the agency has now opted to use its authority to extend the review period.

Ethereum\u2019s distinctive characteristics, which do not align neatly with traditional investment categories, add complexity to the approval process.\n\nThis skepticism is shared by analysts at JPMorgan, who point out the uncertainty in how the SEC will categorize Ethereum \u2013 whether as a standard commodity or otherwise \u2013 in its upcoming May decision.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 The delay could affect the other spot #Ethereum ETF applications that have deadlines from May 23 to August 3, 2024 pic.twitter.com/hJ86Yeeff1 \u2014 Budhil Vyas (@BudhilVyas) January 25, 2024\n\nEthereum ETF As a Sign of Growing Crypto Adoption\n\nThe concept behind the proposed investment vehicle is to offer investors exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

        "content": "Ethereum, the linchpin of the decentralized application ecosystem, finds itself navigating a precarious path this week. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value, having breached the pivotal $2,250 support level, now teeters on the edge of a decisive crossroads, caught between the prospect of a resurgence and the looming threat of a more pronounced downturn.\n\nAnalyzing the technical landscape reveals a cautious narrative, as ominous bearish trendlines emerge on the hourly charts of the Kraken exchange, while a resilient resistance at $2,240 presents a formidable obstacle.\n\nEthereum: Uphill Battle And Key Levels To Watch\n\nThe journey to reclaim lost ground demands a Herculean effort from Ethereum, necessitating the conquering of the initial hurdle at $2,240 and then engaging in a formidable battle against the $2,280 resistance. The digital asset\u2019s fate hangs in the balance, with the outcome likely to shape its trajectory in the coming days.\n\nETH price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nHowever, should Ethereum stumble in this uphill climb, a safety net awaits at $2,200, providing a temporary buffer against a further decline to $2,000.\n\nBut amidst the technical turmoil, a ray of sunshine pierces through the clouds. Market sentiment around Ethereum remains surprisingly upbeat. Despite the price dip, the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors has hit a multi-year high, suggesting a shift in focus from short-term gains to long-term holding.\n\nEthereum\u2019s High-Wire Act: Key Metrics\n\nThis newfound patience is further corroborated by the skyrocketing net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for short-term token-holders. This figure, reflecting the potential profitability of investors based on their purchase price, has for the first time since the November 2021 all-time high, surpassed 0.25, signifying a surge in confidence among those who recently acquired ETH.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,220 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe current scenario resembles a high-wire act, except the stakes are considerably higher. Technical charts flash cautionary signals, but market sentiment whispers sweet nothings of optimism. Whether Ethereum finds its footing and ascends, or takes a misstep and plummets, remains to be seen.\n\nAt A Glance\n\nEthereum faces near-term technical challenges with resistance points at $2,240 and $2,280.\n\nSupport lies at $2,200 and $2,165, with a breach below $2,000 a possibility.\n\nDespite the price dip, market sentiment around Ethereum remains positive.\n\nRecord-high net profits locked in and rising NUPL for short-term holders suggest long-term optimism.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s path forward remains shrouded in uncertainty, the technical picture paints a potentially bleak outlook. With resistance levels looming large and support thin on the ground, a slide towards the psychologically significant $2,000 mark cannot be ruled out. However, the resilient optimism amongst investors, evidenced by locked-in profits and rising NUPL, suggests a hidden strength that could fuel an unexpected comeback.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A crypto analyst, Elja on X, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) will reach a staggering $15,000 by 2025 based on technical analysis. The analyst argues that the current bearish sentiment in the crypto market is \u201ctemporary.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Elja notes that the second most valuable coin by market cap follows a similar fractal pattern that fueled its previous major price rally in 2021.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready To Rip Despite The Current Consolidation?\n\nSharing a screen grab of the current ETH price action, Elja says most people in crypto are \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and only focus on immediate price movements. In the analyst\u2019s assessment, traders should look at the long-term to understand the overall price pattern.\n\nThus far, Ethereum, like Bitcoin (BTC), remains under pressure and struggling to break above immediate resistance levels. Looking at the development in the daily chart, ETH is back at a critical support level of around $2,200. Notably, the coin is down 20% from January 2024 highs of about $2,700.\n\nETH is under pressure, at least in the short to medium term. As it is, the coin follows the technical candlestick arrangement visible in Bitcoin.\n\nThe altcoin downtrend appears to have been triggered by events following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As an illustration, Bitcoin fell from around $47,000 to below $40,000 this week, weighing down altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\nOn-chain data shows that Grayscale Investments has been unloading thousands of coins behind Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Subsequently, there has been a sell-off in Bitcoin and across the altcoin scene. The situation has been made worse for Ethereum following the United States SEC\u2019s decision to postpone the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nWhile these developments have negatively impacted sentiment, Elja believes they will not derail Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth trajectory. Specifically, the analyst notes that ETH is consolidating, a \u201chealthy sign.\u201d\n\nETH To $15,000: Will Fundamental And Technical Factors Help?\n\nElja added that when crypto prices consolidate, it could suggest that whales are accumulating their position. Once this ends, ETH prices could trend higher. From the analyst\u2019s chart, the coin will break above $5,000 to $15,000 in the coming sessions.\n\nWhen making this prediction, the analyst compared the Ethereum price action to the fractal pattern that propelled ETH from around $200 to $4,800 in 15 months from 2019 to 2021. Extrapolating from past price action, Elja believes Ethereum is on a similar path. Based on analysis, the coin will likely break above November 2021 peaks.\n\nBeyond technical factors, ETH supporters cite the decreasing issuance rate. According to Ultrasound Money data, the network has been burning thousands of ETH, reducing supply. Additionally, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, believes Ethereum will be the choice network for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in the years ahead.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe SEC has delayed ETH ETF decision until May 23.\n\nETH\u2019s price has stabilized at $2,200, but another low looks likely.\n\nChart analysis points at a larger downtrend to $1,800.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF, extending the timeline for wider investor access to Ethereum. A similar delay occurred with Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF, with a decision now expected in early March.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThis pattern mirrors delays with Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts anticipate sporadic postponements until late May, expecting a conclusive decision by May 23. The SEC\u2019s cautious stance on crypto is notable, but optimism about Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval remains.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Ethereum has stabilized around $2,200 after its 20% downfall. It reverted to its previous low, which could indicate the start of a new downtrend. Can this stabilization lead to a recovery, or are we in for another low?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOn January 12, ETH reached a high of $2,710. This continued the coin\u2019s uptrend from a low of $1,513 on October 19. This uptrend was the ending wave of a much larger uptrend that started in June 2022.\n\nEthereum formed a rising channel, with the price interacting with resistance with on a recent high. This interaction resulted in a hard rejection. Today, January 25, ETH is trading at $2,200, near the last low from which this recent high was made.\n\nIn this way, the price action hints at a potential reversal as it whips out the gain previously made, indicating that sellers are taking control. If we saw a leading uptrend in a new bull cycle for Ethereum, now we could see its first bull market correction.\n\nThe last downtrend doesn\u2019t have much more room to go, but another minor low of $2,100 in the coming days looks likely. After a minor correction to the upside that will establish the first lower high for wave B, another, more significant downturn should take place at wave C.\n\nProjecting with the Fibonacci retracement tool at the 0.618 level, we come up with a target of $1,840 to complete this correction. After this correction ends and we see the first macro higher low, another lasting uptrend would be expected, ultimately bringing Ethereum\u2019s price to a new all-time high.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "The cryptosphere is like an intricate chessboard; understanding the moves beneath the surface is key. Take the recent tumble of giants Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 a cautionary tale for investors blinded by hype and not fundamentals. Beneath the fad, attention is turning to Kelexo (KLXO), a DeFi upstart that\u2019s got analysts buzzing about 50x to 100x returns in its ongoing presale.\n\nKelexo (KLXO) Transforms Peer-to-Peer Lending, ICO Sees Wave of Signups\n\nOne thing about crypto: The noises are fads, but the blue-chip gems are the low-cap and ICO coins. As Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fall, Kelexo (KLXO) has taken the spotlight, getting all the recognition it deserves for its novel peer-to-peer lending and borrowing protocol.\n\nThe project\u2019s mission to help the unbanked, revolutionize the lending process and provide passive income makes it a much-needed innovation. At its core, Kelexo (KLXO) will provide an enabling platform that connects borrowers with intending lenders with no strings attached. In other words, there will be no KYC, credit checks, or overwhelming paperwork.\n\nAs a result, smart investors are already cutting their losses and have aped into Kelexo\u2019s (KLXO) newly launched presale. The presale has seen tremendous growth already, trading at $0.022 with over 2,500 signups within 48 hours.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Significant Selling Pressure\n\nThe ETF hype was a fad, and Ethereum (ETH) is still reeling in the aftermath of this reality. Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s robust smart contract compatibility has been one of its strongest strengths. However, a lack of ecosystem development and growing baseless hype have severely affected Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s value.\n\nOver the last week, Ethereum (ETH) traders realized nearly $33M in losses, the worst since October 13, 2023. Ethereum (ETH) price has declined by 14%, dropping to a psychological support level of $2,235 today. Sentiment is worsening, and analysts are pessimistic about Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s performance in the coming months.\n\nIs Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Another Sell-The-News?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has also followed Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) suit. Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s decline surprised the general crypto market, especially with the positive outlook surrounding its spot ETF approval. Unfortunately, Bitcoin (BTC) has been in free fall, slumping under $39k and carving out all gains it accrued in the ETF, Ordinals, and pre-halving frenzy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\u2019s value continues to nosedive. It was last seen at $39,600, about 20% from $49,000 earlier this month. The ETF craze blinded many investors. However, the smart ones were quick to realize that the innovative feature that Kelexo (KLXO) aims to provide far supersedes Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s empty hype.\n\nConclusion\n\nNot all that glitters is gold! We\u2019ve seen that with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s surprising drop despite their fleeting buzz. However, Kelexo (KLXO) is poised to make a big splash in DeFi this year. It is definitely an ICO token to watch out for as big cryptos see outflow.\n\nFind out more about the Kelexo (KLXO) presale by visiting the website here\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Developers Discuss Post-Dencun Proposals, Including Increasing Maximum Stake From 32 to 2,048 ETH ... - Unchained",
        "content": "Even as developers are observing Dencun in trials, they have also begun evaluating and prioritizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for Electra, the next upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nEthereum developers deliberated Thursday about the next consensus layer upgrade after the 2024 Dencun network hard fork.\n\nEven as developers are observing Dencun on a testing network, they have also begun evaluating and prioritizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for Electra, the following upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nDuring a live-streamed meeting that takes place every two weeks, developers touched on a range of topics that included potentially increasing the maximum number of ETH a validator can stake, addressing censorship in Ethereum\u2019s block production and scaling up data availability.\n\nDebating EIPs\n\nCurrently, the staking balance of a single Ethereum validator is 32 ETH, but Mike Neuder, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, is trying to create a range that would raise the limit on validators. His EIP-7251 aims to increase a validator\u2019s maximum balance 64 times to 2,048 ETH from 32 ETH.\n\n\u201cThe high-level reason for doing this EIP is to allow some consolidation of the total number of validators we have,\u201d Neuder said in today\u2019s consensus layer meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re currently at around 900,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers also discussed EIP-7594. It concerns peer-data availability sampling, which is a method to progress from EIP-4844 levels of scale \u201cwhere everyone\u2019s downloading blobs\u201d of data, to a level beyond that: \u201cCall it full danksharding,\u201d said Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan, who chairs the biweekly consensus meetings. (EIP-4844 is nicknamed \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d after its two main authors.)\n\nDevelopers have not decided whether to prioritize EIP-7251 and EIP-7594 in Electra.\n\nAnother proposal, EIP-7547, was removed from consideration in the Electra upgrade. EIP-7547 aims to make Ethereum more censorship-resistant. Neuder, one of its authors, highlighted an Ethereum dashboard that showed the censorship of different operators in the block production pipeline. According to community resource website censorship.pics, builders censored about 67% of data blocks by excluding transactions from sanctioned crypto addresses.\n\nEIP-7547 entails a forced transaction inclusion mechanism that specifies what transactions must be included in blocks to be considered valid. \u201cThis is a relatively newer EIP, but I think the ideas are very well established and important for one of the core properties on Ethereum, which is censorship resistance,\u201d noted Neuter.\n\nGajinder Singh, maintainer of Ethereum clients Lodestar and EthereumJS, replied, \u201cWe support the EIP, but we don\u2019t feel strongly about it, because we feel that not all options have been exhausted.\u201d Ryan didn\u2019t get any volunteers when he asked if anyone wanted to make the case for EIP-7547\u2019s prioritization in Electra.\n\nDevelopers did agree to prioritize EIP-7002, which allows validators to trigger exits through their execution layer withdrawal credentials, according to the EIP\u2019s resource page. Ryan noted that EIP-7002 \u201cis relatively straightforward\u201d on both the consensus layer and execution layer. \u201cIt is a new operation type, but [it] triggers very well-known exit code paths,\u201d which refer to the different ways a validator can exit from its role in securing the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen Ryan asked in Monday\u2019s meeting whether anyone was against the inclusion of EIP-7002 in Electra, no one objected to it."

        "title": "Roughly '60% chance' of spot ETH ETF approval in May: Seyffart - Blockworks",
        "content": "Spot ether ETFs have roughly a 60% chance of being approved in May, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.\n\nEarlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed decisions on the potential BlackRock and Grayscale ether ETFs. Alongside BlackRock and Grayscale, Ark 21Shares and VanEck are also in the running for a spot ether ETF.\n\nThe delays were not surprising, according to experts who expect the SEC to put off a decision on the ETFs until later this year. The SEC, earlier this month, approved a slew of bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRead more: Race for a spot ether ETF begins with bid from Ark Invest, 21Shares\n\nSeyffart is eyeing May 23 as the next date to watch in the spot ether saga. May 23 marks the 240-day window for the SEC to decide on proposals from Ark/21Shares and VanEck.\n\n\u201cMy base case is still probably around 60-ish percent that they\u2019ll approve them\u201d around that date, he told Blockworks. \u201cBut there\u2019s plenty of ways they can delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if the SEC wants to get geared up and ready to go and wants everyone to go at the same time, they\u2019ll likely do it on May 23 unless they can figure out some way to deny or delay this whole process and do what they want,\u201d he continued.\n\nIf a May approval doesn\u2019t pan out, then Seyffart plans to watch 2025.\n\nGrayscale is taking a similar approach to its bitcoin ETF by trying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a radio interview that the firm is looking at summer 2024 for an SEC decision.\n\n\u201cThat clock will come due sometime this summer,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\nIts application for a bitcoin ETF was initially denied which led the firm to file an appeal. Back in August, a panel of judges sided with Grayscale, leaving the SEC to reconsider the application.\n\n\u201cThis ruling opened the floodgates for BTC, so to speak. And also put the SEC in a logical pretzel,\u201d Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson said.\n\nFast forward to January, and Grayscale was one of nearly a dozen firms approved to launch. It is also the fund with the highest number of outflows since the ETFs went live earlier this month.\n\nJohnsson further gave his insights on the possible ETH ETF roadmap in a post on X Thursday.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s a lot of \u201cnuance right now,\u201d but he expects that, in the long term, \u201cETH spot is almost guaranteed.\u201d\n\nHowever, the SEC can choose to ask potential issuers to pull their applications or issue denials when the May deadlines come around. If the SEC were to ask Ark/21Shares or VanEck to withdraw then it\u2019s a \u201cgood indication that the SEC is going to approve these,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\n\u201cThe SEC might just need more time to get up to speed with Ethereum versus Bitcoin,\u201d he added, noting how different the two are.\n\nCaution, Johnsson said, \u201cis warranted in assuming spot ETF approval.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJohnsson believes that the existence of ether futures ETFs is a bright spot for the potential green light, having seen that the SEC approved the bitcoin ETFs partially on that basis.\n\nSeyffart added that the SEC could say that the futures market isn\u2019t \u201clarge enough or liquid enough or impactful enough\u201d when looking at spot ether ETFs.\n\nBut, as May approaches, there should be clues that \u201cinform\u201d the public as to what the SEC is thinking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few different things that we can look to to get a feel for what\u2019s going on that we don\u2019t have yet, and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to have it for some time. Perhaps another month or two,\u201d Seyffart said. These things include filings and responses from both the issuers and the SEC.\n\n\u201cIt would certainly not surprise me if the SEC decided to avoid the [DC Circuit] at all costs and simply issued approval,\u201d Johnsson said in a post on X.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview earlier this week, said that the SEC \u201cshouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nShe added that the SEC will \u201capply precedent\u201d to spot ether decisions.\n\nCurrently, Seyffart told Blockworks, the process for spot ETH approval reminds him of July of last year. Around that time, BlackRock and other issuers were about a month into the spot bitcoin ETF race and the Grayscale decision had yet to be issued.\n\n\u201cI know the timeline isn\u2019t exactly lining up that way, but what we know and what we don\u2019t know are kind of in the same boat,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum developers have made the next big announcement as regards the Dencun upgrade. Tim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, shared this on X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Beiko, more testnet blobs are on their way, as Dencun will activate on the Sepolia testnet on Jan. 30 and the Holesky testnet on Feb. 7. He urges node operators on either network to update. Beiko further adds that, assuming both of these go smoothly, Ethereum Dencun will be scheduled on the Ethereum mainnet next.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO\n\n\n\nDencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it!\n\n\n\nAssuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nGoerli blobs were recently launched as Dencun went live on the Goerli testnet at 6:32 a.m. UTC on Jan. 17, 2024. The Sepolia and Holesky testnets will upgrade subsequently over the next two weeks. Dencun will activate on Sepolia at epoch 132608 on Jan. 30 at 10:51 p.m. UTC and on Holesky at epoch 29696 on Feb. 7 at 11:35 a.m. UTC.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated Dencun update follows last year's Shapella upgrade and includes changes to both Ethereum's consensus and execution layers.\n\nThe upgrade features several changes, the most notable of which is the implementation of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, often known as \"protodanksharding,\" which will help cut L2 transaction fees.\n\nEthereum momentum to pick up in weeks\n\nMichael Van de Poppe, a crypto analyst, predicts that momentum for ETH might likely emerge in the coming weeks. He presents three arguments: Bitcoin's bottoming out could be a catalyst for altcoins to resume their upward trend. The second reason is the buzz around the Ethereum Spot ETF. Third, Ethereum plans to implement new upgrades that are anticipated to lower transaction fees by 90%.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, BTC perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in January 2022 and have subsequently increased to 66.2%. ETH's open interest dominance, however, fell from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024.\n\nBut following the ETF approval, ETH regained some market share, with its dominance increasing to more than 40% by this metric."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.\n\nIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.\n\nIf ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.\n\nThe liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up."

Even with that said, the global crypto market cap was relatively unchanged on the week around $1.55 trillion.\n\nIn the NFT world, sales volume declined 16.4% over a seven-day period to $248 million, but the number of buyers \u2014 and sellers \u2014 increased around 50%, according to CryptoSlam data. The top three collections by sales volume were CryptoPunks at $19.33 million, CryptoUndeads at $12.36 million and Ordinals at $8 million, during the same period.\n\nOur favorite \u2018Crypto Twitter\u2019 post\n\nBinance went to court on Monday to dismiss the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission June lawsuit against them \u2014 and the judge wasn\u2019t entertaining some of their arguments, as Fortune reporter Leo Schwartz, highlighted below.\n\nIn today\u2019s hearing for Binance\u2019s motion to dismiss the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, Binance\u2019s lawyers are echoing Coinbase from last week that Howey needs a contract.

At the time of recording, Anatoly shared there were over 40,000 preorders.\n\nAnatoly and Jacquelyn discussed the long road to selling out Saga, how important rewards and developers are and the nitty-gritty details for Chapter 2. They also dove into the company\u2019s strategy and long-term mission of going up against Google and Apple app stores and how long it may take for Solana Mobile to break even.\n\nIf you need a refresher on Solana Mobile\u2019s Saga phone, we\u2019ve got you covered:\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nFollow the money\n\nPolymer Labs raises $23M to build out the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s interoperability Avalanche-based Masa raised $5.4M to build a \u201cpersonal data network\u201d Scene Infrastructure Company raised $3M from a16z to expand FWB token\u2019s utility Web3 gaming startup Arcade2Earn raised $4.8M in private token round Ingonyama raised $21 million to improve zero-knowledge technology\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re writing\n\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights The SEC is considering approving a spot Ethereum ETF, but there are some challenges.\n\nSome experts are optimistic about the approval, while others are more cautious.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision in May, but it could take longer.\n\nIn the wake of the recent green signal for 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, all eyes are now on the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. The burning question on everyone\u2019s minds is whether Ethereum will follow suit.\n\nThe journey towards approval, however, is riddled with challenges, primarily stemming from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) unclear stance on how to classify Ethereum. The SEC is yet to make a definitive decision on whether Ethereum (ETH) falls within the purview of a security, creating a regulatory gray area that complicates the ETF approval process.\n\nStaying Optimistic Regardless\n\nDespite these regulatory hurdles, some optimists find solace in recent victories. Grayscale\u2019s Court of Appeals triumph and the green light for the Ethereum Futures ETF are seen as positive indicators. Optimists believe that an Ethereum ETF approval is imminent.\n\nIn the event of a potential SEC rejection in May, there is an anticipation of an appeal, with hopes that the SEC might reconsider to avoid complications.\n\nRead More: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nSo, What are the Odds of Approval?\n\nMarket experts offer varied perspectives on the likelihood of an Ethereum ETF approval. Brett Tejpaul, Coinbase Institutional\u2019s head, acknowledges growing interest but points out the SEC\u2019s reluctance to definitively label Ethereum as a security as a potential roadblock.\n\nEric Balchunas remains optimistic, assigning a 70% chance for approval, while James Seyffart adopts a more cautious estimate of 60-65%. Both experts weigh the positive and negative aspects, expressing relatively better odds for Ethereum compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he expects a 70% chance of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved in May. The SEC needs to make approval decisions on multiple Ethereum spot ETF applications by the end of May, including VanEck, Ark 21Shares and Hashdex. Digital asset lawyer\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2024\n\nBitwise\u2019s Confidence\n\nBitwise, a company entrenched in Bitcoin ETFs, shares optimism about an Ethereum ETF. They highlight the necessary ingredients, including a robust market for Ethereum futures. However, the acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s complexity compared to Bitcoin introduces an element of uncertainty regarding the approval timeline.\n\nStaying Cautious is Key!\n\nSkeptics argue that the SEC\u2019s historical delays in approving cryptocurrency matters cast doubt on a swift approval for an Ethereum ETF. Given Ethereum\u2019s unique position, not fitting the traditional investment mold, gaining approval becomes a challenging feat.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval Is Next \u2013 With 50% Chances\n\nJPMorgan analysts echo this skepticism, emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding the SEC\u2019s treatment of Ethereum as a regular commodity for the upcoming May approval. Adding a note of caution, investment bank TD Cowen suggests that the SEC might prefer observing the performance of Bitcoin ETFs before making decisions on other cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Beware the crypto bull run predictions in 2024 - Fortune",
        "content": "Aside from the high-profile court cases, much of 2023 was a fairly lackluster year for crypto. Market activity remained mostly flat compared to the historical average. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways all year, and total volume locked (TVL) in decentralized finance ecosystems drifted within a narrow range, far below all-time highs. This lack of dramatic volatility was far from the norm we usually associate with crypto assets. The minor pricing pump in Q4 closed out the year on a positive note.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a year for making money. But the recent green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission for 11 Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications, featuring heavyweight players such as BlackRock, Ark Investments/21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco, and VanEck has led to a notable upswing in the crypto market, expressing optimistic outlook. Speculation is rife that a sustained bull run will replace this latest crypto winter.\n\nWhile I remain bullish on digital assets and the wider crypto industry on a long-term horizon, there\u2019s reason to remain cautious going into 2024. Investors face mixed signals, and it\u2019s possible the good news regarding Bitcoin ETF approval\u2013which has been leading crypto headlines for some months\u2013has already been priced in.\n\nWhile markets didn\u2019t skyrocket last year, they also didn\u2019t crater. There has been sufficient optimism to maintain pricing stability. That optimism is largely related to two major events in 2024: the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF and the potential approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving. The ETF approvals are expected to bring improved trading volumes and liquidity to crypto markets in general, and the halving will prevent BTC deflation and thus support prices.\n\nMany pundits have attributed the Q4 pricing pump to these factors, and that\u2019s been coupled with bullish activity in the derivatives market as well. Investors overall appear to believe that central bank rate hikes are mostly behind us and that there\u2019s enough weight to these optimistic murmurings to look forward to a breakout bull run in 2024.\n\nDespite the undeniably positive impact of institutional endorsements and the market sentiment reflected by the recent pricing upswing, I believe there is some truth to the Wall Street saying \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d here. The crypto market is forward-looking, and traders who have already bought the rumor might be waiting to sell regardless of what the news is.\n\nAfter the initial surge on the back of the highly anticipated news, markets may quickly pare those gains as wider adoption fails to keep pace. A subsequent correction could take place before an actual bull run begins. ETFs are a big step\u2013but not nearly enough to declare we\u2019ve achieved mass crypto adoption. While the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is a big win, I won\u2019t be holding my breath for new all-time highs for crypto asset prices or total value locked (TVL) in the short run.\n\nAs for BTC\u2019s halving in Q2, it will support markets but it\u2019s unlikely to drive a full-fledged bull run. This anti-inflationary measure makes mining new BTC more difficult, restricting supply. In the absence of significant crypto adoption, this alone isn\u2019t enough to take us back to BTC\u2019s peak of nearly $69,000, let alone surpass it.\n\nOn the other hand, an additional reason for optimism is the fact that 2024 is an election year in the U.S. We can expect U.S. regulators to tone down their headline-seeking activities in this high-stakes year. As such, there ought to be less bad news on the horizon for crypto that has the potential to dent investors\u2019 enthusiasm. This can possibly set the stage for the next bullish trend.\n\nAll in all (and Black Swan events aside), 2024 is shaping up to be more of the same for crypto asset prices. My base case scenario is that the market will bottom out and begin recovering more meaningfully by Q4 2024. In the meantime, we can expect some minor volatility as investors whiplash from heady anticipation to mild disappointment.\n\nHowever, the overall relative lack of volatility indicates that the crypto finance market is maturing, and thus our investment and trading strategies must mature as well.\n\nRachel Lin is a co-founder and CEO of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading platform.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune."

        "title": "Ethereum's Dencun Upgrade Nears Debut: Will ETH Rally? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is on the brink of a transformation with the impending Dencun upgrade. Scheduled for a late February or early March release on the mainnet, this upgrade is poised to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s transaction framework. Developers have scheduled critical tests on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 30 and February 7, respectively, marking the final steps before the upgrade goes live.\n\nPrevious Testnet Hiccups and Forward Momentum\n\nDespite experiencing minor setbacks during its implementation on the Goerli testnet, the Dencun upgrade showed resilience. A bug in Prysm nodes caused a delay in finalization but was swiftly rectified. This hiccup did not deter the progress, as the Ethereum community remains focused on enhancing the blockchain\u2019s efficiency and scalability.\n\nadvertisement\n\nProto-Danksharding\n\nAt the core of Dencun lies the proto-danksharding feature, a technical innovation designed to drastically lower transaction costs on layer 2s and provide more affordable data storage on the blockchain. This development is not just a step forward for Ethereum but a potential game-changer for the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, as a result, is a technical milestone and a potential catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s market performance. Historically, significant upgrades have led to notable shifts in Ether\u2019s (ETH) market value. For instance, following the Shapella upgrade last March, ETH\u2019s price saw a substantial uptick.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Response to Upgrade Developments\n\nIn anticipation of the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s market behavior has exhibited noteworthy trends. The cryptocurrency has seen a fluctuating trajectory, with its price rallying significantly before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, only to soften in the subsequent weeks. However, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin in several key aspects, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analysis reveals that Ethereum has surpassed Bitcoin in quarterly, monthly, and weekly performance. The firm, moreover, points to a more than 20% increase in Ether\u2019s value against Bitcoin, coinciding with heightened activity in the ETH derivatives market. This outperformance, in addition, is underscored by Ethereum\u2019s growing market cap dominance, which has gained 2.9% compared to Bitcoin since the ETF approval.\n\nHowever, ETH traded at $2,211, a 0.34% at press time decline from the intraday high of $2,242.\n\nRead Also: Is It A Good Time To Buy Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) 30% Dip In A Month?"

        "content": "The defunct crypto lending platform Celsius has moved large amounts of Ether (ETH) to centralized exchanges amid expectations that the firm will start repaying creditors in liquid crypto in mid-February.\n\nOn Jan. 26, there were several large transactions of Ether from the Celsius Network wallet to deposit wallets for Paxos and Coinbase Prime.\n\nThe largest transaction was for 443,961 ETH worth $984 million at the time of the transfer from Celsius to another network-controlled wallet in preparation for moving.\n\nA total of 13 transactions followed over the next hour, moving this huge tranche of ETH to Coinbase and Paxos wallets, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.\n\nRecent ETH transfers from Celsius Network.

However, according to a Celsius asset distribution FAQ updated on Jan. 12, a limited number of corporate accounts will be able to receive cryptocurrency through Coinbase.\n\nFor non-corporate accounts, distributions to creditors residing in the United States will be made via PayPal, and distributions to creditors outside of the U.S. will be made by Coinbase, it stated.\n\nA community of Celsius creditors on X (formerly Twitter), named \u201cCelsius NewCo Community,\u201d said they expect the distribution of liquid crypto to creditors to start in mid-February, adding that the distribution window will be open for one year.\n\nCelsius is aiming for an Effective Date of January 31st.\n\n\n\n\ufe0f We expect the distribution of liquid crypto to Earn Creditors to start in mid-February.\n\n\n\n\u23f3 The distribution window will be open for one year. pic.twitter.com/TznON0ddBV \u2014 Celsius NewCo Community (@CelsiusNewCo) January 25, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Celsius user \u201cTheHawk\u201d reported that they had officially been able to remove all of their ETH from Celsius, adding that funds were in the custody account, not the Earn account.\n\nBetween Jan. 8 and 12, Celsius transferred another $95.5 million to Coinbase, while $29.7 million was transferred to FalconX, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.\n\nRelated: Celsius transfers $125M of ETH to exchanges as FTX and Alameda dump\n\nEarlier in the month, the bankrupt lending firm stated that it had begun shifting assets to \u201censure ample liquidity\u201d in preparation for any asset distributions.\n\nCelsius said it will unstake its existing Ether holdings to \u201coffset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process\u201d and \u201cunlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors.\u201d It no longer has any ETH pending staking withdrawal, according to Nansen.\n\nOn Jan. 9, Celsius bankruptcy administrators filed an intent to notify its creditors that account holders who withdrew more than $100,000 in the 90 days before the date of the firm\u2019s bankruptcy declaration on July 13, 2022, may be required to return them by Jan. 31, 2024.\n\nETH prices have yet to react, remaining flat on the day at $2,225 at the time of writing.\n\nMagazine: Tiffany Fong flames Celsius, FTX and NY Post: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "The SEC has delayed its decision timeline for BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal.\n\nThe commission previously delayed Fidelity Investment\u2019s proposal.\n\nInvestor optimism is fueled by the growing support for Ethereum from industry giants.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been abuzz with anticipation as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues its evaluation of over six Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) proposals. Issuers include investment management giants BlackRock, Ark Invest, Fidelity, and VanEck, hoping the commission will follow the precedent it set with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet, the SEC appears to be proceeding cautiously, consistently extending its decision deadlines. Following its pushback on Fidelity\u2019s application just a week ago, the SEC has extended the same fate to the next hopeful contender.\n\nSEC Delays BlackRock Ethereum ETF\n\nOn Wednesday, January 24, SEC Assistant Secretary Sherry Haywood announced the commission\u2019s decision to postpone BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF application deadline.\n\nThe proposal, filed on November 21, 2023, requests approval to list and trade BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust on the Nasdaq stock market.\n\nA 45-day timeframe has extended BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF deadline. The newly-scheduled date is March 10, 2024, by which the commission will either approve, reject, or institute additional proceedings to assess the proposal.\n\nCommenting on the delay, ETF Analyst James Seyffart asserted that the delays on ETF proposals will likely continue over the next months.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThe speculation hinges on May 23, 2024, as the plausible date for the commission to roll out its verdict. Despite the speculation, the SEC has until August 7, 2024, to reach a final verdict on BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to delay the approval process has increased the growing anticipation for the regulator\u2019s stance on spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nExperts Bet on Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite predictions that Ethereum ETF delays are expected to continue, the open support by investors has charted an optimistic course for the potential approval of the financial instrument.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s bullish endorsement of Ethereum as a \u201cstore\u201d of value has significantly boosted investor confidence in the asset\u2019s potential. Fellow spot Bitcoin ETF provider Valkyrie Investments has expressed interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, further solidifying the asset\u2019s hype.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF anticipation is not fueled by market sentiment alone, however. In a recent interview, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce voiced optimism about a balanced decision-making process for all proposals, which will adopt an \u201cinvestor-liberty\u201d approach.\n\nOther industry predictions affirm that the SEC will likely grant simultaneous approvals in May, similar to its approach with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum experienced a significant price boost upon the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBefore approving Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC expressed concerns about potential market manipulation, which may influence its current evaluation of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs will signal improved regulatory standards within the United States.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe SEC clarified that approving Bitcoin ETFs is not the endorsement of crypto assets, and the commission\u2019s decision to extend the evaluation period of proposals reflects its commitment to thorough consideration. While the unpredictable nature of the SEC makes predicting a verdict challenging, the final decision on Ethereum ETFs could be influenced by its current regulatory stance.\n\n\u200bRead more on the impressive performance of Ethereum this year:\n\nStrong Ethereum Fundamentals Fuel 20%+ Surge Against Bitcoin\n\n\n\nAre insider hacks becoming a thing among investors?

        "content": "Ethereum price managed to hold the $2,200 support as the crypto market downturn intensified this week, on-chain signals highlight rising whale demand.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the crypto market suffered significant bearish headwinds as Bitcoin (BTC) prices wobbled below $40,000 for the first time in 50 days. At press time on Jan. 25, the global crypto market capitalization has shrunk 7%, with $108.5 billion in valuation wiped out within the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Crypto Market Cap Performance | Source: TradingView\n\nLosing 5% in Ethereum (ETH) price has maintained a relatively more resilient performance than the industry average between Jan. 22 and Jan. 24.\n\nEthereum whale activity remains high despite downtrend\n\nEthereum price has managed to keep losses below the 5% threshold this week, while Bitcoin and the global crypto market cap shrunk by up to 7%, respectively, before making a mild rebound. On-chain data trends suggest that the rising level of whale trading activity recorded on the Ethereum network this week has been pivotal to ETH\u2019s resilient price performance.\n\nSantiment\u2019s Whale transaction count metric tracks the daily number of transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency that exceeds $100,000.\n\nOn Jan. 23, the Ethereum Whale Transaction Count surged above 1,190. A closer look at the chart below shows this was the highest recorded since the ETH price raced to a 20-month peak of $2,690 on Jan. 11.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price vs. Whale Transaction Count | Source: Santiment\n\nCorporate entities accumulate ETH at significantly high volumes despite the broader market retreat. This could be attributed to investors and fund sponsors looking to acquire Ethereum ahead of a looming ETH spot ETF verdict.\n\nDuring market downtrends, an increase in whale transactions impacts the price of a crypto asset positively in two major ways. Firstly, it provides market liquidity, enabling bearish panic sellers to execute their trades at favorable prices. It also reinforces confidence among small-scale retail traders.\n\nThese factors have played a vital role as ETH battles to hold above the $2,200 support level amid market-wide sell-offs this week.\n\nEthereum investors opt for long-term storage\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum has also recorded a steady decline in exchange reserves this week, which could be linked to the rise in whale activity.\n\nCorporate entities and whales are known to be value investors who tend to hold for longer periods. Unsurprisingly, the rising volumes of whale transactions on the Ethereum network in recent months have coincided with a rapid decline in supply deposited on exchanges.\n\nAt the start of the week on Jan. 22, Ethereum supply on exchanges stood at 10.5 million ETH. But interestingly, that figure has dropped sharply to 10.4 ETH by Jan. 25.\n\nEffectively, this means that investors have shifted 150,000 ETH worth approximately $330 million from exchanges and trading platforms into long-term storage or staking contracts.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Supply on Exchanges vs. Price | Source: Santiment\n\nDespite bearish headwinds, Ethereum Supply on Exchanges dropped by 150,000 ETH in the last four days, signaling a dominant preference for long-term holding and passive income staking among current holders.\n\nNotably, Ethereum exchange supply has been in a downtrend since the Proof of Stake (PoS) transition in May 2023, a move that has coincided with an extended period of price uptrend.\n\nETH price prediction: Can Ethereum Price Stay Above $2,000?\n\nAs the downward trend in exchange supply persists, fewer ETH coins are readily available to be traded in spot markets. This appears to have decelerated the selling pressure on Ethereum this week relative to the broader altcoins market. Combined with the steady rise in whale transactions, Ethereum price is in a prime position to defend the $2,000 territory.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price data, which groups all existing ETH holders by their entry prices, also affirms this stance.\n\nIt shows that 8.3 million addresses, the largest cluster of ETH holders, had acquired 46.5 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,078. If Ethereum price slides toward $2,100, many of these holders could make frantic covering purchases to defend their positions to avoid slipping into net-loss positions. This could effectively trigger an instant Ethereum price rebound.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum bulls could overturn the bearish pressure if it reclaims the $2,500 territory. But this looks unlikely within the current market dynamics. As seen above, a significant cluster of 3.7 million addresses had acquired 7.1 million ETH at an average price of $2,400.\n\nIf they engage in mild profit-taking as prices hit their break-even point, Ethereum could slide into another correction phase.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

This move comes amidst similar delays for other proposed spot Ethereum funds from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity. The SEC\u2019s decision to seek further public input marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate over cryptocurrency-based investment products.\n\nConcerns Over Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake\n\nThe SEC\u2019s focus in this latest delay centers around Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof of stake mechanism. The regulator is keen to understand whether this change could lead to potential issues of fraud and manipulation within the proposed fund.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe agency has openly questioned the concentration of control or influence by a few entities or individuals in Ethereum\u2019s network and its impact on the overall stability and security of the proposed ETF. These concerns underline the SEC\u2019s cautious approach to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith the SEC setting a 21-day deadline for public comments and an additional 35 days for rebuttals, the crypto community is keenly awaiting further developments.\n\nThe prolonged timeline for a decision, extending beyond previous deadlines, has sparked varied reactions from industry experts. Some remain hopeful for a positive outcome, especially following the recent approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s recent comments suggest a more measured approach towards other crypto-linked exchange-traded products.\n\nExpert Opinions on Ethereum ETF\n\nAs the market anticipates the SEC\u2019s decision, opinions among crypto experts vary. Some are optimistic about a potential approval by May, drawing parallels with the recent approvals of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOthers, however, remain skeptical, given the unique challenges and regulatory concerns surrounding Ethereum and its underlying technology. The consensus is a cautious optimism, with a recognition of the hurdles that lie ahead in gaining regulatory approval for such a novel financial product.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Nears Mainnet Debut: Will ETH Rally?"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) faced a turbulent start to the week, witnessing a further 3% decline in its value by Monday noon.\n\nNotably, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been on a downward spiral since mid-January, closely tied to the lacklustre response to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, which has also caused a significant dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value by over 10%. Even the optimism surrounding a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval has failed to reverse the trend, particularly in light of the US SEC\u2019s recent decision to delay its verdict on the Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nAs the crypto market experiences these fluctuations, analysts are closely examining Ethereum\u2019s potential moves, with the current price hovering around crucial make-or-break levels.\n\nIn a Monday Tweet, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is currently situated in a key demand zone, spanning from $2,388 to $2,460, where approximately 1.02 million addresses previously purchased $4.82 million ETH ($11.6 Billion).\n\nHe further noted that the strength of this support zone could pave the way for minimal resistance, presenting a potential pathway for upward movement. However, the pundit warned of a potential pullback if Ethereum fails to sustain this level, suggesting the next significant support area lies around $2,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, popular crypto analyst and YouTuber \u201cAlan\u201d also shared insights with his 54,000 followers on Ethereum\u2019s current state, pointing out that Ethereum has touched its old resistance, which could turn into support if the price holds. Richard outlined two scenarios: a bullish pullback towards $3,000 or a potential re-entry into a range with a downward trend, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, not all analysts share the same optimism. \u201cCrypto H\u201d expressed a more bearish outlook, indicating that Ether\u2019s fair value gap has been filled, and there is no compelling reason for the price to move higher. According to him, Ether\u2019s chart suggests a potential downside with targets below the $2,400 support level.\n\n\u201cI am way more confident with taking short positions on ETH as there is little to no barrier for price to move lower and eventually make new lows $1500 and $1000 are the next targets I will be looking for.\u201d Wrote the pundit.\n\nThat said, despite Ether\u2019s price woes, the imminent deadline for the Spot Ethereum ETF, just four months away, is seen by some as a potential game-changer for mainstream adoption and institutional investment in ETH. Expectations for a bullish trend in 2024 are high, especially after Ethereum\u2019s recent outperformance compared to Bitcoin. Notably, despite a 15% drop in Bitcoin following its spot ETF approval, the ETH/BTC pair surged by 26% and has been holding firm.\n\nETH was trading at $2,221 at press time after a 2.98% drop over the past 24 hours."

Simultaneously, equity indices in the stock market have also significantly declined in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the impact on cryptocurrency investors has been minimal. Kuptsikevich thinks that the fall in stock values is seen more as a result of individual corporate stories rather than an indication of a global shift in market sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation phase, with its market share exceeding 50% once again. On the other hand, Ethereum has found itself at the lower end of the consolidation range, which it has been in for most of December. Kuptsikevich predicts that Ethereum is showing signs of possibly dropping to the $2,100 area, a level that marked the upper end of its November consolidation phase.\n\nETH 7-day market performance | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: OKX shuts down mining pools after five years of operation\n\nKuptsikevich suggests that a further decline towards the $2,000 mark is possible, citing the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility. This potential dip could mirror a similar retracement in Bitcoin to the $37,500 level.\n\nThe SEC has also delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF until March 10. While some experts remain optimistic about the ETF\u2019s approval by May, with a probability of 50-to-70%, others are wary of regulatory resistance.\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has broadened the appeal of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. According to the head of institutional at Coinbase, this marks a potential shift towards mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the influx of new capital into new cryptocurrencies is expected to be a gradual process, unfolding over months or even years.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed the decision on the spot Bitcoin ETF application from American multinational asset manager BlackRock.\n\nNew Date for BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Unveiled\n\nThe BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF dubbed the iShares Ethereum Trust will not get a decision on whether it is approved or denied until March 10, 2024, according to a filing published by the markets regulator.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlackRock\u2019s filing comes in the wake of the Bitcoin analogue of the product and the request for rule change was filed by the Nasdaq Global Select Market to list the shares of iShares Ethereum Trust on its platform. Per the regulator, the proposed rule change which was published for comment in the Federal Register has received no feedback from the public to date.\n\nThe SEC noted that it needed additional time to deliberate on the application in order to make the right decision.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC wrote in the filing adding that in pursuant to its extant statutes, it now \u201cdesignates March 10, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d\n\nThis delay to BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF follows a related postponement of the application from rival Fidelity Investments. With the SEC liable for this postponement up to 240 days from the date of the first application, it is choosing to take its time appropriately.\n\nProspects of ETH ETFs\n\nThe emergence of spot Bitcoin ETF has heightened the optimism and the debate on the prospects of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States.\n\nAt the moment, there are divergent views on whether the markets regulator will greenlight this product but Commissioner Hester Peirce has reiterated how the agency has learned from past mistakes and will likely take a different path with the numerous Ethereum applications.\n\nWhile no one can say for sure the products will be approved, proponents believe a precedent has been set and with BlackRock in the race, the chances of securing the approvals are generally higher.\n\nBeyond spot Ethereum ETFs, speculations continue to grow that an XRP spot ETF might also be on the horizon."

        "content": "Blackrock gets delayed spot ETH ETF decision.\n\nETH hits six consecutive days of downtrends.\n\nFollowing the approval of Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETFs, the focus has shifted to Ethereum [ETH] spot ETF proposals submitted to the SEC. The prominent institutions that spearheaded spot BTC ETFs are now leading the way for spot ETH ETFs, with one having received a recent response from the SEC.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF approval extended\n\nBlackRock was one of the major institutions that recently secured approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF. The company is actively pursuing approval for a spot Ethereum ETF, as evidenced by its submitted documentation to the SEC.\n\nSome weeks ago, the CEO of BlackRock spoke positively about the value of a spot ETH ETF in an interview.\n\nUnfortunately, the SEC has deferred the realization of a spot ETH ETF.\n\nA document released by the SEC on the 24th of January showed that the regulatory body has opted for a decision extension. According to the document, the decision was delayed by an additional 45 days.\n\nMajor Ethereum spot ETF decisions not to come till May\n\nThe SEC\u2019s extension of the decision for BlackRock\u2019s application is not an isolated case; Fidelity recently received a similar response.\n\nThe SEC, mirroring its action with BlackRock, has extended its decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF. This trend suggests that other applications may encounter a similar response from the SEC.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, the delays are expected to be \u201csporadic\u201d in the upcoming months. Additionally, he anticipates that major decisions may unfold in May.\n\nETH decline persists\n\nDespite recent developments in ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s performance over the past few days has appeared unaffected. As of this writing, ETH has sustained a six-day consecutive downtrend.\n\nAlthough, the decline has been slight in the last two days, around 0.01% as of the latest data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, it has pushed the trend below its short-moving average (yellow line) for the first time in about four months. This suggests a weakening trend in the price, an observation also shown by its Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\nAt the time of writing, the RSI was around 40, indicating a strong bearish trend."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as Tesla Still Holds $380 Million BTC and Another ETH ETF Gets Delayed\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has recently reversed its downward trend, surpassing the significant $41,000 mark. This resurgence not only bolsters confidence in Bitcoin but also paves the way for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC), all of which have witnessed modest gains.\n\nThe overall crypto market cap now stands at an impressive $1.56 trillion, marking over 0.30% increase in the last 24 hours. This positive momentum in the crypto world is partly attributed to the burgeoning interest in Bitcoin ETFs, a development that underscores the cryptocurrency\u2019s growing acceptance in mainstream finance.\n\nConcurrently, Tesla\u2019s unwavering hold on $380 million worth of Bitcoin through Q4 2023 plays a critical role in shaping market sentiment, while the SEC\u2019s postponement of Grayscale and BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETFs introduces a layer of uncertainty in the ETH market.\n\nTesla\u2019s Q4 2023 Bitcoin Holdings: Influence on BTC Prices\n\n\n\nIn Q4 2023, Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings remained steady, as indicated in their recent earnings report released on Wednesday. The report didn\u2019t mention any Bitcoin transactions, suggesting no buying or selling during the quarter.\n\nCurrently valued at $387 million, Tesla owns approximately 9,720 BTC, ranking as the third-largest public holder after MicroStrategy and Marathon. Tesla initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February 2021, acquiring around 43,000 BTC.\n\n\ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udd12 Tesla's #Bitcoin holdings stand strong at $184 million since Dec 2022, according to the Q4 2023 earnings report. \ud83d\udcca No new purchases or sales, marking a period of inactivity in their #Crypto journey.#Tesla currently ranks fourth among public companies with 10,500 $BTC. \ud83c\udf10\u2026 \u2014 Bitcoinbsc (@Bitcoinbsctoken) January 25, 2024\n\nDespite selling 75% of their holdings in Q2 2022 amid COVID uncertainties, the electric car giant continues to maintain a substantial Bitcoin reserve.\n\n$BTC holdings of Elon Musk's Tesla, worth nearly $387 million at current prices, remained unchanged in Q4 2023.https://t.co/lPfhWkK8jj \u2014 David odeyale (@odeyale_david) January 26, 2024\n\nTherefore, Tesla maintaining its Bitcoin holdings in Q4 2023 signals stability, impacting BTC price sentiment positively. With Tesla holding a significant amount, investor confidence in Bitcoin could strengthen, potentially contributing to sustained or increased value.\n\nSEC Postpones Grayscale, BlackRock Ethereum ETFs: ETH Market Impact\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed a decision on Grayscale Investments\u2019 request to convert its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nHowever, BlackRock\u2019s similar application also faced a delay. The SEC has been cautious about spot crypto ETFs, recently allowing only spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Therefore, the delay in deciding on Grayscale and BlackRock\u2019s applications is not unexpected.\n\nIn no surprise, the @SECgov has delayed decisions on spot #etherETF applications from Grayscale and BlackRock.https://t.co/hLt54lbv7m \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) January 26, 2024\n\nThe filings raise questions about the similarities between spot Ethereum and spot bitcoin ETFs, addressing concerns like market manipulation and the size of the CME futures market. So, this echoes the SEC\u2019s previous inquiries about bitcoin.\n\nConsequently, the SEC\u2019s delay in approving spot ether ETFs from Grayscale and BlackRock has introduced uncertainty, potentially impacting Ethereum\u2019s price. Market participants keenly await regulatory decisions, as approval could positively influence ETH\u2019s value, while continued delays may introduce volatility.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

Still, starting mid-October, the assets rose as confidence that approval would be achieved went up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s market cap has increased by +68.8% since BlackRock first filed for their ETF, and the aggregate Altcoin Market Cap followed suit, rising by +68.9%,\u201d reads the report. \u201cHowever, Ethereum has seen more sluggish relative momentum, underperforming the wider altcoin space by -17%.\u201d\n\nNext, Glassnode has talked about the \u201cmarket cap dominance\u201d of these asset classes, which measures the percentage share they occupy in the total valuation of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe trend in the market cap dominances of these assets over the last few years | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nSince the FTX collapse in November 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance has notably risen. However, BTC hasn\u2019t taken a share of Ethereum as the second-largest coin\u2019s dominance has moved mostly sideways in this period. Instead, the altcoins and stablecoins are the ones who have lost dominance to Bitcoin.\n\nThe BTC spot ETFs finally gained approval earlier this month, but the event turned out to be a sell-the-news one for the asset. In this post-ETF era, though, a new narrative has appeared in the sector in the form of the ETH spot ETFs.\n\n\u201cShortly after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, several issuers have filed or suggested a willingness to advocate for a spot ETF for Ethereum,\u201d notes Glassnode. \u201cAlthough obtaining approval for an ETH-based ETF might be more challenging due to the SEC possibly considering Ether as more of an investment contract, the markets appeared to express optimism.\u201d\n\nAs the chart below shows, Ethereum\u2019s dominance against Bitcoin has gone up.\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have gone up for ETH recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nAs the graph shows, ETH\u2019s market cap dominance versus BTC has increased by about 2.9% since the latter\u2019s spot ETFs gained approval from the US SEC.\n\nThe altcoin side of the sector has seen a net rise in this period as well, but the alts haven\u2019t been able to keep up with ETH, as the latter has generally outperformed them.\n\nETH has gained market-share against the altcoins | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nIn total, Ethereum has earned 4.2% in global dominance. \u201cThis makes ETH the biggest winner in the post-ETF approval market movements,\u201d explains the analytics firm.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,230, up 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nETH has plunged over the last couple of days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Very under-explored sector for privacy improvements. Some \"fancy ZK\" but also some plain boring \"collect and track less stuff please\".https://t.co/dWOga6SMcI \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 26, 2024\n\nThe study evaluated 25 car brands, all of which received a \u201cPrivacy Not Included\u201d warning, indicating notable privacy deficiencies.\n\nThe study claims :\n\n\u201cAll but two of the 25 car brands we reviewed earned our \u201cding\u201d for data control, meaning only two car brands, Renault and Dacia (which are owned by the same parent company) say that all drivers have the right to have their personal data deleted.\u201d\n\nModern computerized vehicles are gathering extensive user data , from personal traits and location to driving habits, which goes beyond vehicle operation and is crucial for business activities like marketing.\n\nThe study also found that 56% of these brands share data with government authorities upon request, and 86% reportedly sell or share this information. Alarmingly, 92% of drivers in modern vehicles have no control over the data collected.\n\nThe report stated :\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough for the behemoth corporations that own the car brands to have all that personal information in their possession, to use for their own research, marketing, or the ultra-vague \u201cbusiness purposes.\u201d But then, most (84%) of the car brands we researched say they can share your personal data \u2014 with service providers, data brokers, and other businesses we know little or nothing about. Worse, nineteen (76%) say they can sell your personal data.\u201d\n\nWhat are ZK-Rollups? We researched it, so you don't have to. \ud83c\udfaf ZK stands for Zero-Knowledge. A kind of proof that mathematically validates the correctness of transactions without revealing their exact details.

In response, Buterin has clarified his position, affirming his support for various modern technologies, including certain AI applications.\n\nI embrace life extension, human genetic enhancement, artificial wombs, mind uploading, many kinds of modern AI (eg. I use it to make many pictures in my blog posts), geoengineering, ZK privacy, going to Mars\u2026 There's a small-but-important subset of things I worry about! \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 26, 2024\n\nHe emphasizes, however, his critical perspective on specific technologies that jeopardize privacy, underlining, \u201cThere\u2019s a small-but-important subset of things I worry about!\u201d\n\nAlarming Privacy Implications in the Modern Automotive Industry\n\nThe research has unveiled a troubling landscape in automotive data privacy. Each brand examined has been collecting more personal data than necessary, utilizing it for purposes beyond vehicle operation and customer relationship management. This issue isn\u2019t isolated to the automotive sector; it\u2019s reminiscent of the privacy challenges in mental health apps, yet the potential for data collection in cars is even more expansive. Vehicles can amass personal information through various channels, ranging from in-car interactions and connected services to external data sources like Sirius XM or Google Maps.\n\n.@WTKR3 \u2019s #CoastLive hosts discuss how cars are collecting and selling your data back to automakers for profit. Hey @CherylNelsonTV & @1AprilWoodard , we don\u2019t like that, either.

The depth and complexity of this data collection, including sensitive personal details, raise profound privacy concerns.\n\nThis trend suggests that car companies will exploit data privacy to the extent permissible by law. The modern automotive industry, therefore, not only represents a significant privacy risk but also highlights the urgent need for robust privacy regulations to protect consumers in an increasingly data-driven world."

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Only Bitcoin got ETF approval, dashing hopes for immediate Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSEC facing lawsuits from Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple while staying silent on the court cases.\n\nGarlinghouse criticizes the court-ordered path for Bitcoin ETFs, urging easier approval for future crypto ETFs.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, gary gensler gary gensler chairman at US Securities and Exchange Commision Gary Gensler is an enthusiastic leader and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has the extreme experience that spans wall street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. He announced several initiatives to enhance investor protections in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. He previously led the Biden-Harris transition\u2019s federal reserve, Banking, and securities regulation agency review team. He was awarded Treasury's highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Award, and also was a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize. He was born on October 18, 1957, into a Jewish family, in Baltimore, Maryland. Graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Master's degree in Business Administration. Additionally, he is also a professor at the MIT Sloan School of management. He has served in various governmental roles since the 1990s, such as the treasury department, Sarbanes-Oxley, CFTC, Swaps, Enforcement, Libor investigation, Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission, Securities, and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler will probably keep on filling in as seat of the SEC until 2026, accepting his renunciation. He has expressed his desires to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. A few officials as well as his kindred SEC magistrates have scrutinized Gensler for not giving adequate administrative direction on crypto, possibly prompting a standoff between Congress and the association. The SEC, CFTC, and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network handle advanced resource guidelines in the U.S., however, each with various jurisdictional cases, bringing about an interwoven methodology that crypto firms should explore to work legitimately. Whether 2022 will see a more clear way for organizations in the crypto space is questionable, yet the cosmetics of the SEC's initiative will fundamentally change following the takeoff of chief Elad Roisman in the first month of the year. Chief Allison Lee's term is likewise set to terminate in June 2022. Chairman , recently clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is limited to Bitcoin alone. Following the Bitcoin ETF approval, wild anticipations have arisen in hopes of spotting Ethereum ETFs. However, Gensler emphasized that the current focus is only on Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNaturally, this has caused an uproar. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nGensler\u2019s Highlights\n\nGary Gensler emphasized that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t extend to the approval of other cryptocurrency ETFs like Ethereum. He affirmed that the improved disclosure and competition in the Bitcoin ETF market had benefited investors with lower fees.\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, what we did about bitcoin exchange-traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou\u2019ve seen some competition in which investors benefited from lower fees.\u201d\n\nAmidst the celebrations, the SEC finds itself entangled in legal battles with major crypto players like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple. Gensler, maintaining a strategic silence, refrains from commenting on the ongoing court hearings involving these industry giants.\n\nTimeline Extended\n\nFollowing the media disclosure of Gensler, a court filing from the SEC on Wednesday announced the delay of its decision timeline on BlackRock\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund to March.\n\nThe filing revealed that the Nasdaq Stock Market filed a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust. For such a proposed rule change, the SEC is authorized to take 45-90 days to announce its decision.\n\nHence, because of this need for sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and related issues, the SEC has decided to extend the decision deadline to March 10, 2024.\n\nRead More About This: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nRipple CEO Speaks Out\n\nQuoting Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF comes with a mix of emotions, driven by the SEC\u2019s need for a court intervention. Garlinghouse warns against a repetitive journey for every ETF, highlighting the potential challenges.\n\n\u201cThe sad part of that reality is we have a Bitcoin ETF only because a US court said to the SEC \u201cYou\u2019re being arbitrary and capricious in your apply of your application of the law\u201d\u2026 What would be sad is if every ETF had to go through that same journey.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Decides to Stay Away from XRP ETFs; Here\u2019s Why"

        "content": "Ethereum Leads Weekly Altcoin Losses as Wider Market Sell-Off Continues\n\nThe crypto market remains in the red zone with altcoins and pack leader Ethereum (ETH) posting losses two weeks after the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn-chain data shows the price of several crypto assets trading at monthly lows. This comes in contrast to the uptick in prices towards the end of last year.\n\nThe recent sell-off can be seen across Bitcoin and a slew of altcoins as daily trading volumes of cryptocurrency plunge.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, daily trading volumes stood at $46.27 billion, a 6.61% decline from the previous day. This brings the total crypto market capitalization to $1.56 trillion.\n\nWith asset prices down, decentralized finance (DeFi) volumes have also plummeted and remain at $3.6 billion. At 7% of the entire crypto market, this shows reduced activity and sell-offs.\n\nEthereum Leads The Pack\n\n\n\nEthereum has recorded the biggest loss among altcoins in the top 20 ranked assets across the last seven days with its decline entering double figures.\n\nETH is down by 10.7% in a week at the time of writing and exchanges hands at $2,212, a 0.4% slight slump in the past 24 hours.\n\nLike most assets, Ethereum gained momentum in Q4 2023 after a slow start to the year coming off the 2022 bear market. The altcoin giant recorded 90% profits throughout the year notching institutional inflows and impressive DeFi numbers.\n\nHowever, gains posted in December have been wiped off amid the recent market correction. Bears are currently predicting a slightly lower price in the upcoming weeks. Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) had 6.69% and 6.4% losses in the past week to trade at $87.83 and $0.51 respectively.\n\nLike ETH, massive December gains recorded by SOL have been wiped out as the asset posts a monthly decline of 23.22%. XRP\u2019s monthly losses are at 17.63%. Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) have plunged 5.54% and 7.5% respectively in the past week with a larger 22% and 15.29% in the last 30 days.\n\nBitcoin Is Still in The Sell-off Mix\n\n\n\nAs the altcoin market remains in the red zone, Bitcoin\u2019s correction after the approval of spot ETFs has drawn opinions from several commentators with some stating that this was simply a sell-the-news event.\n\nThe months leading up to the approval were marked with an improved institutional investor appetite as the asset\u2019s price surged to levels not seen in months.\n\nThis was followed by predictions from analysts of a massive price gain after the approval as it became a new window for investors to increase their exposure to the top assets.\n\nMatrixport projected a $50,000 price for the asset in December and with the recent price correction, a new report has been released on a potential price decline to $36,739 before a rebound."

        "content": "Axiom, an emerging Ethereum data protocol, has secured $20 million in Series A funding for zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nA key technological underpinning of Axiom is its utilization of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs). These cryptographic tools verify transactions without disclosing their specific details. They are instrumental in enabling Axiom\u2019s method of accessing and processing Ethereum\u2019s historical data.\n\nAt the core of Axiom\u2019s innovation is its ability to grant smart contract developers the capacity to retrieve historical Ethereum data. The data is then processed externally, off the main blockchain network. This approach enhances efficiency and addresses some of the inherent limitations of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, specifically their inability to access older blockchain data directly.\n\nWe're excited to announce we've raised $20 million led by @paradigm and @standardcrypto, with participation from @robotventures and @etherealvc\n\n\n\nWe are building infrastructure to give smart contract developers access to more data on-chain. pic.twitter.com/M8q61KMid3 \u2014 Axiom (@axiom_xyz) January 25, 2024\n\nYou might also like: Trezor comments on phishing emails sent to community\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts have historically faced challenges in accessing old data, with solutions like oracles emerging to bridge this gap. However, these oracles have drawbacks, including high costs and computational constraints.\n\nAxiom\u2019s approach, which involves running an off-chain coprocessor that processes data and then syncs it back to the Ethereum blockchain with the validation of ZK proofs, presents a novel solution to these challenges \u2014 positioning Axiom as a pivotal player in the evolving landscape of blockchain data processing and access.\n\nThe funding round was primarily led by Paradigm and Standard Crypto, two notable entities in the crypto-investment space. The funding will be dedicated towards the enhancement of the protocol and the expansion of the team.\n\nRead more: UK Treasury and Bank of England yet to reach decision on digital pound\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Q1 Release on Track? Developers Confirm Schedule Despite Initial Snags - DailyCoin",
        "content": "A recent announcement from Ethereum core developers suggests that the Dencun upgrade is still on schedule.\n\nThe stance comes despite challenges experienced in the network\u2019s first outing on Goerli.\n\nThe disclosure strengthens expectations of a Q1 2024 Dencun mainnet release.\n\nFor members of the Ethereum community, 2024 promises to be an exciting year. One of the reasons for this excitement is the expected rollout of the long-anticipated Dencun upgrade, which would introduce proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, marking the first step in a multi-year vision to address Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges.\n\nOn January 17, the Dencun upgrade finally made it to an Ethereum testnet after nearly a year of anticipation, with developers and enthusiasts hoping for a Q1 2024 mainnet release. However, bugs and challenges experienced during this testnet release had sparked concerns of further delays. These concerns have now been put to rest by a recent Ethereum Protocol Support team announcement.\n\nEthereum Dencun Still on Track\n\nIn December 2023, Ethereum core developers rolled out tentative dates for the Dencun upgrade to launch on Ethereum\u2019s testnets. In line with this schedule, developers rolled out the Dencun upgrade on Goerli, Ethereum\u2019s soon-to-be deprecated testnet for staking infrastructure and protocol level changes, on January 17. But amid a launch marred by bugs and challenges, there had been questions about how the schedule could be impacted.\n\nIn a Wednesday, January 24 announcement, however, developers have suggested that there would be no change to the Dencun upgrade schedule. The announcement confirmed that upgrades on Sepolia, Ethereum\u2019s sandbox for testing DApps, smart contract, and EVM functionality, and Holesky, Goerli\u2019s planned replacement, would occur as scheduled on January 30 and February 7, respectively.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO\n\n\n\nDencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it!\n\n\n\nAssuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nTo this end, developers have urged validators to upgrade to Dencun-supported clients on Sepolia and Holesky to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Developers also highlighted the risks of choosing majority clients amid recent client centralization debates within the Ethereum community. The discussion has sparked fear of a single bug, causing users to lose their stake through a chain split.\n\nDencun\u2019s Rocky Start on Goerli\n\nMultiple issues plagued Dencun\u2019s first testnet outing, including a failure to achieve finality and a chain split. Developers attributed the former to low network participation from validators, while the latter was attributed to a bug in Prysm nodes. These issues were, however, resolved in a few hours as developers confirmed that the network was finalizing again.\n\nFinality is the guarantee that crypto transactions cannot be reversed once they are executed.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nUnforeseen challenges on Sepolia and Holesky could still impact the Dencun launch timeline.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 chains will benefit the most from proto-danksharding, which promises to cut fees for end users by shaving the cost of data storage on the mainnet.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a long-anticipated upgrade that promises to bring Ethereum one step closer to solving scaling concerns. The recent announcement from developers suggests that the upgrade is still on track to launch in Q1 2024.\n\nRead this for more on Dencun\u2019s first outing woes:\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Hits Snags in First Testnet Outing\n\n\n\nPolygon\u2019s interoperability layer is coming.

        "content": "The SEC chair said that the Bitcoin ETF approval stays limited to one commodity, hinting that the agency isn\u2019t thinking of approving an Ethereum ETF. Also, the agency delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Wednesday, January 24, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month remains limited to this single cryptocurrency and one shouldn\u2019t interpret it to have any broader implications beyond it. Gensler\u2019s comments come at a time when top financial players including BlackRock and Fidelity have been pushing for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn his briefing yesterday, the SEC chair said:\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, that which we did with regard to bitcoin exchange traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, crypto experts remain confident that a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming this year. Previously, some analysts have stated that the approval could come by May 2024.\n\nAdditionally, on Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the decision for BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal, pushing the deadline to March 10. Until then, the regulatory body has time to make a decision. The SEC can either approve, disapprove, or initiate further proceedings on the proposed fund. The filing from the SEC reads:\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d\n\nBlackRock submitted the proposal for its spot Ethereum ETF last year in November 2023. Additionally, Fidelity\u2019s application for the spot Ethereum ETF is also facing delays, as filed by the SEC last week.\n\nSEC\u2019s Legal Battles\n\nThe US SEC remains embroiled in legal battles with multiple crypto firms including top names like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple.\n\nIn June, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance Holdings and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging deceptive practices towards customers, failure to restrict US investors, channeling funds to investment funds owned by Zhao, and unregistered exchange operations. The SEC also identified 12 tokens, including BNB and BUSD, as securities.\n\nSimilarly, Coinbase faced an SEC lawsuit in June, accused of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. When questioned about recent court hearings, SEC Chair Gensler deferred to the agency\u2019s enforcement staff and litigators for specific details.\n\n\u201cBut stepping back from any one case, I just think that the investing public, if they\u2019re interested in investing in crypto securities, they should be aware and careful that these crypto security tokens are not necessarily giving them the appropriate disclosures and they\u2019re not getting those disclosures from these non-compliant token operators,\u201d said Gensler."

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius has shifted 459,561 Ethereum (ETH), valued at over $1 billion, to centralized exchanges, including Coinbase, Paxos, and FalconX, in the past 24 hours, per on-chain data.\n\nIn detail, more than 300,000 ETH, equivalent to $673 million, was sent to Coinbase Prime. The firm also moved 146,507 ETH, valued at around $323.3 million, to Paxos, and another 7,800 ETH, worth $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX.\n\nThis latest transfer follows a series of similar fund movements by Celsius in recent days. On Jan. 24, blockchain investigator Lookonchain reported that the firm deposited 18,000 ETH, worth $40 million, to Coinbase.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto analytical platform Spot on Chain provided a more in-depth analysis of the transfers. According to the firm, Celsius has deposited 740,321 ETH, worth an estimated $1.69 billion, to centralized exchanges, including FalconX, Coinbase, OKX, and Paxos, since November 2023.\n\nHowever, despite these transactions, the firm still holds a sizeable amount of ETH. Its address retains 62,468 ETH, approximately $139 million as of press time.\n\nWhy is Celsius making these transfers?\n\nSpot On Chain\u2019s analysis suggests the possibility of an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction, as around 97.2% of the total deposited funds to Coinbase were withdrawn to 12 newly created wallets.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that 12 fresh wallets have withdrawn 296,835 $ETH (660M) from Coinbase shortly after Celsius deposited $ETH to the CEX, accounting for ~97.2% of the total deposited amount. This is probably an OTC deal,\u201d the firm said.\n\nMeanwhile, the motive behind the transfer remains undisclosed. But it coincides with creditors\u2019 anticipation of a potential repayment launch in February.\n\nOn Jan. 25, the Celsius Newco Community suggested that the firm had an effective date of Jan. 31, with expectations of distributing liquid crypto to Earn Creditors starting mid-February.\n\nA Celsius distribution FAQ hints at Coinbase being the platform of choice for creditor repayments in specific countries. Eighty-nine countries (excluding the United States) are eligible for the Coinbase distribution.\n\nThe Celsius Creditors Community group on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) also includes several creditors of the failed firm, who reveal that they received instructions to prepare for their Celsius distribution via Coinbase."

        "content": "Thu 25 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nBlackRock, the financial giant, unveils its ambitions with an application for a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the US SEC is playing for time, pushing the decision to March. Larry Fink, confident, aims for approval, but Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, leaves doubt hanging in the air. Between hopes and uncertainties, the crypto world is holding its breath.\n\nA Spot Ethereum ETF in March, really?\n\nFollowing the dance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, BlackRock now wants to take Ethereum spot trading for a spin. Larry Fink, the maestro at BlackRock, firmly believes in his ETH Spot ETF, already approved on January 10 alongside a myriad of other products. A vivid wish that, according to him, will rocket ETH into the stars of institutional finance.\n\nBut the SEC is not ready to be easily swept away by these ETH Spot ETFs.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has pushed back the timetable for a decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF until March. The SEC now faces a March 10 deadline to approve, reject or take additional proceedings against the proposed fund. The next important date to watch is May 23,\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2024\n\n\u201cThe US SEC has postponed the timeline for the decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed Spot Ethereum ETF to March. The SEC now has until March 10 to approve, reject, or initiate further proceedings against the proposed fund. The next important date to watch is May 23, according to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg.\u201c\n\nAccording to The Block, the SEC has announced that it will not make any decisions on these spot Ethereum ETFs before March. March 10th could be the day when the SEC, with its regulatory broom, will sweep through the approval requests from BlackRock, ARK 21 Shares, VanEck, and Fidelity.\n\nAs usual, Bloomberg\u2019s keen financial analyst, James Seyffart, has looked into his crystal ball regarding the Ethereum ETFs. Predicting their validation in May, he left this gem on his account X:\n\n\u201cThe delays of the Spot Ethereum ETFs will continue to occur sporadically over the coming months. The next date that counts is May 23\u201c\n\nGary Gensler, the SEC\u2019s dance master, has his say!\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs are stirring up passions among analysts: between those who already see the SEC saying \u201cyes\u201d to an ETH waltz and the skeptics who rather hear a resounding \u201cno.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, the current conductor of the SEC, has already suggested that for spot trackers linked to assets other than Bitcoin, the music might not play in their favor.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned two weeks ago, our playbook for exchange-traded products linked to Bitcoin is confined to this product in particular. There\u2019s no need to read anything more into it\u201c, he stated on Wednesday.\n\nFor the record, BlackRock\u2019s application for a Spot Ethereum ETF was filed in November 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Report Shows Polygon Users Rivaled Ethereum In 2023, But Why Has Price Failed To Clear $1? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Layer-2 network Polygon is reported to have competed with Ethereum in 2023, as both networks saw the most influx of new users. This development has once again raised concerns about MATIC\u2019s price, considering that such an achievement should potentially mean that new money moved into the ecosystem last year.\n\nPolygon and Ethereum Acquired The Most Users In 2023\n\nAccording to a report by Blockchain analytics firm Flipside, Polygon and Ethereum led the pack with 30.6 million acquired users in 2023. Giving a further breakdown, Polygon is said to have acquired 15,24 million users, while Ethereum attracted 15.4 million users. Meanwhile, these users are defined as persons who performed at least two transactions on the networks.\n\nDespite falling about 160,000 short of Ethereum\u2019s numbers, Polygon\u2019s numbers are still impressive, considering that it ranked ahead of other networks like Bitcoin and Solana. The layer-2 network also outperformed other Ethereum L2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, which recorded 7.3 million, 3.3 million, and 1.9 million acquired users, respectively.\n\nNotably, Polygon hit the ground running as soon as 2023 began, setting the record for monthly acquired users with 2 million in January. Interestingly, January 2023 was the first time MATIC rose above $1 in a very long while. It held above that level until the end of April 2023. After that, MATIC traded below that level for most of the year, only rising above $1 towards the end of December 2023.\n\nMATIC price at $0.74 | Source: MATICUSDT on Tradingview.com\n\nWhy Has MATIC Failed To Rise And Hold Above $1\n\nA recent analysis by Blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos suggested that the Polygon team has been secretly selling off MATIC tokens, something which could have accounted for the significant sell pressures that have risen at different times for the crypto token. This could also serve as a plausible explanation for why MATIC has struggled to hold above $1 despite enjoying great utility.\n\nThe Polygon team was accused of not executing its token allocations in line with the publicly stated plan, with part of the allocated funds accounting for some of the tokens that were sold. These secret sales, which have for long gone under the radar, are said to be circumvented through wallets linked to the crypto exchange Binance.\n\nSo far, about 767 million MATIC have apparently been offloaded in these secret transactions. ChainArgos hinted at how these transactions have no doubt affected MATIC\u2019s price on different occasions, as they noted that the outflows are a \u201cgood indicator for an upcoming top and subsequent move lower.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, MATIC is trading at around $0.73, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from CoinGape, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Polygon Nearly Matches Ethereum in Crypto User Acquisition in 2023\n\nLayer-2 scaling network Polygon (MATIC) came close to matching Ethereum (ETH) in terms of crypto user acquisition in 2023.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Flipside, Polygon acquired an impressive 15.24 million users during the year, falling just shy of Ethereum\u2019s 15.4 million users.\n\nTo define an \u201cacquired\u201d user, Flipside considered individuals who conducted at least two transactions on a specific blockchain, with at least one transaction occurring in 2023.\n\nIs the bull is really here? How can we tell? Data. Sentiment isn't the only thing that's changed lately. According to the data, user behavior is shifting \u2014 and with it, crypto markets. We cover it all in The Onchain Crypto User Report \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/IsclNOZhJk \u2014 Flipside \ud83d\udcca (@flipsidecrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nPolygon Exceeded Ethereum in User Acquisition in First Half\n\n\n\nNotably, Polygon took the lead in user acquisition during the first half of the year but was eventually surpassed by Ethereum, which maintained its lead throughout the second half.\n\nFlipside highlighted Polygon\u2019s strong start to the year, with 2.8 million acquired users in January alone, accounting for over 40% of the network\u2019s total acquired users for 2023.\n\n\u201cFrom there, Polygon experienced the most consistent decline in monthly user acquisition over the year in relative terms, but still compared favorably with more other networks,\u201d the report added.\n\nWhile Polygon experienced a relatively consistent decline in monthly user acquisition throughout the year, it still fared favorably compared to other networks.\n\nBitcoin secured the third position with 10.65 million acquired users, while Solana and Arbitrum rounded out the top five.\n\nIn total, the eight tracked blockchains recorded 62 million acquired users, which included Optimism, Avalanche, and Base.\n\nFlipside observed that user acquisition peaked in May before gradually declining.\n\nFlipside noted a possible connection between the increase in acquired users and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, which may have led to a loss of confidence in centralized entities, prompting a shift towards decentralized custody alternatives.\n\n\u201cThe acquired user increase began in March, coinciding with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which may have shaken confidence in centralized entities and ignited a flee to decentralized custody alternatives.\u201d\n\nBase Saw a Decline in User Base after Strong Growth\n\n\n\nRegarding Base, which launched in August, Flipside stated that it enjoyed a strong start but experienced a tapering off in user volume towards the end of 2023.\n\nThe firm attributed this decline to renewed enthusiasm for more established chains with robust and diverse app ecosystems.\n\nHowever, Flipside believes that Base\u2019s user growth could benefit from the next bull run, especially considering Coinbase\u2019s efforts to serve as a gateway for new users in the crypto space.\n\nAs reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now has a market share of 49.17% among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share.\n\nThe network has also seen a consistent increase in its TVL at least since October last year, rising about 50% from $1.66 billion in October to the current value of $2.51 billion, data from DeFi tracking site DefiLlama showed.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade, incorporating changes proposed by EIP-4844, is expected to reduce rollup transaction costs, benefiting layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum by lowering gas fees and improving network capacity."

For BTC, with a put/call ratio of 0.52 and a defined \u2018max pain point\u2019 at $41,000, there lies significant open interest of over $360 million at a strike price of $50,000.\n\nThe ETH options highlight a different scenario, evidenced by a lower put/call ratio of 0.31 and a \u2018max pain point of $2,300. There is also significant open interest of around $200 million at the price of $2400.\n\nSuch figures foretell potential fluctuation in the digital asset market following the options expiration at 8:00 AM UTC, Jan. 26."

The current status of the spot Ethereum ETF applications in this regard remains uncertain.\n\nThis week\u2019s developments include the SEC inviting public input on several questions related to these applications. A key query for consideration is whether a spot Ethereum ETF would bear similarities to its Bitcoin counterpart, indicating a new phase of scrutiny and public engagement in the process of evaluating Ethereum-based ETFs.\n\nThe filing asked :\n\n\u201cDo commenters agree that arguments to support the listing of Bitcoin ETPs apply equally to the Shares?

These inquiries delve into issues of market manipulation, the correlation between spot and futures markets, and whether the CME futures market for Ethereum is sufficiently large.\n\nThe final deadline for the Spot #Ethereum ETF is in 124 days! pic.twitter.com/vjSpzGWsUG \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 22, 2024\n\nAmid regulatory deliberations, optimists are predicting that spot Ethereum-ETFs could be adopted by the summer of 2024. This optimistic outlook hinges on a forthcoming decision by the CFTC and the SEC, which is expected to clarify whether Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by capitalization, does not meet the criteria of a security.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov . \u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nExperts suggest that the ongoing trial involving Binance could provide much-needed clarity regarding Ethereum\u2019s status in terms of securities law.\n\nSEC Commissioner Talks Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nHester Peirce, often called \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d for her positive stance on cryptocurrencies, has highlighted the correlation between futures and spot markets in cryptocurrencies, which could influence the SEC\u2019s decision-making process. Her\u2026 \u2014 guardando user (@notouchbitch) January 26, 2024\n\nBinance\u2019s Challenges Signal a Path to Mainstream Crypto Adoption\n\nThis anticipation stems from discussions in previous meetings, particularly the reference to DAO tokens being considered securities. The outcome of the Binance trial is seen as potentially pivotal in establishing a clearer regulatory framework for Ethereum and similar cryptocurrencies.\n\nBinance\u2019s regulatory challenges are indicative of a broader trend affecting the crypto industry, with global regulators increasingly demanding transparency from crypto exchanges. This heightened scrutiny isn\u2019t limited to regulatory bodies; major banks have also limited Binance\u2019s access, reflecting a broader reevaluation of their stance on crypto.\n\nThe primary concerns cited are risks related to money laundering. However, this intensified regulatory focus on Binance and other crypto firms doesn\u2019t signal an end for the industry. Instead, it suggests the onset of a more regulated and potentially mainstream future for crypto assets and exchanges."

        "content": "Celsius has sent more Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase.\n\nThe bankrupt crypto lender may not sell all its exchange deposits despite fears.\n\nThe moves come as Celsius is expected to launch asset distribution to customers and creditors soon.\n\nDespite the recent crypto market recovery recorded in 2023, the unwinding of assets tied to crypto firms that went under in the 2022 bear market has continued to loom large over the market.\n\nIn November 2023, Celsius, one of the bankrupt firms, gained approval to proceed with restructuring plans that required a $75 million wind-down budget and about $225 million in fiat to capitalize a new creditor-owned mining firm. Following the plan\u2019s approval, crypto market participants braced for the selling pressure, anticipating massive sell-offs in Ethereum (ETH), the firm\u2019s most significant holding, amid efforts to raise the capital.\n\nBeyond the $300 million mark, however, the firm\u2019s ETH exchange deposits have not slowed down, sparking further concern about a continued sell-off.\n\nCelsius Strikes Again?\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Celsius has moved another 18,000 ETH worth approximately $40 million to Coinbase, bringing its total ETH transfer to exchanges, including FalconX and OKX, since the approval of its restructuring plan near 281,000 ETH (about $621 million), twice the selling volume most market participants anticipated.\n\nWith the firm holding at least 550,000 ETH worth over $1.2 billion at current rates, according to Arkham Intelligence data at the time of writing, market participants are understandably concerned.\n\nIs Celsius Network Selling All Its Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nDespite the concerns, Celsius is unlikely to sell all its ETH as some fear. Per the firm\u2019s recently approved restructuring plan, it is committed to settling most creditor claims, including an estimated $2.1 billion allocation to retail customers, with a mix of liquid crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, and Tether (USDT).\n\nContrary to the broad market perception, in line with this plan, Celsius may not be selling all of its exchange deposits, particularly its Coinbase deposits, since January 5. At the time, the bankrupt lender noted that it would be unstaking ETH to ensure timely distribution. The firm\u2019s restructuring plan names Coinbase as a distribution partner.\n\nWhen Will Distribution Start?\n\nWhile Celsius\u2019 restructuring plan intends to see the firm exit bankruptcy by Q1 2024, it is unclear when it will start distributing assets to creditors and customers. However, some speculate that it could begin as early as the end of January 2024.\n\ncelsius distributions planned for jan 31 also \u2014 Fabian D. (@_FabianHD) January 16, 2024\n\nAt its peak, Celsius was a leading crypto lender valued at over $3 billion. However, following the crypto market collapse hastened by the Terra Luna crash, the firm was revealed to be \u201cdeeply insolvent\u201d amid shady finance and risk management practices. At the time, the firm had 600,000 customers who held about $4.4 billion in assets on the platform.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFormer Celsius customers have expressed concerns about the capabilities of US Bitcoin, the firm assigned to manage the new creditor-owned Bitcoin mining firm. The concerns come as some argue that the firm is presently in a weakened financial position.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCelsius\u2019 continuous Ethereum exchange deposits have sparked concerns of significant selling pressure on the asset among investors.\n\nRead this for more on Celsius\u2019 Ethereum transfers:\n\nCelsius Network Moves ETH Worth $125M: Is a Sell-off Looming?\n\n\n\nFind out what Chainlink Automation brings to Base:\n\nHere\u2019s What Chainlink Automation Brings to Coinbase\u2019s Base"

        "title": "3 Web3 Cryptos With the Potential for Major Metaverse Moves - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The metaverse hype train veered sharply off the tracks in late-2021 as crypto markets soured. This left many virtual worlds feeling more like ghost towns. But while metaverse mania has cooled considerably, I believe the long-term growth narrative for Web3 and immersive digital environments remains intact. Cyclical downturns are par for the course in crypto, and today\u2019s laggards can spearhead gains when the next bull run begins.\n\nSeveral catalysts on the horizon could re-ignite \u201cmeta mania\u201d and crypto bullishness more broadly in 2024 and beyond. More Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF approvals, block reward halvings, and potential Fed rate cuts could all fuel digital assets. We\u2019ll look at some top projects today instead of small-cap cryptos. Here are three to consider based on their ties to Web3 and the metaverse.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nA coin with the Ethreum logo on top of a financial document\n\nSource: shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) remains the go-to cryptocurrency for anyone seeking major exposure to the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Even if the recent metaverse and NFT frenzies have cooled, Ethereum still stands as the leading blockchain underpinning countless decentralized apps and services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEthereum\u2019s key edge over Bitcoin relates to its support for smart contracts and advanced functionality beyond payments. As the dominant Web3 blockchain, most projects being built in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse, increasingly rely on Ethereum\u2019s global computing network. Users of these apps must pay gas fees in Ethereum, creating perpetual demand even during bear markets.\n\nThis wide utility and role as the \u201cfuel\u201d of Web3 is why Ethereum has massively outperformed Bitcoin in previous bull runs. And with the major Dencon upgrade slated to launch by mid-2024, I expect Ethereum\u2019s advantage over Bitcoin to widen further in the next cycle. Dencon aims to slash Ethereum gas fees by up to 90% while accelerating layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\nSo, if we do get an influx of new crypto buyers and restore Web3 hype, I anticipate Ethereum providing major upside. We could see surging decentralized application usage, NFT sales volume growth, and higher gas consumption pushing Ethereum prices significantly higher, perhaps even to new highs. For broad exposure to a potential Web3 resurgence, Ethereum remains the leading crypto to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nAbstract 3d rendered coin solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: solvertv / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven if the upcoming Dencon cuts Ethereum fees and enhances layer-2 capabilities, transacting and building on Ethereum will likely remain pricier and more cumbersome than alternatives like Solana (SOL-USD).\n\nWith lightning-fast speeds and rock-bottom fees, Solana presents a compelling Web3 option for both developers and users. It has already successfully peeled off market share from Ethereum in NFT trading volume and other areas like DeFi.\n\nI expect the network effects and composability benefits of building on a high-activity chain like Solana to help it gain additional traction if we enter a fresh bull cycle, particularly if congestion and high gas fees resurface on Ethereum amid surging usage.\n\nOf course, Solana still has progress to make, notably in improving its network reliability and uptime. However, the Solana team has made big strides in optimizing stability and mitigating outages over the past year.\n\nGiven the immense room for adoption and growth, I think Solana\u2019s price levels around $90 per token seem attractive. Despite its early-stage flaws, Solana remains one of my top altcoin picks for mega returns if the Web3 and metaverse themes catch fire again.\n\nRender Token (RNDR-USD)\n\nThe Render (RNDR) crypto logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike Ethereum and Solana, which are essentially generalized Web3 blockchains, Render Token (RNDR-USD) and the Render Network target a specific niche \u2013 GPU graphics processing power.\n\nRender operates a network that lets users easily buy and sell excess graphics and compute resources for rendering 3D visuals, animations, models, and more. This on-demand access allows smaller creators to tap into strong GPU performance without substantial up-front investment.\n\nAs metaverse and Web3 content creation pick back up, Render stands to see surging demand from various verticals like architectural and product visualization, special effects, advertisements, video game development, and VR/AR experiences.\n\nIn fact, Render\u2019s native token RNDR has already rocketed higher in recent months \u2013 surging from around 40 cents to current levels approaching $4. I expect this momentum to continue over 2023 and 2024 if the overall environment improves for cryptos and its futuristic applications.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the options market currently shows a bias for price weakness over the next three months. The one-week call-put skew for Ether has fallen to its lowest level in over three months, indicating a preference for bets that Ether's price will decline."

        "content": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Timelines Shared For Sepolia and Holesky Testnets \u2013 Mainnet Next?\n\nThe highly anticipated Ethereum hard fork Dencun is gearing up for its testnet debut on Sepolia and Holesky in the upcoming weeks.\n\nConfirming this development in a recent blog post, the Ethereum Protocol Support Team stated that the latest upgrade to the smart contract network is scheduled for January 30 and February 7.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, a part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) series, will introduce the \u2018proto-danksharding\u2019 feature, which runs on data blobs. It is duly denoted with the EIP-7569 tag, and the \u2018proto-danksharding\u2019 feature is only one of the offerings.\n\nOnce they hit the public Ethereum blockchain, data blobs are expected to be more storage efficient and radically reduce layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions\u2019 rollup costs and transaction fees.\n\nCurrently, the Dencun hard fork is being battle-tested on the Goerli testnet after making its official launch on January 17.\n\nOn January 30, it would migrate to the Sepolia testnet and make its final stand on Holesky on February 7. If the testing phase proceeds without significant issues, the Dencun upgrade is slated to transition to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO Dencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it! Assuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nDelving into the details, the Ethereum Protocol Support Team stated that the Sepolia testnet series for Dencun will activate at 22:51:12 UTC at the epoch height of 132608. The first epoch confirming its slot succession will kick in at 4243456.\n\nOn the other hand, Holesky\u2019s launch is scheduled for 11:34:24 at the epoch height of 29696, with its first epoch slot going online at 950272.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade follows in the footsteps of the Shapella upgrade, which activated staking on the Beacon Chain after the Ethereum blockchain switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nSimilar to Shapella, Dencun introduces nine features, including transient storage opcodes (EIP-1153), Beacon block root in the EVM (EIP-4788), shard blob transactions (EIP-4844), and six others.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Approval Delayed\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network is the second most valuable blockchain-based protocol after the Bitcoin network.\n\nControlling as much as 19% of the emerging industry, Ethereum is home to everything powered by smart contracts, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith so many use cases, the protocol has garnered comparable or even lesser recognition than the Bitcoin network, with several legacy-backed asset management firms looking to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) products underlying the network.\n\nOne such entity is Grayscale Asset Management, which has recently encountered a delay from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAnd another one \u2026 @SECGov delays @Grayscale Spot Ethereum ETF application. IMO: All Ethereum ETFs will be delayed pending a conclusion to the Coinbase and Binance SEC hearings. The president to approve this ETF applies to all Proof Of Stake projects and will be delayed until\u2026 \u2014 MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 25, 2024\n\nAlthough the Grayscale spot Ethereum ETF, like others, faces a temporary setback, many anticipate its eventual approval. The product is designed to track the Ethereum network\u2019s performance and provide users with tokenized securities underlying the digital asset."

        "title": "SEC Pushes Decision On BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Proposal To March - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has pushed its deadline for a decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) to March.\n\nA Jan. 24 filing shows that the top securities watchdog \u201cfinds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d\n\nThe SEC made the deferral just a day before the Jan. 25 deadline. This is the first of many delays the agency can exercise within a 240-day period. The SEC\u2019s next deadline to approve, disapprove, or further delay the BlackRock spot ETH ETF decision is on March 10.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager with over $9 trillion in assets under management, applied for a spot ether ETF in November 2023. After the approval of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 10, BlackRock boss Larry Fink said he\u2019s all in on a spot ETH ETF in a CNBC interview, adding that the introduction of such funds \u201care just stepping stones towards tokenization.\u201d\n\nOther prominent companies such as Ark Invest, VanEck, Fidelity, and Grayscale are also seeking to launch their own Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNext date that matters is May 23rd,\u201d said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 24, further noting that he expects more spot Ether ETF delays \u201csporadically\u201d in the coming months.\n\nWill Spot Ether ETFs Need Lawsuits And Appeals To Be Approved?\n\nStrategists have forecasted that ETH ETF applications will be successful, as the legal realities that pushed the SEC to give the nod to Bitcoin ETFs reluctantly will likely also apply to ether.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d Peirce recently suggested that a drawn-out court battle won\u2019t be necessary to convince the Commission to approve spot Ether applications.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right,\u201d Peirce told a Coinage interviewer, referencing the landmark Grayscale court ruling that preceded the greenlighting of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.\n\nIf approved, it would be the first time professional American investors can gain exposure to the industry\u2019s second-largest crypto by market cap, ether.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs would further legitimize Ethereum\u2019s status in mainstream finance, leading to intensified interest and investment in ether-based projects."
