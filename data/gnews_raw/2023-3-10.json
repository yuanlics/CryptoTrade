        "title": "New York Attorney General says ETH is a security - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Continuing the regulatory clampdown on the cryptocurrency sector, the New York Attorney General has alleged that the Ethereum network token ETH is a security. It made the assertion in a lawsuit filed against crypto exchange KuCoin, alleging that it is operating in New York state without licenses as a commodities broker-dealer and securities broker-dealer.\n\nJoe Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys, was a major backer of Ethereum in the early days and had a big chunk of ETH at the time of its initial coin offering (ICO). ConsenSys is heavily involved in both crypto and enterprise applications of Ethereum including as maintainer of the Quorum enterprise blockchain. Ethereum was the first permissionless blockchain to show potential for various applications beyond payment, including real world solutions.\n\nBackground: A security or a commodity?\n\nBitcoin is generally considered a commodity, in part because it didn\u2019t have an ICO. But we\u2019ll come back to that. ETH is considered a commodity by the CFTC, and a 2018 speech by SEC Director William Henman implied that ETH probably was a commodity as well.\n\nThe well known Howey test looks at an investment contract. To determine if it\u2019s a security, it asks whether it involves:\n\nThe investment of money\n\nin a common enterprise\n\nwith a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.\n\nHinman (sort of) added a \u2018sufficiently decentralized\u2018 test: \u201cIf the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized \u2013 where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts \u2013 the assets may not represent an investment contract.\u201d\n\nHence, it was thought ETH probably was a security at the time of the ICO, but by 2018, perhaps it was not.\n\nIs it about staking or new legal precedents?\n\nThe NYAG court filing includes the following text, which interprets ETH as an investment and also references staking activities.\n\nThe court case states, \u201cETH satisfies the Waldstein test. The ICO was used to raise funds to develop the Ethereum network, as set forth in the ICO Documents. And Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retained large positions of ETH that they continue to use to fund ETH\u2019s development. ETH was also designed as an investment. It continues to be referred to as an \u201cinvestment\u201d on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website. And ETH is used to generate staking rewards for investors. Furthermore, ETH was used to promote the Ethereum enterprise because ETH is needed to process any transactions on the Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in the document about the ICO and staking.\n\nBut the NYAG filing also leans on a recent court case in late 2022 where a summary judgment ruled that the LBRY-issued LBC token was a security based on the Howey test. LBRY did not conduct an ICO, and LBC was designed as a utility token for a video network.\n\nAn interpretation of the ruling highlighted that LBRY and insiders retained significant quantities of the token, which reinforces the third prong of the Howey test of an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others. However, the alignment of interests is also evidence of a common enterprise. Ropes & Gray argued the case collapsed Howey prongs two and three into a single argument contrary to court precedent.\n\nThe law firm added, \u201cThere are numerous reasons for a project to retain portions of its own coin that would not relate to an expectation that the coin will increase in value. For example, a project may retain a portion of its own coins to facilitate validation of transactions on a proof-of-stake network.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the trial between the SEC and Ripple over whether or not XRP is a security has yet to conclude after starting under the previous administration."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Crashing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have had a rough couple of days as word spread that the influential Silicon Valley Bank, which trades under SVB Financial Group (SIVB.Q 8361.54%), is facing a liquidity crisis. While this isn't directly a hit to crypto, many venture capital firms use Silicon Valley Bank, so there's a risk of a broader financial impact, which is why cryptocurrencies are down Friday.\n\nAs of 10:30 a.m. ET, Bitcoin (BTC 0.90%) had fallen by 8.5% over the prior 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH 1.41%) had fallen 8.8%, and Solana (SOL -1.36%) was down 5.7%. Looking further back, over the past seven days, those cryptocurrencies are down 11.2%, 10.7%, and 18.5% respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nThe two major events of the past week have been the collapse of Silvergate Capital and the potential collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Silvergate provided a direct gateway into cryptocurrencies for many wealthy investors and institutions, and even operates many publicly traded funds. But it was seen as a more crypto-specific bank.\n\nThis week's bank run on Silicon Valley Bank is more concerning for the broader tech ecosystem. It is used by many start-ups and provides services small companies need in order to scale their businesses quickly.\n\nContagion, or cascading risks from one entity to another, is the biggest fear here. That could lead to less lending and investors pulling back their investments. Silicon Valley's venture capital firms provide the fuel for the tech ecosystem, and anything that impacts them could impact a lot of smaller start-ups.\n\nAs far as crypto goes, dozens of blockchain start-ups have been funded by venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. If they face pressure from regulators, banks and ultimately, investors, they may not be able to build the tools and services that are intended to make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana more useful, and thus more valuable.\n\nIn short, these ecosystems are intertwined, and the fear this week is that a collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will make this crypto winter even worse.\n\nNow what\n\nThe risk to financial institutions can't be understated because they're critical to making the financial system work. When lending pulls back all at once or there's a credit crisis, there can be an economywide impact, as we saw in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe Labor Department's February jobs report Friday morning did provide some positive news. The U.S. economy added 311,000 non-farm jobs last month, but more people entered the workforce to seek jobs, so the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%. So far, the tech sector slowdown, the crypto collapse, and the downfall of some banks haven't spilled over to the broader economy.\n\nInvestors with a long-term view should start looking at this as a buying opportunity for high-quality cryptocurrencies. Despite the downturn in token values, the crypto industry continues to grow and innovate, which is ultimately what's going to drive value.\n\nI don't know if we are at or even near the bottom, but I am betting on innovation in the blockchain winning in the long term. The Ethereum and Solana blockchains are where most developers are building, and that's where I'm looking to be a buyer if this crash gets worse."

        "content": "Neeraj Agrawal, the Director of Communications at Coin Center, disagreed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s (NYAG) recent assessment of Ethereum as a security.\n\n\u201cCoin Center will be monitoring the case and if there\u2019s an opportunity to weigh in, we will.\u201d\n\nIn support of this view, Agrawal linked a 2018 article arguing that there is a difference between \u201ca token pre-sale and the token itself.\u201d\n\nApplicable securities laws use the Howey Test to determine whether a contract, scheme, or transaction meets the definition of a security. It focuses on resolving if investors paid money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others.\n\nAlthough these rules date back to the 1930s, before computers and digital assets, specific cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (or token pre-sales) have met the definition of an investment contract, according to regulators.\n\nNYAG says Ethereum is a security\n\nOn March 9, the NYAG, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit against Seychelles-based exchange KuCoin, citing concerns over \u201cfalsely representing itself as an exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action is the latest in our efforts to rein in shadowy cryptocurrency companies and bring order to the industry.\u201d\n\nJames said she could trade cryptocurrencies on the exchange in New York, yet the entity was not registered in the state. Furthermore, the AG added that users could buy and sell \u201cpopular virtual currencies, including ETH, LUNA, and TerraUSD (UST), which are securities and commodities.\u201d\n\nAlthough the principal theme of the lawsuit centered on KuCoin operating illegally in New York, James categorically called out the trading of securities on the platform as a basis for operating illegally, not just failure to register.\n\nThis paves the way for Ethereum\u2019s U.S. securities status to be determined in a court of law.\n\n\u201cThis action is one of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security.\u201d\n\nThe crypto community chimes in\n\nLawyer Jake Chervinsky dismissed James\u2019 claims about Ethereum, saying the enforcement action is simply an unfounded allegation, albeit an allegation from a regulator.\n\n\u201cAgencies are like any other plaintiff: they can write whatever they want in a complaint. It may get some press, but it doesn\u2019t change a thing.\u201c\n\nSimilarly, Messari founder Ryan Selkis echoed Chervinsky\u2019s comments, saying, \u201cETH is not a security.\u201d However, Selkis did not provide his reasoning, only hinting at a coordinated attack against crypto, saying, \u201cthe administrative state is completely out of control.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as expected, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser opposed the previous consensus, praising regulators for \u201cfinally doing their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cETH is obviously a security. Now the regulators are finally doing their job. Shut this sh**show down, Gary!!!\u201c\n\nMentioned in this article"

If $ETH would be worth same as ChatGPT parent OpenAi it would put price of $ETH around $350. \u2014 Citron Research (@CitronResearch) March 10, 2023\n\nAs KuCoin is accused of selling unregistered securites, Ethereum (ETH) is one of them. Citron Research stressed that the security status of Ether (ETH) bacame even more obvious as the network migrated to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus and replaced mining by staking.\n\nEthereum (ETH) failed to deliver on its promises of a \"decentralized network,\" researchers say. Instead, it become a full-fledged investment vehicle and should, therefore, be taxed and regulated accordingly.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) could better be compared to corporations, not to \"alternative\" systems like Bitcoin (BTC). Should one compare Ethereum (ETH) and OpenAI, a U.S.-based ChatGPT creator, by approximate market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) would be valued at about $350.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is changing hands at $1,401 by press time. Should Citron Research be right about its prospects, it would be on the eve of a 75% price plunge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Citron Research is an adamant critic of cryptocurrencies: they slammed Ethereum (ETH) in 2022 and compared it to collapsed exchange FTX. Also, it bashed Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the most overhyped investment tools of the previous bull run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) or OpenAI, Lululemon, Chipotle and Twitter?\n\nWhen regulators investigate the internal processes of Etheruem (ETH), they will find an ordinary \"ICO,\" not \"smart contracts,\" the skeptics added:\n\nWhen the AG opens the Ethereum Network kimono we expect the secrets of the to be just as bad as any shadowy organization with: self dealings, shady ICO transactions, multiple attempts to avoid federal laws of taxation and securities, all while being controlled by a small group of people under a guise of decentralization.\n\nAlso, recent charity initiatives by Vitalik Buterin look suspicious to Citron Research: they might cover tax evasion and look too similar to FTX's patented \"effective altruism.\"\n\nIn order to demonstrate how absurd Ethereum's (ETH) current market capitalization is, Citron Research stressed that it is bigger than the market caps of OpenAI, Lululemon, Twitter and Chipotle combined, or as large as Disney."

        "title": "Next stop Shanghai \u2014 Ethereum's latest milestone approaches - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem will continue its ongoing metamorphosis as the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade draws near. The latest preeminent smart contract blockchain protocol improvement will activate Ether (ETH) withdrawals from Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Merge marked a significant milestone for the Ethereum network in 2022, with the blockchain platform shifting from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus. That change introduced validators as the new \u201cminers\u201d of the network, with staking ETH becoming a key component in maintaining the network.\n\nWhile full validators were required to stake 32 ETH to process transactions and add new blocks to the network, the broader ecosystem could stake smaller amounts of ETH to earn a share of rewards \u2014 much like an investor that puts capital into interest-bearing accounts.\n\nThose that locked up ETH to become validators have been unable to withdraw their staked holdings from the Beacon Chain. This changes with the Shanghai upgrade, and is a major reason for the increased fanfare around the latest change to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade features a handful of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in addition to activating staking withdrawals. Cointelegraph reached out to members of the ConsenSys team, the Ethereum Foundation and analytics firm Nansen to unpack all aspects of the upcoming milestone.\n\nCapella x Shanghai = Shapella\n\nThe upcoming changes feature two simultaneous upgrades amalgamated to encompass all facets of the upgrade.\n\nShanghai refers to changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, mainly enabling staked ETH to be deposited to execution layer wallets. The Shanghai upgrade requires a simultaneous change to the Beacon Chain, which has been dubbed Capella.\n\nJustin Florentine, a staff protocol engineer for Hyperledger Besu at ConsenSys, further explained the combined upgrades at the execution and consensus layers:\n\n\u201cIt is doubly named because it is the first simultaneous upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and consensus layer, and is highly anticipated because it will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\u201d\n\nWithin the Ethereum ecosystem, execution layer upgrades are named after cities that have hosted Devcon events, while consensus layer upgrades are named after stars. Therefore the upcoming upgrade\u2019s technical name is Shapella, combining Shanghai and Capella.\n\nNevertheless, given the focus on activating staked ETH withdrawals, the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem refers to the looming upgrade as Shanghai. As Beiko explained, Shanghai closes an important chapter in Ethereum\u2019s evolution:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to think of Shanghai as \u2018finishing the Merge\u2019 than related to future upgrades. We didn\u2019t introduce withdrawals during the Merge because that upgrade was already the most complex in Ethereum\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nShanghai in a nutshell\n\nAs has been highlighted by several analysts and Ethereum developers, Shanghai features five EIPs. EIP-4895 will enable users to withdraw from the Ethereum staking contract, which had previously been locked.\n\nReward payments will be sent automatically to withdrawal addresses at regular intervals to validators. Users also have the option to exit staking entirely, which will return their entire validator balance.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade will unlock 17.6M ETH or over $28 billion. https://t.co/qt8K4Zn55y \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 2, 2023\n\nValidator balances are maxed out at 32 ETH, meaning that balances above this threshold as a result of rewards do not contribute to the principal amount nor increase the weight of a validator on the network.\n\nEIP-3651, EIP-3855, EIP-3860 and EIP-6049 are the other four elements of the network upgrade. Matt Nelson, Hyperledger Besu and Web3 senior product manager at ConsenSys, highlighted the impact of each of these EIPs.\n\nThe Ethereum protocol prices gas based on how many units of work a function will require of a computer in the network. Changes to Ethereum\u2019s gas costs often adjust to correct overpriced or underpriced operations that have central processing units doing more or less work than anticipated. Warm coinbase (3651), PUSH0 (3855) and the initcode changes (3860) are part of these corrections, according to Nelson.\n\nEIP-3651 changes the price of accessing the coinbase address of a validator that submits and executes transactions. Validators receive fees to their coinbase address for maintaining the network. As Nelson summarized, EIP-3651 looks to lower the gas cost of accessing a coinbase address so that users that submit transactions can pay the validators directly in specific conditions:\n\n\u201cRegardless, this EIP corrects a previous oversight on the cost to access the coinbase address and gives some added benefits to users and developers that open up new use cases.\u201d\n\nEIP-3860 will have a similar effect. Developers submit initcode to the network when deploying a new smart contract. When the initcode is executed, a smart contract \u201cbytecode\u201d is created on-chain, running each time the contract is called, and also runs decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMetering initcode intends to correct the gas cost required for network nodes to process and deploy the smart contracts specified in the initcode. Validating nodes currently check that contracts are valid on deployment, which costs time and gas to complete, which the initcode EIP aims to improve as Nelson explained:\n\n\u201cEIP-3860 applies a new cost to the initcode that scales in correlation to the size of the \u2018initcode\u2019 to ensure handling that contract creation is costed appropriately.\u201d\n\nLastly, EIP-3855 carries out a \u201cstraightforward and simple change\u201d to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas costing. The current state of the EVM does not store a value of zero on the execution stack cheaply, with developers having to use the \u201cexpensive\u201d PUSH1 operation to set a value to zero.\n\nNelson highlighted that gas costs are directly linked to storage space in this instance, meaning the EVM only needs 1 byte to store a single zero, while more than 1 byte is required to store a bigger number from the PUSH1 operation:\n\n\u201cThis change creates a new PUSH0 opcode, which is cost for 1 byte of data storage (less than PUSH1), and will bring gas costs for developers (and ultimately users) down.\u201d\n\nBeiko also reiterated that Ethereum Virtual Machine object format EIPs initially included in the Shanghai upgrade have been removed from the event.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe effect of the Shanghai upgrade on cryptocurrency markets and the value of ETH is another pertinent question that is perhaps more difficult to answer.\n\nMichiel Milanovic, a DeFi market analyst at ConsenSys, weighed in on the anticipated effects that Shanghai will have in terms of market supply and value of ETH after the upgrade. Milanovic noted that validators are broadly categorized as short-term or long-term, with the current market split roughly 40/60 respectively, which allows for some simple predictions to be made:\n\n\u201cWe see potential for an increase in the supply of ETH in circulation from long-term validators who are eager to withdraw their accumulated rewards.\u201d\n\nMilanovic also highlighted that the mechanics of withdrawals are engineered with a limit of 16 withdrawals per block and prioritizes short-term validators. The likely outcome is that any market impact from long-term validators will be gradual.\n\nMeanwhile, short-term validators are mostly run by liquid staking providers (LSPs), which are more incentivized to use rewards to spin up new validators. Milanovic said this is mainly due to an expected increased demand once withdrawals are enabled, as it reduces the liquidity risk of staking ETH.\n\n\u201cWe also expect to see more staked ETH tokens issued by these providers to be used across DeFi, which has so far been fairly limited.\u201d\n\nAndrew Thurman, an analyst at blockchain analytics platform Nansen, told Cointelegraph that the upgrade would have significant ramifications for supply flows and price of ETH, given that staking creates fundamental changes to Ethereum\u2019s market structure:\n\n\u201cSome believe that a successful network upgrade will spur more deposits, which would lead to bullish market activity. Others, meanwhile, believe that large portions of the staked ETH supply \u2014 now in excess of 17.5 million ETH \u2014 will be withdrawn and sold.\u201d\n\nSimon Dudley, a ConsenSys senior blockchain protocol engineer, summed up a shift in focus for the Shanghai upgrade to prioritize validator withdrawals. This meant that the implementation of certain EIPs was shifted further down the timeline to limit risks of further delays to the upcoming upgrade:\n\n\u201cFor this reason, there was a strong desire among the core developers to prevent the Shanghai upgrade from becoming overly complicated.\u201d\n\nSeveral of these EIPs have been pushed back to the Cancun upgrade, which will follow Shanghai later in 2023. This includes improvements that will lay the foundation for sharding, namely \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d EIP-4844.\n\nDudley noted that Shanghai intentionally excluded foundational sharding work, but work on EIP-4844 has continued in parallel. He also concedes that the deployment of Shanghai may well influence the ongoing work on sharding in the months to come:\n\n\u201cShipping the Shanghai upgrade may have an impact on sharding because it frees up developers who were working on Shanghai to focus on the more complicated series of sharding upgrades, known as \u2018The Surge.\u2018\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is scheduled to take place on the Ethereum mainnet in early April. The original date was pushed out from March 2023, with the Goerli test network \u2014 which allows for development testing before mainnet deployments \u2014 carrying out the Shapella upgrade on March 14."

Notably, Block.One, the parent company of EOS has recently recorded an enormous $83 million gain in its equity holdings in Silvergate Capital\n\nAs Coingape reported , the New York Attorney General\u2019s office initiated legal action against KuCoin on Thursday. The lawsuit alleges that the company engaged in the promotion of unregistered securities and commodities. KuCoin, which is headquartered in Seychelles, has been accused of carrying out business activities in New York without registering as a broker-dealer of securities and commodities.\n\nThe Chair of the US Federal Reserve , Jerome Powell, cautioned that the central bank may increase interest rates beyond the projected range as inflation continues to rise. These economic conditions are certainly impacting the price of Ethereum as well.\n\nAlso read: EOS Parent Block.One Books $83 Million Loss on Silvergate Equity Position"

        "content": "ETH might be prone to more sell pressure as Voyager liquidates its holdings.\n\nLong positions shift in favor of shorts as bearish market conditions prevail.\n\nThe ghost of 2022\u2019s crypto contagion is yet to be exorcised. A wave of ETH sell pressure might be on the way courtesy of distraught crypto firm Voyager.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nCrypto research company Arkham recently confirmed that voyager has commenced the process of liquidating its digital assets.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy after a series of unfortunate market events that led to heavy losses. Initial data reveal that Voyager has slightly over 100,000 ETH in its addresses which will be liquidated to pay creditors.\n\nVoyager is in the process of liquidating their on-chain assets. They are currently sending 7-8 figures of crypto to Wintermute and Coinbase addresses daily. They have over 100K ETH remaining to sell off \u2013 that's over $150M! Arkham will be dropping a deep-dive at 12:00 EST. pic.twitter.com/XhACb5wlxa \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) March 9, 2023\n\nThe amount of ETH to be liquidated is worth over $150 million. The report further revealed that the funds will be sent to Coinbase and Wintermute addresses.\n\nThose liquidations may translate to a large amount of sell pressure within the next few days. Such an outcome might trigger a deeper bearish move below $1,500.\n\nETH bears have so far pushed the price down by roughly 12% from its February highs to its $1,527 press time price. However, the Voyager liquidations are not the only bearish concerns for bullish traders.\n\nBullish expectations dimmed for the last few weeks courtesy of anticipated rate hike increases. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell recently reignited those bearish expectations during a recent Senate hearing. He revealed that the FED might have to increase rates to have a better chance at combatting inflation.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAre ETH derivatives traders taking advantage?\n\nWith the aforementioned problems taking center stage, shorts traders will be looking to take advantage. That is likely the case according to multiple metrics including the futures estimated leverage ratio. The latter has improved over the last two weeks as prices dropped.\n\nThe surge in the futures estimated leverage ratio is particularly evident in the last two days confirming healthy demand for leverage.\n\nThe price has been bearish during the same time. Also, ETH\u2019s open interest metric is on the rise this week and especially in the last two days. A potential sign that there is demand for shorts.\n\nAnother noteworthy observation regarding the state of derivatives is that investors have shifted from long positions likely in favor of shorts.\n\nThe longs liquidation metric shows a drop in liquidations courtesy of the bearish market conditions."

        "content": "Scroll, an Ethereum Layer 2 network that utilizes zk-rollups technology, has raised $50 million in its most recent funding round bringing its valuation to $1.8 billion.\n\nAn update: To accelerate plans for developing our zkEVM, pursue cutting-edge research, and continue building with a broader community, we've raised capital from a global set of participants. \u2014 Scroll \ud83d\udcdc (@Scroll_ZKP) March 6, 2023\n\nThe round comes at a time when funding to the entire sector has cooled off after a difficult 2022 when many companies went bankrupt, including the crypto exchange, FTX.\n\nNonetheless, Scroll\u2019s round saw a host of notable firms signaling that some of the biggest investors retain interest in the sector.\n\nThe round saw the following participants:\n\nPolychain Capital\n\nSequoia China\n\nBain Capital Crypto\n\nMoore Capital Management\n\nVariant Fund\n\nNewman Capital\n\nIOSG Ventures\n\nQiming Venture Partners\n\nFounded in 2021, Scroll aims to scale Ethereum to a billion users by utilizing a Layer 2 network that processes transactions off Ethereum on its own network. The transaction data is then sent back to Ethereum which helps increase transaction speed and reduce costs.\n\nTo achieve scalability, Scroll\u2019s network uses ZK-rollup technology, specifically its zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine). This technology allows Scroll to batch transactions and generate proof that verifies their legitimacy. Once the proof is created, it is broadcast to Ethereum for approval enabling the transactions to be processed more efficiently.\n\nLast week, Scroll launched its zkEVM on the Goerli testnet as it transitioned out of its pre-alpha testnet phase.\n\nThe traction on the pre-alpha testnet was impressive, with Scroll Co-Founder, Sandy Peng, noting in an interview that it had achieved one million unique addresses and 16 million transactions. The mainnet launch is expected to take place in the next three to four months, according to Peng.\n\nAlong with Scroll, several other Ethereum scaling networks use ZK-rollups, such as Polygon, StarkWare, and Matter Labs. According to Peng, who is just one of Scroll\u2019s co-founders, the network\u2019s competitive advantage lies in its three core design principles: community-driven, security-first, and decentralization at every level.\n\nWith the $50 million raised in the latest funding round, Scroll plans to use the capital to continue building its product, launch its mainnet, and expand its ecosystem. The company plans to increase its team size from around 60 to nearly 100 in the near future.\n\n______________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n______________________________________\n\n______________________________________"

        "content": "Liquid Staking Narrative Gains Momentum Ahead of Ethereum\u2019s Shapella Upgrades\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nLido, the leading DeFi protocol by total value locked, launched on the Polygon network on Thursday.\n\nUsers can now bridge Lido\u2019s Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH) onto the Polygon network. The popular DeFi protocols Kyber, Balancer, and Beefy Finance will offer liquidity incentives for wstETH markets on Polygon.\n\nLido said it chose to launch on Polygon due to the volume of its native DeFi activity, track record for security, and the presence of existing Lido partners on the network. Polygon is the fifth-largest smart contract network with a total value locked (TVL) of $1B, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nThe news marks Lido\u2019s third deployment on an Ethereum scaling solution, following its launch on Optimism and Arbitrum in October 2020. Lido is also live on the Solana, Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Terra Classic blockchains.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLido\u2019s Ethereum-based stETH token is a liquid staking derivative (LSD), meaning the token represents a share of staked Ether and accrues corresponding staking rewards. Wrapped stETH allows the token to easily be bridged between networks.\n\nUsers deposit ETH with Lido. Lido then divides the Ether among its 29 node operators, who stake the ETH on behalf of the protocol\u2019s users. Users are issued stETH tokens corresponding to the value of the Ether they stake. The stETH can then be utilized across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe token then accrues staking rewards for its holder, who receive 90% of the staking rewards generated. The remaining 10% is evenly split between Lido\u2019s node operators and the Lido DAO.\n\nLido is the largest LSD provider, comprising 80% of the sector\u2019s market cap, according to CoinGecko. It is also the largest DeFi protocol, with $8.8B in TVL, according to The Defiant Terminal.\n\nThe native tokens of Lido and other liquid staking providers have outshone other crypto tokens as crypto markets rebounded this year.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nStaked ETH Withdrawals\n\nThe LSD sector is riding a wave of anticipation for Ethereum\u2019s imminent Shapella upgrades, which will activate staked Ether withdrawals for the first time. The fork\u2019s final testnet deployment is scheduled to launch on March 14.\n\nUsers have been able to stake their ETH since Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake Beacon Chain went live in December 2020. However, the inability of users to withdraw their assets spurred criticism from Ethereum detractors, who highlighted that many in the crypto community expected the function to activate last year.\n\nOver 16M Ether worth more than $26B is currently staked on the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Shapella upgrades are expected to precipitate a boom in LSD volumes as the activation of withdrawals incentivizes arbitrageurs to step in and minimize the spread between LSD tokens and Ether.\n\nThe increasing integration of LSDs into DeFi protocols also offers opportunities for users to combine staking rewards with other sources of yield. However, some critics argue that the integration of LSDs into DeFi protocols poses a centralization risk to Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem."

        "title": "4 strategies for staking Ethereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Staked Ether (ETH), liquid derivatives \u2014 it\u2019s a whirlygig of smart contracts and big-brain blockchain jargon out there. Nonetheless, there are a few paths through the ETH staking wilderness.\n\nBut remember, anon, as the poet Antonio Machado said, \u201cThere is no path, paths are made by walking\u201d \u2014 which is a fancy way of saying this isn\u2019t financial advice and make sure you do your own research.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first personality type and the type of ETH staking that might be appropriate.\n\nThe Ox: Slow and steady\n\nThe ox, archetypally, has a strong, dependable personality but can be stubborn and suspicious of new ideas. If that sounds like you, you may be interested in staking directly with Lido.\n\nLido Finance is not only the biggest liquid staking derivative (LSD) protocol but it\u2019s now the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol in the market in terms of total value locked ($9.5 billion) and market capitalization. Lido takes your ETH and stakes it via a team of vetted validators, pooling the yield garnered and distributing it to the validators, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and investors.\n\nRelated: 3 tips for trading Ethereum this year\n\nIn return for providing ETH to Lido, the DAO issues \u201cstaked ETH\u201d (stETH) tokens, which are like receipts (or \u201cliquid derivatives\u201d) that can be redeemed for your original ETH plus the yield accrued. These tokens, along with those from other LSD protocols, such as Rocket Pool and StakeWise, can be traded on the open market.\n\nThe risks include the fact that the smart contracts holding your ETH might have an undiscovered bug, the DAO might get hacked, or one or more of Lido\u2019s validators might get penalized by Ethereum and have some of their stake removed. All the following strategies contain these risks plus more.\n\nThe Dog: Honest, prudent and a little feisty\n\nIf that sounds like you, maybe look into auto-compounders. For example, adding liquidity to Curve Finance and then locking up the liquidity pool (LP )tokens.\n\nWhen using Curve, I like to use Frax-based tokens, as the two protocols clearly have the hots for one another, and Frax pools often have the best rewards. I passed some of my ETH to Frax to stake and received their LSD called Frax ETH (frxETH).\n\nIt\u2019s in Frax\u2019s interest to maintain a highly liquid market for frxETH, so they run an LP on Curve, which offers up to 5.5% APY on top of the fact that your frxETH is also earning a similar yield. Nice.\n\nETH staked by entity. Source: Nansen\n\nBut some of this APY is paid out in CRV tokens. No shade, but I would rather have ETH, so I hopped on to Aladdin DAO\u2019s Concentrator protocol and gave them my LP tokens, which is like a receipt for my share of the frxETH/ETH pool. They do some wizardry and return 8% APY paid in the underlying assets. Nice.\n\nNaturally, when mixing DeFi protocols into a screwy, money cake, the risks compound with the yield. Here, there are three protocols involved as opposed to one, which could mean the risk is cubed \u2014 but I\u2019m no mathematician.\n\nThe Tiger: Sleek, sophisticated and always in control\n\nThis is perhaps the most sophisticated strategy on the list and should be considered by experienced investors with a large amount of money on the line.\n\nEssentially, the tiger can use a similar strategy to the dog; indeed, there are many LP pools and many compounders across the DeFi world, so finding one that fits shouldn\u2019t be an issue. The issue for tigers is how to hedge their risk.\n\nA few options contracts might be in order. The basic approach would be to buy enough in-the-money put options to act as insurance in the event ETH takes a dive. This might be all that\u2019s needed seeing as the risk of impermanent loss is low, given stETH tends to maintain its peg. (Those wanting to hedge against a depeg event should check out Y2K protocol over on Arbitrum.)\n\nA more optimal strategy would be a \u201cbear call spread,\u201d as that will insure against depreciation but also return some profit in a sideways market.\n\nThe Frog: The airdropping Ponzi lover\n\nThe next strategy is quite popular in some sections of the crypto world. In terms of risk, it\u2019s as about as safe as covering yourself in peanut butter and running at a horde of malicious chimpanzees.\n\nIt involves \u201clooping,\u201d which refers to supplying an asset, borrowing against it, swapping the borrowed money for more of the original asset, and repeating the process.\n\nRelated: 5 tips for investing during a global recession\n\nFrom my own research, I found a yield farm that will give you about 2% yield when you deposit wstETH (the same as stETH but with a harder peg) and allow you to borrow USD Coin (USDC) against it for 3.5% interest.\n\nYou can then swap the USDC for more wstETH and repeat the process, using a 75% loan-to-value ratio, so you don\u2019t get instantly liquidated. If you loop this process five times, you will end up with an APY of over 13% on your wstETH, which itself is earning 5%.\n\nWhatever your personality, it\u2019s possible to find the strategy that works for you, and while it might sound complicated if you have your own decentralized wallet or one on an exchange, most of them can be enacted with just a few clicks. While some bearish types might decry the continuation of overly-ebullient risk-taking, I see the trend in LSDs as part of the birth of a new yield-bearing asset: ETH.\n\nOne day, stETH might even rival the traditional bond market. After all, if governments can run trillion-dollar economies essentially as derivatives of their own bond market, what are a few validator nodes among crypto friends?\n\nNathan Thompson is the lead tech writer for Bybit.

        "title": "Ethereum layer-2 solutions may focus less on token incentives in the future - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Layer-2 networks continue to gain momentum as the Ethereum ecosystem advances. For example, data from analytics provider Token Terminal found that layer-2 scaling solution Polygon had 313,457 daily active users as of Jan. 17, 2023 \u2014 a 30% increase in activity since October 2022.\n\nMoreover, the Polygon ecosystem recently announced the launch of its beta version Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. As a result, Polygon\u2019s native token, Polygon (MATIC), maintains a bullish narrative.\n\nWhile notable, some believe layer-2 networks offering token incentive models may soon become obsolete. For instance, Jesse Pollak \u2014 head of protocols and Base core contributor at American crypto exchange Coinbase \u2014 told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that there are currently no plans to associate a token with Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network recently launched by Coinbase. He said:\n\n\u201cWe think about tokens as a powerful incentive tool that can change user and developer behavior. At the same time, we have seen situations unfold over the last few years where tokens have been used as an incentive mechanism with a lack of product fit for the underlying chain. Tokens have also resulted in nefarious or risky situations in the past.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pollak, Base is a layer-2 solution that allows developers to easily build applications without requiring an incentive mechanism. \u201cOur product will stand on its own. It will be very easy for developers to use to build applications and distribute those to real human beings,\u201d he said.\n\nShifting focus from token models to user experience\n\nFocusing on ease of use and distribution are important points, as Pollak pointed out that many of today\u2019s decentralized applications have been used solely for trading cryptocurrencies. \u201cTrading is not enough to make cryptocurrency the future of the economy. At Base, we are making it easy for developers to build useful applications that people actually want to use,\u201d he added.\n\nPollak explained that Base is investing in core infrastructure, such as Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, which will make the network secure and low-cost compared with other layer-2 networks. \u201cIt costs about 10\u201315 cents to conduct transactions on layer-2s. We aim to bring that down,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nWhile Base launched its testnet in February, Pollak shared that the Base mainnet launch will take place in the coming months. Moreover, while no plans exist for Base to offer a native token, several ecosystem participants have already expressed interest in building on Base.\n\nRecent: Next stop Shanghai \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s latest milestone approaches\n\nFor example, Konstantin Richter, chief executive officer and founder of Blockdaemon \u2014 a blockchain infrastructure provider \u2014 told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that Blockdaemon will serve as an official infrastructure partner for Base. Richter shared that he thinks Base shouldn\u2019t have a token associated with the network, as he believes proof-of-stake (PoS) is an entirely broken system. \u201cBlockdaemon runs more PoS nodes than anyone else, and I can tell you that proof-of-stake only works when token prices go up,\u201d he said.\n\nRichter further explained that Blockdaemon plans to use the Base network to determine how to allow network participants to run nodes while possibly earning a fixed U.S. dollar fee. \u201cThis may result in a different type of PoS mechanism, possibly around commitment of compute rather than a staked percentage of tokens that may not serve the network well,\u201d he said. Richter added that such a model could result in a better user experience. He said:\n\n\u201cThis could be the biggest paradigm shift within the cryptocurrency ecosystem since the invention of PoS. We are moving away from incentive models that reward users for using a product. We are now focused on ease of functionality and low fees.\u201d\n\nYet it remains questionable how exactly Base will attract users and developers to the platform without a token incentive model. Given Coinbase\u2019s vast understanding of institutions and decentralized finance (DeFi), Richter doesn\u2019t think this should be an issue: \u201cI prefer to work with Base given Coinbase\u2019s understanding of institutions and DeFi. It\u2019s remarkable that a public Fortune 500 company is committed to putting transactions transparently on Base.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s too soon to predict future outcomes, it\u2019s important to note that Arbitrum, another Ethereum layer-2 network, also functions without a native token. This has certainly not stopped users from interacting with the Arbitrum network. According to data from the analytics website L2Beat.com, Arbitrum has about $3.35 billion total value locked, making up about 54% of the market share on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, rumors have been circulating that Arbitrum may initiate a token airdrop in the future. While this may or not be the case, it demonstrates Arbitrum\u2019s ability to determine product market fit before launching a token. Gil Rosen, president of the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, told Cointelegraph at ETHDenver 2023 that finding product market fit is about ensuring projects acquire the right customers whose value is accretive to the ecosystem, which often isn\u2019t the case with tokens. \u201cEarly projects that launch tokens are often locked into tokenomics models before finding product market fit and then are unable to pivot dynamically,\u201d Rosen said.\n\n\u201cDeFi Dad,\u201d a partner at digital asset investment firm Fourth Revolution Capital, told Cointelegraph that he believes the main driver behind layer-2 tokens is to ensure decentralized control over layer-2 networks.\n\nFor example, he explained that the upcoming launch of zkSync\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine would use a PoS mechanism to allow zkSync tokenholders to act as stakers. \u201cLayer-2 tokens are necessary for building the decentralized future,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to our community and the entire ecosystem for an energizing ETHDenver 2023. For the remainder of the week, we\u2019ll share highlights from ETHDenver around ZK scaling and building a future-proof zkEVM. First topic, hyperscalability.\n\n\n\n1/7 pic.twitter.com/qOVSQ475a2 \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) March 8, 2023\n\nDeFi Dad thinks a layer-2 network without plans to implement a native token could be successful if users are willing to sacrifice decentralization and censorship resistance in the short term.\n\nRecent: Banks with crypto services require new Anti-Money Laundering capabilities\n\nHe said, \u201cBase could be successful as a network for transacting with a user\u2019s crypto. However, make no mistake; Base will be a layer-2 (at least for the foreseeable future) that makes trade-offs. As DeFi users, we tend to deprioritize security and censorship resistance until we really need it.\u201d\n\nWith this point in mind, Rosen mentioned that he believes token models will remain for many decentralized projects with large developer and user communities, but these will launch later. \u201cA project may launch a token when the networks themselves are more mature and have found product market fit.\u201d"

The fear and uncertainty from SVB\u2019s closure have spelled trouble for several companies in the crypto space. The most notable crypto entity that is facing collateral damage is Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the world\u2019s second-largest stablecoin USD Coin (USDC).\n\nUSDC falls to $0.87 amid SVB induced turmoil\n\nAfter hours of silence regarding its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, Circle took to Twitter earlier today to reveal that it had $3.3 billion stuck in the downed bank. The funds are part of the $40 billion reserve that backs the USD Coin. Within an hour of this news, the stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar and proceeded to lose more than 11% of its value, falling as low as $0.87.\n\n@circle is currently protecting #USDC from a black swan failure in the U.S. banking system. @SVB_Financial is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure \u2013 without a Federal rescue plan \u2013 will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs. https://t.co/CYi6Z26ngH \u2014 Dante Disparte (@ddisparte) March 11, 2023\n\nDante Disparte, the Chief Strategy Officer of Circle revealed that the company was protecting its stablecoin from a \u201cblack swan failure in the U.S banking system.\u201d Disparte emphasized the need for a federal rescue plan in order to avert \u201cbroader implications for business, banking, and entrepreneurs.\u201d Silicon Valley Bank is the second largest FDIC-insured bank to fail in the United States. However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits up to $250,000.\n\nAmerican crypto exchange Coinbase, which launched USDC in partnership with Circle, suspended USDC: USD conversions for the stablecoin as holders rushed to exchange it for other crypto assets. The conversions will reportedly resume on Monday. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Jump Trading, Wintermute, and Genesis Trading are among those who redeemed USD Coin for USD via Circle and Coinbase ahead of the weekend redemption break. Meanwhile, opportunistic traders have lined up to grab USDC at a 10% discount, in anticipation of a gradual recovery to its dollar peg."

        "title": "Ethereum Market Update: A Comprehensive Overview - Cyber Daily",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe Ethereum market has witnessed significant growth and development since its inception. As one of the leading cryptocurrencies, Ethereum continues to capture the attention of investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike. This article provides a comprehensive update on the Ethereum market, covering recent trends, price movements, and notable developments. Additionally, it explores the importance of data security in the cryptocurrency industry, drawing attention to key considerations for protecting sensitive information in the wake of data breaches.\n\nRecent Trends and Price Movements\n\nThe Ethereum market has experienced both ups and downs in recent months, reflecting the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. As of late, Ethereum has demonstrated resilience and showcased its potential as a robust digital asset. The market has seen positive momentum, driven by factors such as increased adoption, institutional interest, and the continuous development of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDespite occasional fluctuations, Ethereum has maintained a strong position and remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.\n\nNotable Developments in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is vibrant and constantly evolving, with new projects, upgrades, and collaborations contributing to its growth. One notable development is the integration of Ethereum-based tokens on platforms like easymarkets. This integration enables users to access and trade Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies conveniently, expanding the accessibility and liquidity of the market.\n\nAnother significant development is the ongoing transition from Ethereum's current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0 aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability, further solidifying Ethereum's position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the Ethereum network has created a new paradigm in financial services. DeFi protocols offer users the opportunity to lend, borrow, and trade digital assets without intermediaries, providing financial inclusivity and transparency.\n\nThe Importance of Data Security in the Cryptocurrency Industry\n\nAs the popularity and value of cryptocurrencies continue to soar, ensuring data security has become paramount. Cryptocurrency transactions involve the transfer and storage of sensitive information, including personal and financial data. Protecting this information from unauthorized access and data breaches is crucial to maintain trust and security within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIn light of recent data breaches across various sectors, including the financial industry, it is essential to address the issue of data security head-on. Here are three key considerations to keep in mind:\n\nImplement Robust Security Measures: Crypto exchanges and wallet providers should prioritize implementing robust security measures, including multi-factor authentication, encryption, and cold storage solutions. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Educate Users About Best Practices: Educating cryptocurrency users about best practices in data security is crucial. Users should be encouraged to adopt strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive information online or with unauthorized parties. Raising awareness about potential scams, phishing attempts, and the importance of conducting transactions on secure platforms is vital to prevent data breaches. Stay Informed About Data Privacy Regulations: As data privacy regulations evolve, it is essential for cryptocurrency businesses to stay informed and comply with relevant laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regional privacy frameworks. Adhering to these regulations not only protects user data but also builds trust and credibility within the industry.\n\nNavigating the Ethereum Market and Ensuring Data Security\n\nThe Ethereum market continues to demonstrate resilience and growth, driven by technological advancements, market adoption, and ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Traders and investors should stay informed about market trends and developments to make well-informed decisions.\n\nSimultaneously, safeguarding data security remains paramount in the cryptocurrency industry. By implementing robust security measures, educating users about best practices, and adhering to data privacy regulations, businesses and individuals can mitigate the risk of data breaches and protect sensitive information.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve and reshape the financial landscape, staying vigilant and proactive in data security measures will contribute to a safer and more secure cryptocurrency ecosystem for all stakeholders. By prioritizing data security alongside market analysis and strategic decision-making, participants in the Ethereum market can navigate its dynamic landscape with confidence and reap the potential benefits it offers."

Discover SCENE\n\nPrivacy-focused web browser Brave announced on Friday the rollout of a new feature that allows users to not only buy cryptocurrency but also now sell it for fiat\u2014including U.S. dollars, euros, and the British pound\u2014without leaving the integrated Brave Wallet.\n\nSelf-custody and the \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d mantra have regained momentum following the collapse of prominent cryptocurrency firms like Celsius and FTX. Brave said it aims to make crypto self-custody easier with this new desktop browser feature, which is powered by crypto on-ramp startup Ramp Network.\n\n\u201cAfter recent events where centralized exchanges mishandled customer funds, it\u2019s more important than ever to offer secure and easy-to-manage self-custody,\u201d the company said in a post announcing the update.\n\nIn Brave\u2019s latest desktop version (v1.49), we\u2019ve added a new off-ramping feature to Brave Wallet, powered by our friends at @RampNetwork!

The company said that 38 cryptocurrencies can be sold via the off-ramp service.\n\n\u201cWhile self-custody has grown in popularity over the past decade, the most common way to hold digital currency and tokens remains with centralized exchanges,\u201d the company added. \u201cWe expect to see that shift with innovations in user experience, like the one we are releasing today.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2016, Brave blocks online advertisements and website trackers by default, making it a popular web browsing tool for privacy-minded individuals. In 2017, Brave added the Basic Attention Token, which rewards users for allowing the browser to show advertisements while they surf the web.\n\nBrave then announced a deal with Ramp in May 2022 that enabled users to buy crypto with fiat currency via the Brave Wallet installed within Brave\u2019s desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast month, Brave added support for decentralized applications (dapps) using the Solana blockchain on its iOS and Android mobile browsers, allowing users to connect to platforms like the Solana-centric NFT marketplace, Magic Eden."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Suffer\n\nThe crypto friendly bank Silvergate Bank has recently been struggling due to increased market regulations and has just announced that it will be winding down operations shortly. It\u2019s safe to say that this has negatively affected the crypto market as Bitcoin and Ethereum have both dipped in value as a result.\n\nBitcoin has been on a downward bearish trend for the past week, and dipped under $22,000.

Ethereum is down around 6% in the past week and currently trades at $1.535.45.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current price prediction has a mixed outlook.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Big Eyes Coin: Game-changers for Crypto March - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Notwithstanding the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) strict regulations, the crypto market grew by more than $80 billion as we entered the third quarter of February. Following a difficult first and second quarter, crypto markets are finally showing signs of a bullish run and increasing pace, ignoring any barriers or negative news.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, the newest meme coin in the cryptoverse, is leading the way, having raised over $31.5 million in its presale. Only time will tell when and where this adorable cat-themed coin will come to an end. On the other hand, there are two crypto titans, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The market was controlled by Bitcoin, with consumers exchanging other cryptocurrencies into BTC following SEC laws. Players like Cardano are also throwing their hats in the proverbial ring.\n\nBitcoin is here to rule:\n\nAs we entered the second half of February, Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, achieved a peak of $24,755, the highest since June of 2022. Once many users and investors switched their capital away from other cryptocurrencies, and towards the crypto beast, the value of BTC skyrocketed. BTC was priced at $24,551 at the time of writing, a gain of about 10% in the previous 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $473.59 billion.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous entity, introduced Bitcoin as an alternate method of payment in 2009 with the goal of creating an interconnected and autonomous digital currency network. To validate transactions, Bitcoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, and BTC, Bitcoin\u2019s digital currency, has a finite amount of just 21 million coins.\n\nCan Ethereum Hit $1.8K in BTC?\n\nEthereum (ETH), like Bitcoin, saw advances and hit $1,700, an increase of more than 8%. Only time will tell if Ether\u2019s value can reach $1,800. Ethereum\u2019s last value of $1,800 was in August 2022. At the time of writing, ETH was worth $1,683 and had a market value of $205.75 billion.\n\nEthereum was introduced in 2015 as a De-Fi coin and a platform for decentralized apps and smart contracts. In comparison to Bitcoin, it is the most desired platform in the world by developers and consumers due to its scalability, security, and usability. Ethereum initially employed the Proof-of-Work technique but switched to PoS (Proof-of-Stake) in 2022 because it is faster, uses less energy, and is more secure.\n\nCardano\u2019s Long-Term Blockchain\n\nCardano is a blockchain that employs proof-of-stake (ADA). As a result, the energy efficiency of the coin is improved. The classic proof-of-work consensus approach necessitates additional mining and transaction time. The blockchain was developed in 2017, and four years later, the \u201cAlonzo\u201d hard fork was introduced. As a result, its smart contract functionality exists. Smart contracts are difficult to hack due to their encrypted security. The proof-of-stake system allows for highly fast, efficient, and exact transactions!\n\nCardano\u2019s commitment to transaction security has aided its development into a powerful blockchain platform. The speed and efficiency of its transactions, as well as its smart contract, contribute to its environmental friendliness! Investing has a high potential for success.\n\nBig Eyes That Strain to the Horizon:\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a community-owned, cat-themed meme coin that offers profitable utilities and use cases in addition to an attempt to enhance the Earth\u2019s ecology. Big Eyes Coin has surpassed $31 million in its presale and now intends to reach $50 million by the end of its presale. This new meme coin with a cat mascot is a promising crypto with enormous potential and the ability to become the world\u2019s largest meme coin.\n\nBig Eyes have run a series of promotional campaigns in recent weeks, including a tattoo competition, discount codes, and now, an amazing set of loot box offers that are too good to miss.\n\nWhile some online critics have called the currency and its authenticity into doubt, the community-led token has proven time and time again that it\u2019s here to stay and has a bright future ahead of it, quelling any concerns being spread by these crypto pundits.\n\nWith amazing innovations in tech, accessibility, a user-friendly design, NFTs, loot boxes, and more, Big Eyes Coin is striving to become a crypto mainstay.\n\nFor more information:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Dogetti, Bitcoin, and Ethereum: Post-Silvergate Price Prediction - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "On Wednesday, Silvergate bank publicly spoke about its problems with the SEC regarding a filing that would delay its financial report. With this, the crypto bank decided to press the breaks on the payments to its exchange, the Silvergate Exchange Network. This spiked fear and uncertainty in investors, causing a bank run that led to a loss of $1 billion!\n\nSilvergate Bank is the main payment network provider for numerous cryptocurrencies, so the bank run has had a severe impact on the industry. Silvergate is also well known for working with FTX and Alameda Research and, in effect, also experienced an enormous loss of $14 billion in 2022. How will the bank\u2019s recent problems with the SEC affect some of crypto\u2019s top coins and tokens?\n\nDETI\u2019s Recent Developments\n\nThe top crypto meme coin, Dogetti (DETI), is yet to be officially released. However, through a strong community ethos and enticing features, the token has already managed to rake in a mass \u201cfamily\u201d of investors.\n\nWhile DETI is still in its early presale stages, they have already secured an official contract address as of last week. A contract address is an address created by cryptographic technologies which allow cryptocurrencies to be bought and sold. This is an exciting step toward the dog-themed coin becoming an established part of the industry. In addition, the DETI team has released a limited launch code (WISEGUY25) which offers 25% off all tokens during stage 1 of the presale.\n\nGiven that Dogetti is still in its presale, most investors assume the dust will have settled regarding the Silvergate damage before the token\u2019s launch. Furthermore, crypto analysts predict that these unfortunate events will have little to no impact on DETI.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Bear March\n\nOn account of the Silvergate complications, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) latest price action has abolished $20 billion of its market cap, which now stands at $431 billion. The coin\u2019s price fell from $23,800 to $22,300, and many other coins, such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC), encountered losses between 4% to 5%. BTC is now facing major selling pressure following a decision taken by Coinbase and Paxos from Silvergate to alternative banking partners.\n\nOn the 4th of March, BTC was hanging on around $22,350. However, if it weren\u2019t for recent events, analysts predict that BTC would have reached 25k this week! If matters get worse, the coin may even break $22k and plummet near $21,600. BTC is now floating at around $22,400, but if it manages to break $23k, we may see a bull run for BTC once again.\n\nCan Ethereum Recover from this?\n\nThere was another major bank run for crypto investors on Saturday, leaving Ethereum (ETH) to slip by 0.19%, in addition to its 4.73% drop on Friday. This reduced the coin\u2019s price to $1,567, below the point of 1,600 for the first time since mid-February! This morning, ETH experienced a high of $1,578 but struggled against its resistance level, which stands at $1,630.\n\nConsidering the latest Silvergate bank drama, the ETH charts indicate more bear runs before things improve. However, Ethereum has managed to hold a price of above $1,550, which it hasn\u2019t fallen below since the beginning of February, and even then, it quickly recovered back up to $1,600 in a mere few days.\n\nSo even if ETH is bound to face further price drops, there\u2019s a good chance that it will recover soon enough. With that, we can only hope that the possible incoming bankruptcy of Silvergate bank doesn\u2019t affect other crypto-related firms in its wake. All things considered, crypto analysts still believe that ETH is likely to return to $1,700 once things have cooled down. They also predict that by the end of 2023, the coin may likely break past $2,000 and be on its way to a full recovery!\n\nClick the Following Links to Learn More About Dogetti!\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent crackdown on \u201cshitcoins\u201d has sparked a wave of backlash from the cryptocurrency community. In a post on a small subreddit, Buterin labeled several coins, including Bite (BITE), as having \u201cno redeeming cultural or moral value\u201d and predicted they would result in significant financial losses for investors.\n\nButerin\u2019s comments come on the heels of his recent sale of billions of dollars worth of \u201cfree shitcoins,\u201d as reported by LookOnChain. The sale included 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 Ethereum ($2K), 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH ($91K), and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH ($600K), as reported by TronWeekly.\n\nDespite his efforts to distance himself from these so-called \u201cshitcoins,\u201d it seems that Buterin\u2019s comments may have backfired. Some have lauded Buterin\u2019s efforts to eliminate scams and illegitimate projects, while others have come to the defense of the coins he criticized.\n\nAmong those defending the coins, one user welcomed Buterin to the $BITE community, urging others to invest and enjoy the ride. Meanwhile, some users questioned Buterin\u2019s motivations, accusing him of engaging in \u201csoft shilling\u201d and \u201csoft FUD\u201d to manipulate prices.\n\nOthers still rejected the entire premise of the debate, suggesting that the value of a cryptocurrency is subjective and based on cultural and moral factors that are open to debate.\n\nThey even went so far as to compare the value of Ethereum to Bitcoin and to suggest that currency based on moral or cultural capital is never truly worthless without debate.\n\nDespite the varying opinions, it\u2019s clear that the debate over \u201cshitcoins\u201d is far from over, and Buterin\u2019s latest comments are just the latest chapter in an ongoing saga.\n\nEthereum Co-founder\u2019s NFT Collection Sparks Surge in Sales\n\nThe sale of an NFT collection featuring Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s stamp of approval has caused a stir on Crypto Twitter and resulted in several million dollars worth of sales. Metalabel, in collaboration with Gitcoin, created the collection to honor Buterin\u2019s contributions to the Web3 funding model.\n\nEach NFT includes a signed digital version of the 2018 whitepaper \u201cLiberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design for Philanthropic Matching Funds\u201d and commemorates the creation of quadratic funding. The collection\u2019s initial sale period ended on March 1st, but secondary sales saw a surge in popularity in recent days.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin Slides Below $20K Amidst Growing Crowd\u2019s Interest"

        "content": "The Shanghai upgrade for Ethereum is currently targeted for this March. This will enable staking withdrawals for the first time since people began staking their ETH in 2020. Unlike other PoS networks like Cosmos, with a fixed withdrawal period for stakers, set at 21 days, Ethereum\u2019s is dynamic based on how many validators are exiting at a given time.\n\nSo, how does the Shanghai upgrade come into play?\n\nThe Ethereum\u2019s Overview\n\nThe Ethereum network is scalable, programmable, and decentralized. For many investors, it is the blockchain of choice.\n\nEthereum started with a proof of work (PoW) mechanism. Later, it began its journey toward proof of stake (PoS) with the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020. Later on, the Ethereum Merge happened after a series of testnet checks, making the Ethereum network a PoS one.\n\nStaking, for many investors, is a crucial way of making money as it helps put assets to work and earn passive income without selling assets. However, in the Ethereum network, one issue still was hectic; cost. This is because the minimum amount required for staking to join the Beacon Chain was 32 ETH.\n\nAs a result, a series of projects began working on a more accessible way to stake on Ethereum, dubbed liquid staking.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is likely one of the most significant events for the Ethereum blockchain. Currently planned for the first half of 2023, the upgrade is set to bring several improvements to Ethereum.\n\nShanghai comprises of several upgrades, but the most impactful one allows ETH stakers to remove their staked ETH and the rewards accrued.\n\nThis change is established in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nSeveral other proposals related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Object Format (EOF). This software component of all EVM-compatible chains contains more than 120 operation codes that give decentralized programmability to the networks.\n\nHowever, one of the proposals that will not be present in the March 2023 release is EIP-4844. The proposal introduces proto-danksharding and sets up the highly anticipated sharding upgrade due in 2024 for the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most likely advantage of the upgrade is the spur it brings on the case of innovations regarding direct staking and liquid staking solutions. Additionally, it will bring on ETH\u2019s position on the table as a staking protocol.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThere are preparations already set for the upgrade. The most visible is Metamask integrating Lido and Rocket Pool, some of the most popular liquid-staking options. Once the Shanghai upgrade is complete, this will enable their users to stake ETH directly from their Metamask wallets.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is an essential milestone in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution. As the network continues to grow, we can be sure to expect even more exciting developments in the future."

        "title": "Cardano (ADA) vs Ethereum (ETH); Which Crypto Should I Invest in? - Crypto Economy",
        "content": "A good way to decide which cryptocurrency to invest in is to compare two of them. Knowing their similarities and differences is perhaps the best alternative to know exactly which cryptocurrency best suits each investor. Two of the cryptos that have been most compared for their potential are Cardano vs Ethereum.\n\nBoth the digital assets are altcoin heavyweights that rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies and provide users with a massive investment opportunity. Although they provide similar functionalities in relation with smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApp), there are some major differences that separate ADA and ETH miles apart.\n\nOf late, the war between the two formidable opponents has intensified owing to the significant surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Furthermore, the comparison between the two has piqued interest, in part because Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was also one of the original developers of Ethereum. The Ethereum network seems to be at a commanding position compared to the Cardano network due to its sheer size. It\u2019s the second-most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nEthereum is also the most popular network for non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, DeFi applications, and numerous metaverse projects. While Cardano also host these types of applications, Ethereum is the clear leader in this space.\n\nHowever, since launch Cardano has adopted a more cautious path with a peer-reviewed research-driven approach aiming to incorporate academic rigour and math with blockchain technology. Its primary focus has been on creating a system that is cheaper to use and more efficient than Ethereum.\n\nAlthough there are many similarities between Cardano and Ethereum, they have their differences depending on an individual investor or user\u2019s perspective. In this article, let us understand in details the key differences between the Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nMain Differences Between Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)\n\nEthereum and Cardano seem similar on the surface, but they have significant operational and application differences. The key differences have been segregated under 4 main categories as follows:\n\nTransaction Volume\n\nEthereum enjoys a wider fanbase handling approximately 1 million daily transactions. On the other hand Cardano processes less than 100,000 transactions on a daily basis. However, in regards to transaction speed, Cardano has eclipsed Ethereum in transactions per second (TPS). On Layer 1, Ethereum can process up to 30 TPS. That\u2019s in contrast to Cardano network\u2019s speed, which can process roughly 250 TPS.\n\nScalability\n\nBoth Cardano and Ethereum 2.0 are \u201cLayer 1\u201d blockchains, but their designs are different. Ethereum 2.0 uses a single-layer to manage on-chain smart contracts and apps, but Cardano has a dual-layer design that allows for more functionality and scalability. This means, Cardano is more scalable than Ethereum and can handle more transactions. It seems Cardano is capitalizing on things Ethereum is not, and vice versa.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nEthereum is infamous for its notoriously high gas fees compared to Cardano. The ETH transaction fees are very high with users have to pay 2$ to 6$ for just 1 transaction. In comparison, Cardano gas fees are consistently lower, averaging 0.16 ADA per transaction.\n\nDeFi Ecosystem\n\nThe current boom in the DeFi projects has had a major impact on both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). The global decentralized finance market size was valued at $13.61 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of a staggering 46.0% from 2023 to 2030. This exponential growth has put Ethereum as well as Cardano on the forefront with a number of upcoming upgrades on both the blockchains.\n\nSince Ethereum was the first chain with smart contracts, it dwarfs Cardano\u2019s smart chain ecosystem. To put things into a perspective, Ethereum has more than 3000 dApps running on it, whereas Cardano has a little over 1,000. When looking at total value locked (TVL), Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem outshines Cardano by a long shot. Subsequently, Cardano comprises only a tiny fraction of Ethereum based on TVL being less than $100 million. In a nutshell, Ethereum has clinched the winning trophy in this category.\n\nMeanwhile, even on the NFT front Ethereum (ETH) manages to put forward a sweeping victory with some of the most popular and lucrative NFT projects including CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yatch Club (BAYC). On the other hand, the Cardano NFT ecosystem is also heating up with the three most popular Cardano NFT collections are Skyweaver, Etheremon, and Spells of Genesis.\n\nCardano\u2019s NFT project, Clay Nation, also revealed an integration with The Sandbox Game, a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences. Thus, these developments seem to be providing Cardano with a lot of credibility.\n\nEnter The Sandbox \ud83e\udea8 Clay Nation will become the first @Cardano project to be integrated in @TheSandboxGame \u2013 pushing interoperability even further in #Web3 The experience will be created in collaboration with @smoblerstudios. Stay tuned for more. pic.twitter.com/kzdSsUyKpW \u2014 Clay Nation (@claymates) February 25, 2023\n\nHow are Cardano and Ethereum similar?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have several similarities owing to the fact that they share a common heritage with Cardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, being one of the original developers of Ethereum. Other similarities can be briefly categorized as both the digital assets are used for peer-to-peer transactions and as a mode of payment for services and processing power on their underlying blockchain networks.\n\nIn addition, both are also commonly used as investment products, with users buying them on exchanges and then holding or trading them in hopes of making a profit. Key similarities also include features such as smart contract functionality, developing dApps, sending financial transactions via the network\u2019s native token and the same Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms for their blockchains\n\nEthereum started operating on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, the original mechanism inherited from Bitcoin (BTC). But it changed to a PoS model in September 2022 which is a more environmentally friendly consensus mechanism than the PoW. Meanwhile, Cardano was launched with a specially designed proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocol for consensus called \u201cOuroboros\u201d.\n\nIn terms of smart contracts, both the blockchain networks continue to feature these contracts in their operations. It is likely that while both projects are still being actively developed, Ethereum is a tad further along in its rollout compared to Cardano.\n\nStaking: Ethereum vs Cardano. Which is More Profitable?\n\nStaking refers to a popular way to earn rewards, for helping to support network validation of blockchain transactions. The process helps the network to remain decentralized by spreading the consensus to thousands of validators that ensure the transactions.\n\nEthereum (ETH) takes the trophy for the most staked crypto asset following the successful Merge of the Beacon Chain consensus layer with the Ethereum execution layer in 2022. On-chain ETH staking yields are currently around 4% APY. To stake on Ethereum currently, users have to agree to lock away a minimum 32 ETH until after the network upgrades to Shanghai Hardfork.\n\nAlternatively, Cardano has no lockup period, ADA holders can stake at will, while maintaining the freedom to use their tokens to make payments and transfers and even enter into Cardano\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. Currently, ADA staking returns a yield of about 3.5 to 5% APY.\n\nRecap: Comparative Table Ethereum vs Cardano\n\nEthereum (ETH) Cardano (ADA) Launch Date 30 July 2015 27 September 2017 Max. Token Supply Infinite 45 Billion Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) /Ouroboros Transactions Fees $2-$6 (depending on network traffic) 0.16 ADA per transaction. Transactions Per Second 30 transactions 250-270 transactions Programming Language Solidity Haskell Web https://ethereum.org/en/ https://cardano.org/\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies have their own pros and cons, Ethereum is generally considered the safer bet when comaperd with Cardano. It is significantly larger and more widely used than Cardano, which gives it an advantage. As a matter of fact Ethereum is also more established and likely to survive long term due to its larger developer community and ecosystem. Meanwhile Cardano is relatively new and still building out its fundamentals.\n\nHowever, given the methodical approach Cardano could witness a sustainable growth over time, especially since it has a treasury, which runs as a separate entity from these organizations. On the contrary, when it comes to organizational structure, Ethereum is overseen by a single organization, the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIn conclusion it can be said that both the networks have a fair potential to grow in the future, there isn\u2019t a clear winner as of now. Alternatively, there\u2019s a chance that in the future both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) will both be winners.\n\nCrypto Economy reviews and comparisons are for informational purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.

        "content": "To understand how the Ethereum blockchain works, it is essential to get acquainted with its core component \u2013 the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM provides a secure, trustless infrastructure for developers to compile and execute smart contracts on Ethereum. Before investing in Ethereum, you may also read about some top advantages of Ethereum.\n\nFor many skilled coders in the blockchain space, this technology is one of the biggest advantages that make launching DeFi platforms like DApps, tokens, and DEXs on Ethereum so appealing. If you\u2019re new to all this tech talk but still curious about what makes the EVM appealing, here\u2019s an overview of what it does and how it functions.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum Virtual Machine?\n\nEthereum Blockchain has developed an important component known as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is the main platform of blockchain that permits the operation of codes for smart contracts. It\u2019s authored in Solidity programming language and also operates on Ethereum as a runtime atmosphere for several distributed applications (DApps).\n\nThe EVM\u2019s adaptability as well as support for smart contracts is exactly what makes it well-known among programmers. Additionally, it enables you to create applications in your chosen programming language and run them in the safe environment of Ethereum. The EVM can identify the condition of the bzzlockchain after including each block, apart from utilising smart contracts. It\u2019s developed like a state machine which enables it to execute specific immutable operations to figure out the state of Ethereum.\n\nHow does Ethereum work?\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine functions like a sandbox or a private Virtual computer in which you could create dApps. These dapps are created in various programming languages and are maintained in the Ethereum blockchain. Inside the Ethereum system, the EVM can be incorporated into every node. It produces a cloud environment including all guidelines as well as conditions for the delivery of code. This guarantees the instant implementation of smart contracts.\n\nCode may be made in scripting languages such as Solidity, Python, Vyper or maybe some EVM-compatible language. The EVM can\u2019t, though, handle all programming languages. Firstly, it transforms the code into \u201cbytecode\u201d computer-understandable code. Additionally, since operations are carried out in a sandbox atmosphere, you can change them at any time without impacting your data or programs.\n\nThis will make the computer more dependable and secure for getting started on any DeFi project. At the front end of carrying out smart contracts, various functions happen. It includes 2 primary features:\n\nGas Fee Calculation\n\nFor every transaction which the EVM performs there\u2019s a charge. It makes sure, though, that the device doesn\u2019t have downtime and functions seamlessly. If you wish to utilize the highly effective EVM tool to put into action a smart contract, you have to purchase the gas. Gas is utilized as a unit of work for Ethereum. It sets the price of calculation for a transaction in the system. This is the reason the EVM computes its gas charges along with the backdrop of good contract execution. Additionally, it internally calculates commissions for completed orders. Thus, whenever you verify a transaction, your wallet is going to ask you for a little amount of Ether as reimbursement for gas. The payment generally depends upon the specifics of a smart contract.\n\nEVM using OpCode\n\nThe EVM is a Turing Complete platform, which means that it can operate any complicated algorithm. This particular ability is the result of the Opcode because it lets EVM carry out instructions for smart contracts. Opcodes are a group of more than 140 instructive operations that assist EVM in executing codes. These actions are Push, Call, and ISZERO mSTORE among others. It additionally utilizes other actions to be able to work with various blockchains."
