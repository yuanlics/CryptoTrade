MEV is a complex systemic challenge for blockchains with various potential solutions, implementation paths and externalities.\u00b9 Ethereum, and more specifically the public mempool (the set of pending, unconfirmed transactions), has been described as the \u201cdark forest,\u201d a reference to science fiction by Chinese writer Cixin Liu, meaning \u201can environment in which detection means certain death at the hands of advanced predators. In this environment, publicly identifying someone else\u2019s location is as good as directly destroying them.\u201d In this paper, we attempt to illuminate the dark forest by answering the question, what is MEV?\n\nIn the first half of the paper, we define who the MEV participants are, how they capture value, and the serendipitous emergence of Flashbots. Then we will explain the MEV supply chain in terms of how it functioned on proof of work Ethereum and how it functions post-merge, on proof of stake Ethereum.\n\nIn the second half, we examine what types of mitigation and redistribution strategies at the application and consensus layers are being developed by the top researchers in this domain. Finally, we address the existential threat of cross-domain MEV and postulate a conclusion about the MEV end game, ultimately placing users in the privileged position that has been historically occupied by miners.\u00b2"

        "title": "What Are Smart Contract Wallets? A Beginner's Guide - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction went live on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet on March 1. While some expressed excitement for the news and the potential for smart contract wallets, the leading smart contract wallet providers reminded everyone that they already exist.\n\nSo what\u2019s different? And what in the world is a smart contract wallet again?\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nSmart contract wallets provide a means of self custodying crypto assets.\n\nThey enable bundled transactions, customizable recovery options, the ability to pay gas fees in a different token, greater privacy in identity management and more.\n\nNot all smart contract wallets remove the EOA from the equation.\n\nThere lacks a universal standard to account abstraction that can address risk concerns.\n\nERC-4337 is an account abstraction approach that intends to remove the reliance on centralized relayers and EOAs.\n\nIt can potentially provide a universal standard that addresses security concerns but needs further infrastructure.\n\nWhat are smart contract wallets?\n\nA smart contract wallet is a device or application that lets users customize the way they would prefer to manage their digital assets.\n\nAccount abstraction is how developers make smart contract wallets possible. They abstract all the essential functions of the Externally Owned Account (EOA) and plug them into a smart contract full of new levers and buttons.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a choose-your-own-adventure approach to self custody.\n\nUse Cases\n\nYou can program the smart contract wallet for the use cases that mean most to you \u2014 things like social recovery and bundled transactions. Proponents believe that it will onboard millions more to Web3 by revolutionizing the user experience, and critics fear that it introduces additional risks.\n\nThe Ethereum account model explained\n\nBefore we explain how it works and the significance of ERC-4337 account abstraction, it\u2019s worth refreshing our understanding of the Ethereum account model.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum uses an account model instead of a UTXO (unspent transaction output) model. This allows users to deploy and use self-executing smart contracts that can run applications such as Uniswap.\n\nThere are two types of accounts on the Ethereum network: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts.\n\nBoth are represented by a unique public address, which is essentially a string of letters and numbers.\n\nBoth can be used to send, hold or receive ether.\n\nHowever, EOAs and smart contract accounts differ in how they are controlled and used. EOAs are controlled directly by the user through a private key signing function. This authorizes the account to perform three primary tasks:\n\nValidate transactions\n\nExecute transactions\n\nPay transaction fees\n\nIn contrast, smart contract accounts are controlled by their embedded logic \u2014 a series of if-then statements. But this design makes smart contracts dependent on EOAs. They are still needed to deploy the smart contracts and prompt smart contract actions.\n\nThe smart contract\u2019s dependence on EOAs makes it difficult for wallet providers to program new ways for users to validate, execute and pay transaction fees.\n\nLimitations of this model\n\nThis accounts model limits many wallet providers to only offer users a seed phrase in the case that they lose access. The seed phrase though is notoriously vulnerable to users forgetting it or losing it to theft \u2014 which discourages users from interacting with the blockchain, and makes it difficult for them to manage their digital assets.\n\nRead More: What is a seed phrase and are they necessary?\n\nAnother pain point is the number of steps it takes for a user to interact with a smart contract. Since every interaction with a smart contract requires a signature, gas fees can get expensive quickly. This also adds vulnerability for the user, as each transaction increases risks associated with potential network congestion, errors in smart contract code, or other technical issues.\n\nLastly, the standard EOA model limits the innovation of wallet providers. There are workarounds that use smart contracts that enable more use cases with greater customization, but they come with a new set of risks.\n\nHow does account abstraction work?\n\nBefore ERC-4337, smart contract wallets had two general approaches to account abstraction. They could either use third party relayers with an abstracted EOA or use a layer-2 solution with native account abstraction.\n\nThe EOA and relayer approach\n\nSmart contract wallets like Safe use an EOA as the basis of a smart contract wallet and a transaction relay service to bundle and process transactions on behalf of the smart contract account.\n\nRemember, the current EVM logic requires users to deploy a smart contract with their EOA account. So in this approach, safe wallets use an EOA for its initial set up. But once the account is created, users can add a layer of customization to the authorization process.\n\nBenefits\n\nFor example, with Safe, users can configure several types of transaction confirmation methods, including multi-sig, time-lock, and threshold signatures.\n\nA multi-sig confirmation method is a security feature that requires multiple parties to approve a transaction before it can be executed. It adds an extra layer of security to transactions and helps prevent fraudulent activity.\n\nIn a time-lock confirmation method, a transaction is scheduled to execute at a future time and is confirmed automatically when that time is reached, without requiring any additional approval. This approach is useful for scenarios where a group of people want to agree on a transaction in advance, but don\u2019t want to coordinate their approval at a specific time.\n\nThreshold signatures is a multi-signature scheme where a transaction can be authorized by a subset of a group of signers, instead of requiring all signers to approve it. This allows for greater flexibility in the approval process and can increase security by reducing the likelihood of all signers being compromised at the same time.\n\nThis layer of abstraction can also be used to customize account recovery. For example, it lets users add trusted accounts that can help recover the account in case the user loses access. The recovery process involves a time delay and a confirmation from a majority of trusted accounts to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nSince the smart contract is on Ethereum, it still costs gas to execute actions that require multiple transactions. So instead of executing a set of transactions individually, the smart contract can be programmed to send authorized transaction metadata to a transaction relay service that executes them on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nRisks\n\nThis allows third parties to cover the gas fees for the user or let them pay the fees with a different token. The challenge though is, not all third party relayers are the same. Some contain unique centralization risks that the average user is not going to understand.\n\nLayer-2 native account abstraction\n\nSmart contract wallets like Argent have partnered with ZK-Era to provide account abstraction through a layer-2 solution. This avoids the need for third party relayers and removes the need for a user to set up an EOA.\n\nZK-Era\u2019s native abstraction uses Zero-knowledge proof rollups to bundle a set of transactions from an Argent smart contract account that are then settled using the ZK-Era smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBenefits\n\nSince the accounts are on a layer-2, users don\u2019t need to use an EOA for initial set up and authorization. This adds greater scalability and complexity because smart contracts on layer-2s can process more computations without delegating to a third party like a relayer.\n\nRisks\n\nThe exact process is too complicated to explain here, but the main concerns are rooted in the security and dependency of the layer-2 smart contract responsible for settling deposits and withdrawals.\n\nERC-4337 account abstraction\n\nERC-4337 account abstraction offers an approach that doesn\u2019t require third party relayers, layer-2 smart contracts, or a consensus layer change. It lets people manage a smart contract wallet without ever needing to use an EOA in the same way.\n\nIt does this through providing a new standard of transaction messaging. Instead of executing transactions individually or sending the metadata of a set of authorized transactions to a relayer, smart contract wallets can send a series of user operations to a bundler.\n\nSo what is a bundler and user operation? And how are they different from a relayer and transaction?\n\nBenefits and risks\n\nTo get a full breakdown of how this works, keep an eye out for an upcoming report from Blockworks Research analyst Ryan West.\n\nIn short, the model offers the potential for a more decentralized version of what relayers do for smart contract wallets like Safe.\n\nBut many on Twitter have pointed out that the current bundler infrastructure is centralized and fragile.\n\nTwitter user @blockomotive stated, \u201cthere\u2019s been other projects and technology offering transaction relaying services for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d they added, \u201cuntil many bundlers are up and running (which still requires dedicated [infrastructure]), the system remains centralized and fragile. Currently, only a few projects offer API services to run bundlers, increasing the centralization of 4337.\u201d\n\nAnd @Safe stated in February 2023:\n\n\u201cWe are evaluating an EIP-4337 integration (also based on a module). We will only roll out this integration when we meet our very tough security standards.\u201d\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nEven though the majority of the smart contract wallet discussion is centered around alternative account recovery systems, there are many more exciting use cases. Smart contract wallets have the potential to customize the way users manage their identity online, vote on governance proposals, delegate user responsibilities of DAO wallet and more.\n\nRead more: What Is Decentralized Identity? The Pillar of Web3\n\nMost account abstraction methods still require some form of dependency \u2014 whether it is a relayer, bundler or layer 2 smart contract. Web3 users shouldn\u2019t be expected to understand the difference in risk between the three primary alternatives.\n\nBut if the industry adopts a universal standard, users may feel more comfortable using smart contracts wallets \u2014 unlocking the smart wallet advocate\u2019s promised new wave of adoption.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Source: Coingecko\n\n\u201cBefore that [Filecoin Virtual Machine] upgrade, really all you could do on Filecoin was store data and retrieve it,\u201d Sami Kassab, an analyst at Messari, told The Defiant. \u201cBut essentially what the FVM does now is it kind of turns Filecoin into Ethereum, where any type of decentralized application can be deployed on it.\u201d\n\nThe Filecoin Virtual Machine is compatible with Ethereum, meaning existing Ethereum applications can be brought to Filecoin without major code modifications. Popular Ethereum applications set to debut on Filecoin include Sushi, Ankr and Axelar.\n\nEthereum is limited in how much data it can store. It can record NFT ownership, for example, but storing the NFT itself on-chain is prohibitively expensive.\n\n\u201cTypically on-chain, it would just point to [Inter-Planetary File System] or Arweave or Filecoin, where that data is being stored,\u201d Kassab said.\n\nDecentralized Storage\n\nFilecoin matches anyone with excess space, from data centers to people with a couple of extra gigabytes on their hard drive, with those who need cloud storage. Storage providers are to Filecoin what miners are to Bitcoin: they reach consensus on information stored by the network and receive compensation in FIL tokens.\n\nThe project raised funding in 2017 from around 150 investors, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Winklevoss Capital, who were able to buy the token at $0.75. It raised another $200M at an ICO limited to accredited investors, who were able to buy the token for between $1 and $6.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

That forces them to turn to centralized third-party lenders.\n\n\u201cBut now they can just do this all trustlessly on-chain, so this enables users holding FIL, to stake it and generate yield by lending it out to some of these storage providers.\u201d\n\nIn short, it turns Filecoin into a true marketplace for data storage, he continued.\n\n\u201cIt just makes the whole network more economically sustainable, because if you\u2019re bringing over users who now want to come and mint NFTs on the platform, which wasn\u2019t possible before, now you\u2019re just increasing the amount of revenue that the protocol is generating.\u201d"

        "content": "Is Ethereum a security? The question has financial experts divided. Some experts believe that cryptocurrencies like Ethereum should fall under security laws, while others argue that Ethereum's decentralized nature sets it apart. The outcome of the debate is still uncertain, but it's a topic that continues to spark discussion in the media and among industry leaders.\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Show More\n\nIs Ethereum a Security?\n\nWhether or not Ethereum is considered a security is a matter of debate and interpretation. In general, a security is a financial instrument that holds value, represents ownership in an asset, and can be traded between parties. Some examples of securities are stocks or bonds. Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that enables the creation and execution of decentralized applications and smart contracts. ETH, the native token of Ethereum is used to pay for transaction fees and services on the network.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not provided a clear ruling on whether Ethereum is a security, but it has stated that cryptocurrencies and coin offerings may be considered securities and subject to federal securities laws. The SEC has also said that whether a particular asset is a security depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nThe Howey Test Applied to Cryptocurrency\n\nThe Howey Test is a critical evaluation tool used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US to determine whether a specific asset should be considered a security under federal laws. Securities, such as stocks and bonds, are financial instruments that meet the criteria established by the Howey Test.\n\nAccording to The Securities Act of 1933, an investment contract must satisfy all three requirements to be considered a security. These requirements are:\n\nAn investment of Money In a common enterprise With reasonable expectations of profits Derived solely from the efforts of others\n\nThe first requirement of the Howey test, \u201cAn investment of money,\u201d is often debated when it comes to Ethereum. Some argue that validators depositing their ETH in the smart contract to validate transactions and secure the Ethereum blockchain is not considered \u201can investment of money,\u201d as they are putting ETH as collateral to participate in the proof of stake (PoS) mechanism and not making a purchase or investment. However, others argue that the ETH deposited as collateral can be viewed as a risk and may fall under the investment criteria.\n\nUnder the second requirement of the Howey Test, \u201cIn a common enterprise,\u201d there are two tests of Commonality that can be applied.\n\nHorizontal Commonality: This test refers to the individual's capital being tied to each other by pooling of funds and proportional distribution of profits. Some argue that staking ETH qualifies as horizontal commonality because the fund is staked in a similar smart contract. While others debate that since no one has direct control over the staked ETH, there is no grouping of funds. The staked ETH remains distinct and bound to the node. Additionally, there is no pro-rata distribution of profits, as validators are not incentivized or penalized on the transactions that the validators validate. Vertical Commonality: This test focused on the relationship with the investor and the promoter. The argument is that it does not apply to Ethereum, since there is no promoter. Etherum is a decentralized and open-source project, anyone can be a validator. The actions depend on the codes of the smart contract.\n\nThe third requirement of the Howey Test states that for an investment to be considered a security, there must be \u201cwith reasonable expectations of profits\u201d Some argue that there is a reasonable expectation of profits because the value of ETH is expected to go up and down and investors are able to profit. However, it is also seen as a passive investment not an active one.\n\nThe fourth requirement states that for an investment to be considered a security they are derived solely from the efforts of others. Ethereum's validators are made to work to maximize their uptime and stay connected with the network, which is not solely dependent on the efforts of others.\n\nThe Argument for Ethereum Being a Security\n\nThe argument that Ethereum is a security centers around the idea that the purchase and holding of Ethereum can be considered an investment of money, and therefore a security, under the Howey Test. They also argue that there is a common enterprise, as Ethereum is a decentralized network where all participants are working towards the same goal of maintaining the network. Finally, they argue that there is a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, as the value of Ethereum can increase and the holders can profit from the efforts of the Ethereum developers and miners.\n\nEthereum switching from a proof of work to a proof of stake consensus mechanism, has had people speculate that the ETH ticker doesn't necessarily mean it is the same token anymore and should be considered a security.\n\nWhy Ethereum Isn\u2019t a Security\n\nThe argument that Ethereum is not a security is based on the idea that buying and holding Ethereum does not meet the criteria of an investment contract under the Howey test.\n\nFirst, the argument is that buying Ethereum is not an investment of money, but rather a purchase of a utility token that is used to access the Ethereum network and its various decentralized applications. It is not a passive investment, but rather an active participation in the network.\n\nSecond, the argument is that there is not a common enterprise, as Ethereum is a decentralized network where participants are not pooling their funds and there is no central authority controlling the network. Each individual's capital is distinct and not tied to each other.\n\nThird, the argument is that there is no reasonable expectation of profits derived solely from the efforts of others. The value of Ethereum is determined by the market demand and supply, the value of the network, and the efforts of the individual holders who use and contribute to the network. The rewards for holding and participating in the network is not solely dependent on the efforts of others.\n\nWhat Happens If The SEC Says Ethereum Is A Security?\n\nIf the SEC were to officially classify Ethereum as a security, it would have a significant impact for the Ethereum network and its community.\n\nIt would mean that any transactions involving the sale or exchange of Ethereum would be subject to federal securities laws, including registration and disclosure requirements. This could make it more difficult for individuals and companies to buy and sell Ethereum, and may also make it more difficult for new decentralized applications to launch on the Ethereum network.\n\nAnother impact that could happen is it would mean that exchanges that list Ethereum would be subject to greater regulatory inspection,and may be required to register as securities exchanges. This could lead to some exchanges delisting Ethereum or not listing it in the first place..\n\nAnother possibility would mean that individuals involved in the sale or exchange of Ethereum may be held liable for failure to comply with securities laws, which could result in fines or other penalties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the classification of Ethereum as a security could have a negative impact on the overall crypto market, as it could lead to more regulatory inspections and more difficulties for crypto projects to launch and operate.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum\n\nWhether or not Ethereum is technically a security, its still available on a wide range of the best cryptocurrency exchanges. A few of the best crypto exchanges that offer Ethereum trading are Uphold, Coinbase, Robinhood, eToro and HYCM. If you don't already have an account with a crypto exchange you will have to make a new one and verify your identity with the exchange. As soon as your account is verified you can deposit funds and start buying Ethereum.\n\nWhat Are Security Tokens?\n\nSecurity tokens and cryptocurrency are similar in the way they are created and stored. However, the difference lies in the purpose and intended use of the tokens. Security tokens are a new way to transfer ownership of assets utilizing the blockchain platform. They allow for the digitization of assets and create automation with being in compliance with securities laws. They offer similar rights and benefits as traditional securities, like stocks and bonds. They have the ability to freeze or lock certain tokens if they are being held by a restricted person.\n\nThe market for security tokens is still in its early stages, but it is expected to grow significantly in the coming years as more and more assets are tokenized and more investors are attracted to the benefits of security tokens.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Considered, If Not a Security?\n\nEthereum and other cryptocurrencies are a relatively new and a unique asset class that do not fit neatly into traditional investment frameworks. Unlike stocks or bonds, which are clearly defined as securities under U.S. laws, Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are decentralized and operate on a blockchain network, making it hard to apply the same legal criteria as traditional investments.\n\nIt is important to understand that although Ethereum the platform is not currently considered a security. Some tokens built on Ethereum blockchain may be considered securities by the SEC, depending on how they are structured, marketed and offered to investors."

        "content": "Offchain Labs, the developer behind the Arbitrum ecosystem, announced on Wednesday it would be airdropping, or releasing for free to select individuals, $ARB, a new token designed to govern the two Arbitrum blockchains.\n\nThe new cryptocurrency will be released on March 23 and sent to users of Arbitrum One, the larger of the two blockchains, and Arbitrum Nova, specifically designed for Web3 games and social media applications.\n\nAs part of the token offering, Offchain Labs, whose founders are a Princeton University professor and his two Ph.D. students, will establish the Arbitrum Foundation and an associated DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, to govern the management and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Holders of $ARB will be allowed to vote on proposals submitted to the DAO, further decentralizing control of Arbitrum.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we\u2019re moving closer and closer toward a decentralized financial system, with the Arbitrum technology at the very forefront,\u201d Steven Goldfeder, CEO and cofounder of Offchain Labs, said in a statement.\n\nThe announcement follows Aribtrum\u2019s sudden rise in less than two years as one of the most popular layer-2 blockchains on Ethereum. With $1.6 billion in total assets locked on the chain, according to DeFi Llama, Arbitrum outperforms by almost double closest competitor Optimism, another layer-2 blockchain that similarly makes Ethereum transactions faster and less expensive. Optimism already has a token, OP, with a current market capitalization of about $750 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nGoldfeder told Fortune that the planned $ARB airdrop was a means toward further decentralizing Arbitrum, not a cash grab. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the token for the sake of a token. I really don\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cThe token is a tool to decentralize and a tool to give governance power over to users.\u201d\n\nHe said $ARB would only be used for governance, or providing individuals voting power in Arbitrum\u2019s new DAO. Ether, the native currency on Ethereum, would still be used for transaction fees.\n\nIn addition to the announced release of $ARB and the foundation of the Arbitrum DAO, Offchain Labs announced on Wednesday the unveiling of Arbitrum Orbit, a means for developers to build layer-3 blockchains on top of the Arbitrum blockchains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this increasing trend in the community where projects not only want to launch their own application, they actually want to launch their own chain,\u201d Goldfeder told Fortune.\n\nHe said that as Offchain Labs, which announced that it raised $120 million in funding in 2021 at a valuation of $1.2 billion, loosens its control over Arbitrum, it will spend the next few months focused on onboarding developers who want to create their own layer-3 blockchains on top of Arbitrum\u2019s network."

During the All Core Developers Execution Layer (ACDE) meeting on Thursday, Ethereum core developers set April 12 as the official date for the Shanghai mainnet upgrade.\n\nEthereum core developer Tim Beiko in a tweet on March 16 revealed that Shapella (Shanghai and Capella) upgrade on the mainnet is scheduled for happen at epoch 6209536 on April 12 at 10:27:35 PM UTC. Other developers also shared the news as staked Ethereum withdrawals are coming as the date was slightly delayed from the initial target of March.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will enable validators to withdraw their Ethereum staked on the Beacon Chain to the execution layer. It will also introduce new functions to both the execution and consensus layers. The Shapella upgrade introduces changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella), and the Engine API.\n\nEthereum clients will announce the software releases for the upgrade soon and would require nodes and validators to focus on updating their client software. Recently, Ethereum core developers also noted that several validators didn\u2019t upgrade with the latest client software releases causing issues after the Shapella upgrade on the Goerli testnet\n\nLido Announced Delay in Staked Ethereum Withdrawals\n\nLido Finance, the largest Ethereum liquid staking platform, announced that Lido staked ETH (stETH) withdrawals will likely be delayed to May. It revealed that the time spent on undertaking V2 audits has caused delays in readiness for the Ethereum Shanghai Goerli upgrade.\n\nLido revealed that stETH withdrawals are unlikely to happen on the mainnet until all audits are complete. The mainnet withdrawals are estimated to go live in mid-May.\n\nEthereum price is up just 1% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,664. The 24-hour low and high are $1,616 and $1,671, respectively.

        "content": "The previous six months should have been extremely beneficial to Ether\u2019s (ETH) price, especially following the project\u2019s most significant upgrade ever in September 2022. However, the reality was the opposite: Between Sept. 15, 2022 and March 15, 2023, Ether underperformed by 10% against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH/BTC price ratio on Bitfinex, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC price ratio of 0.068 had been holding since October 2022, a support that was broken on March 15. Whatever the reason for the underperformance, traders currently have little confidence in placing leverage bets, according to ETH futures and options data.\n\nBut first, one should consider why Ether\u2019s price was expected to rise in the previous six months. On Sept.15, 2022, the Merge \u2014 a hard fork that switched the network to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2014 occurred. It enabled a much lower, even negative, coin issuing rate. But more importantly, the change paved the way for parallel processing that aimed to bring scalability and lower transaction costs to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shapella hard fork, expected to take effect on the mainnet in April, is the next step in the Ethereum network upgrade. The change will allow validators who previously deposited 32 ETH to enter the staking mechanism to withdraw in part or in full. While this development is generally positive because it gives validators more flexibility, the potential 1.76 million ETH unlock is a negative consequence.\n\nHowever, there is a cap on the number of validators that can exit; therefore, the maximum daily unstake is 70,000 ETH. Moreover, after exiting the validation process, one may choose between Lido, Rocket Pool or a decentralized finance (DeFi) application for yield mechanisms. These coins will not necessarily be sold on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the recent drop below the 0.068 ETH/BTC ratio has affected investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures recovered from a state of panic\n\nIn healthy markets, the annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% to cover associated costs and risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (\u201cbackwardation\u201d) relative to traditional spot markets, it indicates traders\u2019 lack of confidence and is regarded as a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nDerivatives traders became uncomfortable holding leverage long (bull) positions as the Ether futures premium moved below zero on March 11, down from 3.5% just two days prior. More importantly, the current 2.5% premium remains modest and distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish threshold.\n\nNonetheless, declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nRelated: Lark Davis on fighting social media storms, and why he\u2019s an ETH bull \u2014 Hall of Flame\n\nETH options confirm a lack of risk appetite\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 3, the delta skew crossed the bearish 8% threshold, indicating stress among professional traders. The fear levels peaked on March 10, when the price of Ether plummeted to $1,370, its lowest level in 56 days, although the price of ETH rebounded above $1,480 on March 12.\n\nSurprisingly, on March 12, the 25% delta skew metric continued to rise, reaching its highest level of skepticism since November 2022. It happened just hours before Ether\u2019s price rose 20% in 48 hours, which explains why ETH traders shorting futures contracts faced $507 million in liquidations.\n\nThe 3% delta skew metric currently signals a balanced demand for ETH call and put options. When combined with the neutral stance on the ETH futures premium, the derivatives market indicates that professional traders are hesitant to place either bullish or bearish bets. Unfortunately, ETH derivatives metrics do not favor traders expecting Ether to reclaim the 0.068 level against Bitcoin in the near term.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Web3 URLs \u2014 enabled with the launch of ERC-4804 \u2014 have made it onto Ethereum, allowing internet users to access Ethereum applications and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) without worrying about centralized censorship.\n\nThe new Ethereum standard, titled \u201cWeb3 URL to EVM Call Message Translation,\u201d was first proposed on Feb. 14, 2022, and was co-authored by ETHStorage founder Qi Zhou, Ethereum researcher Sam Wilson, and Chao Pi.\n\nIt described the proposal as an \u201cHTTP-style\u201d URL to directly access on-chain Web3 content, such as decentralized applications (DApps) front-ends and NFTs. More than a year later, ERC-4804 was approved and finalized on the mainnet on March 1.\n\n1/n, I am delighted to announce that the first web access protocol for ETH ERC4804: Web3 URL is approved by EIP editors and finalized!\n\n\n\nweb3:// (https://t.co/uXpTGdXirF) is decentralized http://. It allow users to directly browse the rich web content on EVM, pages/images/songs! \u2014 Qi Zhou (@qc_qizhou) March 1, 2023\n\nAnthurine Xiang, a spokesperson for layer-2 storage protocol ETHStorage, explained that in many cases, the ecosystem still relies on centralized web servers to access \u201cdecentralized\u201d apps.\n\n\u201cRight now, all the DApps like Uniswap [...] claim to be decentralized apps,\u201d Xiang explained, adding: \u201cBut how [do] we get on the webpage? You have to go through the DNS. You have to go through GoDaddy. [...] All those are centralized servers.\u201d\n\nGraphic explaining how the new model compares to Web2. Source: w3eth.io\n\nToday, most users access the internet via \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol,\u201d widely known as HTTP.\n\nWhen an internet user clicks a link or types in a website address, the computer uses HTTP to ask another computer to retrieve the information, such as a website or pictures.\n\nUnder ERC-4804, internet users have the option to type in \u201cweb3://\u201d (as opposed to \u201chttp://\u201d) in their browsers to bring up DApps such as Uniswap or on-chain NFTs directly. This is because the standard allows users to directly run a query to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nFlow chart explaining how Web3 URL standard works with Uniswap. Source: w3eth.io\n\nEntire websites can theoretically be accessed by these means as long as their content is stored on the Ethereum blockchain or a compatible layer-2 protocol. However, the costs of doing this are still very prohibitive, according to ETHStorage founder Qi Zhou.\n\n\u201cThe critical issue here is that the storage cost on Ethereum is super, super expensive on mainnet,\u201d Zhou said in a recent presentation at ETHDenver.\n\n\u201cFor example, 1 Gigabyte of on-chain data will cost roughly $10 million. [...] That is unacceptable for a lot of Web2 applications and even a lot of NFTs,\u201d Zhou added, noting that layer-2 storage solutions could help mitigate some of the costs.\n\nXiang suggested that, given the costs, the new URL standard makes sense only for specific applications.\n\n\u201cNot everything needs to go decentralized. If you are running a pretty good Web2 business and you don\u2019t have to worry too much about centralized censorship. [...] You can just go for that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the new standard would be useful for DApps or websites at risk of censorship, with Tornado Cash as an example.\n\n\u201cFor example, for Tornado Cash, a lot of people can\u2019t get to them through their website because there\u2019s censorship,\u201d Xiang explained.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a DApp and you\u2019ve already been decentralized, why are you still using a centralized website for people to get access to you?\u201d\n\nExample of websites that are able to be accessed via web3:// URL. Source: w3eth.io\n\nAsked whether the new standard could be leveraged by bad actors to partake in illicit activity, Xiang said:\n\n\u201cThis is really hard to say just like how Bitcoin was founded. I think Bitcoin was not born for evil, but still, in the beginning, people [were] doing shady things like the Silk Road, they had been using Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nInstead, Xiang believes, like Bitcoin, they\u2019re just giving people a decentralized option they may not have otherwise.\n\nThe new Ethereum standard is the first of its kind for the blockchain, noted Xiang, though it\u2019s not the first solution to decentralized web hosting.\n\nRelated: How to host a decentralized website\n\nThe InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an example of a network created to do through decentralized means, what centralized cloud servers currently provide. However, Xiang noted that an IPFS URL can only link to static content, which can\u2019t be amended or changed.\n\nI *use* IPFS to store my blog. It has serious UX issues (took ~1h for my last update to propagate). Sticking the blog on-chain would have been way easier.\n\n\n\nFor blogs, that's unfortunately too expensive, but for short text records the logic applies. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 27, 2022\n\nERC-4804 will allow for \u201cdynamic data,\u201d such as allowing people to leave likes and comments and interact with content on a website, explained Xiang. Being Ethereum native, the standard is also expected to be able to interact with other blockchains much easier, Xiang added."

If the validator chooses to do so, they can withdraw the entirety of their 32 ether and earned rewards and enter an exit queue.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation notes that the size of the exit queue will vary depending on the size of the validator set in the network, to ensure that there is a limit rate of exit and entry into the beacon chain validator set.\n\nHowever, Blockworks Research analyst Dan Smith expects most of the resulting sell pressure to be limited to the first few days following the mainnet rollout, and other analysts see the upgrade being perceived as a significant de-risking for the Ethereum network.\n\nVance Spencer, co-founder at Framework Ventures, told Blockworks that a successful mainnet Shapella would be \u201creally important\u201d for any institutional players interested in jumping into the Ethereum ecosystem, but have so far been hesitant due to their inability to unstake ETH as it stands.\n\n\u201cIt appears that things went smoothly yesterday with the Goerli Shapella upgrade, and withdrawals are now being processed on Goerli testnet without major hiccups,\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m optimistic about the schedule, I think we all have to remember that there\u2019s still a month of testing left, and even if there are no significant problems, it\u2019s also still possible that major service providers could also cause delays if they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be ready in time.\u201d\n\nUpdated March 15, 2023 at 3:45 pm ET: Added comment from Vance Spencer.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) stakers who have had their holdings locked up during the Ethereum Merge event might soon have access to \u201cunstaking.\u201c\n\nCoinbase has announced in a tweet that unstaking requests on its platform may take the protocol weeks or months to process. According to the tweet, it expects a flood of staking withdrawal requests after the update to the Ethereum network enables the functionality next month.\n\nThe Merge transitioned Ethereum from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022, but stakers\u2019 holdings remained locked up. This merger created a temporary situation where staking providers like Coinbase allow users to stake ETH on its platform \u2014 but not withdraw the funds.\n\nExpected to take place in mid-April, Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade will enable users to withdraw their staked ETH. ETH holders can also stake more without being subject to an indefinite lockup period\n\n7/ We anticipate that demand for unstaking will be high soon after the upgrade and it may take the protocol weeks to months process unstaking requests. \u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) March 15, 2023\n\nCoinbase noted that staking requests are processed on-chain, and the firm will only act as a channel to pass unstaked ETH to customers once released by the protocol.\n\nCoinbase explained, \u201cUnstaking requests will open to all Coinbase customers at the same time and will be relayed to the Ethereum protocol and queued based on when they are received.\u201d\n\nOnce the upgrade is finished, users will be able to make unstaking requests from their Coinbase accounts, which will become available after approximately 24 hours. However, customers should anticipate a considerable wait time after submitting the request.\n\nCoinbase cannot give customers an exact timeframe for unstaking because they don\u2019t have control over the process. They have given an estimate based on the time it takes for the Ethereum network to process transactions, but customers should be prepared to wait and be patient.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price reaches lowest level relative to Bitcoin in 5 months\n\nTo account for the inconvenience, Coinbase provides its users a liquid staking option called \u201ccbETH\u201d as a derivative of staked ETH on the platform, letting stakers effectively trade ETH while it is still locked up, with the promise of redeemability at a later date."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella hard fork has been successfully executed on the Goerli testnet, the final test before Ethereum validators can withdraw their ether from the Beacon Chain.\n\nHowever, the journey to this milestone wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) core developer, Tim Beiko, pointed out that some testnet validators failed to upgrade their client software ahead of the Goerli fork, causing delays in processing deposits. He attributed it to testnet validators having \u201cless incentive\u201d to make the upgrade given that the Goerli ETH \u201cis worthless.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1635771385380499456\n\nBeiko remains optimistic that validators will make necessary adjustments before the fork on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade comprises five different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4895 being the most anticipated, as it will push staked ETH from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer, bringing Ethereum one step closer to a fully functional proof-of-stake system.\n\nShapella hard fork to unlock $30b worth of ETH\n\nShapella is set to roll out on the Ethereum mainnet in early April, following delays in preparing the Sepolia and Goerli testnets for the fork.\n\nThis hard fork introduces partial and full withdrawals and unlocks 17.6 million ETH, amounting to over $30 billion at current prices. These funds have been locked up since the launch of Ethereum\u2019s PoS Beacon Chain in December 2020.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will enable phased validator withdrawals, allowing users who have been staking to access their staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\n\n\nThere are 522K active validators on Ethereum, and once the upgrade comes, only ~1.6k-1.8k validators would be able to exit per day pic.twitter.com/ewCvD7u1ER \u2014 ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) March 8, 2023\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Foundation has implemented measures to prevent a flood of ETH from hitting the market. Withdrawals are capped at 0.40% of total staked ETH, with only 2,200 withdrawals processed daily.\n\nTestnets replicate a main blockchain, providing developers with a testing ground to patch bugs before upgrades go live on the mainnet. Goerli was the third and final testnet to go through such simulations.\n\nThis test was highly anticipated as it has the largest validator set and closely mimics the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s activity. It was also the final opportunity for staking providers to test the correct processing of staked ETH withdrawals before the upgrade went live.\n\nEthereum developers will convene for their biweekly call on March 16 to set a date for the mainnet Shanghai upgrade. During the last biweekly call, Ethereum developers discussed a target date for early April, a slight deviation from their initial timeline of March.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nArbitrum is finally decentralizing into the hands of its community.\n\nThe popular Ethereum scaling solution today announced the imminent launch of its native ARB token, joining other layer-2 projects like Optimism.\n\nThe governance token will let holders vote and propose any changes that they would like to execute to Arbitrum. The project is an optimistic rollup solution, which moves network activity off of the Ethereum mainnet to lower gas costs. According to data pulled from L2 Beat, it commands more than 55% of the layer-2 market in terms of how much money is on it.\n\nThough Offchain Labs, the dev team behind Arbitrum, has announced the token drop, its distribution won\u2019t kick off for another week.\n\nIn the meantime, users will have the ability to nominate delegates to help steer the direction of the project. Akin to representative democracy, token holders who may have a vested interest in a crypto project, but perhaps not the time or technical acumen to truly improve a protocol, can give their voting power to another individual.\n\nEarly Arbitrum users, determined by an internal eligibility criterion, will be eligible to receive the new ARB token, said Offchain Labs\u2019 co-founder and CEO Steven Goldfeder.\n\n\u201cWe worked very closely with Nansen and meticulously, over many, many months to decide the criteria for the user airdrop,\u201d he said.\n\nIndividual user addresses will enjoy 11.6% of the entire token supply, with another 1.1% going to other projects built on Arbitrum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot only are we giving Arbitrum users a say in governance, we\u2019re also giving DAOs of Arbitrum projects and projects building on Arbitrum a say,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\nThe total value locked (TVL), or the amount of money sloshing around in a specific project, is just one metric that the team has used, but Goldfeder insisted that eligibility has been very broad to include as many projects as possible.\n\n\u201cWe try not to overfit for one metric,\u201d he said. \u201cFor gaming projects or social projects, TVL is not the metric they use.\u201d\n\nArbitrum turns to token-governed development\n\nPrior to today, Offchain Labs was the sole entity in charge of making changes or adjustments to the scaling technology.\n\nNow, though, alongside the launch of the token, Goldfeder and his team will be giving these controls over to its community. These controls also come with the added responsibility that as soon as the DAO executes a vote, the code will be updated simultaneously. DAO votes have usually been used to signal to developer teams which changes to make, but examples in the past also show how sometimes that signal doesn't actually go on-chain.\n\n\u201cThere will be the DAO and the community that decides the future of the chain and the future of technology,\u201d said Goldfeder. \u201cThere will be Offchain and others that will be developing technology, but ultimately, it\u2019ll be the direction of the DAO.\u201d\n\nImportantly, it isn\u2019t a move to fully open-source the code. Instead, said Goldfeder, it\u2019s a middle ground, giving the community the licensing regime to bestow on other developer teams.\n\n\u201cThe community will have the ability to decide the future of technology and how it wants to license it,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cIf one thing is clear, that in the Arbitrum ecosystem, it's in the community's best interest, and in everyone's best interests, to be open and free to use and free to modify. I think that will spur a lot of innovation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Gary Gensler, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has once again implied that proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens, which include Ethereum (ETH), should be regulated as securities, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring an SEC meeting held on Wednesday, the head of the organization highlighted that the individuals behind these tokens frequently utilize social media platforms to promote their ventures, attracting investors who anticipate making profits. He suggested that these projects should seek professional guidance in order to ensure compliance.\n\nGensler's statement was in response to a question about the different views between him and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam, who recently stated that he considers Ether a commodity.\n\nDuring an interview in February, Gensler suggested that Ethereum might fall under the classification of a security. He believes that cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, are securities since entrepreneurs utilize diverse methods to endorse their tokens and attract investors. This view contradicts with the view of the head of the SEC's sister regulatory agency.\n\nUnlike proof-of-work (PoW), which relies on computational power and energy consumption to solve complex mathematical problems, PoS relies on the amount of cryptocurrency held by participants (their \"stake\") in order to determine their chances of creating a new block and validating transactions.\n\nThere are still heated debates about whether or not Ether can be considered a security after the second most popular blockchain network transitioned away from proof-of-work last year.\n\nCrypto firms aim to avoid being regulated as securities due to stringent requirements that come with that label. However, regulatory scrutiny is increasing.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, New York Attorney Genera Letitia James slammed cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin with a lawsuit earlier this month for allegedly selling unregistered securities. In the lawsuit, James suggested that the Bitcoin competitor is an unregistered security since it was generally treated as a commodity. This is a rare instance of the token being given that legal status.\n\nGensler declined to comment on any specific token after repeatedly refusing to mention Ethereum in the past."

        "content": "Over the past trading sessions, Ethereum has managed to appreciate and topple over the $1,600 price zone. At the moment, the altcoin might be displaying consolidated price action.\n\nIn the past week, the coin has jumped by nearly 8%, which has made ETH breach a crucial resistance level of $1,430. It has now turned that level into a support zone. On the daily chart, the Ethereum price also formed a bullish pattern. The technical outlook of Ethereum pointed out that the bulls were taking charge of the price action. Demand for the altcoin had also moved north.\n\nThe buying pressure had noted a downtick but was still bullish. Accumulation also noted a positive change as a result. If the bulls witness a further increase in demand, ETH could break past the $1,700 mark. The market capitalization of the altcoin also increased over the last 24 hours, which indicated that buying strength also shot up.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nETH was trading at $1,686 at the time of writing. After piercing through the $1,430 mark, the altcoin continued to break past multiple resistance levels. The overhead price ceiling stood at $1,700, breaching which the coin can witness resistance at $1,770 respectively.\n\nThe crucial support line for Ethereum stood at $1,560. But a fall through this level will cause ETH to fall below $1,430. The bullish force seems to have taken over, although the rally could be short-lived.\n\nEthereum formed the bullish megaphone pattern, which is also called the broadening pattern that highlights volatility.\n\nIn this case, the pattern signifies the presence of higher highs and lower lows, which means that the altcoin was bullish. The amount of ETH traded in the last session remained positive, implying positive buying strength.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAfter being stuck inside the bearish zone, demand managed to move into the positive zone over the last few trading sessions. The Relative Strength Index was above the 50 mark and was parked near the 60-mark, indicating that buyers outnumbered sellers.\n\nThe indicator noted a small downtick, it is crucial that demand climbs on the chart further if ETH has to trade near $1,800.\n\nIn accordance with increased demand, ETH moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line as buyers started to drive the price momentum in the market.\n\nOther technical indicators have also pointed towards a bullish force. Moving Average Convergence Divergence which measures the price momentum and reversal depicted in green signal bars is reflected due to buying signals on the chart.\n\nParabolic SAR indicates the price direction and the change in the same. The dotted lines were below the candlesticks which meant that the price was moving on the upside.\n\nFeatured Image From UnSplash, Charts From TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Uncover the fascinating story behind Ethereum\u2019s eccentric mastermind, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency that has been making headlines for its unique technology and the innovative minds behind it. But, what sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies is the mind behind its creation, Vitalik Buterin. In this article, we will explore the peculiar mind behind Ethereum and how it has revolutionized the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nIntroduction\n\nVitalik Buterin was interested in the political and economic implications of technology and spent much of his free time researching the subject. When he was just 17 years old, Buterin became interested in Bitcoin, and he started writing articles and blog posts about the subject.\n\nIn 2013, Buterin dropped out of college to work on Bitcoin full-time. However, he soon realized that Bitcoin's technology was limited, and it could not support the creation of decentralized applications. This realization led Buterin to develop the idea of Ethereum, a decentralized platform that could support the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nDevelopment Of Ethereum\n\nButerin's quirky mind was essential in the development of Ethereum. He could see a day in which the blockchain might be utilized for more than simply monetary transactions. His unique perspective allowed him to see the potential for Ethereum to be used in a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare to social media.\n\nButerin's vision for Ethereum was not limited to its technical capabilities. He also envisioned a decentralized world where power was distributed among the people, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. This vision aligned with the principles of the cypherpunk movement, which sought to create a world where privacy, security, and individual freedoms were prioritized.\n\nIn 2016, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack caused a significant setback for Ethereum. The hack resulted in the loss of over $50 million worth of ether, and it raised questions about the security and reliability of the platform. But Buterin's mind was not deterred, and he worked tirelessly to fix the vulnerabilities in Ethereum's code.\n\nEthereum is already one of the world's most widely used cryptocurrencies, and it has cleared the road for the creation of decentralized apps. The framework has been utilized for a variety of purposes, including decentralized finance and non-fungible coins (NFTs).\n\nEthereum As We See It Today\n\nToday, Ethereum is a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem that has become a hub for decentralized applications and smart contracts. In this article, we will explore Ethereum as we see it today and its impact on the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The platform's native currency, Ether (ETH), is used to facilitate transactions on the network, and it has become a popular investment option for cryptocurrency traders and investors.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi refers to financial applications built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that allows for peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for intermediaries. To address these scalability concerns, Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe upgrade will introduce a new consensus mechanism, known as proof-of-stake, which is expected to increase the network's transaction throughput and reduce transaction fees. The platform has become a hub for decentralized applications and smart contracts, and it has paved the way for the rise of DeFi and NFTs.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, such as scalability, the platform's potential for innovation and development remains vast. With the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the future of Ethereum looks bright. To easily trade Ethereum, go to Tesler.\n\nVitalik Buterin's Health And Its Effect On The Development Of Ethereum\n\nButerin has dealt with health issues since he was a child. He was diagnosed with asthma, which caused him to miss school and spend much of his time at home.\n\nDespite his health issues, Buterin continued to excel in his studies, and he was accepted into the University of Waterloo's computer science program when he was just 18 years old. However, Buterin's health issues persisted, and he eventually dropped out of college to focus on his work with Bitcoin and later, Ethereum.\n\nButerin's health issues have impacted the development of Ethereum in several ways. One of the most significant ways is by forcing him to take breaks and step away from his work. In a 2017 interview with Wired, Buterin explained that he had to take a break from Ethereum development in 2016 due to exhaustion and burnout. He also revealed that he had been struggling with insomnia and other health issues that impacted his ability to work.\n\nDespite these challenges, Buterin has continued to lead the development of Ethereum, and his work has revolutionized the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond its technical capabilities, and he has envisioned a decentralized world where power is distributed among the people. This vision aligns with the principles of the cypherpunk movement, which seeks to create a world where privacy, security, and individual freedoms are prioritized.\n\nEffects Of Vitalik Buterin's Autism On Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has publicly disclosed that he is on the autism spectrum. While autism has been traditionally viewed as a hindrance in many aspects of life, it can also bring unique talents and strengths.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of autism is a strong focus on one's interests and an ability to hyper-focus on a particular topic. This intense focus and dedication can lead to exceptional skills and expertise in a particular area. Vitalik Buterin, his focus and dedication have been on computer science and mathematics, which has led to the creation of Ethereum. Buterin's understanding of these fields has been critical in the development of Ethereum, as the platform requires a deep understanding of cryptography, distributed systems, and game theory.\n\nAnother characteristic of autism is a preference for routine and structure. For Buterin, this preference for structure has been evident in his work on Ethereum. He has been vocal about his desire for Ethereum to follow a clear and structured roadmap, and he has advocated for the use of formal verification to ensure the platform's security and reliability. This preference for structure has been essential in the development of Ethereum, as it has helped ensure that the platform remains secure and reliable.\n\nAutism can also bring challenges in social interaction and communication. However, in the case of Buterin, his communication style has been an asset in the development of Ethereum. His writing and speaking style are known for their clarity and precision, which has been critical in communicating the complex ideas behind Ethereum to a broader audience. Additionally, Buterin's ability to think outside the box has led to innovative solutions and new ideas in the development of Ethereum.\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn conclusion, Vitalik Buterin's peculiar mind was instrumental in the development of Ethereum. His unique perspective allowed him to see the potential for blockchain technology beyond currency transactions, and he envisioned a world where power was distributed among the people. Buterin's vision has revolutionized the world of cryptocurrency, and it has paved the way for the development of decentralized applications.\n\nVitalik Buterin's intense focus and dedication, preference for structure, and innovative thinking have been critical in the development of the platform. While autism can bring challenges in social interaction and communication, in the case of Buterin, his communication style has been an asset in the development of Ethereum. The unique talents and strengths that autism can bring are a testament to the importance of diversity and inclusion in the development of technology."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCEO of Ark Invest Cathie Wood has posted a thread on her Twitter handle to comment on the instability of the banking system that has shown itself recently. She pointed out that the two leading cryptocurrencies rose in price on that.\n\nElon Musk, tech billionaire and boss of several leading companies, including Twitter, joined the discussion in the comments.\n\nSlamming regulators for blocking crypto platforms\n\nCathie Woods stated that while the U.S. banking system seized up, the two major cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other digital currencies on the market took advantage of that and \"didn't skip a beat.\"\n\nWhile the US banking system was seizing up in response to bank runs threatening regional banks, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto networks didn\u2019t skip a beat. Instability in the banking system threatened stablecoins, the on-ramps to DeFi, in stark contrast to regulator rhetoric https://t.co/r5xwC96Pdj \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 15, 2023\n\nBitcoin reached an impressive local peak, exceeding the $26,000 level for a short while, rising over 17% this week. It was followed by a 5% drop. Ethereum price has surged 20.26% too since the weekend, hitting $1,776, but it is now down to the $1,689 level.\n\nHowever, Woods mentioned, the instability in the banking system as three major (and crypto-friendly) banks went down, two of them bailed out, produced a threat to the USDC stablecoin. It also impacted TUSD, BUSD and USDP.\n\nElon Musk steps in, supporting Woods\n\nAlso, prior to the crisis beginning, the SEC regulator sued Kraken and Gemini exchanges for their crypto lending service, and the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against KuCoin exchange, claiming that Ethereum is a security.\n\nRather than attacking those \"decentralized, transparent and well-functioning\" financial platforms that have no central point of failure, Wood believes, the regulators should have dealt with the weak points in the traditional banking system. The clear signs of a crisis there have been looming and are similar to the crisis in the 1920s, Wood noted, perhaps referring to the Great Depression that hit the U.S. in 1929.\n\nTwitter chief Elon Musk commented that the situation with banks is now very similar to that back in 1929.\n\nLot of current year similarities to 1929 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 15, 2023\n\nRobert Kiyosaki on fall of three top banks\n\nThe three aforementioned banks are Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. All three of them had cooperated with crypto companies like exchanges. Signature Bank also worked with Paxos, the issuer of the BUSD and USDP stablecoins. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also made a statement on Twitter to say that the company had small exposure to Signature Bank. The failure of the latter, however, will not impact Ripple's daily transactions.\n\nAs reported by U.Today over the weekend, prominent investor and writer Robert Kiyosaki predicted the collapse of Signature Bank on Saturday, saying that two major banks have crashed and the third one is ready to follow in its footsteps. He did not specify exactly what bank it would be."

        "content": "Eth staking on a PoS based consensus mechanism means actively participating in transaction validation of Ethereum.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum (ETH) network upgraded to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. This merger is the answer to the scalability issue and relaxation of the transaction cost. Before the upgrade, Ethereum used a proof-of-work algorithm similar to Bitcoin (BTC). There was a lot of electricity because of the excessive use of proof of work (POW). Additionally, it has caused scalability issues and high transaction costs.\n\nAfter the upgrade, Ethereum now consumes less electricity, is more scalable, and has relatively less transaction costs. What exactly is proof of stake, though? How can investors participate in Ethereum staking? Here in the blog we are explaining all ins and outs of Ethereum staking.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe crypto community\u2019s most sorted-after outcome is the Ethereum staking reward.\n\nUsers tend to favour Ethereum over other staking options due to its rewards.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum\u2019s version number 2.0 denotes the switch from its existing consensus mechanism Proof of Work, to the Proof of Stake. Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2.0, also referred to as ETH2, is the merger of the execution layer of ETH with the proof-of-stake consensus layer. Energy-intensive mining is no more when the consensus mechanism after the switching from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Moreover, the network is more secure using staked ETH.\n\nWhat is ETH 2.0 staking?\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network is currently garnering the highest traction. Following this, the transaction costs are high, making them prohibitively expensive for several use cases. This is partly due to the success of DeFi projects, where customers are ready to pay high transaction fees due to the high financial value of the transactions.\n\nTransaction fees are the cryptocurrency\u2019s \u201cgas\u201d costs because they support the applications running on the Ethereum blockchain rather than just transactions. Non-finance DApps find it difficult to operate on Ethereum because of high gas fees.\n\nTo address these issues, the ETH Foundation has been working on a network upgrade (previously ETH2) to improve the security, responsiveness, efficacy, and scalability of the Ethereum network. The Ethereum network can support more use cases and handle more transactions.\n\nAs part of this upgrade, the current mining model for Eth is a staking model. Staking on a PoS blockchain means actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining). With these blockchains, anyone can verify transactions and collect staking rewards by holding a minimal amount of cryptocurrency. Ethereum staking is possible on cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, etc.\n\nRead more: What Is Staking Crypto And How Does It Work?\n\nWhat is the process for ethereum staking?\n\nNetwork users must store 32 ETH on the blockchain to become validators, also called stakers. At the current price of ETH, that\u2019s a tidy sum worth more than INR 39 lakh.\n\nThe task of approving transactions, creating new blocks, and maintaining the blockchain\u2019s general functionality is then randomly distributed to validators. Stakers receive a yield paid in ETH in exchange for locking up their ETH.\n\nThe yield is recoverable if a validator needs to validate a block after the assignment. Investors can now take part in network staking thanks to that time. After staking ETH, it was under lock until the newly upgraded blockchain was operational.\n\nEthereum staking pools: To participate in Ethereum staking, you only need 32 ETH. For most regular investors to qualify as validators, they must be able to lock up this much ETH. Here, pool staking may be helpful. They provide a way for people to collaborate to obtain the minimum score of 32 ETH required to become a validator.\n\nThe pool\u2019s participants receive proportionate shares of the associated rewards. Staking pool support is not a native protocol of Ethereum. Numerous significant cryptocurrency exchanges, including CoinDCX, Binance, and third parties, provide Ethereum pooling features.\n\nTo participate in Ethereum staking, you only need 32 ETH.

Staking pool support is not a native protocol of Ethereum. Numerous significant cryptocurrency exchanges, including CoinDCX, Binance, and third parties, provide Ethereum pooling features. Lido DAO and Ethereum staking: There are ways for current Ethereum validators to obtain liquidity before the subsequent upgrade. The liquid stakeout, aka Lido DAO works in this way: The liquid tokens known as stETH, or staked ETH, are given to stakers in exchange for locking up their tokens.\n\nSeveral weeks after staking was made possible by Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain, this solution went live in December 2020. Since then, it has developed into the favored market leader for Ethereum liquid staking, gaining over 80% market share in the early months of this year. Unlike many liquid staking options, it is also decentralized. Using Lido, stakers can receive the ETH staking rewards and the stETH tokens to trade within the decentralized finance ecosystem or earn additional yield.\n\nHow much can investors earn by staking ETH?\n\nThe payout for ETH staking is not at a specific rate. Instead, it will change based on how many validators actively participate at any given time. The protocol increases rewards to encourage more stakeholder participation when there are fewer validators.\n\nStakeholders currently make between 5price% and 20% per year. However, according to some analysts, this could increase to 8% or more after the merger and then decrease again. The percentage rate for the yield earned will depend on both this gross rate and the price of Ethereum, which has demonstrated extreme volatility in terms of dollar gains.\n\nRead more: How Can Crypto Staking Be Utilized For Passive Income?"

        "content": "Backed with $3M, Soul Wallet aims to bring self-hosted crypto wallets to the next billion\n\nIf you own a non-custodial crypto wallet like MetaMask, you know the headache of keeping your 16-word seed phrase safe. That\u2019s the responsibility that comes with having full control over one\u2019s digital assets.\n\nA third-party wallet, like one hosted by an exchange, on the other hand, stores private keys on users\u2019 behalf and provides a better user experience. The risk is the lack of transparency over how user funds are managed, which could lead to incidents like the FTX meltdown.\n\nSome believe a new technical change in the Ethereum ecosystem is about to solve the dilemma between asset control and user experience. At the center of the movement is the ERC-4337 standard introduced by the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit research affiliate of Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency that boasts a vibrant developer community.\n\nJiajun Zeng, a former product manager at TikTok\u2019s parent firm ByteDance and Chinese on-demand services giant Meituan, was amongst the first to leverage the new standard. His startup Soul Wallet just raised $3 million in a seed funding round to offer an online, self-custodial Ethereum wallet built on top of ERC-4337.\n\nComparing existing crypto wallets and wallets powered by the new technical upgrade is akin to \u201ccomparing Nokia to iPhones,\u201d said Zeng in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cAfter the FTX implosion, people are refocusing on how to achieve a better user experience on a self-host wallet,\u201d observed Zeng.\n\nAt EthDenver, a major Ethereum developer conference that attracted more than 30,000 attendees in the Colorado capital in early March, the new standard was generating plenty of buzz amongst blockchain application builders.\n\nThrough ERC-4337, Ethereum plans to bring smart contract capabilities to wallets (through what\u2019s called \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d but let\u2019s not get into the nitty-gritty). In short, developers can program smart contracts, or lines of codes that execute predefined agreements, into wallets.\n\nBeing smart means doing away with some of the legacy issues of crypto wallets, such as the reliance on seed phrases. Instead, smart contract-enabled wallets make it possible for users to recover their accounts via social recovery, such as using one\u2019s trusted contacts, another wallet or even a third-party service. For those who use WeChat, it\u2019s a similar account recovery process.\n\nDevelopers can also code other customized functions into wallets, such as letting users pay gas fees using stablecoins rather than limiting payments to Ethereum.\n\nMetaMask, a popular self-custodial Ethereum wallet, uses an old cryptographic method called EOA, or externally owned accounts, where if a user loses their private keys, their funds are forever lost. Early mover Argent has incorporated some smart functions into its wallets but the features are still limited, said Zeng.\n\nThe challenge of introducing any new technological standard is scaling. MetaMask has sticky users because it\u2019s compatible with many popular decentralized apps. The question is how Soul Wallet and other similar startups can compete to build a significant pool of partners.\n\nEthereum is promoting smart contract wallets as the future of Ethereum, so dApp developers will feel incentivized to make the switch, reckoned Zeng, an active member of the Ethereum community.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting the next billion crypto adopters rather than trying to win users away\u201d from the likes of MetaMask, said Zeng.\n\n\u201cIn developing countries like South America and Africa, people are using cryptocurrencies to hedge against currency inflation, so it\u2019s down to how crypto adoption can spread in these regions,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cAs for developed countries, adoption hinges on how dApps and NFTs are evolving.\u201d\n\nSoul Wallet is currently undergoing internal testing and is scheduled to launch in Q3 or Q4 after a series of stringent audits, according to Zeng. The team has a dozen people spanning the U.S., Japan, Thailand and China.\n\nInvestors that participated in its latest \u201cparty\u201d round include Struck Crypto, Game7DAO, NGC Ventures, Dispersion Capital, Alchemy, Ankr and Signum Capital. The financing was also backed by a few notable angel investors such as David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams from Bankless; Kristof Gazso, the co-author of ERC-4337; Marc Zeller from Aave-Chan Initiative; Scott Moore from Gitcoin; Terence Tsao from Arbitrum; and Tim Beiko from Ethereum Foundation.\n\nUpdated on March 16, 2023 with the funding round\u2019s investor list."

        "content": "Whales added 400,000 ETH despite a recent price increment\n\nMore ETH is being circulated although the current vault could be overprice d\n\nLike a ton of assets in the crypto-market, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price jumped over the weekend. Even at press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value maintained a 5.11% hike in the last 24 hours. Needless to say, this has brought some calm to the market. Especially since much of it was flashing red over the weekend.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, despite the gains registered on the charts, whales did not seem to be content. As pointed out by Ali_charts, a crypto-analyst on Twitter, addresses holding 1000 to 10000 ETH added $600 million to their holdings.\n\nThe information, derived from Glassnode, revealed that the whales took the action when ETH was still hovering above $1,680 on the charts.\n\nOn the opposite side of ETH\n\nSo, does the accumulation mean ETH still has a tendency to climb further? Well, according to Glassnode, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) signal had a reading of 98.45, at press time. The metric often reflects the 90-day moving average trend of the daily transaction volume, rather than a day-to-day valuation.\n\nCompared to its value in recent times, the aforementioned NVT signal is a high one. And, the last time it was as high was back in February 2020. Hence, it seemed to confirm that investors were pricing ETH at a premium while the market cap\u2019s growth outpaced its on-chain transaction volume.\n\nWhile the aforementioned metric considered ETH as being currently overpriced, more of the altcoin has been in circulation over the last seven days. The circulation shows the number of unique coins that have been used for transactions within a specific period.\n\nAt press time, the seven-day circulation was 3.96 million. This implied that many units of ETH were swirling around the market, despite their numbers falling when compared to the previous day.\n\nThat being said, one metric that has consistently moved north is Active Addresses. This metric measures the number of unique addresses active on a network. With 24-hour active address count of 534,000, the reading implied that many wallets had either received or sent ETH over the last 24 hours.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAlmost equal exchange flow reactions\n\nWhile ETH remains on whales\u2019 radar, activities on exchanges revealed that it has been a close contest for outflows and inflows.\n\nIn fact, according to Santiment, exchange outflows were as high as 28,400. This seemed to underline traders\u2019 temporary market shortage and contribution to an asset\u2019s appreciation.\n\nOn the other hand, the exchange inflows were 24,000. With the difference in favor of the outflows, it means that ETH has a slight chance of foregoing depreciation in the short term.\n\nHowever, traders might still need to be cautious of projection. This, because of several negative developments and contrasting market reactions."

As the market grows competitive with the advent of Blur and other NFT marketplaces, Hedera finds itself a prominent music NFT project, Mynt, migrating from Ethereum to its network.\n\nMynt Brings Music NFTs To Hedera\n\nSince the latter half of 2022, the NFT market has been plagued by a significant slowdown in the sale of digital collectibles, which has contributed to the sector\u2019s following descent into the abyss of a bear market. However, this has not slowed down the growth of the Hedera ecosystem, as it continues to stride towards creating and introducing new applications on top of its Hashgraph-powered network.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More: New AI Product Sparks Optimism For Hedera Network\n\nOn Tuesday, Hedera\u2019s development arm, HBAR Foundation, announced the launch of Mynt which acts as a launchpad, incubating new artists into the world of Web3 and providing them with insights to launch and grow successful NFT projects. Mynt chose Hedera over other layer-1 blockchains, due to its commitment of creating eco-friendly NFTs, which the NFT platform utilizes to actively generate new revenue streams for artists and musicians.\n\nAlex Russman, VP at the HBAR Foundation\u2019s Metaverse Fund, was quoted as saying:\n\nThe Mynt team are bringing their industry expertise and artist network to to the Hedera ecosystem around a clear understanding of how Web3 innovation best contributes to the artist journey and fan experience.\n\nHBAR\u2019s Push For NFT Growth\n\nHedera is often chosen as the preferred choice because of the scalable nature of its token service, when it comes to generating NFT collections from the perspectives of speed, security, and fees. On the carbon-negative Hedera network, the cost of minting a collection of 10,000 NFTs is only $78 USD.\n\nAdditionally, University College London (UCL) discovered in their most recent research that Hedera consumes the least amount of energy per transaction of any public distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u2014 using 3300 times less energy than Ethereum and 1000 times less energy than VISA.\n\nIn light of this HBAR crypto news, the price of Hedera (HBAR) is currently exchanging hands at $0.065, which represents an increase of 2.10% over the past 24 hours as opposed to a gain of 4% recorded over the previous seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Silicon Valley Bank Now Under Investigation By U.S. SEC & Department Of Justice"

        "content": "After a months-long wait since the Merge, Ethereum developers have set a target date for the network\u2019s highly anticipated Shanghai hard fork.\n\nThe upgrade will enable the network\u2019s stakers to withdraw their locked Ether (ETH) for the first time since December 2020.\n\nWithdrawing Staked ETH\n\nDuring a recorded call among core developers on Thursday, devs set April 12 as their target date for \u201cShapella\u201d \u2013 the dual upgrade enabling ETH withdrawals. Shapella is a combination of the words Shanghai and Capella, changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layer respectively.\n\nOnce devs vote on and confirm the upgrade via GitHub, April 12 will be set in stone \u2013 a month\u2019s delay from their initial target date of March 2023. To be precise, popular developer Tim Beiko tweeted on Thursday that the fork would occur at block 6209536, which will arrive at 10:27:35 PM UTC on April 12.\n\nThis follows several successful simulation upgrades across Ethereum\u2019s testnets, including its Goerli testnet on Tuesday. Things ran smoothly besides some issues surrounding validators who were late to upgrade \u2013 problems that Beiko claimed are not likely to repeat on the mainnet.\n\nAgain, this is something that might be worse on Goerli than mainnet, as it's more likely those nodes are being run with less resources than mainnet ones. \u2014 timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) March 14, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s move to proof of stake in September allowed ETH owners to begin earning yield on their holdings, effectively producing 4% yield at writing time.\n\nIt also completely obsoleted the network\u2019s mining industry, incentivizing relevant businesses to transfer their GPU processing power to other proof-of-work chains. This has substantially reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy footprint, which its neighbor network Bitcoin is often scrutinized for.\n\nThere are currently 17.6 million ETH locked within the network\u2019s staking contract. That\u2019s roughly 14.3% of the total supply, creating a $29.4 billion wall of economic security against a potential 51% attack.\n\nWhile staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH for individuals, small retail holders can fractional amounts of ETH through centralized staking services. Coinbase, which offers such a service, predicted on Wednesday that its platform will experience high demand for \u201cunstaking\u201d after the upgrade next month.\n\nHas the Merge Backfired?\n\nWhile the Merge helped Ethereum escape the critical gaze of environmentally conscious politicians, it may have given market regulators more reason to clamp down on the crypto heavyweight.\n\nLast week, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin for allegedly listing securities on its platform \u2013 one of which, it claimed, is ETH.\n\nEchoing previous claims from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler, James argued that transitioning to proof of stake gave ETH more security-like properties.\n\n\u201cThe shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and incentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in staking,\u201d she stated in a legal filing."

        "content": "Despite recent negative developments in the crypto market, the sentiment seemed to be somehow bullish as Tether, its stablecoin and some major cryptos show resilience in the past couple of days.\n\nThe collapse of major banks has significantly impacted the stablecoin market, with Circle\u2019s USDC suffering a depeg causing smart money to flee USDC in favor of other stablecoins.\n\nTether is benefiting from the chaos in the USDC market with the organization minting more than $2 billion on both the Ethereum and Tron blockchains.\n\nWhaleAlert, a crypto wallet tracker, recently took notice of the mint 15 hours ago. With capital flight already happening on USDC markets, Tether\u2019s recent minting would drive up demand for the stablecoin.\n\nTether Minting: What Does This Mean For Ethereum?\n\nThe minting of stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain is a move by Tether which is expecting demand to rise for USDT.\n\nAccording to Nansen.ai, stablecoin diversification is happening after the subsequent collapses of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank.\n\nTether\u2019s recent minting could give the top altcoin a much-needed shot in the arm in price in the medium to long term.\n\nImage: Binance Academy\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, Ethereum is up more than 2% in the daily timeframe. Although comparatively smaller than yesterday\u2019s price movement, it is a welcome addition for investors to pad their portfolios.\n\nUSDT, on the other hand, is still the undisputed king in the stablecoin market. CoinGecko\u2019s recent stablecoin market research shows that USDT\u2019s market dominance grew by 2.3% in January to 49%.\n\nOn Stagnation And Rejection\n\nThe top altcoin is currently trading on the red candle, possibly signaling the start of profit-taking activities in the short to medium term. If the bulls can overcome the selling pressure that is present with high prices, the altcoin can retest the $1,778.99 resistance.\n\nA breakthrough on the latter can push prices to test $1,828 in the medium term.\n\nWith more USDT present in the market and a possibility of higher market dominance, ETH\u2019s attractiveness grows for investors. However, this is still speculation as there is an equal chance for the coin to drop.\n\nThe current market value of Ethereum is sitting at $1,700, however, the price is currently facing significant resistance near the $1,710 level.\n\nETH price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite this, if Ethereum manages to break through this level of resistance, it could potentially expose the ETH price towards the $1,800 mark, which would indicate a bullish trend.\n\nAs investors await the release of US CPI and retail sales data, they will also be closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movement. Currently, Ethereum\u2019s immediate support levels are at $1,600 or $1,495, on the lower side.\n\nETH total market cap currently at $201 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView\n\nThe outcome of the US CPI and retail sales data release will likely have a significant impact on the overall market sentiment. Should the data indicate positive trends, it could potentially boost investor confidence and lead to a surge in the price of Ethereum.\n\nConversely, negative results could result in a decline in Ethereum\u2019s value, potentially pushing it towards its immediate support levels.\n\n-Featured image from HappyCoin\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "America\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange is expecting a flood of staking withdrawal requests after Ethereum developers enable the functionality next month.\n\nWhile providing details about how the upgrade will impact the business on Wednesday, Coinbase said it could take \u201cweeks to months\u201d for unstaking requests to be fully processed.\n\nShapella is Coming\n\nIn a blog post on the matter, Coinbase explained that the upcoming Shanghai and Capella upgrades (collectively known as Shapella) will allow Ethereum users to unstake their Ether (ETH) for the first time since the Beacon chain launched in 2020.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s execution layer officially \u201cmerged\u201d with its beacon chain in September 2022, stakers holdings remained locked up. This has created a temporary situation in which staking providers like Coinbase can allow users to stake ETH on their platform \u2013 but not to withdraw it.\n\nHowever, after Ethereum completed its Goerli testnet upgrade on Tuesday, the official Shapella rollout is expected by roughly mid-April.\n\n\u201cUnstaking requests will open to all Coinbase customers at the same time and will be relayed to the Ethereum protocol and queued based on when they are received,\u201d wrote Coinbase. As the firm notes, staking requests are processed on-chain, and only acts as a \u201cconduit\u201d to pass unstaked ETH to customer once released by the protocol.\n\nUnstaking requests will be made available from users\u2019 Coinbase accounts about 24 hours after the upgrade is complete. After the request, customers can still expect to be waiting a while.\n\n\u201cCustomers may need to remain patient,\u201d said the exchange. \u201cWe anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process unstaking requests immediately following the upgrade.\u201d\n\nTo account for this, Coinbase provides a liquid staking option called cbETH to its users as a derivative of staked ETH on the platform. This lets stakers effectively trade ETH while it is still locked up, with the promise of redeemability at a later date.\n\nAttack On Staking Providers\n\nBusinesses like Coinbase Earn may not be around in the United States for long: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently forced rival exchange Kraken to close down its staking service, slapping it with a $30 million fine in the process.\n\nThe commission alleged that the product constituted an unregistered securities offering, while critics of the enforcement action said that Kraken was provided no reasonable pathway to register with the agency.\n\nCoinbase has been one such vocal critic, making multiple public arguments about why staking services do not pass the Howey Test \u2013 the SEC\u2019s standard for identifying an investment contract."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIf digital assets are classified as securities, it means more restrictions, something feared could hinder innovation in the sector.\n\nIt is part of a broader debate as the industry regulators move to tame volatility and protect investors.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)\u2019s hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee Wednesday was dominated by the discussion around digital assets. The commission took a firm stance against the SEC regarding the classification of Ether and Stablecoins.\n\nCFTC chair, Rostin Behnam, told the committee that the second largest cryptocurrency was a commodity since it has been listed on CFTC exchanges for quite a while and that it was the right authority to police its derivatives and the underlying markets. Responding to Sen. Gillibrand, Behnam told the hearing that his commission had considered all the litigation and credibility risks in the classification.\n\nSecurity or commodity: why the classification matters\n\nSuppose an asset is classified as a security. In that case, it is subject to additional regulatory requirements, something experts believe, in the case of Ethereum, could hinder the growth of the blockchain and the many projects building on it. Such classification also compels the regulated security to comply with the relevant reporting and registration standards provided under the Securities Act of 1934.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ether is classified as a commodity, it means fewer restrictions and growth potential. SEC\u2019s argument for classifying Ether as a security is based on how the project was funded \u2013 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). During the ICO, the agency claims investors bought the token anticipating a return, a test for determining security called the Howey test.\n\nBehnam also sharply disagreed with the position of the SEC\u2019s chair Gary Gensler that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities because the \u201cforks buying them are anticipating profits, and a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists are nurturing the projects.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCFTC\u2019s stance on stablecoins\n\nCiting a 2021 settlement with stablecoin issuer Tether, where the commission fined the platform $41 million on the allegations that it misled investors that fiat currencies fully backed USDT stablecoin, Behnam maintains his position that stablecoins also fall under its oversight as commodities.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding a regulatory framework around stablecoins, they are going to be commodities, in my view,\u201d he said. \u201cI know colleagues might have a different opinion, but we\u2019ve done the legal analysis and examined the circumstances around the Tether case. It was clear to our enforcement team and the commission that Tether stablecoin was a commodity, and we needed to move forward and swiftly to police the market and the company.\u201d"

Although the epoch did not finalize initially due to low validator participation rates, it did later finalize, as indicated by Arbitrum developer \"Terence. eth.\"\n\n\"15 epochs later, Goerli has finalized.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum developers have completed the final round of testing for the network prior to the Shapella upgrade.\n\nShapella Launch Date To Be Set Soon\n\nOn Tuesday, March 14, Ethereum developers conducted the final dress rehearsal for the upcoming Shanghai/Capella upgrade, also referred to as the Shapella upgrade. Although the exact date of the Shapella upgrade is yet to be set, the community believes it will take place in early April. The date will be set when the Ethereum developers meet for their biweekly call on Thursday. In the last call, the developers had talked about pushing back their initial March timeline to early April.\n\nLow Participation In Goerli Testnet\n\nTuesday\u2019s dress rehearsal took place on the Goerli testnet and stimulated staked ether (ETH) withdrawals. In the next and final step, the ETH staking would go live on the mainnet.\n\nAlthough the upgrade for the testnet was triggered at epoch 162304 at 10.26 UTC, there was low validator participation of just 26%. Due to this, the epoch has not yet been finalized. Ideally, this would have been done at 10.38 UTC.\n\nAccording to Ben Edgington, a product lead at Teku, an Ethereum client, this low participation rate was likely due to validator nodes not having upgraded on time for the Goerli fork.\n\nStaked ETH Soon To Be Unlocked\n\nThe upcoming upgrade is the final element required for the Ethereum network to fully transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism. Once the upgrade is live on the mainnet, validators will be able to withdraw their staked ether.\n\nSo far, the funds have been locked up on the Ethereum blockchain since its PoS Beacon Chain went live in December 2020. Additionally, validators would also be able to withdraw the rewards they have earned by validating blocks on the blockchain.\n\nMost Significant Testnet Completed\n\nDevelopers use these testing networks or testnets to assess the performance of different upgrades and changes before deploying on the mainnet. It provides the developers the opportunity to check for bugs or any necessary improvements to be made on the code before taking it live on the mainnet.\n\nMost of these testnets successfully mimic the mainnet to a certain degree. The Goerli testnet is considered especially useful and highly anticipated since, of all the other simulators, it has the largest validator set and mimics the mainnet\u2019s blockchain activity most closely. The Goerli testnet also provided the last opportunity for staking providers to check if the staked ETH withdrawals were being properly processed.\n\nIncluding Goerli, there have been two other testnets to run through the Shanghai upgrade simulation - Zheijhang and Sepolia.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "By Paul Hoffman from BestBrokers\n\nLooming Fed rate hikes were the hottest topic in the beginning of 2022. Shortly after that global markets dove even deeper into the red with the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Not long after the LUNA crash followed and crypto markets plunged deeply.\n\nUnfavorable events for the global economy continued and caused further damage to all crypto assets. Despite all the negativity surrounding crypto and multiple published analyses, concluding with the announcement of \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, the NFT sector kept developing at a good pace and our team at BestBrokers decided to pull some raw data out of the Blockchain with Dune Analytics and give a visual representation. For the report Dune Analytics was used to run raw queries and analyse raw data from the blockchain. It also features breakdowns by year and quarter of the unique Ethereum NFT traders and the number of Ethereum NFT traders as well as expert opinion on the overall NFT trading activity.\n\nThe number of the unique active NFT traders on the Ethereum blockchain rose to over 2.07 million in 2022. Despite the negative conditions in 2022, the number of active NFT traders on the Ethereum network surged 276% compared to 2021.\n\nInitially the number of trades plummeted 22.48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 but bounced back nicely in the first quarter of 2023, which already makes this year look promising.\n\nDespite the falling prices and the much lower trading volume for most of the cryptocurrencies, the number of the unique active NFT traders on the Ethereum blockchain rose to over 2.07 million in 2022 or 276% compared to 2021.\n\n\u201c The fact that NFTs kept traders\u2019 attention during such tough times for the whole investing world means that there is something special about this asset. With the crypto prices expected to only rise from this point on, NFT will become even more mainstream and eventually will bring a lot of younger investors to the markets \u201d Stable overall trading activity Ethereum NFT trading activity initially skyrocketed to almost 3 million trades for the third quarter of 2021 with BTC and Ethereum reaching all time high. However, this trend remained stable despite the turbulent 2022, only dropping in the fourth quarter of 2022 when the Fed rate reached (and exceeded) the 4% mark for the first time in 15 years. Even after the number of trades plummeted 22.48% in the fourth quarter of 2022, it still bounced back in the first quarter of 2023 with the number of trades in this current first quarter already 6.65% higher as of 15 March 2023."

        "content": "United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has again suggested that proof-of-stake coins may be securities. He expressed his view on March 15 after a commission meeting on cybersecurity issues.\n\nGensler was asked by reporters about his reaction to statements made by Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam at a Senate Agricultural Committee meeting last week that he felt stablecoin and Ether (ETH) were \u201cgoing to be commodities.\u201d Gensler replied, as reported in The Block:\n\n\u201cThe investing public is investing anticipating a return, anticipating something on these tokens, whether they\u2019re proof-of-stake tokens, where they\u2019re also looking to get returns on those proof-of-stake tokens and getting 2%, 4%, 18% returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever they\u2019re promoting and putting into a protocol, and locking up their tokens in a protocol, a protocol that\u2019s often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would just suggest that each of these token operators [...] seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries,\" he continued.\n\nGensler has voiced his opinion on proof-of-stake coins before.

        "content": "Ethereum's use cases and adoption rate in various industries\n\n3/16/23, 11:02 AM By Canarian Weekly Business\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications. It is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, which allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.\n\nEthereum has seen a surge in adoption in various industries, with use cases ranging from finance to supply chain management. In this article, we will discuss some of the use cases and adoption rates of Ethereum in various industries.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe finance industry has been one of the biggest adopters of Ethereum. With its smart contract functionality, Ethereum has enabled the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications aim to replace traditional financial intermediaries such as banks, by providing financial services such as loans, insurance, and trading in a decentralized manner.\n\nThe use of smart contracts ensures that transactions are transparent, immutable, and executed without intermediaries, thus reducing the costs associated with traditional financial services. According to DeFi Pulse, the total value locked in DeFi protocols has surpassed $200 billion, with Ethereum being the leading blockchain platform for DeFi. You might also want to consider knowing about cryptocurrencies\u2019 Decentralization.\n\nGaming.\n\nEthereum is also being used in the gaming industry. With the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum, game developers can create unique in-game assets that players can buy, sell and trade in a decentralized manner. These in-game assets can include characters, weapons, and other virtual items.\n\nThe use of NFTs ensures that the ownership of in-game assets is transparent and immutable, preventing fraud or duplication. The adoption of NFTs in gaming has been on the rise, with some NFTs selling for millions of dollars. Ethereum-based game Axie Infinity has become one of the most popular blockchain games, with over a million daily active users.\n\nSupply Chain Management.\n\nEthereum is also being used in supply chain management. The use of smart contracts enables the creation of a transparent and immutable record of the movement of goods from the point of origin to the final destination. This ensures that all stakeholders in the supply chain have access to the same information, preventing fraud and improving efficiency.\n\nEthereum-based supply chain management platform Provenance has been used by companies such as Nestle and Unilever to track the movement of their products and ensure the sustainability of their supply chains.\n\nReal Estate.\n\nEthereum is also being used in the real estate industry. The use of smart contracts allows for the creation of decentralized platforms for buying and selling real estate. These platforms can provide a transparent and immutable record of property ownership and transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries such as real estate agents or lawyers.\n\nThe use of smart contracts can also enable the automation of tasks such as property inspections and mortgage payments, improving efficiency and reducing costs. Ethereum-based real estate platform Propy has been used to complete real estate transactions in the United States and Europe.\n\nAdoption Rate.\n\nEthereum's adoption rate has been on the rise in recent years. According to a report by DappRadar, the number of active Ethereum wallets has surpassed 150 million, with over 2.5 million daily active users of Ethereum-based decentralized applications. The total value of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain has also surpassed $1 trillion, making it the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin.\n\nThe adoption of Ethereum is not limited to the finance and gaming industries, with its use cases expanding to other industries such as healthcare, energy, and education.\n\nChallenges.\n\nWhile Ethereum has seen a surge in adoption, it still faces some challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain. With the increasing number of users and transactions, the Ethereum network has been experiencing congestion and high fees, making it difficult for some users to use Ethereum-based applications.\n\nTo address this challenge, Ethereum developers are working on solutions such as Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade to the Ethereum network that aims to improve its scalability and efficiency. Ethereum 2.0 will introduce features such as sharding, which will allow the network to process more transactions simultaneously, and proof-of-stake consensus, which will reduce energy consumption and improve network security.\n\nOther challenges facing Ethereum include regulatory uncertainty, interoperability with other blockchains, and the development of user-friendly decentralized applications.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum has seen a surge in adoption in various industries, with use cases ranging from finance to supply chain management. Its smart contract functionality has enabled the creation of decentralized applications that aim to replace traditional intermediaries and improve efficiency.\n\nHowever, Ethereum still faces challenges such as scalability, regulatory uncertainty, and the development of user-friendly applications. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's adoption rate is expected to continue to rise as more industries explore its potential for innovation and disruption.\n\nOther articles that may interest you...

        "title": "'ETH is deflationary' - Why this is important under recent circumstances - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH sees surge in demand which may remain in the long term courtesy of deflationary milestone\n\nETH shorts traders suffer as price pivots while demand for leverage recovers\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP 1559 in August last year marked an important milestone for the network and ETH. The impact of that milestone is particularly evident in the fact that ETH is now deflationary.\n\n\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum (ETH) Profit Calculator\n\nThe latest Ethereum data reveals that the network has so far burned over 3 million ETH. The total amount of ETH burned is worth over $9.09 billion, trimming the post Merge total supply by slightly over 62,000 ETH. These findings underscore the progress that the Ethereum network has achieved so far as part of its PoS transition.\n\nETH\u2019s race for sound money\n\n\u200cETH\u2019s current 0.42% deflationary rate puts it well within the list of sound money. Why is this important? Well, traditional fiat money is currently feeling the weight of inflation which has been gradually causing the loss of value. As such, investors are eying asset classes that may allow them to protect their wealth from inflation.\n\nA deflationary asset such as ETH is currently more preferable both in the short and long-term. This is likely one of the reasons why the demand or ETH recently surged, resulting in significant recovery from the bearish performance we saw earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Glassnode\u2019s data confirmed a surge in demand for the cryptocurrency. For instance \u2013 ETH\u2019s exchange outflows volume just hit a new 3-month high. This is a sign that ETH traders have been aggressively buying the recent dip.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 3-month high of $32,742,895.81 Previous 3-month high of $32,737,155.33 was observed on 14 March 2023 View metric:https://t.co/L4RHmV9kZG pic.twitter.com/6CjaL5QgG0 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) March 15, 2023\n\nThe latest ETH exchange flow data confirmed that exchange outflows are back on the rise. A consequence of the robust buying pressure observed over the last few days, a period during which its price action bounced back strongly.\n\nThe aforementioned surge was strong enough to push ETH back to a new YTD high. As a consequence, the retest of its previous resistance level yielded some sell pressure. Hence, the higher exchange inflows than outflows.\n\nThe state of ETH shorts, liquidations, and leverage\n\nShorts traders once anticipated further downside after the events of last month. However, the pivot on 9 March triggered a surge in liquidations and a shift to long positions.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nDemand for leverage has been declining since the end of February, likely due to concerns over market outcome in March. This has been an unsurprising outcome, one factoring the recent market events which made it more difficult to predict the next outcome.\n\nHowever, we have seen an uptick in demand for leverage over the last few days, with the same corresponding with the price surge.\n\nThe market will likely feature more volatility if the level of leverage continues to rise. A higher likelihood of liquidations may lead to more wild swings."

        "content": "It's well-known that Elon Musk is a big fan of cryptocurrencies, praising their structure as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and claiming it will one day replace paper money. But how much does he actually own? And how much crypto is owned by Tesla?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll dive deep into Elon Musk\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s known historic and current cryptocurrency assets, so read on and find out all about it!\n\nWhat Crypto Does Elon Musk Own?\n\nThe short answer is: very little, if any. In 2019, he stated that, at the time, he only owned 0.25 Bitcoin, and only because a friend gifted it to him. However, two years later, Musk did claim that he acquired Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Doge ASCII hash strings.\n\nMusk never disclosed the number of other cryptocurrencies he personally owns. His companies, however, are another matter.\n\n(Yahoo Finance, Twitter)\n\nElon Musk on Bitcoin and Crypto: An In-Depth Look\n\nThere is no official information on the amount of crypto Elon Musk personally owns, only guesswork and internet snooping. However, his companies are easier to analyze. Let's see how these other companies fare and how much Bitcoin Tesla owns.\n\nMusk\u2019s love for Dogecoin is well-known by now. When talking about the recent FTX collapse, Musk\u2019s comments about Dogecoin lead to a breaking of a key resistance level as well.\n\nIf you want to buy Dogecoin, it's up to you to do so, but have his comment in mind: \u201cDon\u2019t bet the farm on DOGE, but I\u2019m working hard on the DOGE.\u201d\n\n(News.Bitcoin)\n\nTesla Invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February of 2021\u2026\n\nMany people have been waiting for Musk to take the plunge and invest in crypto. Almost two years ago, he did exactly that, through Tesla. This long-awaited Elon Musk Bitcoin investment was held based on new investment policies centering around Tesla\u2019s further diversification of assets.\n\n(CoinDesk)\n\n\u2026.and sold 75% of its Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAnd then, Tesla sold a large quantity of Bitcoin a year and a half later. At the time, this 75% was sold at a value of $936 million. Tesla claimed that the reasons behind this decision centered on the company\u2019s need to increase liquidity.\n\n(NPR, EuroNews)\n\nNow Tesla only accepts Dogecoin\u2026\n\nBefore, Tesla accepted Bitcoin as payment for their cars. A year ago, they dropped it as a payment method, citing Bitcoin mining\u2019s environmental impact as too severe. However, you can open up your crypto wallet and still pay for a Tesla by using Dogecoin.\n\n(Tesla, BBC)\n\n\u2026as does the Boring Company.\n\nIn July, the Tesla and Boring Company CEO announced they will accept Dogecoin as a payment method for their Vegas Loop.\n\nPeople will be able to pay for their rides by scanning a QR code at the Vegas Loop premises.\n\n(Mashable)\n\nIn July 2022, Tesla owned roughly 10,500 BTC.\n\nThe exact number of Dogecoin was not disclosed, but Musk did mention that they did not sell any of their stock. We also don't know how much Dogecoin does Elon Musk own personaly.\n\nThey did announce that Tesla owns digital assets valued at $218 million at the time. An estimation purports that they owned 42,000 BTC before selling 75% of it last year, leaving them with 10,500.\n\n(TechCrunch)\n\nA SpaceX intern started the rumor that Musk is the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nThe rumors behind Elon Musk being Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, seem to have been started by a SpaceX employee in 2017.\n\nMusk, of course, denied this and even posted on Twitter how the name Satoshi Nakamoto is a combination of the following brand names:\n\nSamsung\n\nToshiba\n\nNakamichi\n\nMotorola\n\nThis rumor is especially strange when you consider how much did Tesla invest in Bitcoin in 2021 and then how much did it sell a year later.\n\n(Twitter, CNBC)\n\nMusk never trusted Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe FTX collapse sent shockwaves through the crypto world. Musk, however, claimed that Bankman-Fried set off his \u201cBS detector\u201d in March of 2022.\n\nAt the time, the former FTX CEO offered $3 billion to assist in Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, hoping to talk about integrating blockchain into social media. Musk was doubtful of whether Bankman-Fried even had the liquidity to back up the potential $3 billion investment.\n\nIt might be interesting to think how much Elon Musk\u2019s Bitcoin net worth, and Tesla\u2019s for that matter, stands after this crash.\n\n(Decrypt.co)\n\nBitcoin Will Make It, With Difficulty\n\nMusk definitely believes in cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin. However, it seems that he is still playing it safe. In his own words, \u201cBTC will make it, but [it] might be a long winter.\u201d\n\nSources:"

Market capitalization currently sits at $478.81B\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency and is the comparison point for most aspiring network platforms. Its concept is aimed at those who wish to create secure digital technology. Its native token has recently seen a surge, rising to $1,690.99 when writing this article. The ETH price rose by 7.86%, over the last seven days and overall market capitalization sits at $206.68B.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere has always been a need for greater security; this world has no guarantees.

This surge was supported by the release of mildly encouraging inflation data and the ongoing recovery of the banking sector from a near-catastrophic event. While Bitcoin did lose some of its gains later on, it remains 81 percent higher than its lowest point. Ethereum also experienced a positive trend by breaking through a critical resistance level of $1,700. Collectively, these optimistic market movements indicate an active bullish sentiment.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cPrices of key tokens continued to rise on Tuesday, following a similar pattern of a previous couple of days. Next week will be decisive for the Crypto community with the Fed\u2019s rate hike announcement. We will continue to see a modest surge in prices aligned with past records. It will be a while before new ATH levels are reached. Experts have also predicted that only stringent regulations of the Crypto ecosystem and thoroughly compliant companies will stand a chance to partner with large financial institutions, as smaller players come under the scanner following SVB and Silvergate collapse.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum are currently trading at $24,900 and $1,700, respectively. However, at the time the CPI data was released, Bitcoin saw a sudden increase of $2,000 from $24,000 to $26,000, revealing inflation at 6 percent. While this rise in cryptocurrency prices may have been triggered by news of inflation, it does not appear to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cYesterday's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report met expectations, with overall inflation remaining in line with forecasts. However, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in slightly higher than anticipated. Despite this, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a rise in value to around $26,500, which can be attributed to earlier predictions of an even more hawkish CPI report. Nevertheless, BTC has since consolidated and is currently hovering just below the $25,000 level.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset surged by over 10 percent in just 7 days making it a highly productive month for BTC. The UK government bailing out the Silicon Valley Bank has created a positive sentiment within the investment community and which may have increased buying activity. As per the latest data, US consumer inflation has slowed down but its still on the higher side which may drive Fed to continue its hawkish stance. If the macroeconomic factors continue to remain favourable then we may see Bitcoin testing $30,000 level very soon.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead Crypto Market Recovery While New DeFi Meme Coin Dogetti Launches 50% Bonus On ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency has been in something of poor health recently following the Silvergate Capital crash but there are signs of recovery within the crypto market as the two largest coins, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) rally strongly in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. Meanwhile, the meme coin terrain is witnessing the emergence of a new canine token in the form of Dogetti (DETI) as it launches an exciting time-limited offer of a 50% bonus on its tokens with its promo code Don50.\n\nBitcoin Trading Higher Following SVB Crisis As It Leads Recovery\n\nThe crypto market has been both hit hard and revitalised by two different banks undergoing a crisis. Silvergate Capital, a crypto bank, announced its closure as sustained financial losses led to it being less than capitalised due to the FTX crash prior. This had a dire effect on the crypto market as Bitcoin, along with most other coins, began trading at lower prices due to the fallout. It also watched its market capitalisation sink as it struggled to shrug off the ripple effects of Silvergate\u2019s implosion.\n\nBut the BTC token was given a lease of life by what happened with SVB as it also lurched into a crisis that resulted in customers withdrawing billions of dollars from the bank and trusts in the crypto market growing. Right now on CoinMarketCap, BTC is trading over $25,000 and has been comfortably in the green throughout the past few days. Its market cap has climbed to over $501 billion after an astonishing gain of over 15% in price over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum Gains Momentum Ahead of Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum is enjoying what appears to be the beginnings of a resurgent bullish run in the crypto market. Across the past week, it has seen a price swing of over 13% as it has begun trading in the green. The ETH token is now selling at over $1700 and Ethereum sits on the CoinMarketCap with a market cap of just north of $216 billion.\n\nA return to trading bullishly comes as it prepares for its Shanghai Upgrade which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH. This de-risks staking for users and ensures that their funds can be seamlessly withdrawn. Alongside this, it will provide the basis for future upgrades on the Ethereum blockchain, including sharding, which will give significant scalability improvements when it eventually goes live.\n\nCommunity-Owned Dogetti Giving 50% Bonus On Tokens During Its Presale\n\nThe crypto market has always been a sprawling terrain of new emerging altcoins and the meme coin landscape is a particularly fitting embodiment of this. Dogetti, a new community-owned DeFi inspired by classic mafia family tropes to build a close-knit community, has caught the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nDogetti has entered Stage 2 of its ongoing presales and will move onto the third stage once it generates $4,000,000 in sales. To facilitate this, Dogetti is offering an incredible 50% off on DETI tokens through its promo code Don50, which is literally the crypto canine doubling on its previous promo offer.\n\nBut this new and exciting promo code does have a deadline so anyone interested should act swiftly.\n\nFor more on Dogetti, see the links below:\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "AVAX, AAVE attempt to match RenQ Finance\u2019s innovations but fall short - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that is gaining popularity due to its unique innovations in the DeFi space. The platform offers a range of services, including yield farming, liquidity mining, and staking, all powered by its native token, RENQ.\n\nRecently, there have been attempts by other DeFi platforms, such as Avalanche (AVAX) and Aave (AAVE), to match RenQ\u2019s innovations. However, many experts believe that these attempts will ultimately fail. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this belief.\n\nOverview of Avalanche (AVAX) and Aave (AAVE)\n\nAvalanche is a blockchain platform founded in 2018 by Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a renowned computer science professor at Cornell University. Avalanche aims to solve the scalability and security challenges faced by blockchain networks by utilizing a unique consensus mechanism called Avalanche consensus. This consensus mechanism enables high transaction throughput and fast confirmation times while maintaining high security. AVAX is the native cryptocurrency of the Avalanche network and is used for transaction fees and staking.\n\nOn the other hand, Aave is a decentralized lending platform that enables users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies in a trustless and transparent. Aave was founded in 2017 by Stani Kulechov and was initially called ETHLend. In 2018, the platform rebranded to Aave and expanded its offering to support multiple cryptocurrencies. AAVE is the native cryptocurrency of the Aave platform and is used for governance and staking.\n\nWhat Makes RenQ Finance Unique?\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s uniqueness lies in combining several DeFi features into one platform. RenQ offers yield farming, liquidity mining, and staking, all within a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for faster transaction speeds and lower fees than other blockchains such as Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenQ\u2019s native token, RENQ, is used to power the platform. Users can earn RENQ tokens by providing liquidity to the platform, staking their tokens, or participating in yield farming. The token\u2019s value has also been rising steadily, making it an attractive investment for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAttempts by AVAX and AAVE to Match RenQ\u2019s Innovations\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) and Aave (AAVE) are two DeFi platforms that have attempted to match RenQ\u2019s innovations. AVAX is a blockchain platform that offers high transaction speeds and low fees. It also features a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a bridge that connects it to other blockchains, such as Ethereum. On the other hand, AAVE is a lending platform allowing users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies.\n\nBoth platforms have recently introduced yield farming and liquidity mining features. However, many experts believe these attempts to match RenQ\u2019s innovations will fail.\n\nWhy AVAX and AAVE Will Fail\n\nOne of the reasons why AVAX and AAVE will fail to match RenQ\u2019s innovations is that they lack the unique features that RenQ offers. RenQ\u2019s combination of yield farming, liquidity mining, and staking is not easily replicated. Additionally, the platform\u2019s integration with the Binance Smart Chain provides faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it more attractive to users.\n\nAnother reason why AVAX and AAVE may fail is that they face stiff competition in the DeFi space. Several DeFi platforms offer similar services, and RenQ has already established itself as a unique and innovative platform. It will be difficult for AVAX and AAVE to compete with RenQ\u2019s established user base and reputation.\n\nFinally, AVAX and AAVE\u2019s attempts to match RenQ\u2019s innovations may also suffer from a lack of user interest. While yield farming and liquidity mining have become popular in the DeFi space, users are always looking for new and innovative platforms.\n\nRenQ Finance has garnered a dedicated user following due to its distinctive characteristics. In addition, the platform\u2019s successful presale stages, which raised $2.35 million in two phases, and its recent completion of the Certik audit have instilled confidence.\n\nAs a result, AVAX and AAVE may face difficulties in attracting users away from RenQ Finance.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nPresale: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Rewards Early Investors With NFTs For Free As Bitcoin Sees Highest Liquidations in Two Months and ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The Silicon Valley Bank crisis proves to be a Cyprus Moment For Bitcoin(BTC). While liquidity was already bad before SVB, now it seems totally gone. However, the collapse proved bullish for Bitcoin, which saw the highest liquidations in the past two months. Although Ethereum (ETH) started with impressive gains, it has seen a recent 25% pullback in prices. The new Big Eyes Coin (BIG) announces a huge reward for those who supported the meme coin from Day 1.\n\nThe First Big Eyes NFT Drop Is Here\n\nThe Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is in stage 12 of its presale. The cute community-owned DeFi meme coin promises its holder to make a big fortune. Having raised $31.55 million already, Big Eyes Coin continues to reward its members with promo codes, the vault pin and loot boxes.\n\nThe Vault Pin 300 is one of the biggest offers any presale has ever witnessed. It is projected as a very limited-time offer, and why not? It gives the members 300% extra free loot boxes when one buys a minimum of $100 tokens or loot boxes using vault pin 300. It means that on every purchase of $100 or above, one can get three loot boxes to open for huge rewards.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has some great news for its early investors. Those who have supported the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) from Day 1 will be awarded NFTs for free. In the first Big Eyes NFT Drop, those who bought in stages 1-3 of the ICO will be whitelisted to mint SushiCrew NFTs.\n\nBitcoin Crosses $24.7K\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency has crossed the $24K mark and taken the crypto market by storm after the Silvergate Collapse and the Silicon Valley Bank failure. Bitcoin added 11% in the past day to trade above $24,700 on Tuesday morning, possibly making up for all the losses that happened over the weekend.\n\nIt is quite shocking for many investors who are looking at the declining prices liquidating over $100 million worth of Bitcoin shorts. This is a highly liquidated amount as the Bitcoin surge caused $500 million in liquidation across the cryptocurrency trading market.\n\nIn other news, Binance (BNB), the alternate crypto exchange, said on Monday that it would convert native USD (BUSD) stablecoin to BTC, ETH, BNB or other crypto tokens. This also most likely added to the surge in BTC prices.\n\nEthereum Sees 25% Pullback in Prices\n\n2023 had started for Ethereum (ETH) with significant gains. Volatility and uncertainty in the crypto market, however, have struck this digital asset severely. After enjoying the February High, ETH is now trading at two months\u2019 lows, being nearly 25% down.\n\nThe financial contagion seems to have been caused by the Silicon Valley Collapse and the Silvergate crisis. The current price of Ethereum is $1687 (at the time of writing this article), which is still much below its all-time high of $4891.70 in November last year.\n\nWhile a lot of traders might look at it as a big opportunity to buy Ethereum, Buy-the-dip has been quite popular in Cryptocurrency Trading. At the same time, market upheaval is also building up a good amount of fear among investors.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How Can You Earn Free Ethereum? Best Ways to Earn for 2023 - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum is a popular virtual currency that has gained tremendous popularity over the past few years for introducing the smart contract capability. So, unsurprisingly, people are looking for ways to get their hands on some Ethereum for free. Fortunately, we will discuss several methods to earn Ethereum for free in this article.\n\nFaucets\n\nFaucets are websites that give away small amounts of Ethereum for free. They require you to solve a captcha or perform another task to receive your Ethereum. You can find many faucet websites online and earn Ethereum easily and with fun. However, before claiming from any faucet, ensure the website is legitimate and not a scam.\n\nExample:\n\nWith FreeEthereum.com, Ethereum enthusiasts can use a reliable platform to get their hands on some tokenized ETH without investing money. Launched in July 2020, the Ethereum faucet offers various tasks, such as clicking links and completing quizzes, allowing users to quickly gain small amounts of ETH BEP-20 (the token from the Binance Smart Chain). The faucet\u2019s settings were configured conveniently with a timer set at one hour, a minimal withdrawal of 0.002 ETH, and no withdrawal fees \u2013 making it an excellent choice for those who want to collect free cryptocurrencies at their own pace. FreeEthereum.com is a superb option for everyone interested in ordering some quick ETH.\n\nAirdrops\n\nAirdrops are another way to get free Ethereum tokens. Projects conducting airdrops have just launched their Initial Coin Offering (ICO), giving away tokens or coins to people registering for their ICO. Participating in these airdrops allows you to get free Ethereum without any investment.\n\nExample:\n\nThe popular Ethereum-based blockchain project Polygon (formerly Matic Network) conducted an airdrop of 50,000 MATIC tokens. All users had to do was sign up with their email address and follow the instructions on the website to receive their free tokens.\n\nOnline Games\n\nYou can also earn Ethereum by playing online games. Many game platforms offer rewards in Ethereum tokens for completing tasks or winning competitions. These games provide a fun and easy way to get free Ethereum without any investment.\n\nExample:\n\nEther Kingdoms is a popular crypto-based RPG where players can fight monsters, level up, and earn tokens. In addition, the game has an in-built reward system where players can receive Ethereum rewards for completing tasks.\n\nFreelancing\n\nIf you have some skills or knowledge that are useful to others, you can use them to get rewarded in Ethereum. For example, there are freelance websites such as Upwork and Freelancer where people post projects that require specific skills. You can bid on these projects and earn Ethereum in return.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you are a web developer or a designer, you can search for relevant projects on Upwork and bid on them. Once accepted, the project manager rewards you in Ethereum tokens for completing the project.\n\nCryptocurrency Trading\n\nTrading cryptocurrencies is another way to get free Ethereum. Although trading cryptocurrency requires some knowledge and experience, it can be a great way to make money without investment. By trading wisely and carefully, you can accumulate enough Ethereum over time that will be yours for free.\n\nExample:\n\nBinance is among the most popular crypto exchanges, offering users various trading options. With Binance, you can trade Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies for gains. By carefully studying the market and taking calculated risks, you can make some profits from trading ETH tokens without any investments.\n\nMicrotasks\n\nMicrotasks are small tasks you can complete for a small amount of money. These tasks often require little effort and can be done quickly, allowing you to make some free Ethereum.\n\nExample:\n\nMicroworkers offers a variety of microtasks that require no investment and pay in Ethereum. These tasks often involve data entry, image tagging, or simple surveys. You can earn small amounts of ETH tokens without any investments by completing these tasks.\n\nReferrals\n\nReferrals are another way to get free Ethereum without any effort. Many services and companies offer a referral program, where you can earn commissions or rewards when someone signs up through your link. For example, many exchanges offer a referral program that rewards you with a certain amount of Ethereum each time someone registers using your link.\n\nExample:\n\nCoinbase is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, offering users various services. They also offer a referral program, where you can get rewarded in Ethereum for each new user that joins the platform through your link.\n\nBots\n\nBots are automated scripts that can help you earn free Ethereum. These bots are programmed to search for profitable trades and execute them automatically, earning profits on your behalf. Some bots even allow you to customize settings so that they can make the most profitable trades possible, allowing you to get as much free Ethereum as possible.\n\nExample:\n\n3Commas is a popular trading bot that allows users to automate their trades on multiple exchanges. You can customize your settings and let the bot do its job, earning you free Ethereum. 3Commas is easy to use and requires no investment, making it an excellent way to get extra ETH without any effort.\n\nStaking\n\nStaking is another way to get free Ethereum. Users can delegate their Ethereum tokens to a validator to support the network. Then, as a reward for supporting the network, users receive tips in Ethereum. This method of earning Ethereum does require some investment but is a great way to passively earn rewards for supporting the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nExample:\n\nHuobi is one of the most popular staking platforms for Ethereum. They offer users a variety of ways to earn rewards by staking their ETH tokens. By delegating your tokens to Huobi, you can receive ETH rewards without additional investments or effort.\n\nLend your Ethereum\n\nIf you want to get free Ethereum without doing any work, another option is to lend your Ethereum. You can earn a passive income by lending your Ethereum and collecting monthly interest payments.\n\nExample:\n\nNexo is a popular platform that allows users to lend their crypto in exchange for interest payments. For example, you can lend your Ethereum tokens at competitive rates, allowing you to get free Ethereum without any effort or additional investments.\n\nAccept payments in Ethereum.\n\nIf you are running a business or selling goods and services, you can accept payments in Ethereum. By accepting Ethereum payments, you can get free Ethereum without any effort. This option is perfect if you run an online store that sells digital goods such as software or music.\n\nExample:\n\nCoinbase Commerce is a popular platform that allows users to accept payments in Ethereum. By setting up Coinbase Commerce, you can start accepting ETH payments for your products or services and get free Ethereum each time someone pays with ETH.\n\nParticipate in bounty programs.\n\nBounty programs are another great way to get free Ethereum without any investment. However, these programs usually require you to complete specific tasks, such as social media marketing or bug testing, and then reward you with a predetermined amount of crypto.\n\nExample:\n\nGitcoin is a popular platform that allows users to participate in bounty programs. Completing tasks on the platform can earn free Ethereum as a reward for your efforts. In addition, you also have the opportunity to participate in hackathons and get rewarded with ETH for your work.\n\nLiquidity pools\n\nAnother way to get free Ethereum is by participating in liquidity pools. These pools allow you to deposit cryptocurrency into a shared pool and earn rewards for providing liquidity. By depositing your Ethereum into a liquidity pool, you can earn passive income through interest payments and trading fees.\n\nExample:\n\nUniswap is a popular liquidity pool platform allowing users to deposit Ethereum tokens and earn rewards through trading fees. By depositing your ETH into a Uniswap pool, you can earn passive income each time someone trades with your liquidity.\n\nBe careful of scams\n\nBe aware that there are many scams out there that promise to give away free Ethereum. Before you use any service or participate in an airdrop, do your research and verify the offer\u2019s authenticity. Never share personal information such as passwords or private keys, as these can lead to losing your funds. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is \u2013 so be careful when dealing with any service that promises free Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are several ways to get free Ethereum without investing or doing any work. For example, you can use platforms like Nexo and Celsius Network to lend your ETH for interest payments, accept payments in ETH for goods and services, participate in bounty programs and liquidity pools, or watch out for airdrops.\n\nBe sure to research and be careful of scams when dealing with any service that promises free Ethereum. With the right approach, you can get your hands on some extra ETH without having to invest a penny."

        "content": "After the widely publicized collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), accompanied by two other major banking institutions crashing and more at risk, investors seem to be increasingly flocking to the alternative solution \u2013 cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs evident from the declining portion of Bitcoin and Ethereum reserves on crypto exchanges, investors are seeking refuge in these digital assets out of fear that the banking crisis could spread to crypto businesses, as noted by blockchain and financial analysis platform Glassnode in a weekly newsletter sent out on March 13.\n\nSpecifically, the report stated that around \u201c0.144% of all BTC and 0.325% of all ETH in circulation was withdrawn from exchange reserves, demonstrating a similar self-custody response pattern\u201d to the collapse of the crypto trading platform FTX.\n\nBTC and ETH balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nOn top of that, the platform\u2019s team stressed that these numbers spoke volumes about the growing level of investor confidence in crypto in recent weeks:\n\n\u201cOn a USD basis, the last month saw over $1.8B in combined BTC and ETH value flow out of exchanges. This is not necessarily large in relative scale. However, observing net exchange withdrawals, especially within the current hostile regulatory environment, does speak to a degree of investor confidence that is worth noting.\u201d\n\nBTC and ETH exchange net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has put some breaks on its recent progress, gaining only 0.17% on the day and at press time trading at the price of $24,674, as it began to consolidate the weekly increases of 13.64% and of 13.14% on its monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum has lost 1.17% in the last 24 hours, trading at the price of $1,672, but still up 8.97% compared to the previous seven days and 11.02% across the last month, as per the latest information retrieved on March 16.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart.

        "content": "Over $100 million worth of the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization Ethereum ($ETH) have been burned since the cryptocurrency\u2019s network transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm into a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s deflationary trend has been growing over time, with its supply having dropped by over 64,457 ETH since the network\u2019s merge upgrade over 180 days, to the point there are now 120,456 ETH circulating on the market.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound.money, Ethereum\u2019s supply has been dropping by 0.1% per year since the Merge, while without it, it would be rising at a rate of 3.42% per year.\n\nThe website\u2019s projections suggest Ethereum\u2019s supply could drop to 117 million ETH by 2025, with issuance rewards for stakers on the network being expected to be about 4% per year. A significant portion of the ETH burn resulting in the decrease in supply can be attributed to transfers from major DeFi applications, including Uniswap, Tether, and other projects burning tokens through transaction fees.\n\nEthereum transactions started burning ETH after the London hard fork, which included the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. The EIP changed the way transaction fees on the network work. Instead of an auction system, users now pay a base fee for their transaction to be processed by validators, and can alternatively tip them to get their transactions to be processed faster.\n\nEthereum staking has been seen a source of revenue for both cryptocurrency holders and exchanges. These platforms offer users a staking service allowing them to maintain liquidity through a separate token while locking their ETH on-chain to earn rewards, and collect a potion of the rewards in exchange.\n\nNasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has, for example, reported revenue of over $200 million in the fourth quarter of last year through its staking, earn, and custody products.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade is one step closer to being activated on the network\u2019s mainnet, following a final dress rehearsal that was carried out on the Goerli testnet, which involved a simulation of staked ETH withdrawals.\n\nOnce activated, the upgrade will complete Ethereum\u2019s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, allowing validators to withdraw their staked ether and rewards earned from adding or approving blocks.\n\nImage Credit\n\nFeatured Image via Unsplash"

        "content": "The popularity of OpenAI\u2019s text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT has reinvigorated the public\u2019s interest in the underlying technology due to its utility in multiple areas, and one cryptocurrency exchange executive has decided to test its abilities in finding flaws in Ethereum (ETH) smart contract.\n\nSpecifically, Conor Grogan, director of crypto trading platform Coinbase, has dumped a live Ethereum contract into the newest version of the popular chatbot, GPT-4, and it highlighted multiple security vulnerabilities and surface areas where the smart contract could be exploited, as he said in a Twitter post on March 14.\n\nAdditionally, Grogan posted screenshots of the AI bot\u2019s analysis, which indeed seem to show that ChatGPT is capable of correctly identifying critical issues and vulnerabilities, as it concluded that the analyzed smart contract \u201cshould not be used, as it contains critical vulnerabilities and is based on an illegal scheme.\u201d\n\nI dumped a live Ethereum contract into GPT-4.\n\n\n\nIn an instant, it highlighted a number of security vulnerabilities and pointed out surface areas where the contract could be exploited. It then verified a specific way I could exploit the contract pic.twitter.com/its5puakUW \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) March 14, 2023\n\nRegurgitating available data?\n\nThat being said, some disagreement arose in the comments regarding whether the new version of the AI tool was able to discover these smart contract vulnerabilities on its own or was just highlighting old information about it already available online.\n\nIndeed, Grogan did specify that the contract in question was hacked in 2018 using the flaws that the AI tool was pointing out, which led several commenters to state it was simply listing the issues that had already been made public before its training data cutoff in September 2021, and that it might not be as accurate with an unseen smart contract that was never exploited before.\n\nJust bear in mind that GPT-4 is aware of this exact contract, that it was hacked in 2018 and how.\n\n\n\nIt might not be so accurate if you give it a smart contract that it's never seen before, or has never had the exploit shared publicly before. \u2014 TwoBags \u26e9 (@ItsTwoBags) March 14, 2023\n\nRegardless of whether ChatGPT was able to dig out the vulnerabilities in the smart contract on its own or was just regurgitating the information already available online, its capabilities are still significant and potentially useful in auditing smart contracts, as well as in other areas in the cryptocurrency sector, such as in making educated guesses about the future price of cryptocurrencies like Polygon (MATIC).\n\nThat said, some critics, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, have expressed their views that ChatGPT may be biased in discussing certain topics that are considered controversial, which has allegedly led Musk to start contemplating the possibility of creating a ChatGPT alternative as he joked about the need for \u201cTruthGPT.\u201d"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has become a popular investment option for many people around the world.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, it can be difficult to decide which coins to add to your portfolio. Two coins that have been gaining popularity recently are Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ).\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn this article, we will explore four simple reasons why these coins are a necessity of every portfolio.\n\nEthereum is a proven and reliable investment\n\nEthereum is one of the most established and well-known cryptocurrencies in the market. It was first introduced in 2014 and has since grown in popularity due to its smart contract capabilities.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. It has been tested and proven over time, making it a reliable investment for those looking for long-term gains.\n\nRenQ Finance is a unique and innovative investment\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has been gaining traction in the market. It offers unique features that make it stand out from other coins. RenQ Finance provides cross-chain capabilities that allow users to trade assets between different blockchains and DeFi protocols.\n\nIt has also tackled liquidity issues that many DeFi platforms experience by offering an off-chain order book and a hybrid infrastructure model. These features make RenQ Finance a safe and innovative investment option for those looking for something different.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\n4 simple reasons that make Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) a necessity of every portfolio\n\nReason 1: Smart Contract Platform\n\nSmart contract platforms like Ethereum have become essential components of the blockchain ecosystem due to their ability to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (DApps) with automated and transparent operations. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, healthcare, and real estate, among others.\n\nEthereum's smart contract platform has become the most popular platform among developers looking to build DApps, with a vast array of applications available on the blockchain.

Cross-chain solutions have become increasingly important as the crypto space continues to evolve and new blockchains and DeFi protocols are created.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized computing platform built on blockchain technology that empowers developers to design and launch decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike traditional applications, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network rather than a centralized server, allowing users to have greater control over their data and interactions. With Ethereum, developers can create dApps that give decision-making power to the participants of the application itself, rather than relying on a central authority.\n\nReason 4: Liquidity Solutions\n\nRenQ Finance is also focused on tackling the liquidity issues that many DeFi platforms experience. It offers an off-chain order book and a hybrid infrastructure model that gives its users an edge in terms of speed and liquidity. This makes it a safer coin to invest in and has resulted in increased interest from investors and traders.\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance offer potential for growth\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance offer potential for growth in the future. Ethereum's smart contract capabilities make it a valuable asset for those interested in decentralized applications and the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nAs for RenQ Finance, its unique features and focus on solving DeFi liquidity issues give it potential for growth as the DeFi market continues to expand.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nPresale: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\n\u201cCrypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
