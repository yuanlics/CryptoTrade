        "title": "Ethereum to Flip Bitcoin: Cathie Wood's Bold Prediction for the Next Bull Run - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCathie Wood is bullish on cryptocurrencies, predicting a substantial growth of the entire crypto asset class.\n\nArk Invest is launching five separate crypto ETFs.\n\nEthereum is poised to outperform Bitcoin in the long run due to its multifaceted role in the evolving digital economy.\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, is known for her bullish stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn a recent interview , Wood articulated her conviction in the potential of these digital assets, predicting a substantial growth of the entire crypto asset class from $1 trillion today to $25 trillion over the next five to seven years.\n\nWood Declares Confidence in Crypto with New ETF Launch\n\nARK Invest is launching five separate crypto ETFs , including a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF and a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Wood\u2019s enthusiasm started in the mid-2010s, when it had a market cap of about $6 billion. The involvement of economist Art Laffer , who praised Bitcoin for its rules-based monetary policy, significantly influenced her perspective.\n\nWood\u2019s focus is particularly interesting when it comes to Ethereum. She acknowledges Ethereum\u2019s burgeoning role in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), recognizing its ability to satisfy the unmet need for yield in the financial markets. This view is underscored by the current state of fixed income markets , where the search for yield has reached unprecedented levels.\n\nFurthermore, Wood emphasizes the importance of following the developers in the crypto space. By this metric, Ethereum stands out, with its ecosystem supporting a wide range of applications. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s blockchain\u2019s holds DeFi and NFTs, and attracts a large community of developers. This aspect of Ethereum, combined with its potential in empowering the creator community, contributes to Wood\u2019s optimism about its future.\n\nCathie Wood expects #Ethereum will most likely outperform Bitcoin in the next Bull Run. pic.twitter.com/FEK9YAIZWo \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 15, 2024\n\nWood\u2019s bullish stance on Ethereum does not overshadow her confidence in Bitcoin. She sees both cryptocurrencies as having a bright future, highlighting the importance of investing during times of volatility, which she believes strengthens the credibility and investor confidence in these digital assets.\n\nWood also touches upon the broader economic context, discussing monetary policies and trust issues in traditional finance. She suggests cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized and transparent nature, offer a more trustworthy alternative in the current economic climate.\n\nEthereum Poised to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nIn terms of long-term predictions, ARK Invest\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d presentations provide ambitious forecasts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. In their 2023 presentation, they laid out three scenarios for Bitcoin, ranging from a bear case of $258,000 to a bull case of $1.48 million by 2030. For Ethereum, their 2022 forecast envisages a market cap that could exceed $20 trillion by 2032, potentially valuing each ETH at more than $166,000."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nWith the release of smart contracts, new consensus mechanisms, and improvements to network efficiency, the cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially in recent years, leading many investors to ask, is Ethereum a good investment?\n\nThroughout this guide, we\u2019ll be taking an in-depth look at Ethereum, analyzing its utility and potential for growth in the future. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment? Our Verdict\n\nWith the asset growing by tens of thousands of percent since its launch, many investors are asking the questions, what is Ethereum? Is Ethereum a good investment? After conducting hours of detailed research into the topic, we\u2019ve got an answer.\n\nAs the crypto market expands, there will likely be a sharp increase in the number of applications built upon the Ethereum network. This will naturally result in significantly boosted demand for the ETH token, in turn pumping the token\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum is one of the most proactive blockchains in developing and upgrading its network and following the Merge in 2022 \u2013 which cut energy usage by an estimated 99.95% \u2013 other upgrades are in the pipeline, only helping to further boost its performance.\n\nEthereum remains, by far, the most popular network for decentralized app (dApp) builders and developers, with almost 1,000 major protocols built on its network as well as thousands of meme tokens and NFT collections. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s TVL (total value locked, the combined value of projects built on its network) is over $21 billion, more than three times nearest rival Tron ($6.7bn TVL).\n\nThat is unlikely to change any time soon making Ethereum, by far, the most useful cryptocurrency and giving it a huge network of reliant projects \u2013 even if that isn\u2019t always reflected in the current price of ETH.\n\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve reached a positive verdict on whether Ethereum is a good investment. While the coming months are likely to be rather rocky, over the long-term Ethereum should perform quite well.\n\nHow Ethereum Has Performed Since Launch & in 2023\n\nEthereum has been performing well since its official launch in 2014, when the price of ETH was just $0.31 during its initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nBased on the asset\u2019s past performance, it will have likely provided great returns to investors that gave it enough time to grow. Regardless of when an investor picked up ETH, historically, it\u2019s been possible to turn a profit simply by waiting, making ETH a great long-term crypto investment.\n\nInvestors that bought into the asset during its 2018 highs, would\u2019ve had to wait until at least 2021 just to break even. However, given that ETH was held to the bull run\u2019s peak, investors could\u2019ve netted themselves returns of around 275% or an annualized rate of 91.66%. Furthermore, anyone that invested during the 2017 high would\u2019ve secured 482% in returns.\n\nWith this in mind, while it\u2019s true that anyone that bought ETH at the peak of the 2021 bull would be down roughly 65% at today\u2019s prices, given enough time they could end up securing huge returns, especially given the continued improvements to the Ethereum network, that have massively boosted efficiency, scalability and transaction price.\n\nThe same is true for investors that got involved during the January 2022 dip, while they would currently be down around 53%, given a few years in the market, it\u2019s possible that ETH could yield annualized returns similar to its last run. As such, ETH could be the best crypto to buy in the crash right now.\n\nSince its launch, Ethereum has increased in value by millions of percent.\n\nInvestors that stocked up on ETH during the 2017 run would be enjoying 482% returns.\n\nAnyone that purchased ETH in 2018 would have earned an annualized return of 91.66%.\n\nAfter hitting a new all-time high in 2021. ETH has been on a steady decline.\n\nThroughout 2022, the price of ETH fell alongside the wider market.\n\n2023 has brought better performance with the coin reaching a yearly high of $2120 in April.\n\nAt the time of writing in September 2023, ETH is around 40% up from its price in January.\n\nBuy ETH with MEXC\n\nCrypto assets are a volatile investment product. Your capital is at risk.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nLaunched back in 2014, Ethereum has grown from a humble initial coin offering (ICO) into a titan of industry and the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market. The asset, now boasting a price tag of around $1,600 was originally sold for just $0.311 during its ICO, a discount of 99.97% compared to today\u2019s figure.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s smart contract ecosystem grew and began to attract attention from developers, the price of ETH exploded, rising from a 2017 low of just $8.17 to a high of $820.24, an increase of nearly 10,000%. Naturally, this fast growth led many investors to wonder is investing in Ethereum a good idea.\n\nThis trend continued into 2018, with Ethereum growing massively. Likely helped along by the fact that the world\u2019s largest blockchain game (at the time), CryptoKitties was built on the Ethereum network, leading many other developers to follow suit. At its peak price in 2018, the price of ETH soared, hitting $1,270.47.\n\nHowever, what goes up must come down. Over the next couple of years the price of Ethereum, one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies on the market at the time, slowly declined. Throughout 2018 ETH fell as low as $90.60 and traded between $150 and $200 during 2019. Over this same period, the price of Bitcoin fell from $19,118 to a low of $3,460.55.\n\nThe ETH price stayed within this range until late 2020 promoting crypto enthusiasts everywhere to wonder will Ethereum go up. While things were looking bleak, the cryptocurrency market picked up significantly as thousands of investors entered the market, pushing ETH to new heights, first taking the asset to $4,174, then even further to an all-time high of $4,878.26 on November 10, 2021.\n\nLike the rest of the market, Ethereum has suffered through a prolonged bear market since those highs, with macroeconomic factors such as the Russia-Ukraine War, inflation, plus the collapse of various crypto companies, including FTX, seeing the price dip below $1,000 in mid-2022.\n\nETH has been rising steadily in 2023 \u2013 and was up as much as 77% between January and June to a high of $2,100 \u2013 but has since taken a step backwards leading to its present-day valuation of around $1,600.\n\nEthereum Highs and Lows\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve summarized the highs and lows of Ethereum since its launch, putting the asset\u2019s growth in perspective, and making it simpler to determine is Ethereum a good investment.\n\nEarly 2014 \u2013 Ethereum was released as an ICO with ETH available for around $0.311\n\nEthereum was released as an ICO with ETH available for around $0.311 Mid-2017 \u2013 Ethereum slowly grew, then exploded in 2017, rising from $8.17 to $820.\n\nEthereum slowly grew, then exploded in 2017, rising from $8.17 to $820.

A few of these include the economy as a whole, the crypto market, potential competitors, and even Ethereum\u2019s utility as well as any planned updates to the network. Let\u2019s dive into our prediction.\n\nEnd of 2023 \u2013 Looking toward the end of next year, we could expect to see growth from Ethereum, however, the market will likely remain bearish as a reaction to uncertainty in the economy. As a result, we could see ETH test a previous support of $1,800 .\n\nLooking toward the end of next year, we could expect to see growth from Ethereum, however, the market will likely remain bearish as a reaction to uncertainty in the economy. As a result, we could see ETH test a previous support of . End of 2024 \u2013 Moving onwards, as long as nothing unexpected occurs, we\u2019ll likely see the economy begin its path to recovery, something likely to have a very positive impact on the crypto and stock market. The next Bitcoin halving is also approaching, which has sparked all previous bull runs. This will likely lead to Ethereum trading for an average of $3,000 , an increase of around 75% over today\u2019s prices.\n\nMoving onwards, as long as nothing unexpected occurs, we\u2019ll likely see the economy begin its path to recovery, something likely to have a very positive impact on the crypto and stock market.

End of 2025 \u2013 With more time to build positive traction, continued updates and widespread crypto adoption, we could see some impressive moves from the price of ETH during 2025. It seems likely that a retest of the asset\u2019s prior high will be required. This would place the value of ETH at approximately $4,900 .\n\nWith more time to build positive traction, continued updates and widespread crypto adoption, we could see some impressive moves from the price of ETH during 2025. It seems likely that a retest of the asset\u2019s prior high will be required. This would place the value of ETH at approximately . End of 2030 \u2013 The Ethereum team will have had plenty of time to work on developing new features and any improvements to the network currently in the pipeline may have rolled out. Combined with the expected growth of the crypto market (11.1% annually), we could see ETH hit $7,985 with a high of $10,000 also possible.\n\nEthereum Utility \u2013 What Does the Future Hold?\n\nWhen it comes time for an investor to answer the question, should I buy Ethereum now, it\u2019s crucial to consider the project\u2019s long-term utility \u2013 which is among the very best in the crypto space.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict the market\u2019s movements with 100% accuracy, but investing in utility-centric projects drastically increases the chances of an investment paying off over the long term.\n\nTo make it more simple for investors to determine whether Ethereum holds enough utility to be considered a worthwhile investment, we\u2019ve outlined a few of its top uses below.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nPerhaps the most widely used feature of the Ethereum network is its smart contract capabilities. Developers can build their own decentralized applications known as dApps, directly on the Ethereum network. This helps to facilitate interoperability between applications and allows new projects to take advantage of the various benefits offered by an established network like Ethereum.\n\nNumerous high-profile and highly important protocols are based on Ethereum, including the likes of Lido, Maker, Aave and Uniswap. A number of the largest meme coins in the space are also ERC-20 tokens, powered and secured by Ethereum, including Shiba Inu, Pepe and Floki.\n\nAs applications created on the Ethereum network boost demand for the ETH, this could be phenomenal for the long-term growth of this innovative proof-of-stake crypto.\n\nNetwork Upgrades\n\nThe recent update to the Ethereum network, known as the Merge, switched Ethereum from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. This has created a new economy on the network, with ETH holders able to earn rewards for validating transactions and adding to the network\u2019s security. This incentivizes long-term holds and rewards the project\u2019s top supporters.\n\nOn top of introducing staking to the network, the Merge has paved the way for sharding to be introduced to the network. This will allow transaction data to be split among the network, sharply increasing throughput and reducing congestion during periods of load.\n\nEthereum is one of the most active networks for consistently trying to improve and upgrade its network.\n\nSecurity\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of the Ethereum network is its security. Achieved through decentralization, Ethereum is considered to be one of the most secure networks on the planet.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s commonly used for sensitive applications, like Aave which is a crypto lender and Lido, which offers liquid staking. With the rate at which crypto hacks are increasing, developers will aim to build on secure networks, boosting the demand for Ethereum.\n\nNFTs\n\nThe NFT sector has struggled badly since the 2021 boom \u2013 much more so than crypto investment \u2013 but it remains one of the most rapidly evolving areas in cryptocurrency. A large portion of the best NFTs are built on the Ethereum network, including the likes of Crypto Punks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nNaturally, this has drastically increased the number of transactions taking place on the network, booting its dominance. With NFTs quickly being picked up by mainstream companies this is very promising for Ethereum.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Long-Term Investment or Short-Term Investment?\n\nFor investors considering is now a good time to buy Ethereum, it\u2019s important to have an investing plan in place. This means determining which prices to buy and sell at and also deciding whether you want to hold Ethereum as a long or short-term investment.\n\nWe\u2019ll be discussing the merit of ETH with both strategies, making it simple for investors to choose the one right for them.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering should I invest in Ethereum over the short term, it\u2019s important to take the performance of the wider economy into consideration. With assets across the board taking a beating and mass uncertainty being present in the crypto market, it\u2019s probably best to avoid a shorter-term investment in ETH, until the market gets a clear directional bias.\n\nOn the other hand, as a long-term investment, Ethereum has excellent merit \u2013 the project boasts a wide array of utilities, a strong use case and is consistently attempting to improve.\n\nFurthermore, a number of the world\u2019s largest crypto-assets are built upon the Ethereum network, a clear indicator of longevity. As it stands today, anyone holding ETH for at least 2 years would be in profit, so ETH could work well as a long-term hold.\n\nWhat Experts Say on Whether You Should Invest in Ethereum\n\nMany experts have strong feelings on the topic is Ethereum still a good investment. While hundreds of prominent figures have shared their opinions regarding this top trending crypto.\n\nCapital.com , a popular broker discussed the potential of Ethereum saying that the improvements to the network\u2019s scalability and throughput are likely to offer a sizable long-term boost to the asset. The broker summarized predictions from various outlets, almost all of which offered a positive outlook over a 6+ month period.\n\n, a popular broker discussed the potential of Ethereum saying that the improvements to the network\u2019s scalability and throughput are likely to offer a sizable long-term boost to the asset.

Time , a well-known media outlet shared the thoughts of Mike McGlone, an intelligence analyst for Bloomberg. McGlone predicted that Ethereum could end 2022 trading for roughly $4,000 to $4,500. However, another market analyst, Wendy O expects ETH will drop to around $750, providing a mixed answer to the question is Ethereum a good investment.\n\n, a well-known media outlet shared the thoughts of Mike McGlone, an intelligence analyst for Bloomberg.

WalletInvestor a prominent price prediction platform, shared its rating for Ethereum giving the smart contract network an A+. The predictions platform also stated that according to their forecasts, an increase in the price of Ethereum is expected over the coming years making it a solid long-term pick.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nInvestors trying to determine is it a good time to buy Ethereum will also likely be wondering where they can pick up the digital asset. We\u2019ve included a review of MEXC, a leading crypto exchange and our top pick for the best exchange to buy ETH.\n\nMEXC \u2013 Popular Crypto Exchange With 0.1% Spot Trading Fees\n\nMEXC is a crypto exchange that offers over 1,700 tokens to trade with low spot fees of 0.1% and futures fees from 0.01%. This means that not only is MEXC an excellent choice to buy ETH, but also to trade it on the spot market or the futures market with leverage.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to simply buy ETH, you can do so quickly when you deposit funds via bank transfer or via third-party providers such as Mercuryo, Banxa, Moonpay and Simplex. These providers let you buy ETH with a card, with Apple Pay or Google Pay. Note, these come with a slightly higher fees than if you made a bank deposit and purchased ETH on the spot market. But sometimes, buying ETH faster, even if it comes with higher fees, could be a better option, especially if the price of ETH soars.\n\nOnce you have your ETH, you can withdraw it to your wallet, such as MetaMask, or you can keep some of it on the exchange and stake it with MEXC Savings where you can get up to 4.80% annual percentage yield. Keeping it on the platform can also be useful if you need instant liquidity. With MEXC Loans you can use your ETH as collateral to borrow funds.\n\nMEXC offers additional features such as copy trading, where you can copy popular traders, you can get new tokens from the MEXC Launchpad, or learn to trade with demo accounts.\n\nBuy ETH with MEXC\n\nShould I Buy Ethereum Now? Our Verdict\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the factors influencing our verdict, it\u2019s time to answer the question, is it still a good time to buy Ethereum?\n\nWhile the short-term outlook of just about every financial market leaves a lot to be desired right now, Ethereum seems to be very strong in a macro sense. Just about every long-term (2+ years) ETH holder would currently be in profit, with the only exception being those that invested during the 2021 bull run. As such, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum provides a great long-term opportunity.\n\nWith Ethereum boasting strong utility and a clear plan for future developments, our Ethereum price predictions look rather promising. While 2023 might be a slow year for crypto, we expect that ETH could reach between $7,500 to $10,000 during 2030, an increase of 350% on the low end.\n\nWhile the experts seemed mostly divided on how Ethereum might perform over the short term, one thing was clear, long-term growth was expected by most. It seems as though most people believe Ethereum will play a crucial role in the crypto space over the next few years, so it\u2019s not an asset to overlook.\n\nAll in all, while its short-term potential is murky, Ethereum seems like a strong long-term investment. As such, it could be a good time to buy Ethereum, for investors focused on the macro perspective.\n\nCoins to Consider Alongside Ethereum\n\nNow that we\u2019ve answered the question is Ethereum a good investment, it seems fitting to discuss a couple of smaller projects built on the Ethereum network, that could provide even greater returns than ETH.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token \u2013 ERC20 Presale With 450% Dynamic APY And Market-Focused Roadmap\n\nBitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) is an Ethereum-powered presale with a dynamic APY PoS of 450% at the current time and a roadmap that is tied to important events in the wider crypto economy.\n\nThe primary event is the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should this event manifest, it could increase the total crypto market cap by hundreds of billions of dollars, and possibly result in price increases for BTC and altcoins.\n\nBitcoin ETF token, however, stands to benefit the most, as it was created with this exact scenario in mind. It could be a 10x token or more if approval occurs, something which could happen in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe ERC20 presale also provides a 25% token burn to encourage price appreciation for the remaining supply. The token burn takes place in five distinct intervals dependent on key events, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the price of Bitcoin breaching $100,000.\n\nSo this is a campaign that is tied to the market, as opposed to being a self-contained ecosystem with arbitrary goals. It has a market focus that differentiates it from many other presales. Aside from this, it offers a significant price increase throughout its presale.\n\nIn the initial round, the token retails at $0.0050, a price which will rise substantially to $0.0068 by the final round (round ten). This is an automatic price increase of nearly 40% simply for buying and holding coins.\n\nThis could be an ideal Ethereum alternative with more upside potential and a number of incentives for investors.\n\nThe presale maintains a dedicated section on its website for BTC ETF-related news, along with its official Twitter and Telegram accounts.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Token Whitepaper contains all the essential information about this new presale.\n\nPresale Started 6 Nov 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, BNB, MATIC, Card Chain Ethereum Min Investment None Max Investment None\n\nBitcoin Minetrix \u2013 Stake-to-Mine Project Offering Huge 6,000% APY During Presale\n\nBitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is a brand new ERC-20 token launched on Ethereum that is the world\u2019s first stake-to-mine crypto project.\n\nThe project has only just launched its presale but is seeing a lot of interest from investors and has already raised more than $200,000.\n\nAs well as offering incredible staking rewards \u2013 with the current APY sitting at over 6,000% \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix token holders can also mine Bitcoin.\n\nThis works by staking tokens which then generate cloud mining credits. They can be burnt to earn allocated mining time, with mined BTC sent back to the user.\n\nThe whole process is managed via a dedicated mobile app and takes all the risk out of cloud mining \u2013 which has been a hotbed for scammers \u2013 by tokenizing the process.\n\nThat means there are no upfront fees or long fixed-term contracts to agree, with Bitcoin Minetrix holders able to stake as much or as little as they like and unstake at any time and sell their tokens on an exchange.\n\nThe project has just launched stage 1 of its presale, wihich will run for 10 stages in total \u2013 tokens currently cost $0.011 but will increase 8% to $0.0119 in the final stage.\n\nThere is a max supply of 4 billion tokens, with 2.8 billion available during the presale. More information and the latest news can be found in the whitepaper or on Telegram.\n\nPresale Started 26 Sept 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, BNB Chain Ethereum Min Investment $10 Max Investment None\n\nReferences\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment in 2024?\n\nEvery investor will have a different opinion of what constitutes a good investment. However, with Ethereum constantly working on developing new features and with most people expecting ETH to slowly increase in value, Ethereum could be a good investment in 2024.\n\nWhat Ethereum be worth in five years?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict the value of an asset in the future, but based on the growth of the crypto market and the planned improvements to the Ethereum network, we could see the value of ETH at around $5,000 by 2025 and around $7,500 in five years times.\n\nIs it worth buying Ethereum now?\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment? This is the question on the minds of thousands of investors. Right now, ETH can be purchased for around $1,700, a significant discount compared to 2021\u2019s prices. As such, if you were debating buying ETH at $4,000+ it\u2019s most probably worth buying today.\n\nIs Ethereum a safe investment?\n\nThere is no such thing as a safe investment. Everything has risks. However, the general consensus among professional investors and traders seems to be that Ethereum will grow steadily over the coming years."

        "content": "The official Starknet Ethereum address made seven cross-chain transactions ahead of the anticipated launch of STRK, the protocol\u2019s native token expected by Q2 2024.\n\nStarknet transferred less than three STRK tokens between Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and the project\u2019s layer-2 network, per data seen on block explorer Starkscan. The action was likely part of an on-chain test exercise for the Ethereum-based scaling solution before developers rolled out the ERC-20 cryptocurrency.\n\nSTRK test transactions | Source: Starkscan\n\nThe transactions for users and network participants indicate progress toward STRK\u2019s launch, which may accompany an airdrop and community rewards. The Starknet Foundation revealed 1.8 billion STRK tokens earmarked for its distribution plan in December last year.\n\nHalf that amount was designated network rebates to reward users already transacting on the L2 chain, crypto.news noted. Beneficiaries of the Early Community Member Program are also set to receive a portion of some 50 million STRK coins when the token is released.\n\nYou might also like: Starknet community approves STRK for transaction fees\n\nFurthermore, STRK is set to onboard additional utilities following a pivotal community vote on Jan. 8. Delegates approved STRK as a valid transaction fee payment currency in a two-token gas structure alongside Ether (ETH).\n\nAccording to a Starknet Foundation committee, STRK should launch by April 2024, barring any delays or technical hiccups. Built by Israeli-based blockchain startup Starkware Industries, the L2 network deploys zero-knowledge rollup technology to scale Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nThe idea is to decongest Ethereum\u2019s mainnet by providing an alternative transaction chain with cheap fees and faster settlement while retaining on-chain security and transparency. Starknet had over $169 million in total value locked as of Jan. 15, L2Beat confirmed.\n\nNow that the news is out, we might as well tell you more!\n\n\n\nStarknet is about each of you. Every user, builder and member of our community \u2013 existing and future \u2013 is a critical piece to building our network into the future of decentralisation for generations to come.

        "content": "Finding the next big thing is the secret sauce for many investors, whether it\u2019s startups, stocks, bonds, commodities or crypto.\n\nObsession with discovering \u201cthe next Ethereum\u201d \u2014 or even an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d \u2014 then seems only natural.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts set the industry standard nearly a decade ago and have since inspired dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands, of rival networks.\n\nSolana is generally considered Ethereum\u2019s primary competitor right now. Comparing market values shows nothing has really come close to eclipsing Ethereum. Yet.\n\nIn fact, BNB Chain (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have come the closest over the past three years.\n\nThe market cap of BNB in April 2021 and late 2022 was about 33% of ether\u2019s (ETH).\n\nADA had up to 25% of ether\u2019s cap during the last bull market.\n\nSolana (SOL) set a new record relative to ether last month with 19%.\n\nRead more: It\u2019s a Solanaissance: These 5 charts will cure the Ethereum vibecession\n\nPrice ratios \u2014 dividing one assets\u2019 price by another and comparing over time \u2014 are commonly used to gauge the relative strength of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnalyzing price alone is problematic due to inflation and deflation rates of many top cryptocurrencies.\n\nSolana\u2019s market cap ratio against ether has retraced by a quarter since Christmas, now about 14%\n\nTake ATOM, the native asset for multichain ecosystem Cosmos. Over the past year, ATOM\u2019s circulating supply has swelled by a third and its token price has slipped by 20%, according to data from The Tie.\n\nMeanwhile, ATOM\u2019s market cap has grown 15%. Price alone implies ATOM is struggling, when it could be the market is simply absorbing fresh supply \u2014 and then some.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has almost 17% more circulating supply than this time last year. Its price has quadrupled across that period, while its market cap has nearly quintupled. Comparing only SOL\u2019s price would leave a chunk of the asset\u2019s growth unaccounted for.\n\nMuch of Solana\u2019s outsized growth over the past year can be attributed to its gradual recovery since the FTX debacle.\n\nRead more: Rebuilding trust: Solana\u2019s roadmap after a challenging year\n\nDisgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a significant investor in Solana and its ecosystem, leading SOL to collapse by up to 65% directly following FTX\u2019s implosion in late 2022. Ether fell less than 30% and completely recovered in about two months.\n\nMarket caps are just one metric by which to compare cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Total value locked, unique addresses, on-chain volumes, developer activity, fee revenues and transaction counts are among others. Each has its flaws.\n\nIn any case, Ethereum isn\u2019t exactly threatened right now. But going by market cap growth alone, Solana is well on track to become Ethereum\u2019s primary competitor over BNB.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ETH is now struggling to stay above the key $2,440 support zone and might extend losses.\n\nEthereum climbed further higher toward $2,720 before the bears appeared.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a downside thrust if it breaks the $2,440 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Support\n\nEthereum price outpaced Bitcoin and extended its increase above the $2,550 resistance. ETH even broke the $2,600 zone and spiked above $2,700. Finally, the beards appeared near the $2,720 resistance.\n\nA new multi-week high was formed near $2,716 before the price corrected gains. There was a move below the $2,600 and $2,550 levels. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,716 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,520 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,520 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is now near $2,585.

        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink Sees \u201cValue\u201d in Ethereum ETFs, Future of Tokenization\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has thrown his support behind an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling the asset management giant's growing interest in cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\"I see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\" Fink said. \"These ETFs are stepping stones towards tokenization, and I believe that's where we're headed.\"\n\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was among the several bitcoin ETFs that made their trading debut in the United States on Thursday, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval. IBIT accounted for a significant portion of the total trading volume that the ETFs collectively saw.\n\nFink's endorsement of an Ether ETF comes as BlackRock is looking to list a similar product for Ethereum's native token. This move would align with the company's broader strategy of embracing tokenization, which involves representing assets (real world or digital) in the form of tokens on the blockchain. Fink believes that tokenization can help eliminate issues related to money laundering and other forms of corruption. He also sees cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as an asset class that can provide protection against geopolitical risks.\n\n\"Bitcoin is similar to gold in that it's a scarce asset,\" Fink said. \"However, unlike gold, we're almost at the maximum supply of bitcoin that can be created.\"\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 3 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH 1.41%) is a cryptocurrency that really doesn't get as much attention as it probably should. Over the past week, that's certainly true, with any sort of discussion around Ethereum dwarfed by the massive catalyst that hit the overall crypto sector -- the highly anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC 1.96%) ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThis key catalyst initially drove a significant amount of buying interest in Bitcoin but has since given way to outperformance for Ethereum. As it turns out, investors are clearly focused on the next crypto with a big catalyst on the horizon, which could certainly be the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs. Given the rather positive stance regulators have taken with Ethereum, market anticipation around such an event has driven Ethereum upward this week to levels not seen since spring 2022.\n\nNow, the question is whether this momentum can continue. For long-term investors, the question of where Ethereum may be in three years' time is one that is certainly worth trying to answer.\n\nNo one knows where any asset will ultimately end up over any given period of time, and I'm not going to suggest I have a crystal ball. However, I'll attempt to at least rationalize why I think Ethereum will more likely than not continue to move higher over the next three years and potentially surge past its previous highs.\n\nEthereum ETF hype should be taken seriously\n\nIt's not just crypto bros, talking heads, and pundits suggesting spot Ethereum ETFs could be on the horizon. There's been some rather compelling commentary from big-name investors around the potential approval of such investing vehicles, with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink opining on this topic.\n\nFink noted in a recent interview that he believes there's \"value\" in a spot Ethereum ETF being launched at some point. His view is that Ethereum is among the most viable assets within the crypto space, and while these aren't necessarily currencies by technical definition, they do carry value similar to other assets like gold. That's a rather widespread view among mainstream investors, and given the SEC's stance toward Bitcoin and Ethereum, if regulators take a similar view, it's certainly likely we could see spot Ethereum ETFs on the horizon.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Blackrock is among the companies that have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF already. So, perhaps there's some level of \"talking his book\" that investors need to price in. But given the interest major institutional investors have in promoting digital assets as a viable investment-grade option, Ethereum certainly has a future catalyst investors need to watch closely.\n\nTokenization likely to remain a key catalyst for Ethereum investors\n\nThe tokenization of real-world assets, or the ability to trade rights to physical assets such as art, collectibles, or even real estate, is a trend that's continuing to gain steam. In 2023, it's been estimated that the total value of all real-world assets that have been tokenized and trade on the blockchain has doubled, from around $1 billion at the start of 2023 to $2 billion at year's end. Notably, much of the trading volume in this nascent space has taken place on Ethereum's network, given its scale and ubiquity among users in the decentralized finance sector.\n\nEthereum's pole position as the leading blockchain for anything tied to decentralized finance (including tokenized real-world assets) benefits investors. Ethereum's token price has proven to be correlated over long periods of time to its network activity. Considering Ethereum's impressive ecosystem growth over the years, some investors have called into question where the next growth catalyst will come from. In the past, gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) alongside other financial services took center stage. But given the nascent nature of the tokenized real-world assets market, this could be the next growth catalyst that drives Ethereum's fundamentals, and its price, higher over time.\n\nDoes Ethereum have what it takes to make new highs over the next three years?\n\nLong-term investors can find plenty of other catalysts to focus on when it comes to Ethereum. After all, this ecosystem is vast and supports a great deal of the utility created in the crypto space. The launch of an ETF, continued growth in tokenization, and future Ethereum-network upgrades all remain key catalysts to watch over the next three years. However, who knows, maybe a bigger and more prominent catalyst will materialize. After all, this innovative space continues to evolve in rapid fashion, and I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nMy view is that over the next three years, Ethereum will continue to see the sort of volatility it's seen in the past. But given its fundamental tailwinds, and the potential for the macro- and monetary-policy environments to improve, I think it's far more likely that Ethereum makes new highs rather than multiyear lows."

Such movements are typically linked to early adopters or investors who had mined or purchased cryptocurrencies like Ethereum during their initial phases.\n\nThe recent activation of this address is not an isolated incident. In December 2023, a similar pre-mine address with 11,640 ETH resumed activity after 8.4 years.\n\nEarlier, in October and September of the same year, addresses containing 2,000 ETH and 200 ETH respectively, were reactivated after over eight years of inactivity.\n\nThese instances suggest a pattern where early investors or holders, potentially re-evaluating their investments or deciding to cash in on their holdings, trigger such movements.\n\nThe Ethereum price performance\n\nThe activation of these dormant addresses comes at a time when Ethereum's market performance remains volatile.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $2,515.28, witnessing a minor increase of 1.2% after a significant price drop.\n\nDespite minor fluctuations, Ethereum maintains a significant market capitalization of approximately $301.7 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $17.9 billion."

        "content": "Staying informed and educated about the latest developments in blockchain technology has become more important than ever, and that is precisely where The Crypto Basic plays a crucial role.\n\nDedicated to providing insightful and up-to-date information on all things crypto, we stand as a beacon for both novices and experts navigating the multifaceted panorama of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this comprehensive article, we delve deep into one of the most groundbreaking aspects of blockchain technology: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract revolution; our aim is to demystify the concept of smart contracts, explain their significance in the Ethereum ecosystem, and explore how they are reshaping the world of digital transactions and contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nJoin us on this informative journey with The Crypto Basic, your trusted source for crypto news, as we unravel the intricacies of Ethereum and its pioneering smart contract technology.\n\nWhat is a Smart Contract?\n\nA smart contract is a revolutionary concept in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world; it is essentially a computer program stored on a blockchain that automatically executes, controls, or documents legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.\n\nThe concept of smart contracts was proposed by Nick Szabo in 1994, long before Bitcoin was created; his idea was to use a decentralized ledger to store contracts, which would then self-execute and self-maintain, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to the contract terms.\n\nHow is Ethereum Related to Smart Contracts?\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and his team, was the first blockchain platform designed specifically for creating and executing smart contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt\u2019s not just a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin \u2013 Ethereum is a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) where smart contracts are used as the building blocks; these contracts are written in Ethereum\u2019s native programming language, Solidity, and are compiled into bytecode, which the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can read and execute.\n\nThis technology has enabled Ethereum to become a leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based applications.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum smart contracts offer several key benefits:\n\n1. Automated Enforcement\n\nThey automatically execute the terms of the contract when predefined conditions are met.\n\n2. Increased Security\n\nEthereum smart contracts are secure and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud and tampering.\n\n3. Cost-Efficient\n\nBy eliminating intermediaries, these contracts reduce transaction costs.\n\n4. Transparency\n\nAll transactions are visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust among parties.\n\n5. Speed\n\nSmart contracts automate processes and significantly reduce transaction times.\n\nHow Ethereum Works and Its Security Features\n\nThe core of Ethereum\u2019s functionality lies in its ability to execute smart contracts securely \u2013 this is achieved through the EVM, which serves as the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.\n\nThe EVM is isolated from the main network, providing a sandboxed environment where smart contracts can run without affecting other operations on the blockchain.\n\nSecurity is a paramount concern in Ethereum\u2019s design: the decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that the contracts are resistant to hacking, and the use of cryptographic techniques provides additional layers of security; however, it\u2019s crucial to note that the code quality of a smart contract determines its security, making thorough testing and auditing essential.\n\nWhat are the Advantages of Using Ethereum over Normal Contracts?\n\nEthereum smart contracts offer several advantages over traditional contracts:\n\n1. Trustless Environment\n\nThey operate in a trustless environment, meaning parties do not need to trust each other for the contract to be executed.\n\n2. Global Accessibility\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature allows smart contracts to be accessed and executed from anywhere in the world.\n\n3. Reduced Fraud Risk\n\nThe immutability of smart contracts minimizes the risk of fraud and manipulation.\n\n4. Streamlined Processes\n\nThey streamline business processes by automating tasks that are traditionally done manually.\n\nEthereum Price and Market Trends\n\nThe Ethereum price and its prediction are crucial for investors and users alike: as Ethereum continues to develop, especially with the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, its value is expected to reflect the growing utility of its network.\n\nThe platform\u2019s ability to support a wide range of applications, including DeFi, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and various dApps, contributes to its standing in the crypto market; however, like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s price is subject to market dynamics and can be volatile.\n\nFuture of Ethereum and Smart Contracts\n\nThe future of Ethereum and its smart contracts looks promising \u2013 with advancements like Ethereum 2.0, which aims to increase scalability, security, and sustainability, the platform is poised for further growth.\n\nThe ongoing development in areas such as DeFi and NFTs will likely continue to drive innovation and adoption of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nAdditionally, the increasing interest from enterprises in blockchain technology suggests a bright future for Ethereum in various sectors beyond finance.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s contribution to the blockchain space, particularly through its smart contract technology, is undeniably transformative.\n\nAs a pioneer and leader in this field, Ethereum has set the standard for decentralized applications and has opened the door to a range of possibilities across various sectors \u2013 from creating new financial instruments in DeFi to facilitating unique digital ownership through NFTs, Ethereum\u2019s impact is widespread.\n\nAs the platform continues to develop, particularly with the anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, its role in shaping the future of blockchain technology and digital transactions is expected to grow even more significant.\n\nFor anyone interested in crypto news concerning the intersection of technology, finance, and innovation, Ethereum\u2019s journey is one to watch closely, as always, via The Crypto Basic."

        "title": "After Bitcoin Euphoria: All Eyes on Ethereum ETFs, Will They Be Approved? - Blockonomi",
        "content": "The recent flurry of activity around Bitcoin spot ETF approvals has the crypto world buzzing about what could be next. All signs point to Ethereum being the next major digital asset in focus for exchange-traded fund providers seeking regulatory approval.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum (ETH) has significantly outperformed Bitcoin in recent days, indicating traders are anticipating potential approval of spot ETFs for ETH.\n\nApproval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has increased odds for ETH spot ETF approval, as SEC used similar logic regarding fraud/manipulation impacting both spot and futures prices.\n\nTraders are accumulating other Ethereum-related assets like layer-2 tokens in anticipation of spot ETH ETF approval being next big catalyst.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink sees value in an Ethereum ETF, giving confidence to the prospect. Multiple major firms have filed for ETH spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, some predict ETH spot ETF approval could face delays due to regulatory concerns around classifying Ether as a security rather than commodity.\n\nEthereum has handily outperformed Bitcoin in recent trading, surging over 10% versus Bitcoin since fake news of a BTC spot ETF approval earlier this month. According to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock, this suggests traders are operating under the assumption that Ethereum will be the next cryptocurrency to be granted a spot ETF.\n\nThe logic follows the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) own reasoning in finally approving Bitcoin spot ETF products. In its approval order, the SEC stated that potential manipulation impacting Bitcoin\u2019s spot markets would likely have a similar effect on related futures markets. Given that Ethereum already has a futures-based ETF trading in the US, the door seems open for regulators to apply the same thinking to a spot ETF tied directly to Ether.\n\nThe market enthusiasm extends beyond just Ethereum itself. Other crypto assets related to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem have also seen traders piling in over the past week. This includes layer-2 tokens associated with Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions as well as tokens tied to liquid staking protocols. With the expectation that approval of spot ETFs tracking digital assets can provide a significant catalyst for prices, the broader community is positioning for an Ether spot ETF green light.\n\nAnd that approval may have just gotten more likely following comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. The head of the world\u2019s largest asset manager told CNBC he sees value in an Ethereum ETF. BlackRock has already started the process of applying for such a product.\n\nMajor financial powers like Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck have also thrown their hats in the ring with filings for spot Ether ETFs. In fact, VanEck has the earliest deadline for a decision from the SEC, coming up on May 23rd of this year. Some analysts give over a 70% probability of approval by that date.\n\nHowever, there are also notes of caution from other market experts. Investment bank TD Cowen predicts delays may be ahead, with the SEC likely taking a very cautious approach even in light of the Bitcoin approvals. The key question centers around whether regulators will classify Ether similarly to Bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security. If the latter, it introduces more complexity around applying standards meant for exchange-traded products around traditional securities. Until the SEC gains further confidence from observing recently approved Bitcoin ETFs, an Ethereum product may remain sidelined despite industry pressure.\n\nYet with mounting options for institutional and retail investment gaining SEC approval, the path ahead seems increasingly positive. While delays may yet materialize, an Ethereum ETF seems destined to arrive sooner rather than later. Once open for trading by the masses, such a product would arguably be an even greater catalyst for growth and mainstream adoption than Bitcoin has enjoyed thus far.\n\nAs the crypto community shifts attention to the next likely milestone, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Ethereum to fully emerge from Bitcoin\u2019s shadow and cement its status as the leading smart contract platform."

And while it might seem complex, once you get to know it, things become pretty straightforward.\n\nWhy Use Ethereum?\n\nSo, why are folks buzzing about Ethereum ? For starters, Ethereum isn\u2019t just any cryptocurrency. It\u2019s like the Swiss Army knife of the crypto world.\n\nBeyond just being a digital currency, it allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nPretty neat, right? This uniqueness and versatility make it essential to understand how to buy Ethereum, especially using handy tools like PayPal.\n\nBenefits and risks of buying Ethereum with PayPal\n\nHere\u2019s the essential stuff:\n\nBenefits Risks Using PayPal to buy Ethereum means you don\u2019t have to figure out a brand-new platform for purchasing crypto. Not every crypto exchange is PayPal-friendly, so your options might be a bit limited. Most of us have used PayPal at some point, right? That familiarity reduces the learning curve. Using PayPal might be convenient, but it sometimes comes at a price. PayPal comes with a reputation. It\u2019s been in the digital payment game for a while and offers robust security measures. While PayPal has its protections, remember, the crypto world is like the Wild West. Always stay vigilant\n\nBenefits and risks of using PayPal to buy ETH\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Buying Ethereum with PayPal\n\nTogether, we\u2019ll dissect how to buy Ethereum with PayPal, making it as simple as grabbing a coffee with a friend.\n\nSetting Up a PayPal Account\n\nBefore you can grab some Ethereum with PayPal, you\u2019ve got to set up your PayPal account. It\u2019s easy-peasy:\n\nSigning up for a PayPal account. Head to the website, hit \u2018Sign Up,\u2019 and follow the prompts. Linking a bank account or credit/debit card. This allows smooth transactions. No hiccups when you\u2019re ready to make your purchase. Verifying your identity and account. This might sound tedious, but it\u2019s for safety. A few extra minutes here can save you a world of trouble later on.\n\nPurchasing Ethereum from the PayPal app\n\nHow to use the PayPal app to buy ETH:\n\nEver wondered about the quickest ways to turn your money into Ethereum? Look no further than the PayPal app. Here\u2019s your bite-sized instruction:\n\nOpen the app. Look for \u201cCrypto\u201d on your dashboard. Out of all the cryptos listed, click on Ethereum or \u2018ETH.\u2019 Tap \u2018Buy,\u2019 enter the amount, and select your payment method. Your PayPal balance or linked account will do the trick. Confirm your transaction, and you\u2019re all set!\n\nNote the fees: There\u2019s a little catch. Trading Ethereum using PayPal isn\u2019t entirely free. Always be aware of the spread and transaction fees. It\u2019s a small price for the convenience of using a platform you trust.\n\nChoosing a cryptocurrency exchange that supports PayPal\n\nYou want to choose a cryptocurrency exchange that won\u2019t disappoint. Look for sites with a strong reputation, great trading volume, and a solid number of users.\n\nComparing fees and supported cryptocurrencies\n\nNot all exchanges are created equal. Some might offer Bitcoin and Litecoin but not Ethereum. Others might have hefty fees. Always weigh your options and consider the spread.\n\nReading user reviews and checking for security measures\n\nWould you buy something without reading reviews? Browse through user feedback and ensure your chosen exchange takes security seriously.\n\nSelecting a suitable exchange for Ethereum purchases\n\nAfter researching, choose an exchange that aligns with your needs, whether you need lower fees, a wider variety of crypto assets, or a user-friendly interface.\n\nRegistering and verifying your account\n\nThis is pretty straightforward. Just like any other sign-up process, but ensure your password is robust!\n\nCompleting identity verification (KYC) requirements\n\nTo prevent fraudulent activities, most cryptocurrency exchanges will ask for some proof of identity. Don\u2019t fret; it\u2019s a one-time hassle. Once you complete the Know Your Customer process, you\u2019ll remove all limits on your account.\n\nSetting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security\n\nThis is a no-brainer. It\u2019s like adding an extra lock to your digital funds. Use Google Authenticator or similar tools to set up this security feature.\n\nAdding PayPal as a payment method\n\nHere\u2019s where the magic happens. Link your PayPal account to your chosen exchange, verify the connection, and monitor potential fees or limits.\n\nMaking a purchase\n\nFind and navigate to Ethereum on the exchange, confirm the transaction, and review all details. Remember, double-checking never hurts.\n\nSecurity best practices\n\nYour digital assets are like precious jewels. Safeguard them with two-factor authentication (2FA). Consider hardware wallets, often described as a digital vault for your cryptos.\n\nAlways be diligent, update your passwords, and remember: if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nTips for successful transactions\n\nBe watchful: Keep an eye out for favorable exchange rates.\n\nKeep an eye out for favorable exchange rates. Stay informed: Impulse buying might hurt your finances. Always do your research.\n\nImpulse buying might hurt your finances. Always do your research. Broaden your horizons: For bigger amounts, ponder over alternative payment methods like debit cards or bank transfers.\n\nFor bigger amounts, ponder over alternative payment methods like debit cards or bank transfers. Keep the record: Never overlook tracking your transactions. It\u2019s not just good practice but essential for tax reasons.\n\nSo You\u2019ve Bought Ethereum, What To Do Next?\n\nNow that you\u2019ve secured some Ethereum, the real journey begins.\n\nSecure your Ethereum\n\nCongratulations on buying your first Ether! Now it\u2019s time to keep it safe.\n\nMany beginners leave their assets on a trading platform, thinking it\u2019s the safest option. But that exposes you to unnecessary risks. Exchanges may get hacked or closed down, and you may lose your funds.\n\nThe golden rule? Don\u2019t leave your Ethereum on an exchange for too long. Consider moving it to a cold wallet away from online fraud and hacking attempts.\n\nUse Ethereum\n\nNow, owning Ethereum offers a plethora of possibilities. You could just hold it and watch as market forces play out. But have you considered staking?\n\nIt\u2019s a fabulous way to earn interest on your Ethereum holdings. Or perhaps use it for purchases in the ever-growing list of outlets that accept Ether.\n\nAnd if you have an appetite for risk, there\u2019s always trading to increase your holdings. The options are diverse, so choose what suits your comfort level.\n\nDiversify your holdings\n\nA piece of advice\u2014never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying is key. While Ethereum is a great asset, spreading out your investments is wise.\n\nAim to include at least five different types of cryptocurrencies in your portfolio. This spreads the risk and exposes you to market changes.\n\nStay informed\n\nThe crypto world is dynamic. Regulations get updated, market trends shift, and new coins emerge almost daily.\n\nThe best traders and investors are always in the loop. Staying informed ensures you\u2019re ready to adapt to these changes, optimizing your chances of success.\n\nWrapping Up the Ethereum Journey\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to reflect on our journey together. I\u2019ve walked you through the ins and outs and showed you how to buy Ethereum with PayPal.\n\nDiving into the crypto world, especially making your first purchase, can feel like exploring a new city. Luckily, getting some ETH with PayPal is straightforward. If you select the right exchange, you shouldn\u2019t face issues.\n\nStill, be mindful of potential risks and focus on maintaining your account safe with strong passwords and 2FA. Secure your Ethereum on a hardware wallet and store it or trade it on the exchange if you\u2019re looking for some thrill.\n\nSo, as you move forward, remember to stay curious, stay informed, and, most importantly, enjoy the ride!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "title": "Ethereum Classic surges as ETF speculation continues - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) experienced a 37% increase over the past seven days.\n\nObservers note that the surge is likely due to investors anticipating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will consider applications for an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). On Jan. 10, the agency approved spot Bitcoin ETFs,\n\nHowever, SEC Chair Gary Gensler cautioned that the BTC ETF green light should not be interpreted as a signal of the agency\u2019s willingness to give ETH the same treatment.\n\nStill, Ethereum Classic witnessed a surge of over 35% this week. The altcoin is exchanging hands for $26.65 at press time, with a market cap of $3.8 billion, per data from CoinGecko. This upward movement has been credited to heightened trading volumes and the hype surrounding Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nThe rapid ascent of Ethereum Classic seems somewhat inexplicable given the timing. Some skeptics argue that ETC\u2019s swift climb is in anticipation of an upcoming hard fork later this month.\n\nThis hard fork is speculated to enhance the alignment of the network\u2019s EVM with Ethereum\u2019s, potentially attracting projects to collaborate with the chain.\n\nAdding to the context, the network\u2019s hashrate surged to all-time highs after Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake in late 2022. Former Ethereum miners redirected their GPU mining rigs to Ethereum Classic, seeking an alternative revenue stream, thereby contributing to the network\u2019s heightened hashrate.\n\nDespite Ethereum Classic\u2019s post-Merge hash rate remaining relatively stable, the network registers only about 30,000 transactions per day, roughly the baseline for Bitcoin Cash. Nevertheless, Ethereum Classic\u2019s hashrate is less than 15% of what Ethereum recorded just before the Merge.\n\nIn contrast, ETHPoW, the hard fork of Ethereum initiated around the Merge to compete with Ethereum Classic, currently operates with approximately one-tenth of the latter\u2019s hashrate.\n\nHowever, market reactions appeared to anticipate the SEC\u2019s unofficial announcement, selling the news prematurely, while simultaneously speculating on potential Ethereum ETFs.\n\nLarry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has also expressed support for the idea of introducing an Ethereum-based ETF, following the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF.\n\nYou might also like: Vanguard ceases support for Bitcoin futures ETF purchase\n\nPaving the way for ETH approval\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF enables ordinary investors to tap into the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without direct purchase. This milestone decision holds potential implications for the approval of spot Ether ETFs in the future.\n\nThe green light for Bitcoin ETFs could position Bitcoin as a possible fixture in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans, fostering mainstream acceptance.\n\nSince the announcement, Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced immense volatility, and the onset of 2024 witnessed it surpassing $47,000 marking its highest level in nearly two years, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nMajor asset managers like BlackRock expressing interest have spurred other asset managers to follow suit.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs encompasses several companies, including Ark Invest and 21 Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Hashdex, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and VanEck. Some of these ETFs commenced trading shortly after approval, with Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity dominating trading volumes.\n\nLooking ahead, the SEC is reportedly expected to make decisions on spot Ether ETF applications starting in May. BlackRock, along with Invesco, Ark, VanEck, and Grayscale are among the firms seeking approval.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum Rival Records Nearly 2,000% Growth in Unique Active Wallets Last Year: DappRadar - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Crypto intelligence platform DappRadar says user activity on one Ethereum (ETH) challenger exploded in 2023 as decentralized applications (DApps) saw remarkable growth during the period.\n\nAccording to DappRadar\u2019s yearly industry report, smart contract platform Near (NEAR) recorded 302,000 new unique active wallets (UAWs) last year, marking a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 1,902%, the most out of any chain.\n\nEnterprise-grade blockchain Klaytn (KLAY) and layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) rank next to Near as the networks with the highest UAW increase gain with 73,000 new UAWs, representing a 1,099% increase, and 88,000 UAWs, a 624% increase, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn terms of chain performance, Near, Klaytn, and Arbitrum were the top gainers in UAW percentage increase. They had also a good performance looking with their token, as Near had an increase of 200% since the beginning of the year, Klaytn a 20% and Arbitrum a 32% increase since its launch in March 2023.\u201d\n\nConversely, DappRadar says Ethereum rival Solana (SOL) recorded only 65,000 new UAWs in 2023, a 76% drop on a year-over-year basis. Web3-focused blockchain Hive (HIVE) saw 77,000 new UAWs, representing a 68% drop, as per the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana experienced a rough start of the year, influenced by its association with the FTX fallout. However, the Solana ecosystem saw an impressive recovery during the last months of 2023.

        "title": "Etherum Aims for Scalability, Bitcoin Maintains Fork Conservatism - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade should scale the platform\u2019s transaction processing capacity.\n\nThe introduction of Proto-Danksharding and stateless clients will allow Ethereum to process data more efficiently.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Core developers have often rejected efforts to scale Bitcoin.\n\nFrom the beginning, Ethereum (ETH) has been defined as much by its differences as by its similarities to Bitcoin. In line with Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision, Ethereum had upgradability in mind from the outset. In contrast, convincing Bitcoin node operators to support even small changes to the way the platform functions has proven almost impossible.\n\nAlthough the process hasn\u2019t always run smoothly, over the years, Ethereum developers, node operators and token holders have generally achieved the consensus needed to implement upgrades. Currently expected to occur in mid-2024, the next major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, promises to significantly scale the platform\u2019s transaction processing capacity.\n\nHow Dencun Can Boost Scalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade aims to enhance scalability through two key innovations: Proto-Danksharding and stateless clients.\n\nProto-Danksharding introduces \u201cdata blobs\u201d. These store compressed transaction data off-chain, freeing up valuable block space so Ethereum can support a higher volume of transactions. Blob transaction data is also self-deleting, reducing the blockchain\u2019s long-term storage requirements.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade marks a significant milestone in Ethereum's evolution! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\u2070\n\nGet ready by exploring our Ethereum Evolved: #Dencun Upgrade series, starting with an in-depth look at EIP-6780 and EIP-5656.https://t.co/ryHUFiFzBf \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) January 11, 2024\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will also lay the groundwork for the introduction of full Danksharding in later upgrades. This promises to further boost throughput by distributing data processing across validators.\n\nLike Proto-Danksharding, the idea behind stateless clients is to streamline the way Ethereum handles data.\n\nUnder the current model, full nodes store Ethereum\u2019s entire state history, from Genesis right up to the present day. Post-Dencun, however, stateless clients won\u2019t need to process the full state history and will be able to verify transactions using cryptographic proofs.\n\nBitcoin Developers Remain Committed to Satoshi\u2019s Vision\n\nUnlike Ethereum, which has a history of sometimes-radical forks and upgrades, Bitcoin has been remarkably resistant to change, even for proposed upgrades that would scale its capacity.\n\nBitcoin Core v26.0 was released!\n\nIt is available from: https://t.co/wXCpf4qscl\n\nRelease annoucement: https://t.co/2oLlmkYWlT \u2014 Bitcoin Core Project (@bitcoincoreorg) December 6, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core is hardly monolithic, the open-source software remains true to the basic design principles laid out in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original white paper and implemented by the first generation of Bitcoin (BTC) clients.\n\nOver the years, Core developers have adhered to a singleminded and ultimately rigid vision for Bitcoin, an approach that appears to have the support of the majority of node operators, who have mostly rejected attempts to unseat Bitcoin Core as the blockchain\u2019s preeminent software client.\n\nThe Bitcoin Block Size Debate\n\nObservers can see Bitcoin Core\u2019s general resistance to significant change in the debate over Bitcoin\u2019s block size, which the software has capped at 1 MB since 2010. In contrast with Ethereum\u2019s determined march toward ever greater scalability, the block size limit imposed by Bitcoin Core constrains Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing capacity to a maximum of around five transactions per second.\n\nBefore 2017, a number of alternative Bitcoin implementations broke with Bitcoin Core to increase the maximum block size. The divergence, which aimed to increase capcity, ultimately led to a hard fork. Software clients that supported higher block sizes branched off to form Bitcoin Cash, an alternative blockchain that is more focused on everyday payments than the core network from which it split.\n\nInteresting take on BTC SEGWIT \ud83e\udd14\n\nI wonder what other changes that are architecturally useful for Adam. pic.twitter.com/EyNDZ3WKhI \u2014 cryptotweek (@cryptotweek1) January 15, 2024\n\nAs for Bitcoin Core, developers ultimately settled on a compromise. Rather than increasing the maximum block size, the software has introduced a concept known as Segregated Witness (SegWit). Under the previous model, each block consisted of roughly 35% transaction data and 65% signature data. Post-SegWit, however, signature data is stored off-chain. In turn, this has effectively tripled the amount of transaction data that can be inscribed on each block."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Reach $5k in 2024 If this Scenario Plays Out - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum price has prodded above $2,500 on Jan. 15, further stretching its post-ETF approval lead over BTC, on-chain data trends provide vital insights into the underlying drivers.\n\n\u2018Buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news\u2019 is a popular trading strategy where speculators make acquisitions ahead of a material news event in hopes of selling at a profit when news is confirmed. BTC speculators capitalized on this trading strategy to earn historic gains in the build-up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval verdict. Vital on-chain data trends now reveal that Ethereum (ETH) has also begun to show early signs of a similar phenomenon.\n\nBTC speculators earned 97% profits in build-up to ETF approval\n\nThe Bitcoin spot ETF approval quest suffered multiple setbacks recently, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) citing market manipulation, oversight, and liquidity concerns.\n\nHowever, on June 15, 2023, things turned positive when BlackRock (NASDAQ: BLK) officially filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. With over $13 trillion in assets under management (AUM), BlackRock is one of the largest asset management firms in the world.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s entry into the fray raised optimism about Bitcoin derivatives and effectively spun the rumor mill.\n\nAs of June 15, Blackrock\u2019s official filing date, Bitcoin price was trading around $24,800. Within the first two weeks, speculators who aped-in early on the rumor sent Bitcoin price rallying 25% to hit $30,000 for the first time in 12 months, dating back to June 2022.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action in build-up to spot ETF Approval June 2023 \u2013 Jan. 15, 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nBetween June 15 and Jan. 11, when the SEC eventually confirmed the news, Bitcoin price nearly doubled, moving from $24,800 to a local top of $48,890. This effectively sent speculators who bought the rumor after BlackRock\u2019s filing into 97% profit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the wave of profit-taking that ensued in the aftermath of the SEC approval has sent BTC price spiraling to 15% toward $42,500 as of Jan. 15. This affirms the full cycle of the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news cycle on the spot Bitcoin ETF narrative.\n\nWith the Bitcoin ETF now at a conclusion, investors have switched focus to Ethereum. BlackRock had filed for spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 16. In a recent interview on Jan. 12, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink re-emphasized the value of an Ethereum spot ETF as an asset class.\n\nWhile the BTC price has dropped by 3.8%, Ethereum has increased by 13.5% in the past week. In effect, ETH price has outperformed BTC by approximately 10%.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) price performance \u2013 Jan. 9 \u2013 Jan. 15, 2024. Source: Coin360\n\nInterestingly, in addition to this divergent interplay between ETH and BTC price movement over the past week, strategic on-chain movements from Ethereum whales since Jan. 11 also corroborate early signals of the buy-the-rumor strategy playing out in ETH markets.\n\nEthereum whales have acquired $1.4 billion ETH since Bitcoin ETF approval verdict\n\nOn paper, Ethereum price has outperformed BTC by 10% in the past week, per Coin360 data. Looking beyond the price charts, a vital on-chain indicator has revealed that ETH\u2019s performance has been boosted by corporate entities and high net-worth investors who increased their buy pressure shortly after the Bitcoin ETF approval verdict.\n\nSantiment\u2019s \u2018supply held by top addresses\u2019 metric shows a real-time snapshot of the aggregate balances currently controlled by the largest wallets in a crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe latest readings show that the top 1,000 Ethereum wallets held just 66 million ETH in cumulative balances as of Jan. 10.\n\nBut since the focus switched to spot Ethereum ETF, strategic ETH investors have entered a buying spree, adding 570,000 ETH to bring their balances to 66.5 million ETH at press time on Jan. 15.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply held by top addresses | Source: Santiment\n\nValued at the current price of $2,540, the Ethereum \u2018top holder supply\u2019 chart above illustrates that the top 1,000 investors have added ETH coins worth $1.4 billion to their holdings in the last four days alone.\n\nIntuitively, when the largest stakeholders increase their balances rapidly by hundreds of millions, it is interpreted as a strong bullish signal. Firstly, the buying trend among the largest stakeholders increases overall confidence within the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nGiven that large holders are often likely to hold longer than small-holder swing traders, this accumulation puts ETH in a prime position to score historic gains in the weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum market dominance climbs after spot Bitcoin ETF approval | Source: TradingView\n\nBut more importantly, the timing of the recent buying spree suggests that investors are buying the rumor with optimism that Bitcoin\u2019s ETF approval will increase the likelihood that ongoing ETH applications will also obtain a positive verdict from the SEC.\n\nThe Ethereum Dominance (ETH.D) chart further affirms this stance. Ethereum has cornered 14% more market share between Jan. 10 and Jan. 15, while Bitcoin price has declined at a nearly identical 15%.\n\nThis suggests that speculative traders are selling the news on BTC, rapidly buying the rumor ahead of a possible spot ETH ETF approval verdict.\n\nETH price forecast: can Ethereum reach $5,000 in 2024?\n\nFrom the data points analyzed above, the large holder wallets\u2019 accumulation and the rising ETH dominance suggest that the buy-the-rumor strategy is now widely in play in the Ethereum markets.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin had scored 97% gains in the build-up to the spot ETF approval verdict, a similar performance could put ETH in line to reach $5,000 in the instance of a positive outcome.\n\nBut in the short term, the ETH bulls will have to scale the $2,900 resistance to keep the momentum going. IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money chart, which highlights potential support/resistance points using the historical entry prices of current ETH holders, also supports this ETH prediction\n\nIt shows that with ETH prices currently trading above $2,500, 91% of all ETH holders are now in profit positions. With the ETH ETF approval process on the front burner, these holders could increasingly become less inclined to sell.\n\nHowever, the 8.5 million Ethereum holders who bought 4.1 million ETH coins could pose significant resistance if they book early profits as prices approach their break-even point.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price forecast | Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe bears could negate this bullish prediction if the ETH price unexpectedly retreats below $2,000. However, 7.9 million investors acquired 43.4 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,039.\n\nConsidering this is the largest cluster of ETH current holders, they will likely have enough in the tank to overturn such bearish pressure.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granting approval for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, TD Cowen, a prominent American investment bank and financial service firm, foresees potential delays in the approval process of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Faces Potential Hold-Up\n\nTD Cowen, an investment bank and financial service division of TD Securities has made a bold forecast, predicting that the US SEC is unlikely to approve Ethereum Spot ETFs before its deadline. Presently, the SEC is obligated to make its final decision on its rejection or acceptance of Ethereum Spot ETF from May 23 to August 7, 2024.\n\nEarlier on January 10, the SEC officially approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs, triggering expectations that ETH Spot ETFs would follow suit. Several major firms including Ark 21 Shares, VanEck, Fidelity, BlackRock, and Hashdex have submitted applications for a Spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the regulatory agency has fixed a new deadline for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF to January 25.\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s predictions align with the SEC\u2019s typical cautionary approach towards cryptocurrency-related investment products. The investment bank has disclosed that the regulator may delay ETH Spot ETFs until it accumulates sufficient knowledge and experience from its previously approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs. The bank estimates that while the delay may not take as long as 26 months, it is likely to persist beyond the upcoming elections.\n\nSimilarly, Scott Melker, a crypto investor on X (formerly Twitter) has highlighted the possibility of the SEC hesitating to approve Ethereum Spot ETFs. Melker predicted that the SEC would be reluctant to approve Ethereum ETFs without external legal pressures similar to those observed during the approval process of Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cGary Gensler isn\u2019t going to entertain an Ethereum Spot ETF unless the courts force it on him. I very seriously doubt we will see one anytime soon, but would love to be proven wrong,\u201d Melker stated.\n\nETH price recovers above $2,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nClass Before Approval\n\nJP Morgan, an American multinational financial service firm has introduced another layer of complexity in the approval process of Ethereum Spot ETFs. Managing Director at JP Morgan, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated that there was a 50% chance of the US SEC approving these Spot ETFs by its May deadline.\n\nPanigirtzoglou revealed that the SEC would need to classify ETH as a commodity, similar to Bitcoin before it can officially grant authorization for Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn contrast, Bloomberg senior analyst, Eric Balchunas is more optimistic on Ethereum Spot ETF approvals. The analyst has disclosed a 70% chance of the SEC approving ETH Spot ETFs. Balchunas said previously that he could not imagine a scenario where the SEC would approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs and reject Ethereum Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFeatured image from Tech Cabal, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum price might be doing well post-spot Bitcoin ETF launch, but recent moves by Celsius threaten to destabilize the price movement. The now-bankrupt crypto lender seems to have begun its reimbursement plan to its creditors, as on-chain data reveal the movement of its ETH holdings to crypto exchanges.\n\nAccording to crypto market intelligence company Arkham Intelligence, Celsius Network carried out transfers worth over $125 million worth of ETH last week to various crypto exchanges.\n\nCelsius Transfers ETH To Exchanges\n\nData shows that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius executed transfers worth $95.5 million to crypto exchange Coinbase while also sending $29.73 million to FalconX. At the time of writing, Celsius Network\u2019s balance sheet has 584,601 ETH worth $1.47 billion. Notably, it also has 9,799 BTC worth $418.2 million and 659 million CEL tokens worth $133.2 million on its books, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLooks like Celsius took the opportunity to unload >$125M of ETH over ETF Week. In the past week, they\u2019ve deposited $95.5M to Coinbase and sent $29.73M to FalconX. They still have $1.4 billion (540K ETH) remaining.https://t.co/jp1PJbN46r pic.twitter.com/xgfX6yU5Ye \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) January 13, 2024\n\nCelsius\u2019s motive behind the transfers into exchange points to nothing apart from an intending selloff, as the company is well on its way to clearing its liabilities under bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nCelsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 shortly after the fall of TerraUSD and the LUNA ecosystem, leading to creditors having their funds trapped on the platform for the last 18 months. However, the defunct crypto lender has been making major moves in its bankruptcy proceedings to refund creditors. According to reports, the company sold $240 million worth of ETH in December 2023.\n\nNotably, the company communicated its decision earlier this month on January 5 to unstake $465 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) which will be distributed to its creditors.\n\nETH price shows strength as new trading week opens up | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIncoming Ethereum Price Crash?\n\nEthereum is currently on a roll, still on a 13% gain in the past seven days. However, huge selloffs like this tend to shake market confidence, leading to a sell-off from other investors. On the other hand, some tend to believe that the crypto is sufficiently resilient.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Ethereum retained its bullish sentiment during the time these transfers were made, as price action revealed a 23% jump from $2,191 on January 8 to $2,706 on January 12. Ethereum has declined since then and is now trading at $2,514. According to Coinglass, $23.84 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours.\n\nDespite the recent large transfers, Celsius still retains significant cryptocurrency assets including ETH, BTC, MATIC, and LINK. A decision to continue the selling off of these assets could lead to a bigger dent in the price of the assets, particularly Ethereum, which is now testing the $2,500 support level.\n\nOn-chain data from Spotonchain also reported FTX and Alameda Research moving 1,000 ETH worth $2.33 million to crypto exchange Coinbase during the week.\n\nFeatured image from The Daily Hodl, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Two interesting crypto projects are in the spotlight recently \u2013 Ethereum Classic and Galaxy Fox. Ethereum Classic ($ETC) caught the attention of many investors and traders with its 35% surge.\n\nMeanwhile, Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) is gaining traction with its ongoing presale, which is on track to hit the $3 million mark.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Classic ($ETC) Going Up?\n\nEthereum Classic ($ETC) has emerged as a dark horse, surging by a staggering 35% in a week.\n\nBut what\u2019s fueling this unexpected rise? Ethereum Classic, which hard-forked from Ethereum ($ETH) in 2016, is outpacing its more renowned big brother. Hovering above $27, $ETC has soared by 35%, propelled by positive market sentiment following the approval of the first batch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nEthereum Classic split from the Ethereum Blockchain over a disagreement with founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s decision to reverse a 2016 hack of smart contract system The Dao, which had experienced $60M in stolen Ether. While Buterin\u2019s decision to turn back the clock on the hack was supported by the majority of the community, some developers thought it violated the \u201ccode is law\u201d principle of blockchain \u2013 and thus Ethereum Classic was born. The Ethereum Classic blockchain continues to have a small, but devoted following of users and developers.\n\nAs to the question of why $ETC is pumping recently, part of it has to do with macro-conditions in the market.\n\nSantiment, a leading on-chain analytics platform, reports a rise in $ETC trading volume, reaching levels not seen since September 2022. The report shows the recent surge is closely linked to the Bitcoin ETF announcement and marks a significant milestone for $ETC.\n\nThe coin\u2019s recent bullish movement showcases heightened trader interest and a positive market outlook.\n\nGalaxy Fox Presale Eyes $3 Million\n\nGalaxy Fox has reached a significant milestone with $2.5 million in its presale.

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is enjoying bullish momentum in 2024 thus far, gaining 96% over the past week, per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe surge comes after ENS experienced a massive drawdown in 2023 due to the longstanding crypto winter and regulatory uncertainties.\n\nIn June, ENS witnessed a bloodbath triggered by regulatory actions against leading exchanges, hitting a five-year low of $6.69. ENS started sliding from its all-time high of $83.40 on Nov. 11, 2021, ending with a cycle low. The bear market continued till 2023.\n\nAt the time of writing, ENS is exchanging hands for $24.8, representing a 96 % increase in the past seven days. With a circulating supply of 31 million ENS, the project\u2019s market cap stands at $761 million.\n\nThis resurgence indicates a positive trend for ENS, emphasizing its resilience in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain It allows users to acquire human-readable names like \u201cbob.eth\u201d and link them to identifiers such as addresses, content hashes, and metadata. Unlike traditional DNS, ENS domains are governed by smart contracts and a DAO, reflecting a departure from centralized authority.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder, has emphasized the significance of layer-2 blockchains incorporating ENS domains.\n\nHis call for trustless, Merkle-proof-based CCIP resolvers aims to enable ENS subdomains to register, update, and be readable directly on layer-2 solutions. This move aligns to make ENS more affordable and underscores its importance in the evolving crypto ecosystem.\n\nIt will be recalled that the recent Spot Bitcoin ETF approval triggered a 55% price increase for ENS token last week, with Ethereum (ETH) breaking above $2,400 on January 10.\n\nButerin advocates for the adoption of ENS domains in decentralized finance. His vision is rooted in enhancing user experiences across various layer-2 solutions by integrating ENS domains. This aligns with the broader industry trend of seeking faster and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nYou might also like: SEC chair Gary Gensler assures no breach after X hack\n\nENS enables users to purchase domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, offering a more user-friendly alternative to alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nENS has made its unique niche with 2.1 million registered domains and 800,00 participants where efficient fund transfers are enabled.\n\nDespite the recent approvals of bitcoin spot ETFs, SEC Chair Gary Gensler expressed wariness towards an Ethereum ETF.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently following a pattern similar to previous years, during which their prices surged by 500% and 1,000%, respectively, according to the latest research report by Coinbase Research and Glassnode.\n\nThe observation draws parallels between the ongoing crypto market cycle and the period from 2018 to 2022, characterized by substantial price increases in both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Halving\u2019s Potential Impact on Crypto Markets\n\nAnalysts highlight various cyclicality metrics, such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in profit, which mirror past trends. These metrics indicate that the present state of the crypto markets doesn\u2019t mirror the euphoric conditions seen during the peak of 2023. It suggests there might still be potential for the market to experience further surges.\n\nDespite acknowledging the potential positive impact of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, Coinbase Research is cautious.\n\nThe paper noted a lack of robust supporting evidence and characterized the relationship between the halving and market performance as somewhat speculative.\n\nThe research points out that, with only three halving events historically, there isn\u2019t a fully established pattern, especially considering previous events were influenced by factors like global liquidity measures.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, projected to occur in April 2024 based on current mining rates, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum\u2019s Market and Upcoming Upgrade\n\nIn 2023, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by over 90%, driven by several factors, such as the success of the Shapella upgrade and the increasing likelihood of approval for spot crypto ETFs. Market participants were encouraged by these developments, contributing to the increase in the ETH value.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are focusing on the upcoming Ethereum upgrade named Cancun. It is expected to enhance scalability and security to make layer-2 transactions as cost-effective as possible.\n\nThe successful implementation of Cancun could potentially lead to a significant increase in the number of processed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s analysis notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum have undergone two cycles, encompassing both bull and bear markets. The ongoing cycle, initiated in 2022, closely mirrors the patterns observed in the preceding ones."

        "title": "Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic: 5 Key Differences Between ETH and ETC - CoinGape",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic came from the same network, but they are two different blockchains.\n\nEthereum and Ethereum Classic differ based on their origin, consensus mechanism, token supply, market value, and network developments and upgrades.\n\nEthereum has quickly become one of the most popular blockchains with its innovative capabilities such as smart contract support and dApp development. However, it had to face an unfortunate hack called \u201cthe DAO hack\u201d in 2016, which resulted in a split in the network. That\u2019s how Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains have emerged. The major difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is that Ethereum relies on Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism while Ethereum Classic sticks to the original Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Even though both share similarities like decentralization and smart contract support, they share multiple differences. Let us discuss a few of the major differences between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in the present article. But, before that lets first understand the history behind these two blockchains.\n\nEthereum vs Ethereum Classic: Why There Are Two Networks? Ethereum brought a revolution with its launch by taking blockchain technology beyond mere peer-to-peer transactions. It enabled the development of decentralized applications and \u201cThe DAO\u201d was one of the pioneering apps on Ethereum. The DAO project allowed retail investors to participate in crowdfunding of other projects. However, the smart contract of The DAO project had a vulnerability called \u201cSplit Function\u201d. The developers of the project deliberately included that feature to allow investors to withdraw their investment based on their preference. When investors withdraw their funds, they will get their ETH back and the data on the blockchain will get updated. The Split Function feature paved the way for hackers to breach \u201cThe DAO\u201d project and Ethereum suffered a major loss in 2016. Malicious hackers drained around $50 million dollars from the project without actually updating the transaction history. To make the Ethereum blockchain secure again and to gain the trust of the community, Vitalik Buterin and other developers decided to hard fork the network. However, the entire community didn\u2019t agree with the decision. Just like how the community split based on their decision, the Ethereum blockchain was also split, giving birth to two networks. The original blockchain that remained immutable is today known as the \u201cEthereum Classic\u201d network whereas the new network is the present \u201cEthereum\u201d blockchain.\n\nEthereum vs Ethereum Classic: 5 Key Differences\n\nOrigin of Crypto As we have explained above, after the hard fork in 2016, Ethereum community members divided into two parts, having different opinions. While a part of the community believed that it is important to have the hack in its history and the blockchain should continue as it was. On the other hand, the other part of the community believed that it is important to undo the hack and retrieve the lost money. However, the decision to implement the hard fork gained more votes and the developers implemented the hard fork on July 20, 2016. The network that remained as it was became the \u201cEthereum Classic\u201d network and the new network is the present \u201cEthereum\u201d network. Thus, Ethereum and Ethereum classic differ based on their origin.\n\nConsensus Mechanism Consensus mechanism is another major difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Walking through the footsteps of the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum also initially worked based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, the developer team of Ethereum decided to change it into a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network to make it sustainable. The Ethereum network transitioned from PoW to PoS mechanism after the historical \u201cEthereum Merge\u201d event in September, 2022. This not only saves energy but also helps the network process transactions faster. On the other hand, Ethereum Classic remained a PoW network, sticking to the traditional mining process.\n\nToken Supply and Monetary Policy Token supply and monetary policy behind Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are top differences between them. While Ethereum has no fixed token supply, Ethereum Classic\u2019s token supply is fixed at around 210.7 million. Furthermore, the inflation rate of Ethereum is capped at 4.5% and developers can make changes to its monetary policy as per requirements. But this is not the case with Ethereum Classic. When all the 210.7 million ETC are mined, miners will only get transaction fees as rewards.\n\nMarket Value & Community Ethereum holds a large market value compared to Ethereum Classic, being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As of January 2024, the total market capitalization of Ethereum is more than 300 billion. On the other hand, the market capitalization of Ethereum Classic is over 3 billion. Both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic differ a lot when it comes to their market prices as well. Adding to that Ethereum has a wide user base and adoption with its functionalities and huge number of dApps. When it comes to Ethereum Classic, the community is smaller and more focused on PoW mechanism and immutability rather than dApp ecosystem.\n\nNetwork Developments & Upgrades The developer team behind Ethereum is relentless with network developments and upgrades. From London upgrades to the Merge and Shapella upgrade, Ethereum went through several major events. All of these Ethereum upgrades aim to improve scalability, sustainability, and overall functionality of the Ethereum network. When it comes to Ethereum Classic, there isn\u2019t much activity in terms of its development and network upgrades. It focuses more on stability and doesn\u2019t undergo frequent upgrades. The Ethereum Classic community prioritizes immutability. Thus, the network completely sticks to PoW and traditional functionalities.\n\nConclusion Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are two notable cryptocurrencies in the industry. Even though they came from the same blockchain, they share several major differences. While the smart contract functionality and decentralization features are available on both of them, they differ based on token supply, origins, market value, and network upgrades."

        "content": "Over 650,000 units of staked Ethereum, valued at approximately $1.6 billion, were redeemed last week\u2014the largest amount of redemption since the Shanghai Upgrade was completed last year.\n\nA Dune Analytics dashboard shared by Tom Wan, an analyst at 21 Shares, showed that the bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment were the primary contributors to this substantial redemption surge. Together, they orchestrated withdrawals totaling 563,300 staked ETH, constituting an impressive 85% of the total redemptions during the reporting period.\n\nCryptoSlate highlighted these firms\u2019 role in pushing Ethereum\u2019s validator exits to a record high of over 16,000 validators on Jan. 5. At the time, the two firms made up roughly 75% of the total withdrawals in the queue as they planned to remove more than 550,000 staked Ethereum.\n\nCelsius previously revealed plans to unstake 206,300 ETH, worth around $470 million, as part of efforts for its bankruptcy process. The failed lender said the withdrawals would be used to facilitate the distribution of assets to its creditors.\n\nOn the other hand, Figment was also making substantial withdrawals of over 350,000 staked ETH on its clients\u2019 behalf.\n\nFollowing these substantial withdrawals, the total amount of staked Ethereum now sits at 28.9 million, according to Nansen\u2019s Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) Upgrade dashboard.\n\nETH\u2019s price unaffected\n\nThe staked Ethereum withdrawal activity did not negatively impact ETH\u2019s price performance during the past week, as the digital asset\u2019s value rose by around 12% to a peak of $2700, its highest value since May 2022.\n\nSuggestions that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) following similar approvals granted to Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to this upward price movement.\n\nLarry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock, further fueled the optimism when he said he saw \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF\u201d during an interview with CNBC.\n\nData from Polymarket shows that around 55% of bets on the platform anticipate an Ethereum ETF approval by the end of May."

        "title": "SSV Network: Transforming Ethereum Staking with Distributed Validator Technology - Blockonomi",
        "content": "With Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, staking has become vital to securing the network. But even after the Merge, operating validator nodes still requires 32 ETH, advanced technical skills, and reliable infrastructure. This creates barriers to participation for many people.\n\nEnter SSV \u2013 an open source protocol enabling decentralized and accessible Ethereum staking built atop the post-Merge landscape.\n\nHow does Ethereum staking currently work?\n\nUnder PoS, validator nodes add new blocks rather than miners. To become a solo validator, you must lock up 32 ETH and set up nodes to do the validation work \u2013 whether on hardware you control or using a third-party service. These validators then earn rewards in the form of additional ETH proportional to their stake. However, there are significant hardware demands and the risk of penalties if your validator goes offline.\n\nThe SSV solution\n\nSSV is a staking infrastructure protocol developed by a community-driven DAO. It works by distributing validator keys among non-trusting nodes called \u201coperators\u201d. This means multiple operators can jointly run a validator without any one operator having full control.\n\nAnyone can join SSV as an operator by running an open-source node and registering keys. The protocol handles distributing validator key shares among operators automatically. Validators with 32 ETH at stake provide the keys to the network to have their ETH staked across the operator pools. This gives them effortless access to staking without infrastructure costs. Even if some operators go offline, rewards keep accruing due to the distributed nature.\n\nBenefits of the SSV model\n\nSSV unlocks Ethereum staking for regular users in a decentralized way. By splitting up infrastructure needs, it offers:\n\nReduced barriers to entry: No need for 32 ETH or to maintain validator hardware Enhanced security: Collective validation by operators, with distributed keys More decentralization: Anyone can be an operator or staker Fault tolerance: The network sustains some operator downtime Flexibility: Stakers can choose operator pools based on geography, hardware etc. Censorship resistance: Decentralized operators make collusion unlikely Community-oriented: Open source network governed by a DAO\n\nBy innovating staking infrastructure for the Web3 era, SSV helps move Ethereum towards greater decentralization and accessibility. Now anyone can play a role in shaping consensus and earning rewards.\n\nThe SSV Token\n\nSSV is the native token and has two core functions:\n\nNetwork Governance\n\nSSV holders can create and vote on proposals to steer policies, partnerships, tech upgrades, and more. Just as tokens enable on-chain governance for DeFi protocols, SSV puts the direction of the network in community hands.\n\nValidators pay fees to operators for securing and managing their staked ETH using SSV as interoperable currency. With skin in the game, SSV holders are strongly incentivized to contribute to and monitor the network\u2019s growth.\n\nPayments Between Staking Actors\n\nThe SSV token facilitates exchange of value between validators, who deposit ETH to earn staking rewards, and operators, who maintain infrastructure for validators and take a cut of yields.\n\nValidators fund their accounts with SSV, which operators draw from as a fee in proportion to the staking rewards they generate. Operators also get compensated for actions like submitting slashing proofs. This mechanic aligns incentives \u2013 the more rewards an operator enables, the more SSV they earn.\n\nBridging Incentives Through Tokens\n\nThis tokenized model is key to decentralizing staking on Ethereum in practice. By bridging incentives between essential participants, and allowing validators choice based on real-time operator performance, staking becomes open and efficient like never before.\n\nThrough clever tokenomics design, SSV is bolstering accessibility and decentralization of the rapidly evolving Ethereum network.\n\nKey Moments and Achievements\n\n2023 marked a significant chapter in the evolution of Ethereum staking, with the SSV Network pioneering a transformative approach through its permissionless mainnet deployment. Underpinning this revolutionary shift is the innovative Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) introduced by the SSV Network, which promises to enhance the security, decentralization, and robustness of Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\nThe SSV Foundation\u2019s creation of four testnet versions set the stage for the network\u2019s progress. Boasting 92 active operators from five continents and staking 70,000 ETH, the SSV Network exhibited impressive global participation. The launch of the Shifu testnet V2 marked a significant milestone, enabling operators to engage in Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus using DVT.\n\nETH Denver\u2019s \u2018BUIDLWeek\u2019 in February 2023 showcased the SSV Network\u2019s commitment to fostering development and creativity. With a $50 million ecosystem fund and the announcement of the Shifu testnet V2, the SSV Network provided a robust foundation for aspiring developers.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s commitment to autonomy reached new heights with the establishment the SSV DAO Verified Operators (VOs). These individuals, selected for their strong work ethic and technical expertise, were vital in overseeing a subset of the network\u2019s validators during the Limited Launch period.\n\nDecentralized Governance and Expansion\n\nWhen the Multi-Sig Committee and Quorum Proposal were first introduced in August of 2023, it was a momentous day for the SSV Network. The purpose of these suggestions, which were included in the second round of DAO projects, was to improve network security, simplify decision-making processes, and support efforts that contribute to the expansion of the network.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s governance system, combined with the Karma dashboard and Vote Delegation, significantly reduced the barriers that prevented community members from participating in decision-making processes.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s open-source ETH staking architecture, powered by DVT, addresses critical challenges in Ethereum staking. Active-Active Redundancy and Fault Tolerance ensure uninterrupted validator operation, even in the face of node failures. The unique approach of securing ETH without custody, where validator keys are generated, split, and securely stored offline, enhances the safety of staking for users.\n\nDecentralization and Diversity are cornerstones of the SSV Network, as independent node operators globally contribute to the network\u2019s infrastructure. This strengthens the Ethereum blockchain and reduces risks for individual stakes.\n\nFlexibility and Lack of Coordination are integral to SSV Network\u2019s implementation of DVT. Stakeholders can choose validator operators without collaboration, all managed through smart contracts. The ability of distributed validators to swiftly switch nodes adds a layer of flexibility to the network.\n\nHistorical Evolution and Notable Achievements\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s inception traces back to the team\u2019s involvement in Blox Finance in 2017, evolving into a non-custodial ETH staking provider, Blox Staking. The adoption of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s DVT technology idea in 2020 led to the creation of the SSV protocol, with the mainnet launch in 2023.\n\nFounder Alon Muroch, a leading Ethereum POS specialist, spearheaded the team\u2019s efforts, securing strategic partnerships with Coinbase, Digital Currency Group, and OKEx. Over three years, the team achieved significant milestones, including the release of the SSV protocol, DAO creation, testingnets, DAO fundraising, and a $50 million green fund.\n\nSSV Network\u2019s Impact on Ethereum Staking\n\nA revolutionary change in Ethereum staking has occurred due to the recent deployment of the permissionless mainnet made available by SSV Network. Within the framework of the staking paradigm, the employment of DVT technology answers issues about centralization. It is in line with the vision of decentralized validators that Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has.\n\nThrough its incentive program, which rewards users with one million SSV tokens, the SSV Network is committed to constructing a diverse ecosystem and fostering acceptance of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result of three years of concentrated development that ended in a mainnet that does not need permission, the SSV Network has emerged as a critical player dedicated to expanding Ethereum\u2019s staking environment. This is because the mainnet does not require permission.\n\nOne year ago, the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) network presented a groundbreaking Ecosystem Fund funded with fifty million dollars.\n\nSome of the parties participating in this transaction are venture capitalists, angel investors, and staking enterprises, including DCG, OKX, HashKey, NGC, Everstake, HackVC, GSR, and Chorus. Developing stake solutions for the future generation was a collaborative effort between One SevenX and 1kx.\n\nMore Adoption Is Likely\n\nA significant number of companies use the ssv.network, and they do so by using DVT. Core Development Lead Alon Muroch places significant emphasis on expanding the number of individuals who can use Ethereum\u2019s security. It is anticipated by the DVT protocol that there would be a substantial rise due to the establishment of the Eco Fund.\n\nAfter presenting the ssv.network DAO, which allocated $3 million for developer awards, firms including Blockscape, ANKR, Stader, and Moonstake were given over $1.2 million in prizes for using DVT in product development. These companies were honored for their accomplishments.\n\nIn addition, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s concept for Ethereum 2.0 involves introducing a decentralized virtual token (DVT) to improve the system\u2019s level of security. Each validator uses DVT, made possible by ssv.network, which is positioned as Ethereum\u2019s Layer 0. Ethereum is developing toward a global decentralized and censorship-resistant network. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nTo demonstrate its dedication to decentralization, innovation, and the empowerment of communities, the SSV Network will begin on a journey that will be revolutionary in the year 2024. With rising interest in blockchain, SSV is well placed to rise along with the wider market.\n\nA paradigm shift has occurred in the Ethereum staking given by the network due to the use of DVT technology, which has improved security, fault tolerance, and flexibility. As the SSV Network continues to shape the future of distributed Ethereum staking, it is projected to have a substantial impact on the blockchain technology ecosystem.\n\nThe SSV Network is a driving force in the development of Ethereum\u2019s staking environment because of its commitment to a staking landscape that is open, decentralized, and permissionless."

Based on the price movement after the approval, the product can be deemed to have turned out to be a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event.\n\nInterestingly, the conversation around crypto ETFs has turned to a possible similar product for Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThese discussions are highlighted by activities on Google Trends, where interest in the keyword \u2018Ethereum ETF\u2019 has spiked to an all-time high in the United States over the past 12 months.\n\nIn particular, data acquired by Finbold on January 15 indicates that by the week ending January 13, the interest in the keyword hit a peak popularity score of 100, the highest point over the last month. Notably, between January 6 and January 14, the interest spiked by 455%.\n\n12-month interest in \u2018Ethereum ETF\u2019 in US. Source: Google Trends\n\nA breakdown of regional interest indicates that Oregon and Alabama are leading, reaching a popularity score of 100. Nevada follows closely in third place with a score of 94, trailed by New Jersey at 85, while Washington secures the fifth spot with a score of 81.\n\nDrivers of ETH ETF interest\n\nInterest in the Ethereum ETF surged notably after BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) CEO Larry Fink expressed that he \u201csees value\u201d in the product. It\u2019s worth highlighting that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment management firm, is a key player in the Bitcoin ETF arena.\n\nIt is also among the applicants awaiting feedback from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the spot Ethereum ETF application. The SEC is set to decide on the Ethereum ETF in May of this year.\n\nHowever, there is speculation that the product might encounter obstacles due to its classification by regulators as a security. At the same time, SEC chair Gary Gensler has pointed out that part of the reason for approving a Bitcoin ETF is its classification as a commodity.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAmidst the speculation, Ethereum is experiencing increasing buying pressure, with the token rallying while Bitcoin faces the threat of losing the $40,000 support zone.\n\nEthereum has recorded weekly gains of over 13% as of press time, with the decentralized finance (DeFi) token trading at $2,537.\n\nEthereum seven-day price chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin has calmed at around $43,000 after the recent volatility propelled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the launch of 11 spot ETFs.\n\nOn a weekly scale, though, BTC is in the red, unlike most cryptocurrencies, such as ETH, which has soared by double digits.\n\nBTC Down on ETF Approval Week\n\nAfter years and years of delaying and rejecting countless applications, the US securities regulator finally greenlighted spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday, and the products reached the markets a day later.\n\nThe whole development didn\u2019t go without a few downturns, including a hack and a controversial statement by the SEC\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler. This resulted in enhanced volatility for the underlying asset, which soared to over $49,000 on Thursday after the ETFs went live and slumped by more than seven grand in the next 36 hours.\n\nThe weekend has been a lot less eventful. BTC recovered some of the losses and has remained in a tighter range of around $43,000 for the past two days or so. Nevertheless, the asset is down by more than 2% weekly, which means that its market cap has slipped to $840 billion.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

ETH has risen by more than 13% on a weekly scale and currently trades above $2,500.\n\nTron and Chainlink have posted similar gains on a weekly scale. Polkadot, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, Litecoin, and Dogecoin follow suit. In fact, BNB is the only top 10 alt with a minor daily decline.\n\nThe total crypto market cap is up by $40 billion since last Sunday but down by more than $80 billion since the peak on Thursday."

        "title": "Forget Solana, This Cryptocurrency Is Poised for an Incredible Run in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After rising by more than 900% last year, Solana (SOL -1.23%) might be the most deserving to hold the title of crypto's 2023 MVP. Yet, while the digital currency's monumental resurgence provided a much-needed respite after it fell to as low as $8, Solana's long-term prospects pale in comparison to one of crypto's household names: Ethereum (ETH 1.43%).\n\nHere's why investors would be remiss to overlook Ethereum's potential while the market's focus remains elsewhere.\n\nA little context first\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum arrived on the crypto scene with a bang. At the time, it was the first blockchain that allowed developers to build custom decentralized applications via smart contracts -- transactions that self-executive when certain terms are met -- making Ethereum the first programmable cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum's pioneering of smart contracts meant that the majority of innovative crypto uses initially found a home on its blockchain. Things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and much more all started on Ethereum and represented a seismic shift in the trajectory of crypto's capabilities.\n\nBut like any iteration of technology, new versions eventually arose. Enter Solana. Building off of Ethereum's efforts, Solana arrived in 2017 offering developers and users a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum.\n\nFast-forward a few years, and Solana has assumed the title of Ethereum killer, gaining significant traction in the crypto economy thanks to its blazing speeds and extremely low fees. Today, it is the fifth-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market with a total valuation of $41 billion.\n\nSolana's rapid rise to become one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies has brought a wave of hype with it. Yet even with this, Ethereum remains nearly six times as valuable and supports 20 times more value across the DeFi economy.\n\nEthereum's game-changing upgrades\n\nWhile Solana optimists might paint a different picture, the reality is that Ethereum remains the epicenter of the decentralized economy. It has the largest developer community, has a proven track record of functionality, and continues to implement upgrades that will further increase the network's capabilities.\n\nMost importantly, these upgrades are part of the reason Ethereum is poised for a run in 2024. In the second half of the year, Ethereum will launch EIP-41844, an upgrade that will lower transaction fees and increase its throughput.\n\nFor the entirety of Solana's existence, its primary advantage was that it is a cheaper and faster version than Ethereum. But what will happen if Ethereum levels the playing field?\n\nWith increased efficiency and scalability, the number of uses Ethereum can support will likely increase. Since one of the primary ways a cryptocurrency is valued lies in the utility it provides, EIP-41844 could bring new value to Ethereum's long-term prospects.\n\nBest of all, though, EIP-41844 is just one of a series of planned upgrades over the coming years. Subsequent improvements will introduce new functionality such as greater security, increasing decentralization, and further streamlining of the network.\n\nIn totality, Ethereum's future upgrades hold the potential to solidify it as the most valuable smart-contract blockchain and squash any competition.\n\nThe multichain future\n\nLike many markets in the world today, the DeFi economy will likely have several competitors. Take the smartphone market as an example. While Androids make up more than 80% of the global market, Apple's iPhone still holds a considerable portion.\n\nA similar future in crypto is likely: one where Solana and Ethereum coexist, with each offering developers and users different options. However, when deciding which of the two is poised for a significant run, Ethereum looks more promising, especially over the long haul.\n\nWhile Solana ran up more than 900% in 2023, Ethereum witnessed a measly 90% jump. As the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market and home to more decentralized applications than any other blockchain, this lack of performance suggests that Ethereum has a bit of catching up to do.\n\nFortunately, Ethereum is no stranger to significant growth. During the last bull market, it rose by nearly 2,000% when it skyrocketed from around $200 to more than $4,800 over a year and a half. Whether a similar scenario unfolds remains to be seen.\n\nBut when considering the potential that will accompany EIP-41844, as well as future upgrades, don't be surprised if Ethereum becomes one of the best performers in your portfolio for years to come."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his views on the significance of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pointing to their role in shaping the future of tokenization, in a recent interview with CNBC.\n\nWith the recent greenlight for several spot Bitcoin ETFs, the spotlight has shifted to Ethereum. Responding to this matter, Fink adopted an optimistic viewpoint, saying that he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d Notably, he saw Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as crucial steps toward tokenization.\n\n\u201cI think ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets. Step two is gonna be the token digitalization of the assets,\u201d said Fink, \u201cThese are just stepping stones toward tokenization.\u201d\n\nTokenization is the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens, which potentially increases accessibility to investment opportunities. Last year, BlackRock participated in a live securities settlement using JPMorgan\u2019s Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN).\n\nFink suggested that the technology required for tokenization is already available. He also highlighted the benefits of using a tokenized system, stating that it could eliminate all forms of corruption.\n\nWhile discussing Bitcoin, Fink drew a comparison between Bitcoin and gold, viewing them both as enduring asset classes that offer long-term protection. However, he was skeptical about the potential for Bitcoin to become a widely accepted means of exchange.\n\n\u201cI do believe it\u2019s an alternative source of wealth holding. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever gonna be a currency. I believe it\u2019s an asset class,\u201d stated Fink. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than what gold represents over thousands of years. It\u2019s an asset class that protects you.\u201d\n\nBlackRock filed for a spot Ethereum ETF last November, with Coinbase Custody as the custodian. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a decision on an Ethereum ETF application from Ark Invest and 21Shares by May."

Despite this, a potential fundamental headwind from ETF\u2019s could still push ENS higher.\n\nThis leaves ENS price targeting an upside move to $26 (a potential +7.53%).\n\nWhile downside risk could see ENS price tumble down to $20.37 (a possible -15.79%).\n\nENS price analysis therefore reveals a current risk: reward composition of 0.48 \u2013 a bad entry characterized by retracement risk, but not withstanding the potential boost of a spot Ethereum ETF, this suggests on the short-time frame it is too late to buy.\n\nBut while ENS offers an unappealing entry point, a huge opportunity is still open to early backers interested in innovation in Bitcoin Mining and network security.\n\nENS Price Analysis Alternative?

        "content": "Ethereum has staged a remarkable coup, outshining Bitcoin with a 14% surge in just two weeks. This week, the digital currency shattered a key psychological barrier, surpassing $2,600 for the first time since May 2022. This decisive breach, backed by strong fundamentals and an increasingly bullish sentiment, could pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s ascent to a coveted $3,000 mark.\n\nEthereum Breaches Critical Psychological Barrier\n\nThe $2,600 level wasn\u2019t just a random resistance point; it represented a critical psychological hurdle for Ethereum. Breaching this level not only confirmed the ongoing uptrend but also triggered a cascade of technical buy signals, propelling the price even higher.

Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\nRegardless of the short-term price fluctuations, one thing is clear: Ethereum is no longer playing second fiddle to Bitcoin. With its robust fundamentals, technical momentum, and the promise of an ETF, Ethereum is poised to claim its rightful place as the dominant force in the digital currency landscape.\n\nThe recent $2,600 breach could be the first step on a journey towards even greater heights, and investors around the world are watching with bated breath.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin witnessed a drop in its prices as the optimism about exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin evaporated.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index hit a three-month low, falling back to \u201cneutral\u201d \u2013 for the first time since October last year. This implies that investors have become more cautious since the launch of US-listed spot Bitcoin products.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, the OG cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged to almost $49,000, the highest level in nearly 2 years, in anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. However, Bitcoin (BTC) prices have dropped since and stood at $42,578 at press time, down 0.06% over the last 24 hours.

It too has possible ETF approval looming and that would do wonders for the price of the altcoin. In fact, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes there is a 70% chance that the approval by the SEC will come in May of this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he expects a 70% chance of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved in May. The SEC needs to make approval decisions on multiple Ethereum spot ETF applications by the end of May, including VanEck, Ark 21Shares and Hashdex. Digital asset lawyer\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2024\n\nElsewhere, there is another very interesting Bitcoin alternative coin going through presale called Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX). This coin provides a solution to a Bitcoin mining problem that should not only make this project a great success but also help Bitcoin hit new highs. Before we get into 5 reasons why Ethereum could propel to $5,000, let\u2019s first take a look at this new token.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix- This project is not just likely to pump itself but also help Bitcoin in 2024\n\nThe presale of Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) has been a huge success and it originally took a lot of experts off guard. What seemed like a niche crypto has raised over $8.3 million already as whales are even starting to get their share of BTCMTX.\n\nThe reason for this is that Bitcoin Minetrix could provide a solution that currently plagues the Bitcoin mining sector. This means it could not only be a success itself but could be key to Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high in 2024.\n\nThe problem it aims to tackle is how exclusive the mining of Bitcoin has become. Originally an activity anyone could do from their own home with the right equipment, has really gotten out of hand. Due to its growing popularity, Bitcoin is now mined in industrial-sized data centers that use an incredible amount of energy. This costs a lot and has thus excluded most crypto enthusiasts from mining its number one token.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nImage by Bitcoin Minetrix\n\nThe key ingredients to success are cloud mining and staking\n\nCloud mining was originally put forward as the solution but it has massive issues now too. In theory, an individual enters into a cash contract with a company that can lease the capabilities to mine. This sounds fair but the companies are charging huge deposit fees and demanding a share of the yields individuals mine. The process is also full of scammers too so it has failed as an alternative to the problem.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix understands that cloud mining is a good idea but has innovatively added staking to the mix to give the people who wish to mine control over the process. How it works is fairly simple; Investors have a choice once they stake their BTCMTX. They can keep them and earn a decent APY% and they can also unstake and sell them at any time.\n\nThere is a third option with Bitcoin Minetrix that allows investors to exchange tokens for mining credits. These credits are secondary ERC-20 tokens that have one function. That is to be burned in exchange for mining time or a share of the yields. An innovative process that is both greener and cheaper than regular Bitcoin mining. It\u2019s no wonder the presale has taken off.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\n5 reasons why Ethereum could propel to $5,000 in 2024\n\nAs we mentioned in the opening, a lot of the focus for 2024 has been on Bitcoin (BTC), but Ethereum (ETF) could well outgain it. One of the main driving forces behind the Bitcoin hype is the recently approved ETFs. Later this year the Ethereum ETFs could be approved and given that ETH has already started pumping this year, that could mean the hype could continue to drive the price toward $5k.\n\nEthereum has been making big improvements to the ecosystem, and co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently announced major roadmap updates. Single Slot Finality (SSF) is perhaps the stand-out update. It will help the proof-of-stake system run more efficiently and given the emphasis put on staking lately this should help the price pump.\n\nIt's always nice to have some experts on your side when you make a crypto forecast. Despite Solana (SOL) performing so well lately, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, recently tweeted about how he was abandoning the altcoin for Ethereum. Hayes believes ETH is on its way to $5k.\n\nFam ... I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nSantiment, a behavioral analytics crypto site, released a report right at the end of 2023 that made for very good reading for ETH investors. It stated that the total supply of the altcoin on exchanges was around the 8% mark. As we know scarcity is very valuable for a cryptocurrency\u2019s worth.\n\nLastly, that same study also showed that around $28.4 million ETH had been staked, as we have covered staking is becoming more and more valuable to projects and this many staked coins give Etehereum\u2019s potential future gains a nice parachute if market conditions turn bearish at any time. Over 3.8 million ETH tokens have been burnt too which also contributes to scarcity. All the above reasons point to Ethereum hitting $5k this year.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nSo there you have our analysis on two different coins at very different ends of the spectrum but both look like they will be big gainers in 2024. Both projects are worth investing in but for the largest profit, Bitcoin Minetrix is the choice. Its low presale price means it is a low-risk option but has a chance of a big return on investment."

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: ETH has recently outperformed Bitcoin, marking a significant 14% increase within a fortnight. The cryptocurrency recently surpassed the $2,500 mark, a first since May 2022. This breakthrough, fueled by robust fundamentals and growing optimistic market sentiment, sets the stage for Ethereum\u2019s potential climb to the $3,400 level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Trajectory and Market Optimism\n\nAfter reaching a multi-week high near $2,716, Ethereum price experienced a slight correction, dipping below $2,600 and $2,550. Despite this, the overall momentum remains bullish. Last week\u2019s ETF approval contributed to a surge in Ethereum\u2019s price, maintaining it above the $2,500 threshold. This upward trend presents a promising outlook for Ethereum\u2019s near-term price increase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price is currently hovering around $2,514, showcasing an impressive gain of over 64% in the past year and a 10% increase in the last month. Despite a minor 1% decrease in the past day, this significant growth suggests a predominantly positive sentiment towards Ethereum. It positions the cryptocurrency as a viable option for both long and short-term investment strategies.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis and Price Movements\n\nA cryptocurrency analyst, Ali, recently highlighted Ethereum\u2019s breakout from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s price aims for the $3,400 target. Ali predicts a potential bullish run in the upcoming days.\n\nRemember that #Ethereum broke out from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. Despite the short-term volatility, $ETH continues to target $3,400! pic.twitter.com/kQ2ncLuFjL \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 14, 2024\n\nThe next major resistance level for Ethereum lies near $2,600. A decisive move above this level could propel Ethereum towards the $3,000 mark and potentially even higher towards the $3,400 zone. Conversely, failure to surpass the $2,500 resistance might lead to a downward trend. The initial support level is around $2,440, with further declines potentially testing the $2,300 support.\n\nThe daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates bullish momentum, with a positive crossover observed on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen above 50, entering a neutral zone. This suggests a strong buying interest but hints at the possibility of a short-term correction. Additionally, the 20-EMA currently stands above the 50-EMA, indicating ongoing bullish pressure.\n\nThe Awesome Indicator highlights a bullish trend, overcoming a slight dip as the latest up-candle engulfs the prior down-candle. This suggests strong upward momentum. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow Indicator, at 0.06, confirms a positive market sentiment, indicating a flow of capital into the market, a sign of investor confidence.\n\nRelated Articles"

On the lower side, the near-term support is $2545. Any break below targets $2415/$2350/$2200. Significant downtrend if it breaks $1900.\n\nThe immediate resistance stands at around $2700. Any violation above $2700 confirms a minor jump to 3000/$3580 is possible. A surge past $3600 will take Ethereum to $4000/$4800\n\nIt is good to buy on dips around $2550 with SL around $2350 for TP of $3580.\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "title": "Can Ethereum flip Bitcoin by 2030? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS puts it on course to give Bitcoin a fight.\n\nA prediction said that Ethereum\u2019s revenue could hit $51 billion by 2030 while ETH may hit $11,848.\n\nDestiny cannot be denied. It can only be delayed. This statement explains the sentiment of those who believe that Ethereum [ETH] will flip Bitcoin [BTC] by 2030. However, this discussion has been going on for a long time.\n\nBut at the time of writing, Ethereum had not yet flipped Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nDespite the state of things, some Ethereum supporters argue that the flipping would happen. AMBCrypto checked if there was any time that the smart contract blockchain came close to overtaking Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to data from Blockchain Center, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance rose to 36.9% in June 2017.\n\nAt that, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance was around 44.4%. Eventually, the flipping did not happen. But between that period and now, a lot of things have changed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s new model changes Bitcoin\u2019s operation\n\nOne of the major changes was Ethereum\u2019s move away from Proof-of-Work (PoW). Up until September 2022, both Bitcoin and Ethereum utilized the PoW consensus mechanism.\n\nThe PoW mechanism allows the verification of transactions through miners. In this case, miners get rewards for adding computation power to the network. But Ethereum stopped using that method and transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) during a major upgrade called \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nWith PoS, Ethereum no longer needs miners but validators. Here, users don\u2019t have to be miners, and they also get rewarded for validating new blocks of transactions.\n\nThis \u201cease\u201d has aided Ethereum\u2019s popularity. It is also one of the reasons some predictions are confident that Bitcoin will play second-fiddle by 2030.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has not been resting on its oars. Recent developments have proven that the Satoshi Nakamoto-developed project could be ready to fight Ethereum pound for pound.\n\nCompetition escalates between the kings\n\nThis assertion could be linked to the creation of NFTs on the Bitcoin network. During the 2021 bull market, NFTs got popular, and most of them were built on the Ethereum blockchain. For this reason, demand for ETH increased.\n\nHowever, the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals in 2023 Q1 has ensured that Ethereum has intense competition in that regard. AMBCrypto looked at CryptoSlam\u2019s data and found that Bitcoin was giving its opposite number a run for its money.\n\nAt press time, NFT seven-day sales on the Ethereum blockchain were $92.39 million. Bitcoin was a close second with $90.18 million within the same period.\n\nSo, if demand for ETH rises as a result of these assets, there is a high chance that BTC also follow. Should this remain the same case, Ethereum flipping Bitcoin by 2030 would be difficult.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum dominating the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space makes a strong case for the flipping. This is major because of its smart contract functionalities.\n\nAt the peak of the bull market in 2021, Ethereum\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $97 billion.\n\nThe TVL determines the total value of digital assets locked in a protocol. So, the increase at that time implied that market participants trusted the project enough to continuously add liquidity to it.\n\n5 figures for ETH by 2030?\n\nThis DeFi dominance is why some analysts believe that the Vitalik Buterin-led project can bite into Bitcoin\u2019s market share. For example, in May 2023, VanEck predicted that the blockchain\u2019s revenue could rise as high as $51 billion by 2023.\n\nThe research also mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s dominance among smart contracts protocols could rise to 70%. The mutual fund and ETF management firm also talked about the price, noting,\n\n\u201cIn our Base Case, we assume that Ethereum will achieve $51B in annual revenue in the year ending 4/30/2030. We deduct a validator fee from this total, 1%, and a global tax rate of 15%, and we arrive at cash flows of $42.90B to Ethereum. Assuming an FCF multiple of 33x, 120.7M token, we come to a Base Case 2030 Price Target of $11,848 per token.\u201d\n\nOn an all-time basis, ETH\u2019s price has increased by 89,382.45%. BTC, on the other hand, had seen its value rise by 68,863,742%. By comparing both prices, one can assume that ETH was undervalued massively undervalued compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there have been predictions that the Bitcoin price could rise higher. One of the reasons could be linked to the recently-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nWith the ETF approval, more institutional capital is expected to flow into Bitcoin. This could also affect the price action positively. As a result of this, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that BTC could cross the $1 million mark by 2030.\n\nEthereum flips Bitcoin here\n\nIn the meantime, analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin spot ETF approval was a signal for ETH to shine. According to him, the development could force liquidity rotation into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nBut will this lead to Ethereum flipping Bitcoin? Well, that might be hard to decide, considering that an Ethereum spot ETF could be approved before or by May 2024.\n\nRegarding the number of holders, AMBCrypto analysis of Santiment showed that BTC had 52.76 million. ETH, on the other hand, had more than double that at 112.52 million.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin by 2030? Our verdict\n\nThis data indicated that Ethereum had experienced more adoption than Bitcoin. If the growth continues in this manner, then it could increase its chances of flipping Bitcoin by 2030.\n\nAnother possible impact of the flipping is the supply. For Bitcoin, it has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This is one of the reasons Ethereum might find it hard to flip it.\n\nBecause if demand for BTC increases with its fixed supply, the price and market cap will go higher.\n\nThe supply of ETH, however, is unlimited. But the project, thanks to its burning mechanism, ensures that demand matches the ETH supply.\n\nAlso, the shift to PoS had greatly impacted the tokenomics. This is also one of the reasons market participants have stuck to ETH since it became a yield-generating asset.\n\nGiven its different use cases, demand from retail and institutions alike is expected to increase.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nBut to flip Bitcoin would be a hard nut to crack. Furthermore, 2030 is a long time to predict what would happen with both projects.\n\nBut considering the recent developments, Ethereum might get very close to flipping Bitcoin. However, it is not guaranteed that the former would surpass the number one cryptocurrency by that time."

CoinShares head of research James Butterfill says it failed to break all-time high records.\n\nMassive Bitcoin Inflows In Crypto Funds\n\nCrypto asset investment products saw $1.18 billion inflows (subject to T+2 settlement), according to CoinShares weekly report on January 15. Despite the huge spot Bitcoin ETF hype, it fails to break the $1.5 billion record of futures-based Bitcoin ETFs in October 2021.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, crypto funds trading volumes soared record high of $17.5 billion last week. The average trading volume is $2 billion per week.\n\nBitcoin recorded a $1.16 billion inflows, representing 3% of total assets under management. Short-bitcoin also saw inflows of $4.1 million, with month-to-date inflows of $3.2 million. Experts anticipated a long-term profit of spot Bitcoin ETFs as some remain skeptical about spot Bitcoin ETFs despite bringing money back into the market.\n\nEthereum also saw inflows of $26 million indicating better investment fundamentals and high demand for its staking yield. XRP saw $2.2. million inflows in a week and $3.1 million in inflows month-to-date, the largest among altcoins.\n\nHowever, Cardano and Solana inflows declined to just $1.4 million and $0.5 million. Altcoins such as Avalanche and Polkadot also recorded mere inflows as investors looked to other crypto assets.\n\nThe U.S. saw $1.24 billion of inflows last week, while Switzerland saw $21 million inflows.

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies on Monday evening traded mixed as the long-anticipated approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) resulted in a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.75% $42,619 Ethereum ETH/USD +0.81% $2,517 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -0.11% $0.080\n\nWhat Happened: The term \u201cSell the news\u201d is commonly used in capital markets to describe the phenomenon where asset prices, leverage, and sentiment escalate leading up to a bullish event, only to experience a subsequent decline shortly after.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, BTC retraced to a low of $41,600 before rebounding, following a brief surge to a two-year high above $49,000. This surge occurred as the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. last Thursday.\n\nThe new spot BTC ETF is anticipated to attract substantial capital from various crypto products, as outlined in a recent research report by J.P. Morgan. Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) cautious approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the market\u2019s response has been relatively subdued. The attention has now turned to the potential inflow of capital into these new ETFs.\n\n\"We are skeptical of the optimism shared by many market participants at the moment that a lot of fresh capital will enter the crypto space as a result of the spot bitcoin ETF approval,\" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Flare FLR/USD +35.65% $0.023 Blur BLR/USD +14.54% $0.65 Sei SEI/USD +13.69% $0.82\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.68 trillion, showing a 0.58% decrease in the past 24 hours.\n\nStock futures declined on Monday night as investors awaited further data and bank earnings that will offer more insight into the state of the American consumer. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 50 points, equivalent to 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures decreased by more than 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.\n\nInvestors are keeping an eye on the upcoming December retail sales data, expected to be released on Wednesday, as it may spark concerns about a potential economic slowdown if U.S. consumer spending shows signs of cooling. Economists surveyed by FactSet project a modest 0.2% increase for the month, slightly below the 0.3% rise seen in November.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe has observed that the Bitcoin ETF has yielded a negative return since its inception.\n\n\"The Bitcoin ETF has provided a massive net inflow on the first few days. More than $600 million on the first day. The real impact of the ETF will be shown in the coming few years. A mega bullish event.\"\n\nTop BTC ETFs Since Inception\n\nBitcoin ETFs Gains (Since Inception) +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) -12.3% $43.86 Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) -8.7% $38.35 VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) -10.1% $49.62\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt has suggested that BTC is poised for a corrective movement after reaching the $60,000 mark, anticipating a rapid and forceful correction. Post this anticipated pullback, DonAlt foresees a subsequent surge driving BTC to potentially reach as high as $90,000.\n\n\"If you go straight up, I think $60,000 would be a really good resistance\u2026 I think that pullback would be quite aggressive, quite quick and one that you absolutely should be buying\u2026If we hit $60,000, any pullback that you get should be a buy because at that point, we have tested $60,000 three times. I think then on the next test it wouldn't hold and then you would go to $70,000, $80,000 [or] $90,000.\"\n\nSantiment, an on-chain analytical firm indicates that in anticipation of the recent Bitcoin ETF approvals, larger Bitcoin wallets were observed to be moving older coins at a heightened pace, leading to a considerable decrease in the average age of coins held in these wallets.\n\n\"There are mild signs that this continued movement of older coins is finally done for the time being. This would increase the likelihood of crypto\u2019s bull cycle finally halting for now. With this said, a few large whales could move a large number of coins, further pushing down the BTC mean dollar invested age curve and create another wave to test $45K & perhaps $50K once again.\"\n\nPhoto by FellowNeko on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "title": "Some Traders Think New Altcoin Bitcoin Minetrix Could Outperform Ethereum in 2024 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The investment community is buzzing about the new Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) project, which launched its presale in the second half of 2023 and has raised over $8.4 million so far.\n\nSome traders believe that Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s revolutionary Stake-to-Mine protocol could even allow it to outpace Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) growth once listed on centralized exchanges this year.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Seeks to Democratize BTC Mining Through Staking Model\n\nFor those unaware, Bitcoin Minetrix is an Ethereum-based project that aims to open up BTC mining to a wider audience.\n\nBy staking BTCMTX tokens in a smart contract, users can earn \u201cmining credits\u201d that can later be redeemed for cloud mining power.\n\nThis removes the need for expensive hardware and technical expertise, which has traditionally barred entry for everyday crypto users.\n\nAs Bitcoin Minetrix runs on Ethereum, all transactions are transparent and decentralized, with miners always retaining complete control of their tokens.\n\nBTCMTX staking also generates a passive income stream for token holders \u2013 with yields currently as high as 77% per year.\n\nBy combining the BTC mining yields with these staking rewards, users can potentially generate two streams of income.\n\nThis dual-income model makes Bitcoin Minetrix particularly appealing to investors seeking diversification and recurring rewards.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the project has begun to draw attention due to its unique setup, with high-profile names like Austin Hilton reviewing Bitcoin Minetrix in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix has even undergone a smart contract audit from Coinsult \u2013 further boosting trust in the platform\u2019s security.\n\nOngoing Presale Buzz Fuels $8.4 Million Funding Raise\n\nThe project is currently in the middle of a limited-time token presale to fund its ambitious roadmap.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale began in September 2023 and is structured across multiple stages where early participants can benefit from the lowest token prices.\n\nOver $8.4 million has already been raised \u2013 demonstrating the immense interest in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s features.\n\nCurrently, BTCMTX tokens are on offer for $0.0128, although this price is only scheduled to last for one more day before rising slightly.\n\nOnce the presale ends, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on various exchanges, although specific names have yet to be released.\n\nThese listings will provide access to the broader crypto community and improve liquidity for those who invest during the presale.\n\nMembers of Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Telegram channel are already looking ahead to these listings, believing that the increased trading volume could drive sharp price increases.\n\nAdditionally, the validation that these listings will bring could attract risk-averse investors who prefer to purchase exchange-based cryptos rather than presale tokens.\n\nWith the current presale momentum showing no signs of slowing, many community members believe now is a prime opportunity to gain exposure to BTCMTX while the price is low.\n\nTraders Predict Bitcoin Minetrix to Outpace Ethereum in 2024\n\nGiven the massive momentum behind the presale, some traders think that Bitcoin Minetrix could be poised to outperform Ethereum over the next year.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum has become the go-to platform for decentralized apps and Web3 projects.\n\nHowever, after years of exponential growth, ETH may struggle to maintain the same high pace in 2024.\n\nWith a market cap exceeding $300 billion, there\u2019s a belief that Ethereum lacks the room for 10x gains at this mature stage of its lifecycle.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s innovative staking and mining model presents an intriguing opportunity.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-launched project, BTCMTX offers huge upside if its ecosystem sees rapid user adoption in the coming year.\n\nThe project\u2019s Stake-to-Mine mechanism also unlocks two potential income streams for holders, with staking yields and BTC mining rewards reinforcing its value proposition.\n\nThis design could compound investors\u2019 returns over an extended period.\n\nIn many ways, Bitcoin Minetrix finds itself in a similar position to Ethereum in the late 2010s \u2013 a new project on the brink of providing a groundbreaking concept.\n\nIf even a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s explosive growth can be achieved, Bitcoin Minetrix could establish itself as a major player in the crypto market.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "1inch experienced a substantial surge in volumes and market dominance in the fourth quarter of last year amidst a broader market resurgence,\n\nAccording to Messari\u2019s report, the popular DEX aggregator recorded over $30 billion in executed volume and a commanding 64% share of the Ethereum DEX aggregator market. The nearly doubled volume from external sources suggests increased adoption of 1inch as a backend solution and the expansion of aggregator platforms.\n\n1inch Sees Increased Trading Activity in Q4\n\nTransaction growth is primarily attributed to new products, as evidenced by increased activity in the Limit Order Protocol (LOP) and 1inch Fusion, while transactions in the Aggregation Protocol witnessed a decline during the quarter.\n\nThe share of 1inch trades conducted on Uniswap V3 and V2 saw an increase by 8 and 3 percentage points, constituting 40% of trades and 8% of trade volume, respectively. The volume generated by 1inch on these two Uniswap versions rose from $5.6 billion in Q3 to $10 billion in Q4, Messari\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe share was mainly derived from Curve and Dodo, the second and now sixth most common execution venues. PancakeSwap continued to receive over $1 billion in trade volume from 1inch for the second consecutive quarter, accounting for 7% of 1inch\u2019s total volume in Q4.\n\nDuring the period, 1inch experienced notably greater volume growth compared to its counterparts, leading to an expansion of its market share from 59% of trades in Q3\u201923 to 63% in Q4\u201923.\n\nThe sole significant competitor to gain market share in Q4 was CoW Swap, holding 11% of the aggregator volume on Ethereum during the quarter. ParaSwap and 0x, in turn, held 11% and 10% of the aggregator volume, respectively, in Q4.\n\n1inch DAO\n\nThroughout Q4, the 1inch DAO continued its strategic treasury management, diversifying its stablecoin holdings by swapping a million USDC for DAI. These funds were then deposited to earn interest as sDAI, constituting the first reallocation since the Q2 deposit of 1 million USDC in Aave for interest.\n\nOn the expenditure front, the DAO used slightly over $1 million in three distinct transactions. Notably, on December 30, $890,000 USDC was allocated to fund support services for users within the 1inch Network.\n\nMeanwhile, the staked amount of 1INCH saw a 7% increase in the fourth quarter."

At press time, 91.6% of this total, equivalent to 110,085,982 ETH, was in profit.\n\nThe rally in the percentage of ETH\u2019s supply in profit is attributable to the recent surge in the coin\u2019s price. The value rise comes on the heels of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) recent approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nExchanging hands at $2,550, ETH\u2019s value has risen by almost 10% since the ETF approval arrived on 10th January.\n\nWhile the rise in the number of coins held in profit is generally considered a bullish signal, the disparity in the trading strategies commonly adopted by ETH\u2019s short and long-term holders might impact where the coin\u2019s price might be headed next.\n\nSome profit-takers, especially short-term traders, might be tempted to sell their ETH to lock in their gains. This could lead to temporary price dips if selling pressure outweighs buying.\n\nOn the other hand, long-term holders looking to gain more profit might be more inclined to hold their ETH, reducing the circulating supply and potentially contributing to price appreciation in the long term.\n\nETH on a weekly chart\n\nThe ETH market assessed on a seven-day chart revealed that sentiment remained significantly bullish. The key momentum indicators observed were spotted at overbought highs, suggesting that buying activity outpaced coin sell-offs.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 70.98, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 84.65. Likewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was 0.17 at press time, indicating steady capital inflow.\n\nConfirming that the bulls had control of the weekly chart, ETH\u2019s positive directional index (green) at 30.74 rested above its negative directional index (red) at 8.67.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWith the coin\u2019s Aroon Up Line (orange) spotted at 100%, the current bullish trend was strong.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s Aroon Up line is close to 100, it indicates that the uptrend is strong and that the most recent high was reached relatively recently."

        "title": "EIP-7514: Transforming Ethereum Staking; Arbitrum & InQubeta Outlook Brightens - Cryptonews",
        "content": "EIP-7514: Transforming Ethereum Staking; Arbitrum & InQubeta Outlook Brightens\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been in the spotlight due to its new staking upgrade. The EIP-7514 or \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade seeks to implement a Max Epoch Churn Limit and control the growth of staked tokens on the blockchain.\n\nThe upgrade is set to usher in new functionalities by transforming staking, and analysts are keen to know what it holds for Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nThe other two coins that have captured the attention of analysts are Arbitrum (ARB) and InQubeta (QUBE). Arbitrum is a developer-friendly Layer 2 technology, while InQubeta is a user-friendly platform for raising funds for AI startups.\n\nCompared to Arbitrum, InQubeta is a younger platform and has shown explosive growth in the past few months. It has garnered global recognition as one of the best crypto investments available today and an impressive presale funding, at $8.1 million currently.\n\nInQubeta: DeFi customized for AI startups\n\nInQubeta has been designed to help next-generation startups chase their dream of driving impact with AI. The platform uses the capabilities of the Ethereum network to create a seamless investment model that\u2019s decentralized and transparent. Its native cryptocurrency, the QUBE token, is the only mode of payment accepted within the InQubeta ecosystem. The QUBE token\u2019s supply is capped at 1.5 billion but a large part of it has been earmarked for public sale.\n\nThe rest goes towards funding marketing initiatives, finance staking, and paying legal advisors and developers. The QUBE token is a good crypto to buy as it doesn\u2019t differentiate between crypto users. Even an amateur user can earn steady passive income by staking the token.\n\nUnder staking, an asset is locked for a certain period, supporting a platform\u2019s growth. The owner of the asset earns rewards throughout the staking period. At InQubeta, these rewards are given from a pool that\u2019s funded by tax collections. To ensure that InQubeta develops in a positive way, its protocol is updated from time to time.\n\nBut who decides which changes are to be implemented? The platform\u2019s decentralized governance model offers special voting rights to token holders which they use to screen unwanted proposals for changes. Any community member can suggest a change in protocol and the decision whether it should be implemented is taken by putting it to a vote. The token holders participate in the voting process and vote depending on how they feel about the proposal.\n\nArbitrum One TVL crosses $10.2 billion\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 technology that\u2019s powered by Ethereum and helps developers create innovative dApps on the network. Its native token, ARB, is the chief cryptocurrency of the Arbitrum ecosystem.For many analysts, Arbitrum is among the best altcoins to buy now as it has been growing strongly.\n\nMarket indicators also reflect that a bearish pattern might be on the cards for the ARB token in the coming months. In a recent development, Arbitrum One\u2019s total volume locked (TVL) crossed $10.22 billion during seven days in January. With the feat, it became the first Layer 2 blockchain to achieve the milestone and the figure was reflected by an increase of 15.9%.\n\nVeno Finance to support Ethereum\u2019s zkSync Era\n\nEthereum is a blockchain technology that supports a wide array of decentralized assets, solutions, and dApps. The proof-of-stake platform is known for its seamless scalability and versatility that powers both cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Its native token is ETH.The network\u2019s upcoming EIP-7514 or \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade has the Ethereum community quite excited.\n\nThe upgrade proposes to change the size of the active validator set and is likely to mitigate negative consequences resulting from high staking levels.Ethereum has also been in the news due to its integration with Veno Finance. The liquid staking protocol would now support the Ethereum-based scaling solution zkSync Era. With this latest move, ETH holders will now be able to stake and receive Liquid ETH on Veno Finance.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor those looking to strengthen their portfolio with top crypto coins, InQubeta, Arbitrum, and Ethereum represent unmissable opportunities that enjoy analysts\u2019 favor.\n\nThese three cryptocurrencies have been driving market gains steadily and are expected to reach record highs in 2024.In terms of technology, the three cryptocurrencies are fine examples of how DeFi can drive empowerment across the masses. Along with a user-friendly model, they promise cutting-edge security to keep their token holders\u2019 assets safe from malicious actors.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale"

        "content": "The reactivation of a dormant Ethereum address with 200 ETH highlights a trend of similar incidents amid Ethereum's volatile market. This raises questions about long-term investor strategies and market dynamics.\n\nThere is a reactivation of a pre-mine Ethereum address containing 200 ETH, valued at approximately $506,140. This incident occurred after a prolonged dormancy of eight and a half years, as reported by Whale Alert, a blockchain analytics and monitoring platform. This reactivation is not an isolated event; similar instances involving substantial amounts of ETH in previously dormant addresses have been noted in the recent past.\n\nIn December 2023, an Ethereum address with 11,640 ETH was reactivated, and similarly, addresses with 2,000 ETH re-emerged in October and September 2023. These reactivations come at a time when Ethereum's market performance has been notably volatile. Following a significant price drop, the market observed a minor increase of 1.2%. Ethereum's price volatility and these sudden movements of large amounts of cryptocurrency from dormant addresses have sparked discussions and speculations among investors and analysts.\n\nEthereum's blockchain technology, a decentralized platform that enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party, has been a significant player in the crypto space since its inception. The reactivation of these dormant addresses is noteworthy because it may signal a shift in the long-term strategies of early investors or possibly indicate new movements in the market.\n\nIt's essential to consider the broader context of these reactivations. In the cryptocurrency market, large transactions by 'whales' (entities or individuals holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency) can have a significant impact on market dynamics. According to U.Today, mega accumulation of Ethereum by whales is ongoing, with notable transactions involving thousands of ETH. This kind of activity can signal confidence in Ethereum's long-term value, despite short-term market fluctuations.\n\nMoreover, the reactivation of dormant addresses might be influenced by the overall market trends and the advancements in Ethereum's technology. Ethereum has undergone several updates and improvements, aiming to enhance its scalability , security, and sustainability. These developments could motivate dormant account holders to reengage with the market.\n\nIt's also crucial to analyze the historical context of these reactivations. Ethereum's early days were marked by a more speculative investment environment, with many investors holding onto their assets for long-term gains. The reemergence of these accounts might reflect a shift in these investors' perspectives, possibly due to the evolving regulatory landscape or changes in market potential.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "ETH was up by more than 13% in the last seven days.\n\nMost indicators and metrics remained bullish on Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] spot ETF approval caused havoc in the crypto space, as it resulted in a price plummet for most coins. However, Ethereum [ETH] had other plans, as it registered double-digit growth in the last seven days.\n\nWill investors witness a fresh bull rally during the upcoming week?\n\nThe aftermath of ETF approval\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was up by more than 13% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,543.60 with a market capitalization of over $305 billion. Sentiment around the token also turned positive.\n\nMoreover, on the 13th of January, Santiment posted that sentiment toward top-capital assets such as Ethereum remained at extremely optimistic levels.\n\n\ud83d\udcca As the weekend has kicked off, sentiment toward top cap assets remain at extremely optimistic levels with spotlights on them following the #ETF approvals.

Ethereum\u2019s Weighted Sentiment registered a massive spike last week, meaning that bullish sentiment was dominant.\n\nInterestingly, despite the hike in bullish sentiment, ETH\u2019s social volume registered a drop in the recent past.\n\nWhat to expect from Ethereum\n\nTo better understand whether the high bullish sentiment would result in a further hike in the token\u2019s price, AMBCrypto took a deeper look at Ethereum\u2019s state.\n\nOur analysis revealed that ETH\u2019s Supply on Exchanges recently went below its Supply outside of Exchanges, meaning that buying pressure on the token was high.\n\nWhales\u2019 confidence in the token also somewhat increased as its supply held by top addresses went up slightly last week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bollinger Bands revealed that its price was in a high-volatility zone. Additionally, its MACD also displayed a clear bullish advantage in the market, increasing the chances of a continued price uptick in the days to follow.\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a downtick in the recent past, which could restrict ETH\u2019s price from moving up.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIf Ethereum manages to push its price further up, the token might face a few resistance zones. Therefore, AMBCrypto took a look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heat map.\n\nAs per our analysis, if an ETH bull rally is bound to happen, the token would face strong resistance near the $2,740 mark, as previously, the token\u2019s liquidation spiked at that level."

        "content": "Despite the recent challenges in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has experienced a notable surge, increasing by 70% in the past week. This remarkable growth contrasts sharply with the overall bearish trend observed throughout 2023. Investors are now questioning whether ENS could be the symbol of recovery rising from the aftermath of the crypto crash.\n\nAs of this writing, ENS is trading for $24.6,3 down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko shows. The project has a market capitalization of $761 million, with a 31 million ENS supply in circulation.\n\nEthereum Name Service: From Frozen Depths To Soaring Heights\n\nJust months ago, ENS lay buried under a blanket of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Battered by a prolonged crypto winter and regulatory chills, it slumped to a five-year low in June 2023.\n\nYet, as the new year dawned, a thaw set in. Fueled by a surge of market confidence and a 50% price increase triggered by the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, ENS began a relentless climb, shattering its previous peak and leaving investors breathless in its wake.\n\nWhat Ignited The ENS Engine?\n\nThis strong price ascent wasn\u2019t born out of thin air. Several key factors fueled the ENS inferno:\n\nLayer-2 Endorsement: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has become a vocal champion of ENS integration with layer-2 scaling solutions. This vision of faster, cheaper transactions using human-readable ENS domains resonated with users and developers alike, painting a brighter future for the project.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has become a vocal champion of ENS integration with layer-2 scaling solutions. This vision of faster, cheaper transactions using human-readable ENS domains resonated with users and developers alike, painting a brighter future for the project. DeFi Embrace: With decentralized finance (DeFi) taking center stage in the crypto revolution, the ease and security of ENS domains have become increasingly attractive. The ability to send and receive funds using simple names like \u201calice.eth\u201d instead of long, alphanumeric wallet addresses is a game-changer for user experience.\n\nWith decentralized finance (DeFi) taking center stage in the crypto revolution, the ease and security of ENS domains have become increasingly attractive. The ability to send and receive funds using simple names like \u201calice.eth\u201d instead of long, alphanumeric wallet addresses is a game-changer for user experience. Community-Driven Flight: Unlike traditional, centralized naming systems, ENS thrives on a decentralized foundation governed by smart contracts and a DAO. This democratic approach gives users a direct say in the project\u2019s future, fostering a sense of ownership and community that fuels its growth.\n\nENS currently trading at $24.67 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nChallenges On The Horizon?\n\nEthereum Name Service is a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain, for those who are unaware. It enables users to obtain names that are legible to humans, such as \u201cbob.eth,\u201d and associate them with identifiers like addresses, content hashes, and metadata.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the sun-drenched optimism, storm clouds still linger on the horizon. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification as a security or commodity could cast a shadow on ENS\u2019s future. Additionally, the broader crypto market remains susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment, making sustained growth anything but guaranteed.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe ENS rally serves as a powerful testament to its resilience and potential. However, navigating the volatile crypto landscape demands a cautious approach. As with any investment, careful research and a measured understanding of the risks involved are paramount.\n\nOne thing is certain: with its user-friendly domain names, community-driven spirit, and increasing DeFi and layer-2 integrations, ENS has carved a unique niche in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The blockspace demand for scaling solutions soared, with users scurrying to capitalize on their relative advantages.\n\nEthereum scales in 2023 and how!\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of L2Beat statistics, 2023 was indeed the moving year for scaling solutions built atop the base layer of Ethereum.\n\nFathom this \u2014 on the first of January 2023, the Ethereum mainnet clocked 13.67 transactions per second (TPS) on average, while the combined throughput of the scaling solutions was just 4.38.\n\nBy December, the story had changed dramatically. The scaling factor of L2 rollups exploded to 5x and, on certain days, even 7x. On the 15th of December, scaling solutions averaged more than 91 TPS when compared to Ethereum\u2019s 13.45.\n\nWith a growth trajectory like this, there were very few reasons not to be bullish on Ethereum L2s. However, the best part was yet to come.\n\nEthereum L2s wait for EIP-4844\n\nThe upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade, shortened to Dencun \u2014 or EIP-4844 \u2014 was the most anticipated Ethereum upgrade of 2024. Popularly referred to as Proto-Danksharding, the upgrade aims to achieve 10-100x cost savings on the rollups.\n\nOn-chain analyst Leon Waidmann drew attention to the projected gas fees reduction following the upgrade.\n\n#Ethereum EIP-4844 will be a GAMECHANGER for L2s.

Work on the upgrade was going on in full swing, and developers have eyed the 17th of January for a testnet launch.\n\nThe tech of it all\n\nAs is well known, rollups help cut fees by batching thousands of transactions into a single transaction and sending them back to Ethereum for validation.\n\nHowever, the data is eventually stored on the chain forever and the storage costs are factored in the total gas fees.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nWith the EIP-4844, the data is sent to the nodes on the consensus layer, which would automatically get deleted after a certain period.

        "content": "After the approval of the first U.S. traded spot bitcoin ETFs were approved on Wednesday, the price of Ethereum soared reaching its highest level since May 2022. Meanwhile, investors still have their attention on $GFOX the presale token that is causing waves as one of the best meme coins to buy.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nWhat is $GFOX?\n\n$GFOX is the native token of the Galaxy Fox project, a meme coin project designed to proliferate and transform. Although $GFOX draws inspiration from some of the best meme coins to buy such as $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE, it offers way more than a run-of-the-mill meme coin. For example, the project has immense growth potential and offers utility-focused features that set it apart from other crypto projects.\n\nOne of the most prominent features of $GFOX is its play-to-earn game. In this game, avid gamers compete for the top 20% of positions on the leaderboard. Once the gaming season is over, winners are rewarded with in-game currencies that they can exchange for $GFOX tokens.\n\nPlayers can enhance their chances of success by purchasing temporary attribute boosters that enhance their speed, agility, and strength, to give them an edge over the competition. They can also leverage NFTS which gives them unique strengths and abilities to enhance their gameplay.\n\nSpeaking of NFTs, $GFOX is set to release a collection of 3,000 NFTs that is rumored to be the coolest NFT collection yet. Upon launch, these NFTs will be available for minting on the $GFOX website. Investors can trade their NFTs on the $GFOX marketplace or third-party sites like OpenSea.\n\nAnother reason why $GFOX is quickly gaining recognition as one of the best meme coins to buy is its growth potential. Right, from the presale, the $GFOX token is designed to give loyal investors the best returns. With each presale stage, the price of the token increases slightly, allowing early investors to make up to 5 times their investment at launch.\n\nAccording to market analysts, $GFOX is a potential 100X coin that could easily surpass well-known meme coins like $PEPE. The token burn feature, which removes part of the $GFOX tokens in supply and permanently burns them, will also play a large part in the coin\u2019s growth. Burning tokens reduces its circulating supply, hence increasing its inherent value.\n\n$GFOX has already garnered a lot of support from its growing community and avid investors who recognize it as one of the best meme coins to buy now. The project has raised over $2.64 million and hopes to raise even more as it enters stage 7 of the presale.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\n$ETH Begins Rally\n\nAs investors continue to flock to the $GFOX presale, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap $ETH has begun a new rally. $ETH is currently (at the time of writing) trading at $2,618 a 24-hour uptick of over 10%. Weekly charts show a growth of about 18% while the month-to-month chart shows a 16% increase.\n\n$ETH has underperformed many of the top altcoins for most of the year, but its recent rally has a lot to do with the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. After the SEC gave the green light for the first US Traded Bitcoin ETS, $ETH shot up by 15.5% to trade at $2,606 which is the highest the cryptocurrency has reached since May 2022.\n\nAccording to a popular crypto analyst, the positive momentum of $ETH is likely to continue in the near future. If the recent breakout is confirmed, $ETH could go for as high as $3500.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe crypto market is in a frenzy of excitement after the SEC approved the first Bitcoin ETFs after 10 years of waiting. Investors are eager to see the impact of these ETFs on the border crypto market, but if $ETHS\u2019 recent spike is any indication, the bulls are in control. Meanwhile, investors are looking towards $GFOX for over 100X gains in the coming months.\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Weekly Recap: Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana...crypto news you shouldn't have missed! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 15 Jan 2024 \u25aa 9 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nWeek after week, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to captivate and redefine the boundaries of digital finance and blockchain technology. This week was no exception, bringing its share of major developments, innovations, and surprises. In our weekly round-up, we dive into the most striking and influential stories that have shaped the crypto ecosystem. From the historic SEC approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, to Standard Chartered\u2019s bold prediction on Bitcoin\u2019s price, to the resilience of Binance Pay in the face of regulatory challenges, the prospects for ETFs for Ethereum and XRP, and the explosion of development activity on Solana, we will review the highlights of the past week.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF: The SEC says Yes!\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made a historic step by finally approving Spot ETFs for Bitcoin. This decision, long awaited by investors, marks a crucial turning point in the history of Bitcoin. Financial giants such as VanEck, Fidelity, and BlackRock now have their pass to offer innovative investment opportunities in Bitcoin. This approval is the result of a change in stance by the SEC, which had previously rejected over 20 proposals for Bitcoin ETFs. A judgment by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia played a key role, challenging the SEC\u2019s previous refusals and paving the way for this new era.\n\nHowever, the impact of this approval on the Bitcoin market was not as spectacular as expected. The price of Bitcoin had already incorporated this news, having seen a steady increase in the preceding weeks. The announcement did not cause a major upheaval in the Bitcoin price but instead led to a significant rise in altcoins. Although the future of Bitcoin with Spot ETFs remains uncertain, it is undeniably promising, clearing the way for further integration into the traditional financial system.\n\nBitcoin at $200,000? Standard Chartered anticipates a big leap\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, a renowned financial institution, forecasts a dramatic increase in the price of Bitcoin, potentially reaching $100,000 this year and doubling to $200,000 by the end of 2025. This bold prediction is based on the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, an event the bank considers a decisive moment for the normalization of institutional investor participation in the Bitcoin market. Drawing a parallel to the impact of the first gold-backed ETF, the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), on the gold market, Standard Chartered examines the potential effects of Bitcoin ETFs on the crypto market. The GLD, launched in 2004, saw an influx of $88 billion in its first year.\n\nThe bank estimates that Bitcoin could see similar growth to gold following the introduction of the GLD, but at a faster pace. Their projections suggest that between 400,000 and 1.3 million bitcoins could be held by ETFs by the end of 2024, representing a value of $50 to $100 billion.\n\nBinance Pay: Triumphs amidst the regulatory storm\n\nIn 2023, Binance Pay has demonstrated impressive resilience and growth despite a challenging regulatory environment. The platform recorded a transaction volume of $77 billion, marking an increase of 71% from the previous year. This remarkable performance is accompanied by a 70% growth in its user base, showcasing the growing adoption of cryptos for payments. Binance Pay has not only successfully navigated through the complex regulatory landscape but has also redefined the possibilities in the realm of cryptocurrency payments. With innovative features and strategic partnerships, Binance Pay has extended its influence across various sectors.\n\nBinance Pay has established itself as a cornerstone of crypto adoption, revolutionizing the financial sector, including by integrating cryptocurrencies into salary payments and loyalty programs. These initiatives have contributed to wider adoption of these assets across various industries.\n\nBitcoin 2024: Between Initial Momentum and Anticipated Decline\n\nMatrixport, an expert company in crypto investment products, predicts a turbulent year for Bitcoin in 2024. In January, Bitcoin is expected to experience an impressive increase of +17%, moving from $42,265 to $49,450. However, this climb would be short-lived. As of March, a significant drop is anticipated, with a -14% depreciation, bringing Bitcoin back to about $36,350. A rapid rise followed by an abrupt decline.\n\nAt the same time, trading signals indicate a short-term weakness for Bitcoin, with an anticipated drop of -7% in the coming two weeks. The always unpredictable Bitcoin continues to capture the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts, promising an eventful year in 2024.\n\nBanking Restrictions on Bitcoin ETFs in the United States\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marked a historical record with a volume of more than $4.5 billion on the first day, involving key players such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Tempelton. However, a surprising development emerged: millions of Americans found themselves unable to buy these Bitcoin ETFs. Major American banks, such as Vanguard, have refused to offer Bitcoin ETFs to their clients, citing the high volatility of Bitcoin as contrary to their goal of generating positive real returns over the long term.\n\nThe refusal of banks to provide access to Bitcoin ETFs has created a distinct divide between wealthy customers and others. Banks like UBS and Merrill Lynch have reserved access to Bitcoin ETFs only for their wealthiest clients, with high investment thresholds. This situation has led to frustrations among ordinary customers, many of whom are choosing to close their accounts with Vanguard. Gabor Gurbacs, an advisor at Tether and Vaneck, suggested that the banks might simply need time to integrate the new ETFs, but the immediate impact of these restrictions remains significant for many American investors.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Ethereum and XRP: Next on the ETF list?\n\nSteve McClurg, the Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Funds, expressed his optimism during an interview with Bloomberg, regarding the imminent approval of Spot ETFs for Ripple and Ethereum following the Bitcoin ETF. This regulatory advance is seen as a major positive signal for the crypto sector and paves the way for broader adoption of financial vehicles directly backed by cryptos.\n\nMcClurg highlights the growing interest of investors to diversify their holdings in cryptocurrencies. He points out the example of Grayscale, which recently added Ripple to one of its publicly traded trusts. These financial vehicles, focused on the general public, make it easier for novice investors to access cryptos. However, McClurg acknowledges that the regulatory approval process remains unpredictable, and nothing is yet fully assured.\n\nSolana: Explosive Growth with 2,500 Active Developers\n\nThe Solana blockchain stands out in the crypto universe with impressive growth, recording a 50% increase in developer retention over the past three months. With over 2,500 active developers monthly, Solana demonstrates the robustness and vitality of its ecosystem. This significant increase, reflecting heightened activity on the network, is a powerful indicator of Solana\u2019s health, which is positioning itself among the biggest crypto blockchains. It\u2019s important to note that these figures focus solely on contributions to public repositories. Concurrently, this growth in developer retention coincides with a spectacular surge in activity on Solana\u2019s crypto ecosystem. The cryptocurrency SOL saw a meteoric rise of 500% between October and December, fueled by the frenzy around MEME coins based on SOL, briefly propelling SOL ahead of BNB in terms of market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite this impressive growth, Developer Report data indicates a downturn in activity on Solana for a period. As of October 1st, the number of developers was only 946, a decrease from the all-time high of 2,634 reached on December 22, 2022. In comparison, the total number of active monthly developers on Ethereum was 4,769 on October 1st, 2023, showing a 22% decrease from its peak of 7,433 reached on June 16, 2022.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of what to remember for this week.

        "content": "Ethereum and BNB are two of the most well known and reputable cryptocurrencies out there. However, the cryptocurrency world is witnessing a remarkable shift as investors from established giants like Ethereum and BNB are now turning their attention to Scorpion Casino, following the announcement of its first top-tier exchange listing date. This pivot highlights the growing appeal of innovative crypto presales and the unique opportunities they present.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are always on the lookout for signs of a bullish trend in the market. After a period of volatility and uncertainty, three key indicators suggest a bull run is on the horizon. In this article, we will explore these indicators and why Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) are poised to lead the charge in the next crypto bull run.\n\nInstitutional Adoption on the Rise\n\nOne of the most promising indicators of a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market is the increasing adoption by institutional investors. Over the past year, major financial institutions and corporations have shown a growing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has gained significant attention from institutional investors. Companies like Grayscale, Galaxy Digital, and others have added Ethereum to their portfolios, recognizing its potential as a store of value and a platform for decentralised applications. Retik Finance, a relatively new entrant to the cryptocurrency space, has also garnered interest from institutional investors. Its innovative approach to bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies has piqued the curiosity of financial institutions looking to diversify their holdings. The influx of institutional capital into Ethereum and Retik Finance is a clear indicator of the growing acceptance and recognition of these cryptocurrencies as valuable assets. As more institutions allocate funds to these projects, it is expected to drive up demand and contribute to a bullish market sentiment.\n\nNFTs and DeFi Ecosystems Thriving\n\nThe explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystems is another strong indicator that a bull run is underway. Ethereum has been at the forefront of both NFTs and DeFi, providing the infrastructure for these groundbreaking innovations. NFTs, which represent unique digital assets, have gained mainstream attention, with high-profile sales of digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate. Ethereum\u2019s robust smart contract capabilities make it the preferred platform for creating and trading NFTs. As the NFT market continues to expand, Ethereum\u2019s value is expected to rise in tandem. Retik Finance also plays a role in this ecosystem by offering DeFi solutions and smart contracts. Its focus on making cryptocurrency transactions and spending more accessible and user-friendly positions it well to benefit from the growing DeFi trend. As DeFi protocols gain adoption and usage, the demand for Retik Finance\u2019s services is likely to increase, potentially driving up the value of its native token.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nStrong Community Support and Development\n\nA thriving cryptocurrency project requires a strong and dedicated community of supporters and developers. Both Ethereum and Retik Finance boast vibrant communities that are actively engaged in the growth and development of their respective ecosystems. Ethereum\u2019s open-source nature has attracted a global community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to its continuous improvement. The Ethereum community is known for its collaborative spirit and commitment to advancing the platform\u2019s capabilities. Recent upgrades like the London Hard Fork, the Ethereum 2.0 transition, and the upcoming Ethereum \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade demonstrate the project\u2019s commitment to scalability and sustainability. Retik Finance, while newer to the scene, has also cultivated a dedicated community of believers who see the project\u2019s potential to revolutionize the financial industry. The ongoing success of Retik Finance\u2019s presale stages and the completion of a Certik audit have further solidified its community\u2019s confidence. The synergy between a strong community and active development is a hallmark of successful cryptocurrency projects. Ethereum and Retik Finance have both demonstrated their ability to harness community support and drive innovation, setting the stage for further growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is showing clear signs of a bullish trend, with institutional adoption on the rise, NFTs, and DeFi ecosystems thriving, and strong community support and development. Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) are well-positioned to lead the charge in this anticipated bull run. Ethereum\u2019s status as a dominant force in the crypto space, coupled with its ongoing upgrades and institutional backing, makes it a frontrunner for significant price appreciation. Retik Finance, with its innovative approach to bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrencies and the support of its growing community, is also poised for substantial growth. Investors and enthusiasts alike should keep a close eye on these two cryptocurrencies as they navigate the exciting and dynamic landscape of the cryptocurrency market. With the indicators pointing towards a bull run, Ethereum and Retik Finance may offer promising opportunities for those looking to capitalise on the next wave of crypto momentum.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "Larry Fink thinks a spot Ethereum ETF has value.\n\nETH rose in dominance on the back of the spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has led to speculation about increased possibilities for other assets to have their spot ETFs, particularly Ethereum [ETH]. The CEO of BlackRock recently expressed this sentiment during an interview.\n\nA matter of when for a spot Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently expressed his perspective on ETFs. He said there is \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF\u201d in a recent CNBC interview following the approval of the spot BTC ETFs.\n\nNotably, BlackRock itself has secured approvals for a spot BTC ETF.\n\nOn the first trading day, the spot BTC ETF recorded a substantial volume of around $4.6 billion. The potential for institutions to pursue a spot ETH ETF is buoyed by the absence of any regulatory issues between Ethereum and the SEC.\n\nUnlike certain exchanges and crypto assets that have faced SEC charges in the past, ETH has had no such issues.\n\nFurthermore, ETH holds the second-largest market capitalization, as per CoinMarketCap. This makes it an attractive asset for institutions to consider offering as an ETF.\n\nEthereum rally cut short post-ETF\n\nAn examination of the daily timeframe chart for Ethereum showed a significant rally leading up to the approval of the spot BTC ETF. The positive trend continued on the first day of ETF trading, approaching the overbought zone.\n\nHowever, this upward trend paused on 12th January, marked by a decline of over 3%. Initially poised to break the $2,700 price range, ETH retraced back to around $2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH was trading at around $2,540, reflecting a slight increase of over 1%.\n\nEthereum takes space in the crypto discourse\n\nAn examination of Ethereum\u2019s social dominance on Santiment showed its dominance in discussions within the crypto space.\n\nOn 10th January, the social dominance rose to over 9.4%. This signified that ETH accounted for more than 9% of the overall discourse in the space. However, as of this writing, the dominance has reduced to around 7%.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe chart showed a noteworthy correlation between the increase in Ethereum\u2019s social dominance and its price increase.\n\nAdditionally, ETH played a key role in leading the broader altcoin rally, further showing its significance within the crypto space."

        "content": "In a week etched in crypto history, the long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in the US sent shockwaves through the market. Yet, despite the monumental achievement, the king of crypto, Bitcoin, took a step back on Saturday, dipping 6% to end the week barely above $43,000.\n\nMany analysts predicted a \u201csell-the-news\u201d scenario, where investors cashed in on profits built upon anticipation of the ETF approval. Others suggest a rotation into Ethereum, which surged 15% on the week and touched highs not seen since May 2022.\n\nEthereum ETF Speculation: Shaping Crypto Narratives\n\nThis speculation is fueled by expectations of imminent Ethereum ETF decisions from the SEC, potentially mirroring the winds that propelled Bitcoin towards a 60% rally in recent months.\n\nAccording to Alex Saunders, a Citi analyst, the cryptocurrency market has transitioned to a new narrative, as Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin. This surge is believed to be driven by anticipation that the second-largest cryptocurrency could receive approval for an ETF.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the crypto market has already moved to the next narrative, with ETH rallying more than bitcoin, likely on the expectation that crypto\u2019s second largest token could also see an ETF approval,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nWhile the immediate price action might paint a contrasting picture, the significance of the ETF launch for Bitcoin\u2019s long-term trajectory remains undeniable. Market participants across the board agree that ETFs will pave the way for increased institutional adoption, a crucial step towards legitimizing Bitcoin as a serious asset class.\n\nBitcoin slightly below the $43K level today. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAnalysts at Citi anticipate \u201cextra prominence\u201d for Bitcoin in diversified portfolios, although widespread inclusion is still some distance away.\n\nThe road to crypto acceptance, however, isn\u2019t paved solely with Bitcoin. Litecoin, often dubbed \u201csilver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u201d emerged as another bright spot this week, on track for an impressive 11% gain. This signifies diversification within the crypto landscape, a trend likely to continue with the potential influx of other crypto ETFs.\n\nBTC 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko\n\nCrypto Equities Shake Amidst Bitcoin\u2019s Slide\n\nBeyond the digital coins themselves, the news wasn\u2019t as rosy for crypto-related equities and miners. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, heavily invested in Bitcoin, took tumbles of 6% and 8%, respectively. Miners, already on the back foot after suffering substantial losses on Thursday, extended their descent, with CleanSpark and Iris Energy experiencing double-digit drops.\n\nThis market snapshot illustrates the dynamic nature of the crypto ecosystem. While Bitcoin might have taken a breather after its historic week, the overall sentiment remains positive. Ethereum\u2019s ascent and the anticipation of broader ETF access signal a shift in investor focus, suggesting a future where the crypto playing field isn\u2019t solely Bitcoin\u2019s domain.\n\nThe dust settles on Bitcoin\u2019s ETF debut, leaving a wobbly king and a market yearning for the next narrative. Ethereum, bathed in its own ETF hopes, gleams like a challenger. In this dance of highs and lows, understanding the evolving stories matters more than chasing fleeting profits. Bitcoin\u2019s wobble may yet be a prelude to a high-flying future. The crypto saga, after all, has only just begun.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Taiko Unveils Latest Testnet \"Katla\" with Multi-Proofs, Paving the Way for Mainnet Launch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Katla is the first testnet using Taiko's Based Contestable Rollup (BCR) design and will serve as the foundation of Taiko's mainnet launch.\n\nNEW YORK, LONDON and SINGAPORE, Jan. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Taiko, an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions provider, today has announced it has launched Katla, their Alpha-6 testnet. This testnet features a new rollup design that supports both optimistic rollup and ZK Rollup, forming the foundation of the mainnet launch in 2024.\n\nTaiko is an Ethereum scaling Layer 2 solution and is developing what is called an Ethereum-equivalent ZK-EVM (Also called a type-1 ZK-EVM by Vitalik Buterin). This scaling solution tries to mimic Ethereum as much as possible: it keeps all of its properties and reuses tools and the broader Ethereum architecture as much as possible, making it extremely developer-friendly. This is in contrast to other ZK-EVMs that change large parts of their codebase, drifting away from the original Ethereum architecture.\n\nTaiko is also a based rollup. This means that Taiko does not have a centralized sequencer and instead relies on Ethereum block builders for transaction sequencing. This approach fully inherits Ethereum's security, liveness, and censorship-resistance.\n\nKatla is laying the foundation for Taiko's mainnet launch, marking a significant step forward for the project. It will very likely be the last testnet before Taiko's mainnet launch in early 2024. It will be testing the innovative Based Contestable Rollup (BCR) design , which blends the advantages of optimistic rollups, such as simplicity and low cost, with those of ZK rollups, known for their security and shorter time-to-finality. This powerful combination results in a rollup architecture that can be embraced by a diverse range of dapps, including those with demanding requirements for high throughput and low cost, such as gaming and web3 social applications.\n\nKatla's standout feature is its ability to upgrade rollups from optimistic to ZK, adapting to changes in technology. This means that as the cost of generating ZK proofs decreases, BCR-based layer 2s can be smoothly transitioned to pure ZK rollups, ensuring long-term suitability. Additionally, Katla simplifies the setup of app-chains within the Taiko tech stack, removing the burden of generating ZKPs for every block for app-chain owners.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Katla pioneers a multi-proof framework, combining different proofs to create a more secure design. This framework aligns with Ethereum's approach to security and reflects the importance of multi-proofs highlighted by Vitalik. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the need for a robust \"multi-proofs\" framework to bolster the security of Ethereum rollups at an earlier time.\n\nKatla is going to play a fundamental role, not only in Taiko's, but also in Ethereum's future. Being the first Ethereum-equivalent ZK-EVM and based rollup, Taiko believes that the launch of Katla, together with its upcoming mainnet launch, will mark a new paradigm in Ethereum scalability and for rollup security as a whole.\n\n\"We are excited to share this latest testnet with our community and partners, aiming to further enhance the scalability and security of the Ethereum network. Taiko is the first Layer 2 to test multiproof solution in a public testnet, aligning with Vitalik Buterin's vision for Layer 2 security,\" said Daniel Wang, CEO of Taiko.\n\nTaiko has had five testnets, each testing out different parts of the protocol. In each of them, Taiko received significant support from tens of thousands of its community members who built dapps, ran their nodes, proposers, and provers, and interacted with the protocol in other ways \u2014 all without anyone's permission.\n\nTaiko has gathered a lot of information and made significant improvements to the protocol throughout the five testnets it has had. Katla will likely be the last testnet Taiko has before its mainnet launch, which is going to look a lot like what it is testing with Katla. But Taiko is still evolving, the next major milestone is Based Booster Rollup (BBR).\n\nAbout Taiko\n\nTaiko is an Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup, scaling Ethereum by supporting all EVM opcodes in a layer-2 architecture that is decentralized, permissionless, and secure. The team has raised 22 million from top-notch investors such as Sequoia China and Generative Ventures.\n\nCision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taiko-unveils-latest-testnet-katla-with-multi-proofs-paving-the-way-for-mainnet-launch-302031101.html\n\nSOURCE Taiko"

While the slump threatened BTC\u2019s upside potential, the big-picture outlook remains bullish as long as $30,000 is not breached.\n\nMeanwhile, technical indicators suggest a stiff tug-of-war between the bulls and bears. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) resists the downside after crossing below the signal line (yellow band). The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator also hint at a transition from green to red, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) teases with a crossover below its signal line (orange band).\n\nIf the bears have their way, Bitcoin price could descend below $40,726, with the fall likely to extrapolate to the $37,800 range. If this level fails to hold as support, the next logical target would be the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, with both the AO and MACD still in the positive territory, the bulls still have a presence in the BTC market. The position of the RSI at 68 also shows there is more room north before consideration of an overbought asset.\n\nBitcoin price could recover, pushing back into the confines of the ascending channel. Enhanced buyer momentum could see BTC flip the midline of the channel into support above the $48,000 psychological level. Such a move would pave the way for Bitcoin price to eye the $50,000 target, 16% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF launch: A turning point or a teething stage?\n\nEthereum price risks bearish takeover as bulls take a breather\n\nEthereum (ETH) price teases with a possible correction after ETH was overbought over the weekend, indicated by the RSI trending above 70. In the aftermath, a pullback could be underway amid buyer exhaustion as the momentum indicator now appears subdued, moving horizontally.\n\nThe bears having their way could see Ethereum price descend 5% to find possible support at $2,388, levels last tested on crypto\u2019s watershed moment, January 10. A break and close below this level could see ETH descend past $2,200 to the $2,135 support level. In the dire case, the PoS token could descend to the $1,935 support, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, with the bulls still in play, evidenced by the green histogram bars of the AO and the MACD above the signal line, the Ethereum price could push north. This could see ETH clear the range high at $2,717.

However, with the RSI below 50 and both the AO and the MACD in the negative territory, the odds favor the downside. With this, Ripple price could descend 5% to test the $0.5442 support.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, considering Ripple price recently tagged the Fair Value Gap (FVG) that extends from $0.4927 to $0.5111, the inefficiency in the XRP market has been filled. With there being no effective pull on Ripple price to the south, the bulls could push the price north.\n\nEnhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price clear the resistance due to the descending trendline, bringing the $0.6500 level in sight as XRP price collects sell-side liquidity residing above the trendline. In a highly bullish case, the payments token\u2019s market value could reach the $0.7000 psychological level, 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price eyes $0.700 despite SEC\u2019s move to subpoena Ripple\u2019s financial statements"

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies dropped on Sunday following the excitement over the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this week.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD -1.23% $42,260 Ethereum ETH/USD -2.48% $2,505 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -0.01% $0.080\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin soared to $46,000 earlier on Friday and spiked to a two-year peak of $49,000 on Thursday as Bitcoin ETFs commenced trading in the U.S. However, the soaring prices proved to be short-lived.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Toncoin TON/USD +10.65% $2.32 Chainlink LINK/USD +6.54% $15.30 Tezos XTZ/USD +6.01% $1.14\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.77 trillion, showing a 1.24% increase in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nStocks ended the week on a positive note, with mixed performance among the major indexes on the closing day.

Any dip of 20% is an opportunity to get in, in my opinion.\"\n\nAccording to pseudonymous analyst Crypto Tony, Bitcoin has hit the $47,000 mark, which he had previously identified as a top due to resistance points. The analyst has taken profits on his long position at $47,000 and is currently observing the market for the next move. Crypto Tony has set his stop loss at $41,000 for his long position.\n\nEthereum is poised to become the next cryptocurrency asset to be listed on a spot market ETF, according to an analysis by IntoTheBlock's Lucas Outumuro.\n\nOutumuro notes that Ethereum has shown significant outperformance compared to Bitcoin in the past few days, especially following the false reports of approval for spot-based BTC ETFs. The head of research at the firm indicates that Ethereum's sudden surge indicates that traders are anticipating the approval of spot market Ethereum ETF applications.\n\n\"Ether has outperformed Bitcoin by over 10% since the initial fake approval of the spot ETF came out on Tuesday. With Blackrock and several other entities having pending applications for Ethereum spot ETF applications, the market appears to be giving it high odds they will pass.\"\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Unsplash.com\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

With these coins having multiple utilities, their demand will increase as the crypto bull cycle gains speed.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, top Ethereum beta coins proved viable long-term investment options since their prices remained stable and bullish despite the turbulence in the market.\n\nBesides disrupting their sectors, $SPONGE, $BTCMTC, $MK, and $LPX have growing communities, positive sentiments, and teams of professionals developing and supporting them.\n\nWith all these projects still in presale, now is the best time to buy and get in early before their values explode exponentially.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nAfter making a weekly close that poses the question of whether bitcoin has now made its top for now, a bounce is probably still on the cards. That being said, ethereum does look a better bet.\n\nAn ugly wick\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nAfter making a new local high of $49,000 last week, the bitcoin price descended around 15%, wiping off a huge $7,500 from that high. The rather long wick that the price left behind looks quite ugly, and is another sign that $BTC could have left its high behind it, and is ready to make a descent.\n\nBitcoin still respecting trend\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nZooming in on $BTC on the shorter daily time frame, it can be seen that the price did dip out of the upward sloping channel, but looks to be climbing back in currently. In addition, $BTC has respected a trend line that goes back to mid-August. These factors could mean that $BTC will go up first.\n\nEthereum a better bet?\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nWith this in mind, even if $BTC does bounce from here, ethereum does look a better bet, at least for the next few weeks. However, for $ETH to start making ground against its $BTC pair, it first needs to surmount the critical resistance at 0.059.\n\nCritical resistances\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nZooming in a bit closer, it can be seen just how important this level is, as it also coincides with a downward trend line. The price has already come up against these barriers and is trying to break through. If $ETH does get through here, and is allowed to consolidate, expect some decent gains against its $BTC pair.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets are always in a state of flux, and Ethereum (ETH), one of the top cryptocurrencies, is under the spotlight. Recent revelations by a trader have brought attention to a major weakness in Ethereum, while a leading analyst predicts a substantial 141% rise in Ethereum\u2019s value. Additionally, we\u2019ll explore the latest updates on Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ), a rising star in the crypto space.\n\nUnveiling the Weakness in Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, known for its smart contract capabilities and versatility, has faced scrutiny as a trader highlights a significant weakness. The weakness centres around Ethereum\u2019s design, prompting the development of Layer 2 solutions to address scalability issues and enhance overall performance.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared an updated roadmap for Ethereum in 2023. The roadmap includes crucial priorities such as implementing the Proof-of-Stake consensus, achieving 100,000 transactions per second, introducing liquid pooling, and simplifying the block verification process. However, no specific timeline was committed to these changes.\n\nOne notable addition to the roadmap is the concept of Single Slot Finality (SSF). SSF aims to finalize blocks of transactions in a single slot, ensuring their immutability. This proposed change involves all validators in endorsing slots and seeks to make Ethereum blockchain changes irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether. SSF is considered a key step in addressing Ethereum\u2019s design weaknesses.\n\nBold Prediction: 141% Rise in Ethereum (ETH) Value\n\nWhile Ethereum grapples with its challenges, a leading trader, Pentoshi, has made a bold prediction. Pentoshi foresees Ethereum\u2019s value surging to $3,400, marking an impressive 141% increase from its current value. Pentoshi\u2019s predictions carry weight in the crypto community due to their historical accuracy, particularly in anticipating Bitcoin\u2019s surge when it was trading between $25,000 and $28,000.\n\nThe anticipation of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) contributes to this optimistic outlook. Major players like Ark Invest and 21Shares have submitted ETF applications for Ethereum, pending approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, Ethereum ETFs could usher in institutional capital, potentially triggering a substantial price rally.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ): A Rising Star in the Crypto Space\n\nAmidst Ethereum\u2019s developments, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) emerges as a promising player in the crypto space. The Rebel Satoshi presale has garnered significant attention, having sold over 100 million RBLZ tokens and raised $2 million. As the presale inches closer to the $2 million mark, Rebel Satoshi positions itself as a compelling crypto investment.\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi leverages one of the most secured blockchains in the crypto space. The project\u2019s smart contracts have undergone scrutiny by a top auditing firm, Source Hat, ensuring their safety and reliability. This is one of the reasons why it is regarded as the best memecoin.\n\nInvestment Opportunity: Why Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ)?\n\nRebel Satoshi presents a unique investment opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. The presale success, coupled with robust fundraising, signifies growing interest in the project. As the presale progresses towards the $2 million milestone, investors are urged to consider Rebel Satoshi as a strategic investment choice.\n\nWith a foundation on the Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi aligns itself with a secure and established blockchain. The audit of the smart contracts by Source Hat further reinforces the project\u2019s commitment to transparency and safety. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, Rebel Satoshi stands out as an investment worthy of consideration.\n\nNavigating the Dynamic Crypto Landscape\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, each development brings both challenges and opportunities. Ethereum\u2019s journey to address its weaknesses, coupled with bold predictions and the rise of projects like Rebel Satoshi, underscores the need for investors to stay informed. For those wondering how to get into cryptocurrency or which crypto to buy today for long-term gains, Rebel Satoshi offers a compelling proposition.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Following the approval of all Spot Bitcoin ETFs yesterday, BTC is set to skyrocket past $100,000 in 2024. As a result, investors will soon be looking for new opportunities to reinvest their ETF gains. Ethereum and Retik Finance present viable diversification choices. The cryptocurrency industry is a dynamic terrain brimming with opportunity. Diversification might be a wise decision offering potentially higher rewards.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The Impact of Recent ETF Approval and Expected Institutional Adoption\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved over a dozen Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is a big deal for Bitcoin and its investors. An ETF is a type of investment that tracks the price of an asset, such as gold or stocks. A spot Bitcoin ETF means investors can buy and sell shares of an ETF that holds actual Bitcoin. This way, they can gain exposure to Bitcoin without buying it directly.The approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF might benefit the Bitcoin market. It may entice more institutional investors, such as banks, hedge funds, and pension funds, to invest in Bitcoin. In the financial markets, institutional investors have a lot of money and power. They can increase Bitcoin\u2019s demand and price, as well as its adoption and acceptability.As adoption grows, so will the price. Bitcoin investors can diversify their gains by investing in other cryptocurrencies. Here are two strong choices.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Rising Star with Potential ETF on the Horizon\n\nEthereum is a prominent cryptocurrency that is used to power a variety of dapps. ETH has attracted the attention of investors and authorities. The idea of an Ethereum ETF is one of the reasons. An ETF is a mutual fund that tracks the price of a particular asset, such as a stock or cryptocurrency. An Ethereum ETF would facilitate the purchase and sale of Ethereum on regulated exchanges. This might raise Ethereum\u2019s demand and value.Another factor is Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge. Ethereum has set new highs in recent days, hitting more than $2,600 per token. This demonstrates Ethereum\u2019s tremendous momentum and devoted community. A third reason is Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve scalability. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle more users and transactions. Ethereum is working on a major upgrade called Ethereum 2.0, which aims to make the network faster, cheaper, and more secure. Ethereum 2.0 will use a new method of verifying transactions, called proof-of-stake.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): A New Player with Promising Features\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is booming, and Retik Finance stands out in this fast-growing landscape.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe crypto market is still quite unpredictable, and there has been a large volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies including standout performers like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. However, Ethereum has remained solid throughout the last week and has now reached the $2,400 price zone.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the controversy over Solana's Bonk token's recent price increase, Meme Moguls is claiming to address fundamental flaws inherent in the use of meme coins, ultimately seeking to rank among the top crypto coins.\n\nEthereum Crosses $2,400 Price Mark; Can It Make It to $2,500 Soon?\n\nThe last time Ethereum (ETH) traded above the $2,500 price zone was in May 2022, but that may change as the ETH price prepares to return to that level. Although it hasn't been a smooth rally since crossing the $2,000 price mark in November 2023 after hovering below the level for more than a year. Regardless, Ethereum has managed to maintain a positive price line, crossing the $2,400 price mark and now seeking to cross the $2,500 price mark after almost two years.\n\nEthereum price is currently trading around $2,434, reflecting a significant price gain of over 87% in the past year, 14% in the last month, and nearly 12% in the last 7 days. This huge increase strongly suggests that the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is mostly positive and has significant potential for both long and short-term investment, ranking it tightly among the top crypto coins to invest in.\n\nBonk Builds Momentum Despite Sharp Downturn From All-Time High\n\nBonk (BONK) faced a lot of criticism after it fell sharply by nearly 100 from its all-time high of $0.00003419. While criticism is unavoidable in the crypto realm, many attributed Bonk's outstanding performance to hype rather than actual utility. This is understandable given that the Solana-based meme coin currently has little to no utility value.\n\nRegardless of the controversial claims, the Bonk coin has been gaining ground and is now just over 50% of the way to its previously established ATH. Bonk's price which is currently hovering around $0.000014 shows a 15% gain in the last month and a 22% increase in the last seven days. If anything, the rising price of Bonk suggests a bright future for the Dogecoin-inspired project.\n\nMeme Moguls Set to Outperform Bonk and Other Meme Coins Upon Launch\n\nUnlike Bonk, and the majority of meme coins in circulation, Meme Moguls aims to introduce actual utility in the space. Essentially, Meme Moguls will function as a meme-backed marketplace where traders can buy and sell meme tokens, as well as engage in different fun and monetized activities within its ecosystem.\n\nNotably, there are two main interactive sections within the Meme moguls ecosystem - a game section where members can engage in activities such as virtual or simulated trade, and a metaverse experience dubbed Moguls World. The latter aims to foster connections among members, while allowing them to mine tokens, participate in liquidity pools, as well as engage in token staking.\n\nAt the core of its operation is the $MGLS token which serves two primary purposes - first, as an in-game currency and secondly as a governance token. This dual functionality not only enhances the utility of the Meme Moguls native asset but also positions it to potentially secure a prominent rank among top crypto coins to consider this year.\n\nCurrently, in stage 4 of its ongoing token presale, the MGLS token is priced at $0.0027, marking a nearly 180% increase from its initial launch price of $0.001. Interestingly, this upward trajectory is attributed to the adoption of a dynamic pricing model, where the token's price progressively increases with each stage of the presale until the project's official launch.\n\nThis unique approach not only provides an easy point of entry for traders but also positions MGLS tokens among the best new cryptos to invest in.\n\nFor more information about the Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale follow the link below:\n\nWebsite: https://mememoguls.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/meme_moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Rebel Satoshi, TRON, and Ethereum Classic: Analyzing the Crypto Trio's Market Dynamics - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "TLDR\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) is racing towards the $0.025 target with a 120% surge already during the presale.\n\nTRON (TRX) is predicted to surge past $0.115 with the ecosystem growing.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) to continue the rally and rise above $35.\n\nAs the market returns to bullish territory, experts have given their picks for the best altcoins to buy. While TRON (TRX) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are already established top altcoins, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) is the latest entrant. Let\u2019s understand what the experts have to say about the best altcoins, $RBLZ, TRX, and ETC.\n\nInvestors Flock Towards Rebel Satoshi Presale For 150% Gains\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi project is built on the ideals of Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto. While it draws its name from the Bitcoin founder, Rebel Satoshi was launched on the Guy Fawkes Night. Rebel Satoshi is designed to challenge the centralized systems and bring a revolution. The Recusant community members of Rebel Satoshi band together and rise against the status quo.\n\nThe $RBLZ token adhering to the ERC-20 standard is the governance token for the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem. Rebel Satoshi will comprise a Rebels Artefact Vault with 9,999 unique NFTs, a staking pool, and a play-to-earn game. The target of Rebel Satoshi is to attain a $100 million market cap for the $RBLZ token.\n\nThe presale of the $RBLZ token has entered the Monarchs Round 4 at $0.022 per token. This is a surge of 120% from the start of the presale for the $RBLZ token. By the end of the presale, early investors will generate a return of 150% when $RBLZ surges to $0.025. Rebel Satoshi will then list the $RBLZ token across major DEXs in February. As a result, experts have termed $RBLZ as one of the best cryptos to buy right now.\n\nTRON Surges Post Dip Amid Listing on Brazil\u2019s Largest Exchange\n\nEven as the market rallied in January, the TRON (TRX) price had been on a downtrend. By January 8, the TRON (TRX) price dropped to a low of $0.101. Since then, however, the TRON (TRX) token has recovered and experienced a jump. This bounce in TRX is a result of growing partnerships for the TRON ecosystem.\n\nOn January 8, TRON published the Ecosytem Expansion and Platform Integration Overview 2023. Coin98 Analytics revealed on January 10 that TRON was the top network in terms of total transactions in 2023. TRON\u2019s token TRX was listed for trading on Brazil\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Mercando Bitcoin on January 11.\n\nAs a result, the TRX token rose by nearly 6% from its January 8 low to $0.107 on January 11. Experts predict this bullishness in the TRX price to continue and expect it to rise above $0.115 going forward.\n\nEthereum Classic Rallies As Market Celebrates ETF Approval\n\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) price has been in accumulation for weeks before dipping to a low of $18.56 on January 8. Amid the price accumulation, Ethereum Classic released a guide on how to run an ETC Node using DappNode on January 4. However, this announcement failed to push the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price upwards.\n\nWith the SEC in the USA approving the listing of Bitcoin Spot ETF on January 10, the market is euphoric. As a result of the euphoria, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price has also witnessed a massive surge. From its low on January 8, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price is up 72% to $31.96 on January 11.\n\nWith the Spiral Network Upgrade for Ethereum Classic (ETC) scheduled for January 31, experts are bullish on ETC. They predict the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price to rise above $35.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Crypto analysts single out VC Spectra (SPCT), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Avalanche (AVAX) as the three best altcoins to invest in the current market. These tokens have received significant attention based on their groundbreaking features and excellent future potential, so let\u2019s explore the details and find out which is the top crypto to buy in 2024.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) provides 900% gains even before the official launch.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) could increase over $50 by the end of 2024.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) could surge above the $60 range by the year\u2019s close.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Takes Precedence as the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is an exciting decentralized hedge fund that offers an extensive selection of viable investment opportunities. Hence, VC Spectra (SPCT) users can delve into numerous tokens and extend their portfolios across various sectors of the broader niche market.\n\nIn addition, VC Spectra (SPCT) holders can take advantage of the platform\u2019s outstanding AI trading systems to obtain advanced expertise and detect the most promising fresh Web3 projects. On the other hand, SPCT possesses a powerful deflationary burn mechanism and brings exclusive access to massive pre-ICO discounts. Furthermore, adopters of the VC Spectra (SPCT) token also receive voting rights for upcoming investment decisions.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s unrivaled real-world utility has inspired numerous prominent experts to embrace SPCT as the best cryptocurrency to buy today. While SPCT is currently available for only $0.077, Stage 5 investors can expect astonishing profits when SPCT soon hits the $0.080 presale target and surges by 900% from the initial $0.008.\n\nThe rewards are bound to get exponentially bigger once VC Spectra launches on major exchanges, so make sure to invest today.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Bulls Expect Rallies Over $50\n\nCrypto experts rank Ethereum Classic (ETC) among the best coins to invest in 2024 due to Ethereum Classic\u2019s position as one of the major players in the overall DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) popularity as an open-source platform for smart contract execution has inspired several market analysts to give a positive Ethereum Classic price prediction.\n\nMore precisely, Ethereum Classic (ETC) bulls believe that ETC could increase over $50 by the end of 2024. For reference, ETC traded at around $25 during the second week of January, meaning that ETC investors could expect over 100% gains.\n\nDespite this optimistic Ethereum Classic prediction, ETC bears warn that the token\u2019s inability to provide users with valuable short-term rewards could lead to a prolonged bearish trend. As for the latest pessimistic Ethereum Classic price prediction, ETC could trade around the $15 range by the end of the year.\n\nAVAX Price Prediction: Could Avalanche Surge Over $60 in 2024?\n\nCrypto enthusiasts praise Avalanche (AVAX) as a good crypto to buy in 2024 due to Avalanche\u2019s rising popularity among dApp developers and the platform\u2019s scalable infrastructure. In addition, Avalanche (AVAX) boasts a cutting-edge Proof-of-Stake mechanism that allows AVAX users to earn excellent staking rewards.\n\nThus, AVAX bulls are convinced that Avalanche is set to continue its positive momentum and surpass the $60 threshold by the end of 2024. For reference, Avalanche (AVAX) traded at around $35 during the second week of January, which means that AVAX holders can expect a substantial 71.42% ROI.\n\nContrary to this positive AVAX price prediction, Avalanche bears claim that holders can expect significant drops over the next AVAX price movements due to the token\u2019s highly increased volatility. As for the latest negative AVAX price prediction, Avalanche could trade at around $25 by the end of the year.\n\nExperts point to VC Spectra (SPCT) as a more viable long-term investment than Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Avalanche (AVAX), so head to the presale right away to claim a momentous bonus on any deposit!\n\nTo learn more about VC Spectra (SPCT), visit:\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

With Aave v3 currently commanding over $5 billion across various lending pools, primarily on Ethereum, this expansion could significantly amplify Aave\u2019s influence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nMoreover, following sufficient community backing, the proposal will advance to an on-chain vote, a pivotal moment in this venture. The outcome could dramatically reshape the DeFi landscape, melding Solana\u2019s robust features with Aave\u2019s innovative lending services.\n\nAs Aave stands on the verge of this major expansion, the decision could herald a new chapter in its journey, further cementing its role as a leader in decentralized lending."

Despite widespread expectations of the ETF approval boosting Bitcoin purchases, the market seemed more eager to sell the news for profit-taking. Currently, Bitcoin is positioned just above its support level of $42,272, and its resistance level of $45,557 is still quite distant. While Ethereum initially witnessed major gains post the spot ETF approval, it now seems to be undergoing some price correction as well. Overall, the market appears to have shifted to a more neutral sentiment after a period of greed.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, noted, \u201cBTC (-1.1% in the last 24 hours) seems to have undergone a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 pressure over the weekend as investors decided to book profits after spot BTC ETFs approvals. Currently trading around $42k, there is a possibility of continued selling pressure for BTC for a few days if it goes lower than $41k. However, the general price trajectory shows a consolidation with a bullish pattern. Amidst mixed views, analysts continue to predict an upward trend with BTC ETFs-induced institutional inflows and long-term investors looking forward to the halving event. In fact, after Blackrock\u2019s spot BTC ETF offering, Larry Fink, the CEO, is now considering an equivalent product for ETH (-2.6%).\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cEthereum has demonstrated a consistent price trend over the past week, maintaining proximity to its recent support levels around $2500. This trend is largely attributed to optimism surrounding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. In contrast, Bitcoin has not observed any significant price surges following the approval of its ETF, which is viewed as a positive indicator. The market has experienced pressure, approaching oversold conditions, as many investors took profits leading up to the ETF approval event.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap fell to $1.67 trillion mark after Bitcoin slipped to $42,000 level due to heavy liquidations of future options. Ethereum, the largest altcoin, is trading around $2,500 mark after it breached $2,600 level last week. The Bitcoin traders liquidated their positions as they were not able to meet the margin requirements as Bitcoin process went up and then retreated in a short span after Bitcoin ETF listings. The market is expected to remain volatile in the coming weeks owing to the macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, the crypto market was quiet with low trading volume. From a technical perspective, BTC experienced a drop to $42,000 levels after reaching a new high at $49,000. Currently, it appears bearish to neutral as it is trading below the 20 EMA Daily. The current level and the $41,000 level are crucial for BTC to maintain; otherwise, a bearish scenario could unfold. ETH has showcased strength relative to BTC in recent days, following a substantial rally. Currently, ETH is consolidating, which is considered a healthy pattern. The key level for ETH is $2,450, and it needs to remain above this level. The local resistance for ETH is at $2,660.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "ETH reclaimed the $2,500 level and its weekly returns stood at an impressive 14.5%.\n\nNearly 66% of all whale positions on ETH were long.\n\nWhile Bitcoin [BTC] proved to be a dampener since the official clearance of its spot ETFs, the focus shifted to Ethereum [ETH], which clocked double-digit gains over the past week.\n\nETH comes to the market\u2019s rescue\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the $2,500 level, and its weekly returns stood at an impressive 14.5% as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWell-known technical analyst Ali Martinez dissected ETH\u2019s weekly trajectory in an X (formerly Twitter) post and its optimistic chances of even reaching $3,400.\n\nRemember that #Ethereum broke out from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart.

According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Coinglass data, the Open Interest (OI) spiked above $8 billion on the 12th of January, the first such occurrence since April 2022.\n\nWhen new money is invested into a coin\u2019s derivatives, it indicates a strong bullish sentiment.\n\nWhales bullish on ETH\n\nMoreover, the number of traders holding long positions exceeded those holding shorts in the past 24 hours, the reading of the Long/Short Ratio chart revealed.\n\nAMBCrypto examined further and turned to Hyblock Capital to ascertain the sentiment of whale investors on ETH.\n\nIt was discovered that nearly 66% of all whale positions were long on Binance as of this writing.

There was a glaring FOMO in the market, with many traders wanting to get their hands on ETH.\n\nThe market sentiment was one of greed, with one day last week experiencing \u201cextreme greed.\u201d Typically, it is assumed that greed drives an asset\u2019s price upward with more buying pressure.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWith Bitcoin spot ETFs now operational, market participants have become hopeful of a spot Ethereum ETF as well.\n\nAround seven companies have applied for the investment vehicle, which would track the spot prices of the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. The final deadline for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF falls on the 23rd of May."

        "content": "After a sideways price action during the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) price closed the week at $41,732. This was the lowest level for the most valuable digital asset in almost four weeks. Ethereum (ETH) price also fell below $2,500 as investor focus shifted to Celestia (TIA), Chainlink (LINK) and SUI.\n\nAt press time, BTC price was fondling with the yearly open of $42,282 after a slight recovery in the Asian session on Monday. Despite the pullback in leading cryptocurrency, the Total 3 market cap was still up 1.22%.\n\nCelestia (TIA) appeared as the pick of the altcoins after making a new all-time high of $19.90 on Sunday. As a result, the market capitalization of TIA crypto hit $3 billion. Chainlink and SUI also experienced increased buying pressure, and both digital assets were up 7% and 1.4%, respectively.\n\nCelestia Price Prediction\n\nIt seems like TIA price has no ceiling as the rally keeps extending. After a brief pullback at the end of last week, the asset turned green again on Monday. The bullish market structure points toward more upside as the bulls target a new all-time high above $20.\n\nThe technical analysis gives a possible Celestia price target of $20.72, which aligns with the 1.618 fib extension level. This target will remain valid as long as the price holds the $17.90 support level.\n\nSUI Price Targets $1.50\n\nAfter perfectly meeting my price target of $1.25, the SUI price is still gaining strength. Despite a negative price action in Bitcoin, the smart contract cryptocurrency has found support at $1.22. If this level holds, I expect a move toward $1.50 in the coming days.\n\nChainlink Price Rises 4% On Monday\n\nAfter a 3.81% pump on Monday morning, the LINK price is up 7% in the last 24 hrs. The bullish pressure suggests a move toward $15.72, which is the next resistance level. A break of this resistance might push it toward the December high of $17.65. However, this move will be invalidated in case of a breakdown below the $14.40 support level.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "FLOKI worth $2.4 trillion staked in 3 months: What\u2019s going on? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The staked amount was nearly 25% of FLOKI\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nOver $350 million worth of TOKEN has been staked.\n\nMore than $2 trillion worth of Floki [FLOKI] tokens have been deposited on the platform\u2019s staking program in less than three months since it went live.\n\nUsers stake FLOKI for yields\n\nAMBCrypto tracked Floki\u2019s official staking portal and noticed around $1.4 trillion deposited on Ethereum [ETH] and a trillion locked up on the BNB Chain [BNB].\n\nThe staked amount equated to nearly 25% of FLOKI\u2019s total circulating supply, meaning that a sizable chunk of the meme coin now lies off-limits for market traders.\n\nThe mad rush to stake coins was driven by Floki\u2019s new asset tokenization platform TokenFi [TOKEN]. The sister project was launched to capture a slice of the growing industry which involves representing real-world assets as tokens on a blockchain.\n\nThe market was anticipated to expand to $16 trillion by 2030.\n\nWhen users stake their FLOKI tokens, they earn TOKEN as a reward. In fact, more than half of TOKEN\u2019s supply was reserved for those who stake their FLOKI tokens for a minimum duration.\n\nThe longer the staking duration, the higher the annual percentage yield (APY) earned. As of this writing, the staking APY for three months was 28.66%, increasing to as much as 91% for a locking period of four years.\n\nTOKEN also gets locked up\n\nTo multiply their yields, users were seen depositing their TOKEN holdings into a separate TokenFi staking program.\n\nAccording to latest stats analyzed by AMBCrypto, over $350 million worth of TOKEN has been staked, accounting for more than 24% of the coin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nLike its sister coin, TOKEN also appealed to users because of the high rewards. The staking APY for locking TOKEN for four years was nearly 79%.\n\nPrices tell a different story\n\nThough both assets scored high on the staking front, the market value didn\u2019t seem to capture this rise.\n\nFLOKI lost as much as 21.22% over the past month and around 11% since the start of 2024, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 FLOKIs worth today?\n\nTOKEN narrated the same story, as it too dropped more than 21% over the month.\n\nWhile it was still early days, the TokenFi factor had the potential to bring a significant chunk of FLOKI\u2019s liquid supply into staking. This could also help in reducing the asset\u2019s volatility, the infamous label attached to meme coins."
