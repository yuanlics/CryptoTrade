        "content": "MEV arises as a function of the overlapping preferences of market participants who transact on a blockchain. MEV is a complex systemic challenge for blockchains with various potential solutions, implementation paths and externalities.\u00b9 Ethereum, and more specifically the public mempool (the set of pending, unconfirmed transactions), has been described as the \u201cdark forest,\u201d a reference to science fiction by Chinese writer Cixin Liu, meaning \u201can environment in which detection means certain death at the hands of advanced predators. In this environment, publicly identifying someone else\u2019s location is as good as directly destroying them.\u201d In this paper, we attempt to illuminate the dark forest by answering the question, what is MEV?\n\nIn the first half of the paper, we define who the MEV participants are, how they capture value, and the serendipitous emergence of Flashbots. Then we will explain the MEV supply chain in terms of how it functioned on proof of work Ethereum and how it functions post-merge, on proof of stake Ethereum.\n\nIn the second half, we examine what types of mitigation and redistribution strategies at the application and consensus layers are being developed by the top researchers in this domain. Finally, we address the existential threat of cross-domain MEV and postulate a conclusion about the MEV end game, ultimately placing users in the privileged position that has been historically occupied by miners.\u00b2"

        "title": "Ethereum price reaches lowest level relative to Bitcoin in 5 months - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The previous six months should have been extremely beneficial to Ether\u2019s (ETH) price, especially following the project\u2019s most significant upgrade ever in September 2022. However, the reality was the opposite: Between Sept. 15, 2022 and March 15, 2023, Ether underperformed by 10% against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH/BTC price ratio on Bitfinex, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC price ratio of 0.068 had been holding since October 2022, a support that was broken on March 15. Whatever the reason for the underperformance, traders currently have little confidence in placing leverage bets, according to ETH futures and options data.\n\nBut first, one should consider why Ether\u2019s price was expected to rise in the previous six months. On Sept.15, 2022, the Merge \u2014 a hard fork that switched the network to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2014 occurred. It enabled a much lower, even negative, coin issuing rate. But more importantly, the change paved the way for parallel processing that aimed to bring scalability and lower transaction costs to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shapella hard fork, expected to take effect on the mainnet in April, is the next step in the Ethereum network upgrade. The change will allow validators who previously deposited 32 ETH to enter the staking mechanism to withdraw in part or in full. While this development is generally positive because it gives validators more flexibility, the potential 1.76 million ETH unlock is a negative consequence.\n\nHowever, there is a cap on the number of validators that can exit; therefore, the maximum daily unstake is 70,000 ETH. Moreover, after exiting the validation process, one may choose between Lido, Rocket Pool or a decentralized finance (DeFi) application for yield mechanisms. These coins will not necessarily be sold on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the recent drop below the 0.068 ETH/BTC ratio has affected investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures recovered from a state of panic\n\nIn healthy markets, the annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% to cover associated costs and risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (\u201cbackwardation\u201d) relative to traditional spot markets, it indicates traders\u2019 lack of confidence and is regarded as a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nDerivatives traders became uncomfortable holding leverage long (bull) positions as the Ether futures premium moved below zero on March 11, down from 3.5% just two days prior. More importantly, the current 2.5% premium remains modest and distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish threshold.\n\nNonetheless, declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nRelated: Lark Davis on fighting social media storms, and why he\u2019s an ETH bull \u2014 Hall of Flame\n\nETH options confirm a lack of risk appetite\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 3, the delta skew crossed the bearish 8% threshold, indicating stress among professional traders. The fear levels peaked on March 10, when the price of Ether plummeted to $1,370, its lowest level in 56 days, although the price of ETH rebounded above $1,480 on March 12.\n\nSurprisingly, on March 12, the 25% delta skew metric continued to rise, reaching its highest level of skepticism since November 2022. It happened just hours before Ether\u2019s price rose 20% in 48 hours, which explains why ETH traders shorting futures contracts faced $507 million in liquidations.\n\nThe 3% delta skew metric currently signals a balanced demand for ETH call and put options. When combined with the neutral stance on the ETH futures premium, the derivatives market indicates that professional traders are hesitant to place either bullish or bearish bets. Unfortunately, ETH derivatives metrics do not favor traders expecting Ether to reclaim the 0.068 level against Bitcoin in the near term.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Ethereum now commands two out of the top 10 market cap spots, after the premiere ETH staking derivative flipped Binance\u2019s stablecoin earlier this week.\n\nLido Staked ETH (stETH) is now worth more than $10 billion, per CoinGecko, eclipsing Binance USD (BUSD), which now has only $8.4 billion in circulation.\n\nBUSD had about double that at the start of the year, ranking it in seventh place, slightly behind XRP.\n\nIts issuer Paxos has faced compounding redemptions after a Wells notice from the SEC claimed the stablecoin represents an unregistered securities offering.\n\nClick play to watch stETH flip BUSD and enter the top 10 | Chart by David Canellis\n\nLike other liquid staking providers, Lido allows ether holders to stake their ETH in return for a separate derivative token, stETH.\n\nStaking directly to the Ethereum blockchain without services such as Lido requires 32 ETH ($56,500) to operate a staking validator node. All staked ether cannot be withdrawn until the network\u2019s next big upgrade, Shanghai, goes live next month.\n\nStETH turns ETH staked via Lido into an immediately liquid asset, which can either be traded on crypto exchanges, lent out or used as collateral for loans across DeFi protocols.\n\nThe token is backed by ether locked in staking, but its price isn\u2019t directly pegged; stETH has wavered from ETH parity at times.\n\nLido also automatically pays stETH holders daily staking rewards passed down from the Ethereum blockchain. There\u2019s currently just shy of 5.6 million ETH ($9.9 billion) staked inside Lido\u2019s protocol (excluding interest), according to Nansen, up 150% from around 2.3 million ETH ($4.1 billion) one year ago. Etherscan shows more than 171,000 wallet addresses hold stETH.\n\nMeanwhile, ether dominance \u2014 which measures how much of the crypto market is ETH \u2014 hovers a touch under 20%, while bitcoin dominance is almost 46%.\n\nEther liquid staking derivatives find product-market fit\n\nIn any case, ether staking derivatives like stETH have exploded in popularity in recent months, making the best of the lengthy lockup periods associated with participating in Ethereum 2.0 consensus.\n\nThe earliest ETH stakers locked their tokens in the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain back in Nov. 2020, when ether was less than $450.\n\nETH has since rallied as much as 1,000%, reaching a high of $4,878 one year after the Beacon contract went live, before dropping 64% to under $1,800 today.\n\nETH goes up and down, but the number of ETH staked in consensus can only increase (for now)\n\nMore than 17.6 million ETH ($31.3 billion) has been staked, representing nearly 15% of the circulating supply overall.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shapella hard fork has been successfully executed on the Goerli testnet, the final test before Ethereum validators can withdraw their ether from the Beacon Chain.\n\nHowever, the journey to this milestone wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) core developer, Tim Beiko, pointed out that some testnet validators failed to upgrade their client software ahead of the Goerli fork, causing delays in processing deposits. He attributed it to testnet validators having \u201cless incentive\u201d to make the upgrade given that the Goerli ETH \u201cis worthless.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1635771385380499456\n\nBeiko remains optimistic that validators will make necessary adjustments before the fork on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade comprises five different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4895 being the most anticipated, as it will push staked ETH from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer, bringing Ethereum one step closer to a fully functional proof-of-stake system.\n\nShapella hard fork to unlock $30b worth of ETH\n\nShapella is set to roll out on the Ethereum mainnet in early April, following delays in preparing the Sepolia and Goerli testnets for the fork.\n\nThis hard fork introduces partial and full withdrawals and unlocks 17.6 million ETH, amounting to over $30 billion at current prices. These funds have been locked up since the launch of Ethereum\u2019s PoS Beacon Chain in December 2020.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will enable phased validator withdrawals, allowing users who have been staking to access their staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\n\n\nThere are 522K active validators on Ethereum, and once the upgrade comes, only ~1.6k-1.8k validators would be able to exit per day pic.twitter.com/ewCvD7u1ER \u2014 ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) March 8, 2023\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Foundation has implemented measures to prevent a flood of ETH from hitting the market. Withdrawals are capped at 0.40% of total staked ETH, with only 2,200 withdrawals processed daily.\n\nTestnets replicate a main blockchain, providing developers with a testing ground to patch bugs before upgrades go live on the mainnet. Goerli was the third and final testnet to go through such simulations.\n\nThis test was highly anticipated as it has the largest validator set and closely mimics the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s activity. It was also the final opportunity for staking providers to test the correct processing of staked ETH withdrawals before the upgrade went live.\n\nEthereum developers will convene for their biweekly call on March 16 to set a date for the mainnet Shanghai upgrade. During the last biweekly call, Ethereum developers discussed a target date for early April, a slight deviation from their initial timeline of March.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Over the past trading sessions, Ethereum has managed to appreciate and topple over the $1,600 price zone. At the moment, the altcoin might be displaying consolidated price action.\n\nIn the past week, the coin has jumped by nearly 8%, which has made ETH breach a crucial resistance level of $1,430. It has now turned that level into a support zone. On the daily chart, the Ethereum price also formed a bullish pattern. The technical outlook of Ethereum pointed out that the bulls were taking charge of the price action. Demand for the altcoin had also moved north.\n\nThe buying pressure had noted a downtick but was still bullish. Accumulation also noted a positive change as a result. If the bulls witness a further increase in demand, ETH could break past the $1,700 mark. The market capitalization of the altcoin also increased over the last 24 hours, which indicated that buying strength also shot up.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\n\nETH was trading at $1,686 at the time of writing. After piercing through the $1,430 mark, the altcoin continued to break past multiple resistance levels. The overhead price ceiling stood at $1,700, breaching which the coin can witness resistance at $1,770 respectively.\n\nThe crucial support line for Ethereum stood at $1,560. But a fall through this level will cause ETH to fall below $1,430. The bullish force seems to have taken over, although the rally could be short-lived.\n\nEthereum formed the bullish megaphone pattern, which is also called the broadening pattern that highlights volatility.\n\nIn this case, the pattern signifies the presence of higher highs and lower lows, which means that the altcoin was bullish. The amount of ETH traded in the last session remained positive, implying positive buying strength.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAfter being stuck inside the bearish zone, demand managed to move into the positive zone over the last few trading sessions. The Relative Strength Index was above the 50 mark and was parked near the 60-mark, indicating that buyers outnumbered sellers.\n\nThe indicator noted a small downtick, it is crucial that demand climbs on the chart further if ETH has to trade near $1,800.\n\nIn accordance with increased demand, ETH moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line as buyers started to drive the price momentum in the market.\n\nOther technical indicators have also pointed towards a bullish force. Moving Average Convergence Divergence which measures the price momentum and reversal depicted in green signal bars is reflected due to buying signals on the chart.\n\nParabolic SAR indicates the price direction and the change in the same. The dotted lines were below the candlesticks which meant that the price was moving on the upside.\n\nFeatured Image From UnSplash, Charts From TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

I look at the chart. The chart looks great. It feels like we\u2019ve just had this nice kind of month-long correction. I am looking at the ETH [chart], but you can use any of the charts. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s just going to trigger this. I then went back and looked at all the other previous pick-ups from the low and then versus stuff like Amazon back in 2003-04. I look at all of this stuff and normally it always goes higher and faster than people expect. And then corrects.\u201d\n\nPal sets price targets of between $2,000 to $3,000 for an Ethereum run to the upside. However, he says the price of ETH could go even higher since Ethereum is burned when used in transitions, making it more scarce.\n\n\u201cIt could be anywhere between $2,000 and $3,000. Let\u2019s call it that. It could be even higher. I don\u2019t know. Because there are a lot of mechanics in ETH which is very lopsided because of the burn. The more people come into the network, the less ETH is around. I think it might become a problem for ETH, but it\u2019s going to give it a lot of upside volatility.\u201d\n\nPal says Ehtereum may go on an unexpected V-shape recovery.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk of a V-shape up.

        "content": "Uncover the fascinating story behind Ethereum\u2019s eccentric mastermind, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency that has been making headlines for its unique technology and the innovative minds behind it. But, what sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies is the mind behind its creation, Vitalik Buterin. In this article, we will explore the peculiar mind behind Ethereum and how it has revolutionized the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nIntroduction\n\nVitalik Buterin was interested in the political and economic implications of technology and spent much of his free time researching the subject. When he was just 17 years old, Buterin became interested in Bitcoin, and he started writing articles and blog posts about the subject.\n\nIn 2013, Buterin dropped out of college to work on Bitcoin full-time. However, he soon realized that Bitcoin's technology was limited, and it could not support the creation of decentralized applications. This realization led Buterin to develop the idea of Ethereum, a decentralized platform that could support the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nDevelopment Of Ethereum\n\nButerin's quirky mind was essential in the development of Ethereum. He could see a day in which the blockchain might be utilized for more than simply monetary transactions. His unique perspective allowed him to see the potential for Ethereum to be used in a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare to social media.\n\nButerin's vision for Ethereum was not limited to its technical capabilities. He also envisioned a decentralized world where power was distributed among the people, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. This vision aligned with the principles of the cypherpunk movement, which sought to create a world where privacy, security, and individual freedoms were prioritized.\n\nIn 2016, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack caused a significant setback for Ethereum. The hack resulted in the loss of over $50 million worth of ether, and it raised questions about the security and reliability of the platform. But Buterin's mind was not deterred, and he worked tirelessly to fix the vulnerabilities in Ethereum's code.\n\nEthereum is already one of the world's most widely used cryptocurrencies, and it has cleared the road for the creation of decentralized apps. The framework has been utilized for a variety of purposes, including decentralized finance and non-fungible coins (NFTs).\n\nEthereum As We See It Today\n\nToday, Ethereum is a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem that has become a hub for decentralized applications and smart contracts. In this article, we will explore Ethereum as we see it today and its impact on the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The platform's native currency, Ether (ETH), is used to facilitate transactions on the network, and it has become a popular investment option for cryptocurrency traders and investors.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi refers to financial applications built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that allows for peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for intermediaries. To address these scalability concerns, Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe upgrade will introduce a new consensus mechanism, known as proof-of-stake, which is expected to increase the network's transaction throughput and reduce transaction fees. The platform has become a hub for decentralized applications and smart contracts, and it has paved the way for the rise of DeFi and NFTs.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, such as scalability, the platform's potential for innovation and development remains vast. With the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the future of Ethereum looks bright. To easily trade Ethereum, go to Tesler.\n\nVitalik Buterin's Health And Its Effect On The Development Of Ethereum\n\nButerin has dealt with health issues since he was a child. He was diagnosed with asthma, which caused him to miss school and spend much of his time at home.\n\nDespite his health issues, Buterin continued to excel in his studies, and he was accepted into the University of Waterloo's computer science program when he was just 18 years old. However, Buterin's health issues persisted, and he eventually dropped out of college to focus on his work with Bitcoin and later, Ethereum.\n\nButerin's health issues have impacted the development of Ethereum in several ways. One of the most significant ways is by forcing him to take breaks and step away from his work. In a 2017 interview with Wired, Buterin explained that he had to take a break from Ethereum development in 2016 due to exhaustion and burnout. He also revealed that he had been struggling with insomnia and other health issues that impacted his ability to work.\n\nDespite these challenges, Buterin has continued to lead the development of Ethereum, and his work has revolutionized the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond its technical capabilities, and he has envisioned a decentralized world where power is distributed among the people. This vision aligns with the principles of the cypherpunk movement, which seeks to create a world where privacy, security, and individual freedoms are prioritized.\n\nEffects Of Vitalik Buterin's Autism On Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has publicly disclosed that he is on the autism spectrum. While autism has been traditionally viewed as a hindrance in many aspects of life, it can also bring unique talents and strengths.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of autism is a strong focus on one's interests and an ability to hyper-focus on a particular topic. This intense focus and dedication can lead to exceptional skills and expertise in a particular area. Vitalik Buterin, his focus and dedication have been on computer science and mathematics, which has led to the creation of Ethereum. Buterin's understanding of these fields has been critical in the development of Ethereum, as the platform requires a deep understanding of cryptography, distributed systems, and game theory.\n\nAnother characteristic of autism is a preference for routine and structure. For Buterin, this preference for structure has been evident in his work on Ethereum. He has been vocal about his desire for Ethereum to follow a clear and structured roadmap, and he has advocated for the use of formal verification to ensure the platform's security and reliability. This preference for structure has been essential in the development of Ethereum, as it has helped ensure that the platform remains secure and reliable.\n\nAutism can also bring challenges in social interaction and communication. However, in the case of Buterin, his communication style has been an asset in the development of Ethereum. His writing and speaking style are known for their clarity and precision, which has been critical in communicating the complex ideas behind Ethereum to a broader audience. Additionally, Buterin's ability to think outside the box has led to innovative solutions and new ideas in the development of Ethereum.\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn conclusion, Vitalik Buterin's peculiar mind was instrumental in the development of Ethereum. His unique perspective allowed him to see the potential for blockchain technology beyond currency transactions, and he envisioned a world where power was distributed among the people. Buterin's vision has revolutionized the world of cryptocurrency, and it has paved the way for the development of decentralized applications.\n\nVitalik Buterin's intense focus and dedication, preference for structure, and innovative thinking have been critical in the development of the platform. While autism can bring challenges in social interaction and communication, in the case of Buterin, his communication style has been an asset in the development of Ethereum. The unique talents and strengths that autism can bring are a testament to the importance of diversity and inclusion in the development of technology."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCEO of Ark Invest Cathie Wood has posted a thread on her Twitter handle to comment on the instability of the banking system that has shown itself recently. She pointed out that the two leading cryptocurrencies rose in price on that.\n\nElon Musk, tech billionaire and boss of several leading companies, including Twitter, joined the discussion in the comments.\n\nSlamming regulators for blocking crypto platforms\n\nCathie Woods stated that while the U.S. banking system seized up, the two major cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other digital currencies on the market took advantage of that and \"didn't skip a beat.\"\n\nWhile the US banking system was seizing up in response to bank runs threatening regional banks, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto networks didn\u2019t skip a beat. Instability in the banking system threatened stablecoins, the on-ramps to DeFi, in stark contrast to regulator rhetoric https://t.co/r5xwC96Pdj \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 15, 2023\n\nBitcoin reached an impressive local peak, exceeding the $26,000 level for a short while, rising over 17% this week. It was followed by a 5% drop. Ethereum price has surged 20.26% too since the weekend, hitting $1,776, but it is now down to the $1,689 level.\n\nHowever, Woods mentioned, the instability in the banking system as three major (and crypto-friendly) banks went down, two of them bailed out, produced a threat to the USDC stablecoin. It also impacted TUSD, BUSD and USDP.\n\nElon Musk steps in, supporting Woods\n\nAlso, prior to the crisis beginning, the SEC regulator sued Kraken and Gemini exchanges for their crypto lending service, and the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against KuCoin exchange, claiming that Ethereum is a security.\n\nRather than attacking those \"decentralized, transparent and well-functioning\" financial platforms that have no central point of failure, Wood believes, the regulators should have dealt with the weak points in the traditional banking system. The clear signs of a crisis there have been looming and are similar to the crisis in the 1920s, Wood noted, perhaps referring to the Great Depression that hit the U.S. in 1929.\n\nTwitter chief Elon Musk commented that the situation with banks is now very similar to that back in 1929.\n\nLot of current year similarities to 1929 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 15, 2023\n\nRobert Kiyosaki on fall of three top banks\n\nThe three aforementioned banks are Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. All three of them had cooperated with crypto companies like exchanges. Signature Bank also worked with Paxos, the issuer of the BUSD and USDP stablecoins. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also made a statement on Twitter to say that the company had small exposure to Signature Bank. The failure of the latter, however, will not impact Ripple's daily transactions.\n\nAs reported by U.Today over the weekend, prominent investor and writer Robert Kiyosaki predicted the collapse of Signature Bank on Saturday, saying that two major banks have crashed and the third one is ready to follow in its footsteps. He did not specify exactly what bank it would be."

Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nThe financial sector in the United States has been rocked by the failure of many banks and financial institutions in the previous week, notably Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank. In response, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) value jumped from a low of $19,736 last week to its current level of $24,835, carrying the broader crypto market up with it.\n\nFor instance, Ethereum (ETH), the leading smart contract platform and second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap fortunes, now look bullish after rebounding from last week\u2019s low of $1,379 to regain support at $1,600 as it tests resistance at $1,700 midway through the month.\n\nHowever, despite the bullish turn of events, according to the 1,565 community votes cast by the members of the crypto tracking platform CoinMarketCap by press time, ETH is set to change hands at an estimated average price of $1,560 by March 31, a decrease of -7.67% or -$129.58 to ETH\u2019s current price, as per data retrieved on March 14.\n\nETH end of March price estimation. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nIt is also important to note that the projections of the crypto community for Ethereum over the last six months have had a historical accuracy of 87.72%, making them a suitable alternative to the price estimates made by the artificial intelligence (AI) platforms that have set a slightly lot lower Ethereum price for the same period at the price of $1,529 by March 31.\n\nETH estimation accuracy. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nDue to the Ethereum Shanghai update, the roughly $28 billion worth of ether that has been staked will begin to become accessible in a few weeks. This supply, which at this time is unable to be withdrawn or sold, will be progressively returned to the public markets, which will affect the price of Ethereum. With that being said, crypto trading analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum whales continue to buy up ETH during the recent market dip:\n\n\u201cEthereum whales with 1,000 to 10,000 $ETH added around 400,000 ETH to their holdings in the recent crypto market dip, worth around $600,000,000.\u201d\n\nETH March whale purchases.

        "content": "Web3 URLs \u2014 enabled with the launch of ERC-4804 \u2014 have made it onto Ethereum, allowing internet users to access Ethereum applications and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) without worrying about centralized censorship.\n\nThe new Ethereum standard, titled \u201cWeb3 URL to EVM Call Message Translation,\u201d was first proposed on Feb. 14, 2022, and was co-authored by ETHStorage founder Qi Zhou, Ethereum researcher Sam Wilson, and Chao Pi.\n\nIt described the proposal as an \u201cHTTP-style\u201d URL to directly access on-chain Web3 content, such as decentralized applications (DApps) front-ends and NFTs. More than a year later, ERC-4804 was approved and finalized on the mainnet on March 1.\n\n1/n, I am delighted to announce that the first web access protocol for ETH ERC4804: Web3 URL is approved by EIP editors and finalized!\n\n\n\nweb3:// (https://t.co/uXpTGdXirF) is decentralized http://. It allow users to directly browse the rich web content on EVM, pages/images/songs! \u2014 Qi Zhou (@qc_qizhou) March 1, 2023\n\nAnthurine Xiang, a spokesperson for layer-2 storage protocol ETHStorage, explained that in many cases, the ecosystem still relies on centralized web servers to access \u201cdecentralized\u201d apps.\n\n\u201cRight now, all the DApps like Uniswap [...] claim to be decentralized apps,\u201d Xiang explained, adding: \u201cBut how [do] we get on the webpage? You have to go through the DNS. You have to go through GoDaddy. [...] All those are centralized servers.\u201d\n\nGraphic explaining how the new model compares to Web2. Source: w3eth.io\n\nToday, most users access the internet via \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol,\u201d widely known as HTTP.\n\nWhen an internet user clicks a link or types in a website address, the computer uses HTTP to ask another computer to retrieve the information, such as a website or pictures.\n\nUnder ERC-4804, internet users have the option to type in \u201cweb3://\u201d (as opposed to \u201chttp://\u201d) in their browsers to bring up DApps such as Uniswap or on-chain NFTs directly. This is because the standard allows users to directly run a query to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nFlow chart explaining how Web3 URL standard works with Uniswap. Source: w3eth.io\n\nEntire websites can theoretically be accessed by these means as long as their content is stored on the Ethereum blockchain or a compatible layer-2 protocol. However, the costs of doing this are still very prohibitive, according to ETHStorage founder Qi Zhou.\n\n\u201cThe critical issue here is that the storage cost on Ethereum is super, super expensive on mainnet,\u201d Zhou said in a recent presentation at ETHDenver.\n\n\u201cFor example, 1 Gigabyte of on-chain data will cost roughly $10 million. [...] That is unacceptable for a lot of Web2 applications and even a lot of NFTs,\u201d Zhou added, noting that layer-2 storage solutions could help mitigate some of the costs.\n\nXiang suggested that, given the costs, the new URL standard makes sense only for specific applications.\n\n\u201cNot everything needs to go decentralized. If you are running a pretty good Web2 business and you don\u2019t have to worry too much about centralized censorship. [...] You can just go for that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the new standard would be useful for DApps or websites at risk of censorship, with Tornado Cash as an example.\n\n\u201cFor example, for Tornado Cash, a lot of people can\u2019t get to them through their website because there\u2019s censorship,\u201d Xiang explained.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a DApp and you\u2019ve already been decentralized, why are you still using a centralized website for people to get access to you?\u201d\n\nExample of websites that are able to be accessed via web3:// URL. Source: w3eth.io\n\nAsked whether the new standard could be leveraged by bad actors to partake in illicit activity, Xiang said:\n\n\u201cThis is really hard to say just like how Bitcoin was founded. I think Bitcoin was not born for evil, but still, in the beginning, people [were] doing shady things like the Silk Road, they had been using Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nInstead, Xiang believes, like Bitcoin, they\u2019re just giving people a decentralized option they may not have otherwise.\n\nThe new Ethereum standard is the first of its kind for the blockchain, noted Xiang, though it\u2019s not the first solution to decentralized web hosting.\n\nRelated: How to host a decentralized website\n\nThe InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an example of a network created to do through decentralized means, what centralized cloud servers currently provide. However, Xiang noted that an IPFS URL can only link to static content, which can\u2019t be amended or changed.\n\nI *use* IPFS to store my blog. It has serious UX issues (took ~1h for my last update to propagate). Sticking the blog on-chain would have been way easier.\n\n\n\nFor blogs, that's unfortunately too expensive, but for short text records the logic applies. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 27, 2022\n\nERC-4804 will allow for \u201cdynamic data,\u201d such as allowing people to leave likes and comments and interact with content on a website, explained Xiang. Being Ethereum native, the standard is also expected to be able to interact with other blockchains much easier, Xiang added."

        "content": "The popularity of OpenAI\u2019s text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT has reinvigorated the public\u2019s interest in the underlying technology due to its utility in multiple areas, and one cryptocurrency exchange executive has decided to test its abilities in finding flaws in Ethereum (ETH) smart contract.\n\nSpecifically, Conor Grogan, director of crypto trading platform Coinbase, has dumped a live Ethereum contract into the newest version of the popular chatbot, GPT-4, and it highlighted multiple security vulnerabilities and surface areas where the smart contract could be exploited, as he said in a Twitter post on March 14.\n\nAdditionally, Grogan posted screenshots of the AI bot\u2019s analysis, which indeed seem to show that ChatGPT is capable of correctly identifying critical issues and vulnerabilities, as it concluded that the analyzed smart contract \u201cshould not be used, as it contains critical vulnerabilities and is based on an illegal scheme.\u201d\n\nI dumped a live Ethereum contract into GPT-4.\n\n\n\nIn an instant, it highlighted a number of security vulnerabilities and pointed out surface areas where the contract could be exploited. It then verified a specific way I could exploit the contract pic.twitter.com/its5puakUW \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) March 14, 2023\n\nRegurgitating available data?\n\nThat being said, some disagreement arose in the comments regarding whether the new version of the AI tool was able to discover these smart contract vulnerabilities on its own or was just highlighting old information about it already available online.\n\nIndeed, Grogan did specify that the contract in question was hacked in 2018 using the flaws that the AI tool was pointing out, which led several commenters to state it was simply listing the issues that had already been made public before its training data cutoff in September 2021, and that it might not be as accurate with an unseen smart contract that was never exploited before.\n\nJust bear in mind that GPT-4 is aware of this exact contract, that it was hacked in 2018 and how.\n\n\n\nIt might not be so accurate if you give it a smart contract that it's never seen before, or has never had the exploit shared publicly before. \u2014 TwoBags \u26e9 (@ItsTwoBags) March 14, 2023\n\nRegardless of whether ChatGPT was able to dig out the vulnerabilities in the smart contract on its own or was just regurgitating the information already available online, its capabilities are still significant and potentially useful in auditing smart contracts, as well as in other areas in the cryptocurrency sector, such as in making educated guesses about the future price of cryptocurrencies like Polygon (MATIC).\n\nThat said, some critics, including Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, have expressed their views that ChatGPT may be biased in discussing certain topics that are considered controversial, which has allegedly led Musk to start contemplating the possibility of creating a ChatGPT alternative as he joked about the need for \u201cTruthGPT.\u201d"

If the validator chooses to do so, they can withdraw the entirety of their 32 ether and earned rewards and enter an exit queue.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation notes that the size of the exit queue will vary depending on the size of the validator set in the network, to ensure that there is a limit rate of exit and entry into the beacon chain validator set.\n\nHowever, Blockworks Research analyst Dan Smith expects most of the resulting sell pressure to be limited to the first few days following the mainnet rollout, and other analysts see the upgrade being perceived as a significant de-risking for the Ethereum network.\n\nVance Spencer, co-founder at Framework Ventures, told Blockworks that a successful mainnet Shapella would be \u201creally important\u201d for any institutional players interested in jumping into the Ethereum ecosystem, but have so far been hesitant due to their inability to unstake ETH as it stands.\n\n\u201cIt appears that things went smoothly yesterday with the Goerli Shapella upgrade, and withdrawals are now being processed on Goerli testnet without major hiccups,\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m optimistic about the schedule, I think we all have to remember that there\u2019s still a month of testing left, and even if there are no significant problems, it\u2019s also still possible that major service providers could also cause delays if they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be ready in time.\u201d\n\nUpdated March 15, 2023 at 3:45 pm ET: Added comment from Vance Spencer.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Shapella hard fork has been executed on the Goerli testnet \u2014 the last test run before Ethereum validators will be able to withdraw their Ether (ETH) from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThere were, however, issues with the hard fork. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko noted that while deposits were being processed, the process didn\u2019t run as smoothly as it could have because several testnet validators didn\u2019t upgrade their client software before the Goerli fork.\n\nDeposits are being processed (https://t.co/CxYtPcGMCp), but it seems like several validators haven't upgraded. Looking into it\n\n\n\nOne challenge with testnet validators is that given the ETH is worthless, there's less incentive to run a validator/monitor it. \u2014 timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) March 14, 2023\n\nHe blamed it on testnet validators having \u201cless incentive\u201d to make the upgrade given that the Goerli ETH \"is worthless\u201d but expects validators to make proper adjustments ahead of the fork on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum researcher \"terence.eth\" explained that it took 15 epochs for Shapella to be forked onto the Goerli testnet because network participation was below the two-thirds threshold:\n\n15 epochs later, Goerli has finalized.\n\n\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the Client software. We just had to get the offline operators to upgrade. It was a good stress test.\n\n\n\nOn to the next one. Mainnet! https://t.co/s573n5pC9f \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) March 15, 2023\n\nThrough Ethereum Investment Proposal EIP-4895 staked ETH from the Beacon Chain will be \u201cpushed\u201d to the execution layer.\n\nWhile the Shapella upgrade comprises five different EIPs, EIP-4895 has been by far the most anticipated as it moves Ethereum one step closer to a fully functional proof-of-stake system.\n\nShapella is expected to take effect on the Ethereum mainnet in early April following a few delays in preparing the Sepolia and Goerli testnets for the fork.\n\nThe hard fork will allow for partial and full withdrawals, and will theoretically unlock 17.6 million ETH when Shapella is forked, which equates to over $30 billion at current prices.\n\nHowever several mechanisms are in place to prevent a flood of the ETH supply from hitting the market, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will enable phased validator withdrawals, allowing users who have been staking to access their staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\n\n\nThere are 522K active validators on Ethereum, and once the upgrade comes, only ~1.6k-1.8k validators would be able to exit per day pic.twitter.com/ewCvD7u1ER \u2014 ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) March 8, 2023\n\nThe number of withdrawals allowed within a 24-hour period will only represent about 0.40% of the total staked ETH because only an approximate 2,200 withdrawals can be processed per day.\n\nRelated: Ethereum Shanghai upgrade could benefit liquid staking providers and cement ETH's layer 1 dominance.\n\nThis is because, in most cases, a maximum of 10 validators can be assigned to an epoch and it takes approximately five or six minutes for an epoch to be processed.\n\nIf each of the 2,200 validators withdraws the full 32 ETH staked per day it would only account for about 70,000 ETH \u2014 a fraction of the 17.6 million staked.\n\nThe execution on Goerli was shared in a March 15 live stream by EthStaker on YouTube."

        "title": "Will Ethereum 2.0 Kill Mining? \u2013 Robotics & Automation News - Robotics and Automation News",
        "content": "Therefore, as a mine, you are considering mining Eth 2.0. You\u2019ve been hearing a lot of excitement about it, so you\u2019re interested to find out whether it\u2019s worthwhile for your money and your time.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of mining Ether 2.0 in this post so you can decide for yourself. Furthermore, ether Systems, a stock exchange, enables ethereum code to carry out their operations immediately.\n\nHow Ever will Mining Be Affected by Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum will undergo a significant update in 2020 called Serenity, often known as Ethereum 2.0. By safeguarding the database and authenticating transactions, miners run and maintain a Cryptocurrency.\n\nThey get Ether, the commodity that underpins Ethereum, in exchange. Because it will enable nodes other than miners to verify and conduct trades, Ether 2.0 will render mining obsolete.\n\nIn addition, it will eliminate the need for miners to contribute by lowering the amount of processing power and bandwidth needed to maintain the Ethereum network.\n\nThough this may be terrible news for miners, Ether 2.0 has several potential advantages. For instance, Ethereum 2.0 will allow miners to validate transactions more quickly and get more rewards.\n\nAdditionally, it will enable them to generate a new revenue stream by offering their computer capacity for sale to other users in the network.\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s Benefits for Mining\n\nWhat benefits does Ethereum 2.0 provide miners, then? One is that mining is done in a far more effective manner. The new PoS technique is intended to enable mining with far less technology, reducing the need for power.\n\nAdditionally, it implies that miners will indeed be able to extract minerals more effectively, allowing them to reap greater returns for their labourers.\n\nBecause of how much more attack-resistant the algorithmic program is, producers will be more likely to forfeit their rewards or income. The third feature of Ethereum 2.0 is its increased scalability.\n\nAs a result, the network will be able to process more payments at once, making it quicker and simpler to use. The advantages of this will be significant for both individuals and enterprises.\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s Drawbacks for Miners\n\nThe second drawback of Ethereum 2.0 is that it will take more time to execute transactions, from ten min to 3 minutes on average. It is because Bitcoin 2.0 will utilize a slower consensus process called Piece of Stake (PoS) compared to the one it now uses, termed Formal verification (Pow).\n\nSome people consider this a positive development since it will make Ethereum 2.0 more secure and egalitarian. However, miners will have to wait much longer to get paid for their labour, making it less desirable for them.\n\nUsers will cut the block incentives the miners will earn with Ethereum 2.0 in half, which brings us to the final and third disadvantage. As a result, they will only get 1.5 ETH for each brick they mine rather than the usual 3 ETH.\n\nAlthough it may not seem like a significant concern, the fact that mining requires buying things (in the form of power bills) means that mines will either have to accept lesser earnings or find a method to reduce their expenses.\n\nThe Miners\u2019 Opinion on Ethereum 2.0\n\nYou undoubtedly want to know what miners think about this whole situation. After all, many individuals may lose their jobs if Ether 2.0 does deal with mining. For several reasons, many miners genuinely support the migration to proof-of-stake.\n\nFirst, proof-of-work is increasingly concentrated, with major powers like Russia holding a significant mining capacity. Decentralization, one of the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies, suffers from this standardization.\n\nSince proof-of-stake eliminates the need for costly mining hardware, anybody with a pc may participate in Ether 2.0. A more decentralized and secure network may result from this.\n\nSecond, actual evidence is using more and more energy. According to an analysis by Gathering important data, Ethereum\u2019s yearly carbon emissions are comparable to that of Las Vegas and will only increase as the network expands. Ether 2.0 will be much more energy-efficient via evidence.\n\nWhat Possibilities Does Ethereum Miner Have in the Future?\n\nIt is due to Ethereum 2.0 possibly switching to a proof-of-stake method, which eliminates the need for mining. What does this entail for miners, then? Well, it may imply that they\u2019ll need to locate another source of income. Or, it can mean they will need to find another source of income.\n\nOf course, Ether 2.0 may either not be deployed in its entirety or will be postponed permanently. In such a situation, miners may exhale with relief and continue their regular work.\n\nBalance Out\n\nSo, will mine disappear as a result of Ether 2.0? It\u2019s difficult to say. On the one extreme, the network changes will significantly reduce the profitability of ETH mining. Conversely, it\u2019s conceivable that the total rise in ETH consumption will balance out the decreasing payouts, allowing miners to carry on making money.\n\nOne thing is for sure: Ethereum blockchain is going through a significant transition, so producers will want to be ready for any possible repercussions. Only the future will reveal whether Ether 2.0 will affect miners.\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n"

        "content": "Whales added 400,000 ETH despite a recent price increment\n\nMore ETH is being circulated although the current vault could be overprice d\n\nLike a ton of assets in the crypto-market, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price jumped over the weekend. Even at press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value maintained a 5.11% hike in the last 24 hours. Needless to say, this has brought some calm to the market. Especially since much of it was flashing red over the weekend.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, despite the gains registered on the charts, whales did not seem to be content. As pointed out by Ali_charts, a crypto-analyst on Twitter, addresses holding 1000 to 10000 ETH added $600 million to their holdings.\n\nThe information, derived from Glassnode, revealed that the whales took the action when ETH was still hovering above $1,680 on the charts.\n\nOn the opposite side of ETH\n\nSo, does the accumulation mean ETH still has a tendency to climb further? Well, according to Glassnode, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) signal had a reading of 98.45, at press time. The metric often reflects the 90-day moving average trend of the daily transaction volume, rather than a day-to-day valuation.\n\nCompared to its value in recent times, the aforementioned NVT signal is a high one. And, the last time it was as high was back in February 2020. Hence, it seemed to confirm that investors were pricing ETH at a premium while the market cap\u2019s growth outpaced its on-chain transaction volume.\n\nWhile the aforementioned metric considered ETH as being currently overpriced, more of the altcoin has been in circulation over the last seven days. The circulation shows the number of unique coins that have been used for transactions within a specific period.\n\nAt press time, the seven-day circulation was 3.96 million. This implied that many units of ETH were swirling around the market, despite their numbers falling when compared to the previous day.\n\nThat being said, one metric that has consistently moved north is Active Addresses. This metric measures the number of unique addresses active on a network. With 24-hour active address count of 534,000, the reading implied that many wallets had either received or sent ETH over the last 24 hours.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAlmost equal exchange flow reactions\n\nWhile ETH remains on whales\u2019 radar, activities on exchanges revealed that it has been a close contest for outflows and inflows.\n\nIn fact, according to Santiment, exchange outflows were as high as 28,400. This seemed to underline traders\u2019 temporary market shortage and contribution to an asset\u2019s appreciation.\n\nOn the other hand, the exchange inflows were 24,000. With the difference in favor of the outflows, it means that ETH has a slight chance of foregoing depreciation in the short term.\n\nHowever, traders might still need to be cautious of projection. This, because of several negative developments and contrasting market reactions."

        "content": "HBAR Crypto News: In recent times, the Hedera (HBAR) network, which runs on its proprietary hashgraph technology, has been making bigger headways into the NFT space. As the market grows competitive with the advent of Blur and other NFT marketplaces, Hedera finds itself a prominent music NFT project, Mynt, migrating from Ethereum to its network.\n\nMynt Brings Music NFTs To Hedera\n\nSince the latter half of 2022, the NFT market has been plagued by a significant slowdown in the sale of digital collectibles, which has contributed to the sector\u2019s following descent into the abyss of a bear market. However, this has not slowed down the growth of the Hedera ecosystem, as it continues to stride towards creating and introducing new applications on top of its Hashgraph-powered network.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More: New AI Product Sparks Optimism For Hedera Network\n\nOn Tuesday, Hedera\u2019s development arm, HBAR Foundation, announced the launch of Mynt which acts as a launchpad, incubating new artists into the world of Web3 and providing them with insights to launch and grow successful NFT projects. Mynt chose Hedera over other layer-1 blockchains, due to its commitment of creating eco-friendly NFTs, which the NFT platform utilizes to actively generate new revenue streams for artists and musicians.\n\nAlex Russman, VP at the HBAR Foundation\u2019s Metaverse Fund, was quoted as saying:\n\nThe Mynt team are bringing their industry expertise and artist network to to the Hedera ecosystem around a clear understanding of how Web3 innovation best contributes to the artist journey and fan experience.\n\nHBAR\u2019s Push For NFT Growth\n\nHedera is often chosen as the preferred choice because of the scalable nature of its token service, when it comes to generating NFT collections from the perspectives of speed, security, and fees. On the carbon-negative Hedera network, the cost of minting a collection of 10,000 NFTs is only $78 USD.\n\nAdditionally, University College London (UCL) discovered in their most recent research that Hedera consumes the least amount of energy per transaction of any public distributed ledger technology (DLT) \u2014 using 3300 times less energy than Ethereum and 1000 times less energy than VISA.\n\nIn light of this HBAR crypto news, the price of Hedera (HBAR) is currently exchanging hands at $0.065, which represents an increase of 2.10% over the past 24 hours as opposed to a gain of 4% recorded over the previous seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Silicon Valley Bank Now Under Investigation By U.S. SEC & Department Of Justice"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum Price Prediction For Q2: Big Eyes Coin Becomes Top Earning Crypto With Vault Pin - Atalayar EN",
        "content": "Since there is a limited supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum, considering how they\u2019re becoming more widely used, many experts predict that their prices will increase over the long term. Moreso, having survived the Silvergate crisis, the duo are expected to begin another attempt to bring back the bull run.\n\nGovernment regulations, investor sentiment, and rivalry from other cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) are a few variables that could impact their prices in the near future. In this article, we will make Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions as well as highlight how Big Eyes Coin is becoming a top-earning crypto.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Price Prediction After Silvergate Brouhaha\n\nIn Q2 2023, it's predicted that the price of the biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, will increase as more organisations and individuals choose to use it as a source of value and a hedge against inflation. But there's also a chance that regulatory ambiguity and greater rivalry from other cryptocurrencies will stagnate it or could even push its price lower.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin has shaken off the effects of the Silvergate crisis, gaining close to 9% in the last 24 hours. As Bitcoin makes another attempt to bring back the bull run, experts have predicted that Q2 of 2023 might just signal the return of Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s best days.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Banking on DeFi Ecosystem\u2019s Growth\n\nIn terms of market capitalisation, Ethereum is presently the second-largest cryptocurrency, and its price has historically been quite volatile. Similar to Bitcoin, a number of variables, such as investor sentiment, technical advancements, and competition from other cryptocurrencies, affect the price of Ethereum. The adoption of decentralised applications (dApps) and the expansion of the decentralised finance (DeFi) network, however, makes Ethereum price prediction a bit difficult.\n\nHowever, with more DApps being created on its blockchain and the DeFi ecosystem growing, it's predicted that Ethereum's price will increase in Q2 2023. However, there's a chance that greater rivalry from other smart contract platforms and unpredictability in the regulatory environment will have a negative effect on its price.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Top Earning Crypto \u2018CATs\u2019 Home $31.4m\n\nCat-themed crypto, Big Eyes Coin, has introduced yet another avenue for its teeming followers to earn big on their investments and grow their finances.

        "content": "Sohrab is a passionate cryptocurrency news writer with over five years of experience covering the industry. He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum (ETH) has been making headlines after he recently transferred 200 ETH to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. While trying to sell, investors often transfer their cryptocurrency to exchanges.\n\nThe Ethereum founder used the ETH hoard as collateral on Reflexer to create 150,000 RAI tokens, according to earlier Peckshiled reporting. Then, Buterin traded 132,500 RAI for 378,500 USD Coin (USDC). For 50,000 Dai, the remaining 17,500 RAI were exchanged (DAI). According to PeckShield, the exchange of ETH into the stablecoins USDC and DAI was completed in less than three hours.\n\nEtherscan, a blockchain monitoring service, also recorded the transactions. In order to create 100,000 RAI, Buterin initially sent 200 ETH to Reflexer. Then, Buterin immediately donated 300 ETH to Reflexer to generate 50,000 RAI. According to Etherscan, Buterin spent over $200 to handle both transactions.\n\nIn addition, he had recently sold 9.9 billion CULT tokens, the CultDAO\u2019s native token, for 58 ether (ETH). According to blockchain analyst PeckShield, he also sold his shares in BITE and MOPS. According to Coindesk, the sales totaled 220 ether, which is worth $332,420 at the moment.\n\nBite and the majority of the other coins described in the r/Testingtesting62831 forum were tagged as Buterin as \u201cshitcoins\u201d that have no redeeming cultural or moral significance, and will probably lose most of the money they put into them on March 9. \u201cI strongly oppose these proposals,\u201d he said.\n\nBy selling tokens like Dogelon Mars (ELON) in May 2021, Buterin launched a similar dumping that resulted in reductions in the value of 40% and 90%, respectively. Coming back to Ethereum, after Vitalik Buterin\u2019s most recent remarks about the network, the price projections for Ethereum are optimistic."

Although the epoch did not finalize initially due to low validator participation rates, it did later finalize, as indicated by Arbitrum developer \"Terence. eth.\"\n\n\"15 epochs later, Goerli has finalized. There was nothing wrong with the client software. We just had to get the offline operators to upgrade. It was a good stress test. On to the next one. Mainnet,\" Terence.eth tweeted.\n\nThree testnets were used, with Goerli being the final one to go through the scenario. Given that it has the most validators and most closely resembles the activity on the Ethereum blockchain, this test was the most anticipated of the three.\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum developer, celebrates the historic moment on Twitter. \"Goerli forked,\" he tweeted.\n\nA mainnet launch date has not yet been decided upon, as reported earlier, although Beiko states that it will \"probably\" be decided upon during the March 16 devs meeting, \"assuming things go well on Goerli.\"\n\nAccording to Beiko, the teams advised waiting before any potential mainnet fork for four weeks following the Goerli upgrade, implying that the mainnet hard fork could occur by mid-April."

        "content": "America\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange is expecting a flood of staking withdrawal requests after Ethereum developers enable the functionality next month.\n\nWhile providing details about how the upgrade will impact the business on Wednesday, Coinbase said it could take \u201cweeks to months\u201d for unstaking requests to be fully processed.\n\nShapella is Coming\n\nIn a blog post on the matter, Coinbase explained that the upcoming Shanghai and Capella upgrades (collectively known as Shapella) will allow Ethereum users to unstake their Ether (ETH) for the first time since the Beacon chain launched in 2020.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s execution layer officially \u201cmerged\u201d with its beacon chain in September 2022, stakers holdings remained locked up. This has created a temporary situation in which staking providers like Coinbase can allow users to stake ETH on their platform \u2013 but not to withdraw it.\n\nHowever, after Ethereum completed its Goerli testnet upgrade on Tuesday, the official Shapella rollout is expected by roughly mid-April.\n\n\u201cUnstaking requests will open to all Coinbase customers at the same time and will be relayed to the Ethereum protocol and queued based on when they are received,\u201d wrote Coinbase. As the firm notes, staking requests are processed on-chain, and only acts as a \u201cconduit\u201d to pass unstaked ETH to customer once released by the protocol.\n\nUnstaking requests will be made available from users\u2019 Coinbase accounts about 24 hours after the upgrade is complete. After the request, customers can still expect to be waiting a while.\n\n\u201cCustomers may need to remain patient,\u201d said the exchange. \u201cWe anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process unstaking requests immediately following the upgrade.\u201d\n\nTo account for this, Coinbase provides a liquid staking option called cbETH to its users as a derivative of staked ETH on the platform. This lets stakers effectively trade ETH while it is still locked up, with the promise of redeemability at a later date.\n\nAttack On Staking Providers\n\nBusinesses like Coinbase Earn may not be around in the United States for long: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently forced rival exchange Kraken to close down its staking service, slapping it with a $30 million fine in the process.\n\nThe commission alleged that the product constituted an unregistered securities offering, while critics of the enforcement action said that Kraken was provided no reasonable pathway to register with the agency.\n\nCoinbase has been one such vocal critic, making multiple public arguments about why staking services do not pass the Howey Test \u2013 the SEC\u2019s standard for identifying an investment contract."

Shortly after that global markets dove even deeper into the red with the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Not long after the LUNA crash followed and crypto markets plunged deeply.\n\nUnfavorable events for the global economy continued and caused further damage to all crypto assets. Despite all the negativity surrounding crypto and multiple published analyses, concluding with the announcement of \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, the NFT sector kept developing at a good pace and our team at BestBrokers decided to pull some raw data out of the Blockchain with Dune Analytics and give a visual representation. For the report Dune Analytics was used to run raw queries and analyse raw data from the blockchain. It also features breakdowns by year and quarter of the unique Ethereum NFT traders and the number of Ethereum NFT traders as well as expert opinion on the overall NFT trading activity.\n\nThe number of the unique active NFT traders on the Ethereum blockchain rose to over 2.07 million in 2022. Despite the negative conditions in 2022, the number of active NFT traders on the Ethereum network surged 276% compared to 2021.\n\nInitially the number of trades plummeted 22.48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 but bounced back nicely in the first quarter of 2023, which already makes this year look promising.\n\nDespite the falling prices and the much lower trading volume for most of the cryptocurrencies, the number of the unique active NFT traders on the Ethereum blockchain rose to over 2.07 million in 2022 or 276% compared to 2021.\n\n\u201c The fact that NFTs kept traders\u2019 attention during such tough times for the whole investing world means that there is something special about this asset. With the crypto prices expected to only rise from this point on, NFT will become even more mainstream and eventually will bring a lot of younger investors to the markets \u201d Stable overall trading activity Ethereum NFT trading activity initially skyrocketed to almost 3 million trades for the third quarter of 2021 with BTC and Ethereum reaching all time high. However, this trend remained stable despite the turbulent 2022, only dropping in the fourth quarter of 2022 when the Fed rate reached (and exceeded) the 4% mark for the first time in 15 years. Even after the number of trades plummeted 22.48% in the fourth quarter of 2022, it still bounced back in the first quarter of 2023 with the number of trades in this current first quarter already 6.65% higher as of 15 March 2023."

In September, after the Ethereum Merge, Gensler said proof-of-stake coin holders were members of \u201cthe investing public anticipating profits based on the efforts of others.\u201d\n\n\ufe0f Open Commission Meeting \ufe0f\n\n\n\nTomorrow, March 15th, at 10am ET we will have an @SECGov open meeting to discuss:\n\n\n\nProposed changes to Regulation S-P\n\nA Proposed Cybersecurity Risk Management Rule\n\nProposed changes to Regulation SCI \u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) March 14, 2023\n\nLater that month, Gensler told a Senate Banking Committee that staking is \u201canother indicia that under the Howey test, the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nRelated: Proof of Stake Alliance publishes white papers on legal aspects of liquidity staking\n\nThe Howey test, which dates to 1946, is used in U.S. law to identify securities.\n\nEarlier this year, the SEC also forced cryptocurrency exchange Kraken to discontinue its staking service and pay a $30 million settlement on Feb. 9, setting off concerns that the agency was preparing a new round of enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency industry. Gensler said at the time, \u201cIf they want to offer staking, we\u2019re neutral. Come in and register, because investors need that disclosure.\u201d"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum developers have completed the final round of testing for the network prior to the Shapella upgrade.\n\nShapella Launch Date To Be Set Soon\n\nOn Tuesday, March 14, Ethereum developers conducted the final dress rehearsal for the upcoming Shanghai/Capella upgrade, also referred to as the Shapella upgrade. Although the exact date of the Shapella upgrade is yet to be set, the community believes it will take place in early April. The date will be set when the Ethereum developers meet for their biweekly call on Thursday. In the last call, the developers had talked about pushing back their initial March timeline to early April.\n\nLow Participation In Goerli Testnet\n\nTuesday\u2019s dress rehearsal took place on the Goerli testnet and stimulated staked ether (ETH) withdrawals. In the next and final step, the ETH staking would go live on the mainnet.\n\nAlthough the upgrade for the testnet was triggered at epoch 162304 at 10.26 UTC, there was low validator participation of just 26%. Due to this, the epoch has not yet been finalized. Ideally, this would have been done at 10.38 UTC.\n\nAccording to Ben Edgington, a product lead at Teku, an Ethereum client, this low participation rate was likely due to validator nodes not having upgraded on time for the Goerli fork.\n\nStaked ETH Soon To Be Unlocked\n\nThe upcoming upgrade is the final element required for the Ethereum network to fully transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism. Once the upgrade is live on the mainnet, validators will be able to withdraw their staked ether.\n\nSo far, the funds have been locked up on the Ethereum blockchain since its PoS Beacon Chain went live in December 2020. Additionally, validators would also be able to withdraw the rewards they have earned by validating blocks on the blockchain.\n\nMost Significant Testnet Completed\n\nDevelopers use these testing networks or testnets to assess the performance of different upgrades and changes before deploying on the mainnet. It provides the developers the opportunity to check for bugs or any necessary improvements to be made on the code before taking it live on the mainnet.\n\nMost of these testnets successfully mimic the mainnet to a certain degree. The Goerli testnet is considered especially useful and highly anticipated since, of all the other simulators, it has the largest validator set and mimics the mainnet\u2019s blockchain activity most closely. The Goerli testnet also provided the last opportunity for staking providers to check if the staked ETH withdrawals were being properly processed.\n\nIncluding Goerli, there have been two other testnets to run through the Shanghai upgrade simulation - Zheijhang and Sepolia.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "'ETH is deflationary' - Why this is important under recent circumstances - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH sees surge in demand which may remain in the long term courtesy of deflationary milestone\n\nETH shorts traders suffer as price pivots while demand for leverage recovers\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP 1559 in August last year marked an important milestone for the network and ETH. The impact of that milestone is particularly evident in the fact that ETH is now deflationary.\n\n\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum (ETH) Profit Calculator\n\nThe latest Ethereum data reveals that the network has so far burned over 3 million ETH. The total amount of ETH burned is worth over $9.09 billion, trimming the post Merge total supply by slightly over 62,000 ETH. These findings underscore the progress that the Ethereum network has achieved so far as part of its PoS transition.\n\nETH\u2019s race for sound money\n\n\u200cETH\u2019s current 0.42% deflationary rate puts it well within the list of sound money. Why is this important? Well, traditional fiat money is currently feeling the weight of inflation which has been gradually causing the loss of value. As such, investors are eying asset classes that may allow them to protect their wealth from inflation.\n\nA deflationary asset such as ETH is currently more preferable both in the short and long-term. This is likely one of the reasons why the demand or ETH recently surged, resulting in significant recovery from the bearish performance we saw earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Glassnode\u2019s data confirmed a surge in demand for the cryptocurrency. For instance \u2013 ETH\u2019s exchange outflows volume just hit a new 3-month high. This is a sign that ETH traders have been aggressively buying the recent dip.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 3-month high of $32,742,895.81 Previous 3-month high of $32,737,155.33 was observed on 14 March 2023 View metric:https://t.co/L4RHmV9kZG pic.twitter.com/6CjaL5QgG0 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) March 15, 2023\n\nThe latest ETH exchange flow data confirmed that exchange outflows are back on the rise. A consequence of the robust buying pressure observed over the last few days, a period during which its price action bounced back strongly.\n\nThe aforementioned surge was strong enough to push ETH back to a new YTD high. As a consequence, the retest of its previous resistance level yielded some sell pressure. Hence, the higher exchange inflows than outflows.\n\nThe state of ETH shorts, liquidations, and leverage\n\nShorts traders once anticipated further downside after the events of last month. However, the pivot on 9 March triggered a surge in liquidations and a shift to long positions.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nDemand for leverage has been declining since the end of February, likely due to concerns over market outcome in March. This has been an unsurprising outcome, one factoring the recent market events which made it more difficult to predict the next outcome.\n\nHowever, we have seen an uptick in demand for leverage over the last few days, with the same corresponding with the price surge.\n\nThe market will likely feature more volatility if the level of leverage continues to rise. A higher likelihood of liquidations may lead to more wild swings."

        "content": "It's well-known that Elon Musk is a big fan of cryptocurrencies, praising their structure as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and claiming it will one day replace paper money. But how much does he actually own? And how much crypto is owned by Tesla?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll dive deep into Elon Musk\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s known historic and current cryptocurrency assets, so read on and find out all about it!\n\nWhat Crypto Does Elon Musk Own?\n\nThe short answer is: very little, if any. In 2019, he stated that, at the time, he only owned 0.25 Bitcoin, and only because a friend gifted it to him. However, two years later, Musk did claim that he acquired Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Doge ASCII hash strings.\n\nMusk never disclosed the number of other cryptocurrencies he personally owns. His companies, however, are another matter.\n\n(Yahoo Finance, Twitter)\n\nElon Musk on Bitcoin and Crypto: An In-Depth Look\n\nThere is no official information on the amount of crypto Elon Musk personally owns, only guesswork and internet snooping. However, his companies are easier to analyze. Let's see how these other companies fare and how much Bitcoin Tesla owns.\n\nMusk\u2019s love for Dogecoin is well-known by now. When talking about the recent FTX collapse, Musk\u2019s comments about Dogecoin lead to a breaking of a key resistance level as well.\n\nIf you want to buy Dogecoin, it's up to you to do so, but have his comment in mind: \u201cDon\u2019t bet the farm on DOGE, but I\u2019m working hard on the DOGE.\u201d\n\n(News.Bitcoin)\n\nTesla Invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February of 2021\u2026\n\nMany people have been waiting for Musk to take the plunge and invest in crypto. Almost two years ago, he did exactly that, through Tesla. This long-awaited Elon Musk Bitcoin investment was held based on new investment policies centering around Tesla\u2019s further diversification of assets.\n\n(CoinDesk)\n\n\u2026.and sold 75% of its Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAnd then, Tesla sold a large quantity of Bitcoin a year and a half later. At the time, this 75% was sold at a value of $936 million. Tesla claimed that the reasons behind this decision centered on the company\u2019s need to increase liquidity.\n\n(NPR, EuroNews)\n\nNow Tesla only accepts Dogecoin\u2026\n\nBefore, Tesla accepted Bitcoin as payment for their cars. A year ago, they dropped it as a payment method, citing Bitcoin mining\u2019s environmental impact as too severe. However, you can open up your crypto wallet and still pay for a Tesla by using Dogecoin.\n\n(Tesla, BBC)\n\n\u2026as does the Boring Company.\n\nIn July, the Tesla and Boring Company CEO announced they will accept Dogecoin as a payment method for their Vegas Loop.\n\nPeople will be able to pay for their rides by scanning a QR code at the Vegas Loop premises.\n\n(Mashable)\n\nIn July 2022, Tesla owned roughly 10,500 BTC.\n\nThe exact number of Dogecoin was not disclosed, but Musk did mention that they did not sell any of their stock. We also don't know how much Dogecoin does Elon Musk own personaly.\n\nThey did announce that Tesla owns digital assets valued at $218 million at the time. An estimation purports that they owned 42,000 BTC before selling 75% of it last year, leaving them with 10,500.\n\n(TechCrunch)\n\nA SpaceX intern started the rumor that Musk is the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nThe rumors behind Elon Musk being Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, seem to have been started by a SpaceX employee in 2017.\n\nMusk, of course, denied this and even posted on Twitter how the name Satoshi Nakamoto is a combination of the following brand names:\n\nSamsung\n\nToshiba\n\nNakamichi\n\nMotorola\n\nThis rumor is especially strange when you consider how much did Tesla invest in Bitcoin in 2021 and then how much did it sell a year later.\n\n(Twitter, CNBC)\n\nMusk never trusted Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe FTX collapse sent shockwaves through the crypto world. Musk, however, claimed that Bankman-Fried set off his \u201cBS detector\u201d in March of 2022.\n\nAt the time, the former FTX CEO offered $3 billion to assist in Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, hoping to talk about integrating blockchain into social media. Musk was doubtful of whether Bankman-Fried even had the liquidity to back up the potential $3 billion investment.\n\nIt might be interesting to think how much Elon Musk\u2019s Bitcoin net worth, and Tesla\u2019s for that matter, stands after this crash.\n\n(Decrypt.co)\n\nBitcoin Will Make It, With Difficulty\n\nMusk definitely believes in cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin. However, it seems that he is still playing it safe. In his own words, \u201cBTC will make it, but [it] might be a long winter.\u201d\n\nSources:"

        "content": "The news surrounding Silvergate\u2019s issues is huge, causing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices to dip. But it does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s the end for the crypto industry. Dogetti (DETI) is a new meme coin that is still gaining success in its presale, which gives a lot of hope to token enthusiasts.\n\nRecently, a major European asset manager stated their belief in digital assets and that these coins are not destined to fail.\n\nEU Asset Manager Says Digital Assets are Here to Stay\n\nAmundi Chief Investment Officer Vincent Mortier, along with macroeconomist Tristan Perrier released a thematic analysis paper to examine the state and perspectives of the crypto industry.\n\nThe two executives from the leading European asset manager argued that crypto giant Bitcoin failed to be an inflation hedge for the previous two years due to huge changes in policy and market interest rates, pressuring \u201call asset classes\u201d.\n\nAccording to the paper, nominal interest rates might cease to surge or drop due to high inflation but would not rise. If it happens, it can lead to a bull market, which is a favorable environment for an asset with finite supply and a long duration. Such a coin attracts investors due to its future potential rather than its current status.\n\nDuring market volatility, it is important to invest in the long-term, which is one great benefit of purchasing DETI coins.\n\nDogetti Holders are in for a Treat at Launch\n\nEarly investors who had bought DETI in its Presale Stage 1\u2014when the coin was sold at $0.00007\u2014are going to enjoy a huge increase when the coin launches on a crypto exchange.\n\nThe token is now in Stage 2, selling for $0.00029 each. That means the price has seen a huge increase of about 300%!\n\nWhen Dogetti ends Stage 5, which is also the time the coin launches, DETI will be selling for $0.0007 each. We are looking at a 900% increase from Stage 1!\n\nThe longer you wait to purchase DETI, the more you possibly lose millions of dollars in the future! If you buy at a later date nearing the final stage of the presale, you will only receive fewer tokens than if you had bought them earlier.\n\nAside from generating wealth for all \u201cfamily members\u201d, Dogetti is a coin that never forgets to give back to its community. One of the best features of joining the Dogetti family is its 2% protocol. For every transaction, 2% will be redistributed to all holders, meaning you gain extra coins just by having DETI in your wallet. Dogetti will also take 2% from every transaction and add it to its charity wallet. The whole family is encouraged to cast votes on which charities they want to support.\n\nLastly, the meme coin will get 2% from every transaction and split it between liquidity and burn wallets. This ensures the stability of the project as well as the family in the long term.\n\nInstitutions Look Beyond BTC and ETH\n\nA top executive of Coinbase, David Duong, hinted that institutional investors might be open to investing in digital assets other than the top two giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn a live stream with crypto analyst Scott Melker, the head of Coinbase\u2019s institutional research said that 55% of their institutional clients are into Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the remainder is in altcoins. This means that a lot of attention is poured into the ecosystem outside of BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have been performing poorly after Silvergate shut its operations, sending the whole crypto market into meltdown. On March 9th, Bitcoin and Ethereum traded at $21,637 and $1,533, respectively. BTC\u2019s price decreased by 7.31%, while ETH saw a 6.21% decrease in the past seven days.\n\nNevertheless, many investors are still hoping that the crypto market will recover. If you want to invest long-term and avoid market volatility, you might want to try presale coins like Dogetti.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Shrinking, Dogetti Still Continues to Thrive in Presale Phase - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Recently, increasing market regulations have had a detrimental effect on Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the other hand, Dogetti (DETI), since its presale, has formed itself as the brightest meme coin in the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin Plunges Due to Unending Inflation\n\nThe US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s hardline testimony to Congress prompted traders to price in a higher \u201cterminal,\u201d and as a result, Bitcoin (BTC) is perilously close to falling below US $20,000 for the first time in two months. By the start of the second week of March, Bitcoin had lost about 1% against the US dollar. The next morning, it lost another 0.9%, which allowed for a collapse in the BTC/USDT pair to roughly $22,000.\n\nThe Fed has increased interest rates by 450 basis points (bps) since last year, causing risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies, to tremble. As fear, uncertainty, and doubt spread in the cryptocurrency market, investors are shifting away from Bitcoin towards tokens that facilitate smart contracts. Although there is still a considerable distance between the current price and $20,000, if the dip is extended further by momentum traders, there is a possibility that the gap between them could narrow.\n\nETH Alert: 90% decline since March 2020\n\nSince June 2022, the price of Ethereum has increased by 78%, but this does not imply success. The volume profile of the digital asset strongly suggests a significant correction in the cryptocurrency market. The ETH volume profile showed approximately $64.25 million ETH traded between $270 and 450, with buying volume outpacing the selling volume by nearly 1 million ETH between July 2020 and November 2020.\n\nFollowing Powell\u2019s speech, Ethereum (ETH) recovered from an intraday low of US$1,540 on March 7 to close the session 0.25% lower. The performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world was actually worse, falling more than 0.7% on the ETH/USD pair. A recent purchase of 65% of Ethereum at a lower price in March 2023 suggests that even if a considerable price decline is inevitable, the potential to secure profits may still be high.\n\nThe majority of the top-20 altcoins took a stiffer boost just after the hawkish Fed chair\u2019s remarks, though Bitcoin and Ether limited overnight losses to one or two percentage points.\n\nDogetti \u2013 Meme Coin with Future Potential\n\nDogetti (DETI), a meme coin that is relatively new, is currently in the second phase of its presale. With sales of more than 7,205,450,000/50,000,000,000 DETI tokens thus far, the dog-themed coin has gotten off to a flying start, raising more than $515,741 in total. Dogetti offers a family code called \u201cWISEGUY25\u201d that entitles you to a massive 25% discount on your purchase.\n\nThe mirror protocol of Dogetti, which enables users of its digital currency, DETI, to amass more coins just by keeping them in their digital wallets, is one of the platform\u2019s main attractions.\n\nIn addition, Dogetti recently introduced DogettiDAO and DogettiNFTs, allowing customers to mint their own customized NFT pets. Since the demand for these digital assets is only expected to increase, this entry into the NFT market is wise. The collaboration between Dogetti and Uniswap offers traders high levels of security, low fees, and quick transactions. As a result of its hybrid consensus mechanism, Dogetti is able to process transactions swiftly and securely, making it the perfect platform for DeFi applications that demand low-cost, swift, and efficient transactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the decision to invest in digital currencies can be volatile, but the likelihood of good yields is impossible to ignore. With distinct characteristics like its re\ufb02ective protocol and NFT opportunities, Dogetti (DETI), a cryptocurrency, has exhibited great commitment. Dogetti is an enticing potential investment due to its burgeoning family. Right here, you can buy your very own Dogetti.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Crypto coins continued their bull run as the global market cap continued burgeon early Wednesday morning. Ethereum (ETH), arguably the most popular crypto after Bitcoin (BTC), managed to rise above $1,700 for the first time in March.

This surge was supported by the release of mildly encouraging inflation data and the ongoing recovery of the banking sector from a near-catastrophic event. While Bitcoin did lose some of its gains later on, it remains 81 percent higher than its lowest point. Ethereum also experienced a positive trend by breaking through a critical resistance level of $1,700. Collectively, these optimistic market movements indicate an active bullish sentiment.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cPrices of key tokens continued to rise on Tuesday, following a similar pattern of a previous couple of days. Next week will be decisive for the Crypto community with the Fed\u2019s rate hike announcement. We will continue to see a modest surge in prices aligned with past records. It will be a while before new ATH levels are reached. Experts have also predicted that only stringent regulations of the Crypto ecosystem and thoroughly compliant companies will stand a chance to partner with large financial institutions, as smaller players come under the scanner following SVB and Silvergate collapse.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum are currently trading at $24,900 and $1,700, respectively. However, at the time the CPI data was released, Bitcoin saw a sudden increase of $2,000 from $24,000 to $26,000, revealing inflation at 6 percent. While this rise in cryptocurrency prices may have been triggered by news of inflation, it does not appear to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nKunji founder Anurag Dixit offered his take, \u201cYesterday's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report met expectations, with overall inflation remaining in line with forecasts. However, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in slightly higher than anticipated. Despite this, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a rise in value to around $26,500, which can be attributed to earlier predictions of an even more hawkish CPI report. Nevertheless, BTC has since consolidated and is currently hovering just below the $25,000 level.\"\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset surged by over 10 percent in just 7 days making it a highly productive month for BTC. The UK government bailing out the Silicon Valley Bank has created a positive sentiment within the investment community and which may have increased buying activity. As per the latest data, US consumer inflation has slowed down but its still on the higher side which may drive Fed to continue its hawkish stance. If the macroeconomic factors continue to remain favourable then we may see Bitcoin testing $30,000 level very soon.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead Crypto Market Recovery While New DeFi Meme Coin Dogetti Launches 50% Bonus On ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency has been in something of poor health recently following the Silvergate Capital crash but there are signs of recovery within the crypto market as the two largest coins, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) rally strongly in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. Meanwhile, the meme coin terrain is witnessing the emergence of a new canine token in the form of Dogetti (DETI) as it launches an exciting time-limited offer of a 50% bonus on its tokens with its promo code Don50.\n\nBitcoin Trading Higher Following SVB Crisis As It Leads Recovery\n\nThe crypto market has been both hit hard and revitalised by two different banks undergoing a crisis. Silvergate Capital, a crypto bank, announced its closure as sustained financial losses led to it being less than capitalised due to the FTX crash prior. This had a dire effect on the crypto market as Bitcoin, along with most other coins, began trading at lower prices due to the fallout. It also watched its market capitalisation sink as it struggled to shrug off the ripple effects of Silvergate\u2019s implosion.\n\nBut the BTC token was given a lease of life by what happened with SVB as it also lurched into a crisis that resulted in customers withdrawing billions of dollars from the bank and trusts in the crypto market growing. Right now on CoinMarketCap, BTC is trading over $25,000 and has been comfortably in the green throughout the past few days. Its market cap has climbed to over $501 billion after an astonishing gain of over 15% in price over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum Gains Momentum Ahead of Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum is enjoying what appears to be the beginnings of a resurgent bullish run in the crypto market. Across the past week, it has seen a price swing of over 13% as it has begun trading in the green. The ETH token is now selling at over $1700 and Ethereum sits on the CoinMarketCap with a market cap of just north of $216 billion.\n\nA return to trading bullishly comes as it prepares for its Shanghai Upgrade which will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH. This de-risks staking for users and ensures that their funds can be seamlessly withdrawn. Alongside this, it will provide the basis for future upgrades on the Ethereum blockchain, including sharding, which will give significant scalability improvements when it eventually goes live.\n\nCommunity-Owned Dogetti Giving 50% Bonus On Tokens During Its Presale\n\nThe crypto market has always been a sprawling terrain of new emerging altcoins and the meme coin landscape is a particularly fitting embodiment of this. Dogetti, a new community-owned DeFi inspired by classic mafia family tropes to build a close-knit community, has caught the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nDogetti has entered Stage 2 of its ongoing presales and will move onto the third stage once it generates $4,000,000 in sales. To facilitate this, Dogetti is offering an incredible 50% off on DETI tokens through its promo code Don50, which is literally the crypto canine doubling on its previous promo offer.\n\nBut this new and exciting promo code does have a deadline so anyone interested should act swiftly.\n\nFor more on Dogetti, see the links below:\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "NAB has completed an intra-bank cross-border transaction using NAB-issued stablecoin, which represents a world-first by a major financial institution on a layer-one public blockchain.\n\nThis pilot transaction on the public and permissionless Ethereum blockchain, involved deployment of stablecoin smart contracts for seven major global currencies. The pilot\u2019s success demonstrates the potential to cut cross-border transactions from days to minutes and brings NAB one step closer to enabling clients who operate in multiple jurisdiction and currencies a simpler and faster experience, starting with corporate and institutional clients.\n\nNAB Executive General Manager, Markets, Drew Bradford, said NAB was investing to develop Australia\u2019s safest, simplest and most secure digital asset ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to pursuing the right digital asset opportunities with clear customer benefits. Bringing multi-currency stablecoins to market demonstrates NAB\u2019s focus on simplifying international banking protocols to increase speed and transparency while lowering costs and reducing complexity for customers,\u201d Mr Bradford said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that elements of the future of finance will be blockchain enabled and we\u2019re already witnessing rapid change in the tokenisation market. The stringent governance frameworks we have in place ensures we can support the creation of a safe and reliable digital financial system.\u201d\n\nNAB\u2019s Australian stablecoin, AUDN, which will be fully backed one-for-one with the Australian dollar and managed as a liability of the bank, will be the cornerstone for NAB\u2019s ambitions in digital assets. In addition, transacting on a public, permissionless layer-one blockchain will allow for greater transparency, accessibility and scalability.\n\nNAB has partnered with leading technology providers Blockfold and Fireblocks for this pilot to build and deploy its stablecoins. This includes leveraging their expertise for smart contract creation, securely minting and burning its stablecoin and managing the direct custody of the digital assets on the blockchain technology.\n\nFireblocks CEO and Co-founder, Michael Shaulov, said: \u201cAustralia continues to be a global torch bearer for tokenisation in financial services, with NAB leading the charge in the world\u2019s first use case of a large financial institution leveraging a public blockchain for cross-border payment rails. NAB\u2019s successful trade execution marks the beginning of the evolution of financial services from Web2 to Web3, underpinned by blockchain technology as well as strong governance and risk management\u201d.\n\nBlockFold CEO and Co-founder, Francois Schonken, said: \u201cNAB\u2019s multi-currency cross border settlement execution on a public blockchain is exhilarating. This trade marks the first cross-border multi-currency exchange executed by a regulated large financial institution (NAB) backed stablecoin. The NAB eco-system of stablecoins puts in place cross-border payment rails that unlock tokenization potential for both real world assets and financial products\u201d.\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nNAB\u2019s ambition is to enable transactions across seven of the top globally utilised currencies: Australian, New Zealand, Singapore and US dollars, Euro, Yen and Pound Sterling.\n\nNAB expects to be supporting select corporate and institutional clients to transact using digital assets by the end of 2023.\n\nThe transaction was completed using NAB\u2019s own, newly minted ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAbout Fireblocks\n\nFireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.

        "content": "The Silicon Valley Bank crisis proves to be a Cyprus Moment For Bitcoin(BTC). While liquidity was already bad before SVB, now it seems totally gone. However, the collapse proved bullish for Bitcoin, which saw the highest liquidations in the past two months. Although Ethereum (ETH) started with impressive gains, it has seen a recent 25% pullback in prices. The new Big Eyes Coin (BIG) announces a huge reward for those who supported the meme coin from Day 1.\n\nThe First Big Eyes NFT Drop Is Here\n\nThe Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is in stage 12 of its presale. The cute community-owned DeFi meme coin promises its holder to make a big fortune. Having raised $31.55 million already, Big Eyes Coin continues to reward its members with promo codes, the vault pin and loot boxes.\n\nThe Vault Pin 300 is one of the biggest offers any presale has ever witnessed. It is projected as a very limited-time offer, and why not? It gives the members 300% extra free loot boxes when one buys a minimum of $100 tokens or loot boxes using vault pin 300. It means that on every purchase of $100 or above, one can get three loot boxes to open for huge rewards.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has some great news for its early investors. Those who have supported the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) from Day 1 will be awarded NFTs for free. In the first Big Eyes NFT Drop, those who bought in stages 1-3 of the ICO will be whitelisted to mint SushiCrew NFTs.\n\nBitcoin Crosses $24.7K\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency has crossed the $24K mark and taken the crypto market by storm after the Silvergate Collapse and the Silicon Valley Bank failure. Bitcoin added 11% in the past day to trade above $24,700 on Tuesday morning, possibly making up for all the losses that happened over the weekend.\n\nIt is quite shocking for many investors who are looking at the declining prices liquidating over $100 million worth of Bitcoin shorts. This is a highly liquidated amount as the Bitcoin surge caused $500 million in liquidation across the cryptocurrency trading market.\n\nIn other news, Binance (BNB), the alternate crypto exchange, said on Monday that it would convert native USD (BUSD) stablecoin to BTC, ETH, BNB or other crypto tokens. This also most likely added to the surge in BTC prices.\n\nEthereum Sees 25% Pullback in Prices\n\n2023 had started for Ethereum (ETH) with significant gains. Volatility and uncertainty in the crypto market, however, have struck this digital asset severely. After enjoying the February High, ETH is now trading at two months\u2019 lows, being nearly 25% down.\n\nThe financial contagion seems to have been caused by the Silicon Valley Collapse and the Silvergate crisis. The current price of Ethereum is $1687 (at the time of writing this article), which is still much below its all-time high of $4891.70 in November last year.\n\nWhile a lot of traders might look at it as a big opportunity to buy Ethereum, Buy-the-dip has been quite popular in Cryptocurrency Trading. At the same time, market upheaval is also building up a good amount of fear among investors.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has become a popular investment option for many people around the world.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, it can be difficult to decide which coins to add to your portfolio. Two coins that have been gaining popularity recently are Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ).\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn this article, we will explore four simple reasons why these coins are a necessity of every portfolio.\n\nEthereum is a proven and reliable investment\n\nEthereum is one of the most established and well-known cryptocurrencies in the market. It was first introduced in 2014 and has since grown in popularity due to its smart contract capabilities.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. It has been tested and proven over time, making it a reliable investment for those looking for long-term gains.\n\nRenQ Finance is a unique and innovative investment\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has been gaining traction in the market. It offers unique features that make it stand out from other coins. RenQ Finance provides cross-chain capabilities that allow users to trade assets between different blockchains and DeFi protocols.\n\nIt has also tackled liquidity issues that many DeFi platforms experience by offering an off-chain order book and a hybrid infrastructure model. These features make RenQ Finance a safe and innovative investment option for those looking for something different.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\n4 simple reasons that make Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) a necessity of every portfolio\n\nReason 1: Smart Contract Platform\n\nSmart contract platforms like Ethereum have become essential components of the blockchain ecosystem due to their ability to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (DApps) with automated and transparent operations. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, healthcare, and real estate, among others.\n\nEthereum's smart contract platform has become the most popular platform among developers looking to build DApps, with a vast array of applications available on the blockchain. This thriving ecosystem has been facilitated by Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, which have enabled the creation of new and innovative applications.\n\nRenQ Finance is another blockchain project that leverages the Ethereum network's smart contract capabilities. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, RenQ Finance offers the same features and benefits as Ethereum, including the ability to develop DApps that are secure, transparent, and self-executing.\n\nReason 2: Diverse Use Cases\n\nEthereum's ability to support a wide range of DApps has made it one of the most versatile cryptocurrencies. It has been used for everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming and social media platforms. Its versatility has made it a must-have cryptocurrency in any well-diversified portfolio.\n\nRenQ Finance's smart contract platform provides developers with the necessary infrastructure to build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that can offer a wide range of financial services, including lending, borrowing, and trading. The platform's flexibility and scalability make it a viable option for a wide range of use cases.\n\nReason 3: Cross-Chain Capabilities\n\nOne of the main reasons RenQ Finance is a necessity in every portfolio is its ability to provide cross-chain capabilities. This allows users to trade assets between different blockchains and DeFi protocols. Cross-chain solutions have become increasingly important as the crypto space continues to evolve and new blockchains and DeFi protocols are created.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized computing platform built on blockchain technology that empowers developers to design and launch decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike traditional applications, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network rather than a centralized server, allowing users to have greater control over their data and interactions. With Ethereum, developers can create dApps that give decision-making power to the participants of the application itself, rather than relying on a central authority.\n\nReason 4: Liquidity Solutions\n\nRenQ Finance is also focused on tackling the liquidity issues that many DeFi platforms experience. It offers an off-chain order book and a hybrid infrastructure model that gives its users an edge in terms of speed and liquidity. This makes it a safer coin to invest in and has resulted in increased interest from investors and traders.\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance offer potential for growth\n\nBoth Ethereum and RenQ Finance offer potential for growth in the future. Ethereum's smart contract capabilities make it a valuable asset for those interested in decentralized applications and the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nAs for RenQ Finance, its unique features and focus on solving DeFi liquidity issues give it potential for growth as the DeFi market continues to expand.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nPresale: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\n\u201cCrypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
