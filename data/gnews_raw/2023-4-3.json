        "title": "Ethereum Validator Goes Rogue, Frontruns MEV Bots for $25M - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum validators hellbent on maximizing revenue can employ special bots to extract the most value possible from every single block. Some of those bots were just attacked for $25 million.\n\nA rogue validator used a tool for obtaining the maximum extractable value (MEV) from the Ethereum blockchain and carried out a \u201csandwich attack.\u201d\n\nBut first, understanding sandwich attacks takes unpacking MEV as a concept.\n\nMEV is essentially frontrunning. MEV bots find additional revenue by exploiting knowledge of which transactions are about to be processed. This is done most commonly via arbitrage (taking advantage of price differences between exchanges).\n\nThese opportunities are often discovered by other revenue seekers, known as \u201csearchers.\u201d Once searchers identify profitable trades, they will submit them to a public mempool and wait for an Ethereum validator to approve the transaction.\n\nSome searchers have realized they can frontrun those trades by using bots that scan the public mempool, proposing blocks which have replaced the trade with their own transaction to grab another searcher\u2019s MEV.\n\nCompanies such as Flashbots prevent these kinds of events with tools known as MEV boost relays. Relays make sure MEV transactions are not revealed in the public mempool, so MEV hunters can\u2019t frontrun each other.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a will to frontrun MEV bots\u2026\n\nMEV relays are formed by two parties: proposers and builders. Proposers make bids on transactions, and builders secure the highest bid and generate blocks containing their transactions. They then send the blocks to validators, who will approve the transaction.\n\n\u201cOne of the core ideas behind Proposer-Builder Separation is that proposers cannot be allowed to see the contents of the block they\u2019re signing until they\u2019ve signed the block,\u201d a research analyst at Paradigm who goes by samczsun said in a tweet. \u201cTheoretically, this makes it extremely hard for a malicious proposer to deconstruct bundles.\u201d\n\nAs for this weekend\u2019s $25 million sandwich attack: Eighteen days earlier, the exploiter deposited 32 ETH ($57,500) to become a validator. This meant the exploiter was a proposer who could also reorder block transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that once they were able to propose a block as a validator, the attacker included additional transactions that weren\u2019t initially inside the block made by the builder. This enabled the attacker to front-run the front-running MEV bot, a Blockworks research analyst explained in a tweet.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThis is considered a sandwich attack \u2014 where the victim\u2019s transaction is stuck between two transactions created by the searcher.\n\nIn this case, the sandwich attacker pushed transactions worth $25 million across three main addresses, per PeckShield. Tokens gained include wrapped ETH, wrapped bitcoin, tether, USDC and DAI.\n\nThe incident was first identified by pseudonymous Twitter user 3155.eth. Usually, if a validator tampers with a transaction, they are slashed for malicious behavior and they lose some of their ETH stake.\n\nFlashbot developers have rolled out a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\n\u201cNow, mev-boost-relay will refuse to return the transactions if the block was not successfully sent to the network. Then, just for good measure, it delays the response by a second too,\u201d Paradigm\u2019s samczsun said.\n\nUpdated April 4, 2023 at 9:52 am ET: Flashbot developers have already rolled out a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Now it\u2019s receiving a contributor from outer space.\n\nCryptosat, a blockchain-powered satellite orbiting Earth, announced its contribution of entropy from space on April 4 at 6 a.m. UTC. The contribution will be deployed from the Crypto2 satellite.\n\nAccording to the announcement from Cryptosat, the satellite orbits Earth every 90 minutes following a remote course 550 km above ground, which makes it difficult for outside actors to gain access during the KZG contribution.\n\nYan Michalevsky, the co-founder of Cryptosat, explained to Cointelegraph that the ceremony needs parties that can generate \u201ccryptographic parameters\u201d that don\u2019t leak what is called \"toxic waste,\u201d or intermediate computation artifacts that are discarded and inaccessible after being generated.\n\nMichalevsky continued that if leaked, this \u201ctoxic waste\u201d could compromise \u201cthe integrity of the cryptographic scheme\u201d on which the next version of Ethereum is based.\n\n\u201cThis is why generating those parameters in a completely physically isolated environment from which data cannot be extracted has a lot of merit.\"\n\nCryptosat has a Verifiable Random Beacon service, which will generate entropy for its contribution.

It was the successor to the first satellite launch of Crypto1 back in May. According to Cryptosat, the second satellite has 30x the computing power of the first one.\n\nPreviously the company said that blockchain-powered satellites are part of the effort to make outer space a \u201cnew battleground in the quest for bulletproof cryptography.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade to the mainnet, for which the entropy by Crypto2 is generated, is scheduled for April 12.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain fail-safes in space: SpaceChain, Blockstream and Cryptosat"

        "title": "A guide to Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "In 2022, Ethereum developers pulled off a dramatic upgrade known as the Merge, changing the way transactions are validated on the network.\n\nPreviously, that task was the preserve of thousands of powerful \u201cmining\u201d computers, which checked the authenticity of transactions by way of an energy-intensive process known as Proof of Work. The Merge introduced the greener Proof-of-Stake model, replacing the miners with \u201cvalidators,\u201d users who have deposited at least 32 units of Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency, ETH, on the network.\n\nThat made the network something like 99% more energy-efficient, and around $26 billion has since been locked up on the network by over 520,000 validators.\n\nBut all is not perfect. Though validators are theoretically able to earn rewards on their deposit in the form of newly mined ETH, they still can\u2019t actually redeem these rewards\u2014or their initial deposit.\n\nNor has it helped that many of the validators began staking funds in 2020, via an early \u201ctestnet\u201d iteration of the staking protocol that was later \u201cmerged\u201d with Ethereum proper in 2022. The crypto market has undergone a series of violent swings since then, and a lot of stakers want their money back.\n\nWith more than two years having passed since staking was first made possible, it\u2019s safe to say that the upcoming Shanghai Upgrade, which will introduce a withdrawal feature, is a big deal.\n\nShanghai Upgrade\n\nScheduled for April 2023, the Shanghai Upgrade is arguably the most anticipated network upgrade to Ethereum since the Merge. Though it also includes a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) designed to reduce gas costs (transaction fees), most of the attention is centered on EIP-4895\u2014the holy grail of EIPs, which enables staking withdrawal.\n\nThere will be two types of withdrawals that come with Shanghai: partial and full.\n\nIf a validator wants to remain a part of the network, they can then opt for a partial withdrawal, keeping their minimum threshold of 32 ETH on the chain and redeeming the excess to their wallet address.\n\nUnder a full withdrawal, the validator is free to withdraw the entirety of their stake, but in doing so would forgo their participation in the chain.\n\nThere is one minor caveat. Validators who staked on the 2020 \u201ctestnet,\u201d known as the Beacon Chain, were given withdrawal credentials, known as \u201c0x00,\u201d but these are no longer valid. In order to execute a full or partial withdrawal, they will first need to upgrade their credentials to 0x01.\n\nWill Unstaking ETH Trigger a Sell-off?\n\nNot necessarily. To really understand this, we need to look at how many participants are actually \u201cilliquid stakers\u201d\u2014that is, stakers who can\u2019t immediately access their deposits.\n\nA big part of the staking market constitutes liquid staking participants provided through services like Lido as well as centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Not everyone has 32 ETH to tuck away in a deposit contract, so many users have participated in ETH staking with a liquid token tied to the value of their deposit. Since they have always had access to liquidity, it\u2019s fair to assume they aren\u2019t looking to sell off their holdings.\n\nAround 52% of stakers are illiquid, and while the majority of staked ETH is underwater, at least 2 million ETH were sent to the contract when the asset was trading between $400 and $700. This cohort might be looking to sell their ETH, but then again, they did send their tokens to the contract without a timeline for withdrawals and are likely ardent supporters of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Impotence Proposal\n\nBefore the details around withdrawals were ratified, there was significant controversy over the speed of its implementation. Many developers hoped to make the upgrade compatible with a sleeker, new Ethereum encoding method known as simple serialize (SSZ), which would have delayed its release by a few months. Popular calls to quickly enable withdrawals, however, led to developers tacking the feature onto April\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade\u2014potentially rushing it through and risking technical woes in the future.\n\nWhen and How Will Shanghai Be Deployed?\n\nShanghai was originally scheduled for March 2023 but has been postponed to sometime in April 2023. Developers make the decisions based on their assessment of progress, so this tentative date is subject to change.\n\nWhile deployment on the mainnet is still a few weeks away as of the time of writing, some have already begun testing out the withdrawal feature on one of Ethereum\u2019s testnets e.g., Zheijang and Sepolia."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has regained its bullish momentum and is continuing its bull run. The cryptocurrency has managed to break multiple significant resistance levels since rebounding from the $1,000 area in November 2022, signaling a potential upward trend in the market.\n\nEthereum is trading just below the $1900 mark, representing uncharted territory since August 2022. Despite breaking its correlation with Bitcoin, the question remains whether Ethereum can continue its upward trend and reach new yearly highs by surpassing the $2,000 milestone.\n\nWill Ethereum Maintain Its Bullish Trend?\n\nAccording to a recent Twitter post by crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez, on-chain data reveals a potential breakout above the $1,900 level. According to Martinez, the next critical resistance area for Ethereum is between $2,100 and $2,150.\n\nIn addition, over 200,000 addresses had purchased over 18 million ETH at the $2,100-$2,150 level, as seen in the chart above, making it a crucial resistance area for Ethereum\u2019s price action in the mid-term.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum can maintain its momentum and surpass this resistance level to establish it as support. In that case, the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to reach new yearly highs and potentially consolidate above the $2,000 mark, further solidifying its upward trend.\n\n2019 Fractal Mirrors Bullish Pattern For ETH\n\nAnother interesting trend has emerged in Ethereum\u2019s price action, dating back to its diagonal breakout in 2019. Crypto Analyst under the pseudonym \u201cWoetoe\u201d has identified a blue fractal in ETH\u2019s charts that could offer valuable insights into the cryptocurrency\u2019s future price movements.\n\nAccording to Woetoe\u2019s fractal, Ethereum could potentially experience a significant uptrend shortly. This prediction is bolstered by the upcoming Shappella upgrade, represented by the vertical red line, which could further drive Ethereum\u2019s price upwards.\n\nIn addition to its recent surge, Ethereum has also seen a high rate of liquidations, with approximately $30 million worth occurring within just 24 hours at the $1,880 level, as Glassnode data shows.\n\nIt is now crucial for ETH to maintain its current level as a support and potentially consolidate above the $1,900 mark. However, if Ethereum fails to consolidate at this level, it is likely that a healthy pullback will occur, potentially pushing its price action toward the $1,830 mark.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,867, reflecting a gain of more than 2% over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has posted significant gains in wider time frames, with 8.5% and 7% profits in the seven-day and fourteen-day periods, respectively.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

On April 6, the company will launch 3,800 Ethereum NFTs spanning a mix of POGs and slammers with unique artwork for each, at a price of 0.049 ETH (about $90 as of this writing).\n\nThe NFTs can be used within a slate of upcoming Ethereum-based video games, which are set to launch this summer. The first play-to-earn POG game, called Stack and Slam, will first debut on Solana this week. Frisbee said that it mimics the classic slammer-tossing playground experience, relying on a combination of timing, skill, and luck for players to succeed.\n\nSome of the NFTs will feature artwork from popular NFT projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Moonbirds. Bored Ape holders can use or license out their owned artwork for commercial products, while the open-source Moonbirds artwork is free for anyone to commercialize. Other POGs NFTs are based on projects like Neo Tokyo and Viva La Vandal.\n\nBeyond this week\u2019s mint, Frisbee and team plan to release physical packs of Web3 project-themed POGs in May via a token-gated platform, letting owners of POG NFTs access the marketplace to purchase limited edition POGs based on the NFTs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Doodles Plans to Scale From Genesis Box to Millions of NFT Avatars\n\nFrom there, Frisbee has a number of ideas on how to further embrace Web3 with POGs. He envisions a potential play-for-keeps physical game that uses NFC chips within the POGs themselves, and then automatically transfers the tokenized ownership from the loser\u2019s wallet into the winner\u2019s.\n\nThe goal with POGs NFTs, he said, is to deliver digital collectibles that feed into video games, but also pair with the physical POGs experience.\n\nHe teased plans to bring physical POGs back in a big way, with the NFT expansion and celebrity partners intended to \u201cbring the right buzz for when the official distribution of those POGs comes back globally.\u201d"

        "content": "A new decentralized layer has been added on top of Ethereum to make smart accounts possible with the introduction of ERC-4337 and account abstraction \u2014 but infrastructure providers suggest it may be tricky to participate profitably right now.\n\nERC-4337, commonly called \u201csmart accounts\u201d or \u201caccount abstraction,\u201d was deployed on the Ethereum mainnet on March 1. \u201cSmart accounts\u201d are essentially a supercharged version of an Ethereum wallet. Although smart contract wallets already exist, they rely on centralized components. ERC-4337 changes that with a distributed network of \u201cBundlers\u201d and \u201cPaymasters.\u201d\n\nUnder the hood, there are a few subtle but significant changes \u2014 namely the addition of the \u201cUser Intent Layer,\u201d explained Matt Cutler, the co-founder and CEO of Blocknative, a core Ethereum infrastructure provider.\n\nAccording to Cutler, an Ethereum transaction today involves several discrete steps.\n\nA model explaining the current Ethereum transaction flow. Source: Blocknative\n\nA user accesses their standard externally-owned account (EOA) or private key to compose a signed transaction \u2014 for example, transferring a nonfungible token (NFT) to another user.\n\nThis transaction is then sent to the public mempool \u2014 which could be described as a shared queue for transactions \u2014 to be plucked out by a \u201cBuilder\u201d who organizes it into a \u201cprofitable block.\u201d From there, the block is proposed to a Validator, who ultimately proposes and publishes it on-chain, completing the transaction.\n\nUnder ERC-4337, the new \u201cUser Intent Layer\u201d is introduced before the current EOA step.\n\nA mental model explaining the new Ethereum transaction flow with ERC-4337. Source: Blocknative\n\nThis additional layer allows a user to initiate more complex transactions in a single step. To make this possible, ERC-4337 introduces an \u201cAlternative Mempool\u201d and a network of transaction Bundlers, and along with it \u2014 a new way to earn fees.\n\nBecoming a Bundler\n\nA Bundler is a node that does a very similar job to the block \u201cBuilder.\u201d Instead of organizing signed transactions from the public mempool to assemble a profitable block, a Bundler grabs User Operations, or userOps, from the Alt-Mempool to create the most profitable bundle which is signed and submitted to the network as a single transaction. This is all part of the newly added layer that makes smart accounts possible.\n\nBundlers get compensated via userOp gas fees for providing their much-needed service.\n\nWill Account abstraction bring a billion people to crypto?\n\n\n\nNO. Solving a problem that billions of people have will bring a billion people to crypto.\n\n\n\nAccount abstraction enables the distribution of the solution. \u2014 John Rising (@johnrising_) March 24, 2023\n\nWhile anyone can be a Bundler in theory, in reality, being a successful one might be another story, Cutler warned.\n\nLike Builders, Bundlers are \u201cspecialized actors\u201d made up of \u201crelatively sophisticated development teams operating substantial computational, storage, and networking infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 is trustless and permissionless. So if you\u2019re technically adept, by all means, you can stand up and operate your own Bundler. The challenge is Bundling is a competitive market.

        "content": "Blockchain developer and founder of Cardano Charles Hoskinson has shared a fresh take on the subject of his chief brainchild, this time in terms of staking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparing it to Ethereum (ETH) as the largest proof-of-stake blockchain by capitalization, Hoskinson notes a specialty of Cardano that, in his view, lies in the number of unique addresses involved in the staking process. The chart provided by Hoskinson shows that the number of unique staking participants' wallets on Cardano equals more than 1.2 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has 88,400.\n\nIt is as if a lot of people decided to build an excellent staking protocol years ago and achieved it, says a blockchain developer.\n\nHoskinson's figures are partially confirmed by a Staking Rewards portal. According to the data, Cardano's staking ratio is 68.11%, while Ethereum's is 15.6%. That means that the number of outstanding ADA delegated to staking is almost 4.4 times higher than for ETH.\n\nHowever, because of the price difference between Cardano and Ethereum tokens, the latter has a market staking capitalization 3.5 times larger at $34.29 billion.\n\nAlso, according to the website, Ethereum has a higher staking reward than Cardano, 4.92% versus 3.24%. If we take into account the adjusted reward metric, which considers the annual reward rate adjusted for network supply inflation, the gap is even larger, at 5.13% versus 0.17%."

        "title": "A Guide to Base, Coinbase's Ethereum L2 - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum network speeds can be slow, and the cost of using it can be prohibitively expensive, especially for small transactions.\n\nIn 2023, Coinbase stepped in to help solve the problem. Its approach: to build a layer-2 (L2) network atop Ethereum.\n\nThis explainer will quickly get you up to speed on L2s and other projects working to scale Ethereum, and then dive into what Base says it can bring to the table.\n\nWhat Are Layer-2s Again?\n\nLayer-2 networks are blockchains that run atop other (layer-1) blockchains, such as Ethereum. Since Ethereum is near its upward limit of roughly 1 million transactions per day, any additional demand on the network results in higher prices for users (i.e., you pay more to get your transaction through) and/or slower speeds (e.g., you wait until congestion ebbs). So, while Ethereum is decentralized and secure, it lacks a third property of a Platonic blockchain: It\u2019s not scalable.\n\nL2s help solve this by moving bunches of transactions to another blockchain, processing them there, and then sending compressed data back to the L1. Popular L2s include Optimism, Arbitrum, and Loopring. [For an overview, check out our quick history of Ethereum scaling.]\n\nWhat Is Base?\n\nBase is a layer-2 blockchain that\u2019s, er, based on Optimism\u2019s open-source stack of software. Coinbase is working on the network with the OP Labs team that created Optimism. That\u2019s right, instead of taking aim at a competitor, the centralized exchange is collaborating with it\u2014for now, at least.\n\nWhile Optimism took steps in 2022 to decentralize control of the protocol, Base will be built by Coinbase in-house. Unlike Optimism, Coinbase says it doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently\u201d plan to issue its own token. It does say, however, that it will \u201cprogressively decentralize the chain.\u201d\n\nBase has the, ahem, basic setup of many other L2s:\n\nIt\u2019s designed to get its security from Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s EVM-compatible, meaning its smart contracts are recognized by computers running the Ethereum software.\n\nTransaction costs on the network are generally much lower than on Ethereum alone.\n\nThough Base says it\u2019s \u201crollup agnostic,\u201d by building off of Optimism\u2019s stack, it\u2019s sticking its flag in the ground for a particular type of rollup. There\u2019s an ongoing battle in L2 land between zk-rollups and optimistic rollups. Protocols using the latter type assume that transactions are valid, but they contain a mechanism for users to prove fraud. The former employs zero-knowledge (zk) proofs to demonstrate that a legitimate transaction took place\u2014without showing their work. [See our guide to zkEVMs for more.]\n\nThere\u2019s some disagreement between the groups as to whether zk-rollups are ready for prime time; many optimistic rollup devs assert that the technology isn\u2019t as mature as optimistic rollups.\n\nBase joins Optimism, Arbitrum, Boba, and others in the optimistic rollup camp.\n\nWhy Another L2?\n\nIt\u2019s clear from Coinbase\u2019s February 2023 introductory announcement that the exchange sees the L2 as a home base for decentralized applications. In other words, L2s can make individual users\u2019 transactions faster and more affordable, but the big money is in getting DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications to integrate.\n\nTo that point, Base is promising developers \u201caccess to Coinbase\u2019s products, users, and tools.\u201d\n\nThe Future of Base\n\nBase\u2019s testnet went live in February 2023. The next step is a mainnet launch that would open the platform up to everyone."

        "title": "3 Undervalued Cryptos That Could Surprise You in April - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been going gangbusters this year and outperforming stocks by a wide margin. During the year\u2019s first quarter, the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) gained 70% while Ethereum (ETH-USD) was up 50%. The huge rally since the calendar turned to 2023 has many former skeptics now calling for BTC and ETH to hit new all-time highs by year\u2019s end. It\u2019s a stark reversal from last fall when the $8 billion collapse of FTX, a large crypto exchange, sent a chill through the industry and prompted analysts to say that a crypto winter looked likely to turn into a prolonged ice age. However, while this year\u2019s big reversal of crypto prices is welcome news, the gains have not been universal. Many cryptocurrencies, particularly smaller ones, have not enjoyed the same upswing as Bitcoin and Ethereum. But many cryptos remain undervalued, and there are bargains for investors who know where to look. Here are three, undervalued cryptos that could surprise investors in April.\n\nTRX Tron 6.6 cents SOL Solana $20.88 ADA Cardano 39 cents\n\nUndervalued Cryptos: Tron (TRX)\n\nDigital data flow on road with motion blur to create vision of fast speed transfer. Concept of future digital transformation, disruptive innovation and agile business methodology. LTRX stock\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis cryptocurrency has no association with the popular Tron film series. Despite that, TRON (TRX-USD) is one of the more interesting, affordable, and seemingly undervalued cryptos currently available to investors.\n\nAnd, while the cryptocurrency has risen 22% so far in 2023, its gains pale in comparison to those achieved by sector leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum. Plus, Tron\u2019s current price is 5% lower than where it was trading at 12 months ago.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCreated in 2014, Tron was designed, in part, based on Ethereum and helps to facilitate smart contracts. Also like Ethereum, TRX operates on an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake protocol, as well as a decentralized, open-source blockchain operating system.\n\nTron is an investor favorite when it comes to smaller, lesser-known cryptocurrencies. And despite Tron\u2019s ups-and-downs of the past year, TRX has gained over 60% since 2018. Now might be a good time for investors to take advantage of an attractive entry point in this crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nConcept art of the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) doubled in the first quarter of the year, but it remains 85% below where it was trading at in April 2022. Investors looking to buy the dip of a cryptocurrency should consider SOL. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has been negatively impacted by several high-profile hacks, the most notable one involving $320 million of Ethereum that was stolen from the Solana platform. Developers have spent much of the last year improving the security of Solana and protecting investors\u2019 capital.\n\nBeyond security improvements, another reason to consider SOL is that its public blockchain platform is able to facilitate smart contracts. This gives Solana a use that many smaller cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin (DOGE-USD, lack.\n\nAnd while the price of Solana has been turbulent, it has been gaining ground alongside most other cryptos this year. Many crypto fans also like the fact that Solana offers fast processing speeds and has comparatively low user fees.\n\nUndervalued Cryptos: Cardano (ADA)\n\nLitecoin logo\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter bottoming this past December, Cardano (ADA-USD) has been on an upswing in 2023, having gained 53% since the start of January. However, trading at 38 cents a token and still down 68% over the past 12 months, ADA looks undervalued and ripe for the picking.\n\nCardano appears to be a bargain considering that its current price is 86% below its all-time high of $2.85 reached in August 2021. And some crypto bulls continue to view Cardano as an up-and-comer in the sector.\n\nCardano competes directly with Ethereum in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Cardano\u2019s underlying blockchain technology got a boost in late 2021 when it completed what\u2019s known as the \u201cAlonzo hard fork.\u201d\n\nSome analysts say that upgrade put Cardano on equal footing with ETH. Yet investors can buy ADA for a fraction of the $1,800 that it costs to purchase a single Ethereum token.\n\nADA is now preparing for another upgrade, called \u201cHydra,\u201d that promises to make the cryptocurrency even more powerful and efficient.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This was followed by a relatively short period of range trading before a rise started on April 3.\n\nAccording to Deutscher, the newfound strength Ethereum is seeing on its Bitcoin BTC chart might reflect the makings of capital rotation ahead of the Shanghai update.\n\nStaked ETH withdrawals will be made possible by the Shanghai upgrade, also known as \"Shapella,\" which completes Ethereum's entire transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. The long-awaited Shanghai hard fork has an April 12 target date, according to Ethereum developers.\n\nThe fact that the last time Ethereum traded at such oversold levels to Bitcoin, it produced fresh highs on the ETH/BTC chart raises the possibility of a sustained rebound in the coming weeks.\n\nSustained strength might bode well for altcoins\n\nDeutscher notes that the sustained strength of Ethereum against Bitcoin would bode well for the altcoins' performance. Oftentimes, the altcoin market tends to benefit from Ethereum's show of strength against Bitcoin, with this often an indicator of altcoins' performance.\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum faces a barrier that coincides with the moving averages on its Bitcoin chart. A successful flip into support might dictate the next move in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, going back to the ETH/USD chart, crypto analyst Ali says Ethereum appears to be breaking out. According to him, on-chain data reveals that the next critical resistance area is between $2,100 and $2,150, where over 200K addresses had previously purchased over 18 million ETH."

The funds are frozen pending resolution of the dispute\n\nOyekenov warns the approaching \"Shanghai upgrade\" \u2013 a technical upgrade that increases users\u2019 direct control over their staked ether funds \u2013 will empower the pair to abscond with more than $10 million of the disputed funds\n\nTensigma assets worth over $6m have allegedly already been stolen and hidden. Judge previously noted \"real risk\" of Svirksy and Donin dissipating their assets in order to \"frustrate any judgment\" against them\n\nSvirsky worked previously for Renaissance Capital, BNP Paribas and Sberbank\n\nNEW YORK, April 04, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A renowned Kazakh entrepreneur says he is fighting against time for the return of crypto assets worth millions of dollars, after they were allegedly misappropriated by his former business partners.\n\nArman Oyekenov claims that imminent changes in the way certain funds in the Ethereum network are housed will give Julian Svirsky, an American-Russian banker who formerly worked at Renaissance Capital, the opportunity to flee with millions of dollars in stolen money, despite an international court order freezing the disputed funds.\n\nThe case is being closely watched by legal experts and raises important questions about the ability of regulators, the courts and the criminal authorities to combat fraud and money-laundering on crypto networks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other agencies are being alerted about the case.\n\nOyekenov, a one-third owner of Tensigma, established the crypto real estate business with Svirsky and Denis Donin before suing the pair for alleged fraud. In May 2021, the British Virgin Islands High Court (Commercial Division) granted a worldwide freezing order prohibiting Svirsky and Donin from dealing with the assets of Tensigma Limited up to the value of $23 million. The freezing order was continued in December 2021 and remains in force today.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn apparent breach of the freezing injunction, more than $6.2 million of cryptocurrency has since been stolen and funnelled through cryptocurrency \"mixers\", rendering efforts to trace the Bitcoin and Ethereum almost impossible.\n\nTensigma\u2019s only remaining cryptocurrency asset, worth about $10 million, is Ethereum staked on the Beacon Deposit Contract. The so-called Shanghai Upgrade to the Ethereum platform, scheduled for April 12, allows holders to \"unstake\" their assets for the first time. Parties will be watching closely what happens to the staked Ethereum at that point.\n\nCANDEY LLC in New York has been instructed to refer Julian Svirsky and Denis Donin to the US criminal authorities for extradition to the United States on charges of wire fraud and theft.\n\nBackground \u2013 ICO to shareholder dispute\n\nThe funds at the centre of this dispute were raised through an initial coin offering in late 2017 in connection with the Atlant.io platform and two ventures known as uvas.com and karta.com.\n\nOyekenov is a one-third owner of Tensigma and claims that the theft and appropriation of cryptocurrency by Svirsky and Donin has resulted in the destruction of his shareholder value. Tensigma is now in liquidation.\n\nIn their Defence, Svirsky and Donin say that Oyekenov obtained his shareholding in Tensigma through coercion and was only an employee. It is also alleged the cryptocurrency no longer belongs to Tensigma having been transferred to a Gibraltar company named Digital Asset Exchange Limited for $559,279 in July 2020. Oyekenov refutes the claim that he was merely an employee and alleges that DAE transaction was a sham transaction, as the true value of the cryptocurrency was millions of dollars.\n\nFreezing Injunction \u2013 \"Mr. Svirsky and Mr Donin are ready to lie\"\n\nIn reaching his decision to grant the worldwide freezing injunction, Mr Justice Gerhard Wallbank commented that:\n\n\"If it is right, as it appears to be, that Mr. Svirsky and Mr Donin are ready to lie about the position of the Claimant within their business, and basically to try and mislead the Court into pretending that the Claimant was a mere employee as opposed to a partner. If that\u2019s right, and on the documents it appears to be right. [\u2026]\n\nThey also have, reading those text messages, what I think can best be called a macho vulgarity in the obscenity of their language that they use between them such that they seem to be rather crude individuals. I don\u2019t think for one moment that they\u2019d lose sleep over putting assets a few steps further, may using nominees to pretend that they don\u2019t have them.\"\n\nAppeals\n\nSvirsky and Donin have appealed various orders in the proceedings including the grant of the freezing injunction itself. The appeals are due to be heard by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal in May 2023.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230404005094/en/\n\nContacts\n\nMedia enquiries:\n\nPalatine Communications: Conal Walsh / Victoria Fell\n\nVictoria.fell@palatine-media.com"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants to see zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zk-EVMs) built on Ethereum\u2019s first layer to speed up the verification process on the base blockchain.\n\nButerin explained in a March 31 post that it\u2019s possible to integrate a zk-EVM on the base layer without compromising on decentralization and security. The technology enables Ethereum Virtual Machines to execute smart contracts on the blockchain with ZK proofs.\n\nHow will Ethereum's multi-client philosophy interact with ZK-EVMs?https://t.co/MPpTPNhldR \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 31, 2023\n\nEthereum was developed with a \u201cmulti-client philosophy\u201d to ensure decentralization at the protocol level, Buterin explained. By integrating zk-EVMs at the Ethereum layer 1, it would be the third type of client.\n\n\u201cOnce that happens, zk-EVMs de-facto become a third type of Ethereum client, just as important to the network\u2019s security as execution clients and consensus clients are today.\u201d\n\nThe other two clients are the \u201cconsensus\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d clients. The consensus client implements proof-of-stake to ensure nodes in the network reach agreement, while the execution client listens to new transactions broadcast to the network, executes them in standard EVM and holds a copy of the latest state of the blockchain.\n\nIn championing the idea of zk-EVM verification at the Ethereum base layer, Buterin firstly considered the advantages and drawbacks of treating the layer 1 as a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d by pushing almost all activity to layer 2\u2019s.\n\nHe said many layer 1-based apps would become \u201ceconomically nonviable\u201d and that small funds \u2014 worth a few hundred dollars or less \u2014 may get \u201cstuck\u201d in the event that gas fees grow too large.\n\nButerin explained that zk-EVMs would need to be \u201copen\u201d in that different clients each have different zk-EVM implementations and each client waits for a proof that is compatible with its own implementation before accepting a block as valid.\n\nHe prefers this approach because it wouldn\u2019t abandon the \u201cmulti-client\u201d paradigm, and an open zk-EVM infrastructure would also ensure that new clients could be developed, which would further decentralize Ethereum at the base layer.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum\n\nButerin said zkEVMs might be the solution to \u201cThe Verge,\u201d a part of the Ethereum roadmap that aims to make verification at the base layer easier.\n\nButerin acknowledged that the zk-EVM infrastructure might cause data inefficiency and latency issues, however, he said those challenges wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctoo hard\u201d to overcome.\n\nIf the zk-EVM ecosystem is implemented, it would make running a full node on Ethereum even easier, Buterin explained:\n\n\u201cEthereum blocks would be smaller than today, anyone could run a fully verifying node on their laptop or even their phone or inside a browser extension, and this would all happen while preserving the benefits of Ethereum\u2019s multi-client philosophy.\u201d\n\nEthereum layer-2 scaling platform Polygon has made considerable progress with its zk-EVM, having recently open-sourced its zkEVM to the Polygon mainnet on March 27, promising reduced transaction costs and increased throughput of smart contract deployments.\n\nStarkWare, ConsenSys, Scroll, zkSync and Immutable are also deploying similar zkEVM scaling solutions.\n\nMagazine: Attack of the zkEVMs!

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThere is a growing clamor for the scalability of transactions on Ethereum, and one of the protocols with the right technology to do this, zkSync, is breaking impressive milestones. According to new data from crypto market analytics platform Dune Analytics, the newly launched zkSync mainnet Era is garnering immense and intense traction among users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from Dune, the zkSync Era now has a total of 59,200 ETH tokens that have been bridged, while more than 254,500 wallets have been created in all. Atop all of the metrics listed, total transactions numbering close to 300,000 complemented the growth in the ecosystem across the board.\n\nZkSync Era \ud83d\udcca\n\n\n\n- 59.2k $ETH bridged\n\n- 254.5k wallets\n\n- 299.2k transactions\n\n\n\n95%+ bridged <1 $ETH, the majority of wallets being \"newbies\" according to this dashboard by @gm365\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0fhttps://t.co/0e29xQ6fxn \u2014 Dune (@DuneAnalytics) April 3, 2023\n\nScalability is notably a major challenge for most protocols as it is technically difficult to achieve scalability and decentralization easily. zkSync solves this problem through its hyperscalability feature that tends to process an unlimited number of transactions without a marginal impact on security or cost.\n\nThe launch of zkSync has been tagged as the future of scalability on Ethereum, and many legacy users of the network are gradually coming to appreciate what the scaling outfit is bringing to the table.\n\nzkSync to help raise bar on Ethereum\n\nWith solutions for scalability being floated by zkSync, the bar is currently being raised for the so-called Ethereum killers who boast of higher scalability and plan to use this as a basis for dethroning Ethereum as the biggest smart contract hub.\n\nWhile zkSync is also raising the bar for Ethereum-based scalability protocols, Polygon has tapped into the ZK technology with the launch of the zkEVM protocol. The ZK innovations are being backed by many of the top developers on Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin, who signed the first transaction when Polygon's zkEVM protocol launched.\n\nEthereum is changing hands at $1,807.97, up 3.10% in the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLeading NFT attendance badge service POAP announced Tuesday that it will soon begin charging commercial clients for access to its services, ending the company\u2019s years-long policy of offering all users unlimited POAP minting for free.\n\n\u201cOur goal for the long run is to bring POAPs to humanity more broadly, and getting there will require long-term sustainability to be more of a priority,\u201d the company said in an email sent to POAP users today.\n\nPOAP, or Proof of Attendance Protocol, is an Ethereum-based app that helps event organizers give out attendance badges in the form of NFTs, minted using the ERC-721 token standard. Those badges, called POAPs, can be used to show proof of attendance at a physical or virtual event, as well as to unlock a variety of benefits and experiences post-mint, including access to group chats, discounts, and ticketing for future events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPOAP raised $10 million in a seed funding round last year to further its development. According to the company, over 6.5 million POAPs have been minted since it launched in 2019.\n\nPOAPs will still be free for personal use, per the company. Companies and individuals who distribute POAPs at commercial events, though, may be subject to charges based on the number of POAPs they issue, beginning April 17.\n\nAccording to Isabel Gonzalez, POAP\u2019s co-founder, prices for commercial clients will likely converge around $1 per POAP issued. Current commercial users, however, will be able to opt into special pricing at one quarter that cost, for an unspecified period of time.\n\nNot all commercial customers will be charged for their use of POAPs, though. Certain ventures that further POAP\u2019s artistic and creative mandate may continue to be subsidized by the company on a case-by-case basis, according to Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cWe like people creating true precious digital collectibles more than we care that they pay,\u201d Gonzalez told Decrypt. \u201cThe efforts that go into good storytelling are worth their own weight in gold.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParticularly in Web3, where the line between community and company is often razor-thin, determining whether an event or project is personal or commercial can pose a daunting task. POAP has released detailed guidelines outlining the telltale diferences between a personal event (a wedding with under 200 attendees where collectors know the issuer directly) versus a commercial one (a concert with thousands of attendees where a POAP unlocks financial perks).\n\nSome factors taken into consideration in determining whether a project is personal and commercial\u2014such as whether \u201can emotional connection\u201d exists between a POAP issuer and collector (telltale sign of personal usage)\u2014may prove harder to parse. As a general rule, according to the POAP guidelines, events requiring large amounts of POAPs (especially in an automated fashion) will most likely be considered commercial ventures.\n\nGonzalez, who said ideas for a commercial use tier have been floating around POAP since early last year, hopes the move will encourage its users to consider the best applications for its services, in addition to cementing the company\u2019s staying power.\n\n\u201cWe believe this evolution will expand the range of possibilities for how POAP can be used sustainably, in part by giving issuers tools to align their plans with POAP\u2019s mission of creating precious digital collectibles,\u201d she said."

On April 6, the company will launch 3,800 Ethereum NFTs spanning a mix of POGs and slammers with unique artwork for each, at a price of 0.049 ETH (about $90 as of this writing).\n\nThe NFTs can be used within a slate of upcoming Ethereum-based video games, which are set to launch this summer.

Frisbee said that it mimics the classic slammer-tossing playground experience, relying on a combination of timing, skill, and luck for players to succeed.\n\nSome of the NFTs will feature artwork from popular NFT projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Moonbirds. Bored Ape holders can use or license out their owned artwork for commercial products, while the open-source Moonbirds artwork is free for anyone to commercialize. Other POGs NFTs are based on projects like Neo Tokyo and Viva La Vandal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond this week\u2019s mint, Frisbee and team plan to release physical packs of Web3 project-themed POGs in May via a token-gated platform, letting owners of POG NFTs access the marketplace to purchase limited edition POGs based on the NFTs.\n\nFrom there, Frisbee has a number of ideas on how to further embrace Web3 with POGs. He envisions a potential play-for-keeps physical game that uses NFC chips within the POGs themselves, and then automatically transfers the tokenized ownership from the loser\u2019s wallet into the winner\u2019s.\n\nThe goal with POGs NFTs, he said, is to deliver digital collectibles that feed into video games, but also pair with the physical POGs experience.\n\nHe teased plans to bring physical POGs back in a big way, with the NFT expansion and celebrity partners intended to \u201cbring the right buzz for when the official distribution of those POGs comes back globally.\u201d"

By combining several transactions into one proof, Layer 2 protocols in ZK rollups have scaled Ethereum and successfully utilized ZK proofs.\n\nZK-EVMs, however, de facto become a third sort of Ethereum client, just as crucial to the network\u2019s security as execution clients and consensus clients are now, as they develop to verify execution on Mainnet.\n\nVitalik aims to preserve the advantages of the \u201cmulti-client philosophy\u201d while simultaneously making use of ZK-EVMs to increase the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and decentralization as the ecosystem grows.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder stated that if users use ZK-EVMs to verify layer 1, they could use a Single ZK-EVM, Closed multi ZK-EVM, or Open multi ZK-EVM.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the main technical issues of deploying ZK technology with many clients are related to latency and data inefficiency.\n\nAdditionally, because different ZK-EVM implementations or protocol rules are interpreted differently by different Ethereum clients, zero-knowledge proofs are handled differently by each client, says Buterin.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder says that the latency challenge could be addressed by being careful when designing the single-slot finality protocol and the data efficiency issue would have to be addressed by having a separate protocol for aggregating verification-related data.\n\n\u201cClients will likely start experimenting with ZK-EVMs to prove Ethereum block execution on their own, especially once we have stateless clients and there\u2019s no technical need to directly re-execute every block to maintain the state,\u201d Buterin added.\n\nSubscribe to The Crypto Times to Learn More About Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Outlooks!!"

The team claimed that even though the Ethereum network brought about the Web3 revolution through smart contracts, it cannot build the future of blockchain on its own.\n\nTo celebrate its launch, the Astar team invited community members to tune into a panel discussion led by its executives and various Polkadot developers to discuss how WASM can be utilized. Furthermore, the company will meet with its infrastructure partners who will build the foundations for the WASM environment.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum\n\nIn other news, Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon has recently released its zkEVM beta to its mainnet, letting developers deploy smart contracts at lower costs.

        "title": "Ethereum Locked-in Beacon Contract Surpasses 18 Million - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": ".\n\nThe number of validators on the Ethereum blockchain has increased rapidly, with 67,500 new validators arriving on the network from January 1, 2023, to the end of Q1.\n\nCurrently, the number of ETH locked in the Beacon contract is over 18 million, representing 15% of the total supply, and the ETH price has risen 50% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network currently operates with 13,299 physical nodes in 81 countries, and the USA, Germany, and Finland have the highest node density.\n\nLess than 10 days to Shanghai upgrade. With this upgrade, ETH stakers on the ETH 2.0 contract can withdraw their funds if they wish. This allowed the number of validators on the Ethereum blockchain to increase rapidly.\n\nAccording to BeaconScan data, 67,500 new validators arrived on the network from January 1, 2023, to the end of Q1. The number of validators, which was 495,270 on January 1, increased to 562,787 as of April 1. On January 12, an important milestone was passed in the Ethereum blockchain, the number of validators exceeded 500,000. The biggest jump took place between February 25 and March 1. 16,700 new validators joined the network with the official date set for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network currently operates with 13,299 physical nodes in 81 different countries. The three countries with the highest node density are the USA (36.57%), Germany (17.50%), and Finland (6.18%).\n\nNumber of Ethereum Validators to Decrease After Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe process of staking ETH on Ethereum 2.0 started in December 2020. Since then, anyone who has locked their 32 ETH on the Beacon Chain can become a validator in the network and have a say in the consensus mechanism. The function of validators in the Ethereum network is to validate that transactions and blocks are valid\n\nIt is expected that the number of validators will first decrease and then increase again. Individuals and institutions can choose to stake ETH by being able to withdraw at any time.\n\nValidators are currently rewarded with 5.2% APR for this. Someone who staked 32 ETH with an average price of $600 in December 2020 would have made a profit of around 3.5 times with staking rewards after about 2 and a half years. The profit rate will vary based on factors such as when the person stakes their coins and at what price they will sell them.\n\nWill There Be Pressure To Sell?\n\nAs of April 12, anyone who wants to can withdraw their funds also means they can sell their funds. This can lead to both a rapid price drop and a liquidity crisis. Santiment data shows that only 10.3% of the circulating ETH supply is found on crypto exchanges, the lowest amount since July 2015.\n\nCurrently, the number of ETH locked in the Beacon contract is over 18 million. This means there is around $32.5B worth of locked assets. 18 million ETH also represents 15% of the total supply. Delphi Digital has published a chart showing that Ethereum validators have earned 1.1 million ETH since December 2020. That\u2019s almost $2B.\n\nDefiLlama data, on the other hand, shows that 7.9 million ETH has been staked on liquid ETH staking protocols. Since the withdrawal option is open in these protocols, the amount of ETH in these protocols can change daily. Lido has the largest share with 74%, followed by Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH with 15% and Rocket Pool with 5.6%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) price has risen 50% since the beginning of the year. We can expect high volatility in price, especially in the days before and after the Shanghai upgrade."

Polygon and zkSync launched their zkEVMs on Ethereum mainnet a week ago, and multiple other teams are working towards establishing their own versions of the scaling solution.\n\nHowever, for zkSync, the launch has been somewhat difficult, with the zkSync Era network experiencing downtime a week after being launched.\n\nzkSync Era Fails to Produce Blocks for 4 Hours\n\nzkSync Era, the arguably first zkEVM to launch on Ethereum mainnet, has experienced downtime just a week after its highly-anticipated launch.\n\nOn Saturday, the zkSync Era network stopped producing blocks for four hours. This means that essentially all activity came to a grinding halt as no transactions were completed.\n\nEven more interestingly, it took a few hours for the zkSync team to acknowledge the network issues.\n\nNETWORK UPDATE: Today, the zkSync Era network experienced downtime from 1:52\u20136:02 AM CET. Our team identified the cause and resolved the issue, and the system is healthy and operating 100% as expected again. We'll provide a post-mortem with further details to the community soon. \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 1, 2023\n\nzkSync later apologized for the downtime and explained that the block production halted because of the database for the block queue failures.\n\n\u201cThe database for the block queue failed, causing block production to halt. The database health alert did not trigger because it could not connect to it to collect metrics.\u201d\n\nzkSync also said that when the issues started, the \u201centire team was together at an offsite\u201d and couldn\u2019t respond quickly. However, when the team noticed something was wrong, a fix was issued in five minutes.\n\nProtocol liveness is @zksync's second top priority after security.\n\n\n\nWe want to share, with full transparency, the details of this incident with our community.

        "title": "Should You Buy This New Crypto With Explosive Upside Potential? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When the new Arbitrum (CRYPTO:ARB) token started trading in crypto markets on March 23, it was arguably the most highly anticipated token debut of the year. Arbitrum had sparked tremendous investor interest as well as hype and speculation online after announcing earlier in the month that it would distribute more than 1 billion tokens to users, developers, and investors within its ecosystem in what is known as a crypto airdrop. As part of this airdrop, if you were an active user or developer of Arbitrum, you were entitled to claim free tokens that would be sent to your online crypto wallet.\n\nBut in many ways, the hype and speculation surrounding the airdrop was Arbitrum's downfall as soon as the token started trading. Many saw this as an opportunity to become a crypto millionaire overnight. On the first day of trading, Arbitrum fell by 90% from its early price of more than $11 as new token owners sold en masse and locked in profits. Arbitrum now trades for about $1.20.\n\nNonetheless, despite this early volatility, some Arbitrum bulls now predict that the token could double by the end of April. Here's the case for and against buying Arbitrum.\n\nThe Ethereum factor\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH 1.60%), much like Polygon (MATIC 2.06%) or Optimism (OP), and was created with one primary goal in mind: to make Ethereum run faster, better, and more efficiently. Instead of processing individual transactions on a one-by-one basis, Arbitrum \"rolls up\" tens of thousands of transactions into a single batch to reduce congestion on the Ethereum network. Because of this, Arbitrum can handle 40,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum can manage fewer than 40.\n\nIn terms of its prospects, Arbitrum is very much a leveraged bet on the future of Ethereum. As a Layer 2 token, Arbitrum essentially sits on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. Thus, if you have confidence in the growth prospects of Ethereum, then you should have confidence in the growth prospects of Arbitrum. At some point, Ethereum might not need Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum. However, until Ethereum reaches its long-promised goal of 100,000 transactions per second, there is still a need for Arbitrum.\n\nGrowth prospects\n\nArbitrum already ranks No. 4 in total value locked (TVL), one of the most important blockchain metrics used to evaluate how much activity is really happening on a blockchain. In fact, Arbitrum has already surpassed its Layer 2 peers in this regard. While Arbitrum now accounts for 4.48% of all TVL, Polygon can claim only a 2.15% share. Optimism is even lower, at 1.85%. Even Ethereum rivals such as Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) have lower TVL metrics than Arbitrum.\n\nThus, while it might be tempting to say that Arbitrum was overhyped, the numbers speak for themselves. Developers obviously trust Arbitrum and are using it for new blockchain projects. During the first week of trading, Arbitrum's TVL spiked by 20%.\n\nA crowded field\n\nWhile the long-term growth thesis for Arbitrum is attractive, the big thing to watch out for is that the Layer 2 field is getting more and more crowded. After The Merge, Ethereum still needs help in getting rid of congestion on its blockchain and settling transactions more quickly and cheaply. One of the biggest misconceptions about The Merge was that transaction speeds on Ethereum would increase dramatically. As a result, new Layer 2 competitors are continually entering the ring. That might be good news for Ethereum, but it could hurt future market share projections for any Layer 2 solution.\n\nInvestors recognize the importance of these Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, so their prices are soaring this year. Polygon is up almost 50% for the year, while Optimism is up 140%.\n\nEarly performance issues\n\nTheoretically, Arbitrum, as the newest Layer 2 competitor, should also be skyrocketing in value. So it's a bit concerning that the price of Arbitrum is just $1.20, which is nearly 90% below its all-time high of $11.80, which it set in its first hours of trading. If you look at a chart for Arbitrum, it's easy to see what happened: the price fell off a cliff immediately as anyone who had Arbitrum tokens sold as quickly as they could to lock in profits. Since that plunge on the first day of trading, Aribitrum has basically traded sideways in the $1.20 to $1.40 range.\n\nTo make a stock investing analogy, it would be much as if shares of a heavily hyped initial public offering (IPO) plummeted right out of the gate as insiders dumped everything they owned. For that very reason, there are specific IPO lockup periods to avoid an instant, mass sell-off. In the crypto world, however, lockup periods are optional, and not mandatory. Nevertheless, some analysts point to similar experiences with tokens such as Polygon as proof that a price reversal could be coming sooner rather than later for Arbitrum.\n\nShould you buy Arbitrum?\n\nRight now, there's an interesting situation in the Layer 2 market. There are several high-profile Layer 2 tokens (Polygon, Arbitrum, and Immutable) trading between $1.15 and $1.25. Optimism is an outlier here, trading at about $2.20. All of them do roughly the same thing -- help Ethereum run more efficiently -- and their prices appear to have clustered in the same range.\n\nIf you have to pick winners and losers in this crowded field, it might be easier simply to invest in Ethereum, which is the base layer blockchain responsible for all this growth. While I'm impressed with all the traction that Arbitrum has made in the Layer 2 market, I'm very much turned off by how the token traded straight out of the gate. In terms of a crypto that I can buy and hold for the long term, my preference is still Ethereum."

        "content": "BNB Chain was the king of rug pulls in the first quarter of 2023, with over 73.3% of such scams in the entire crypto ecosystem happening on the network, according to an April 4 report from blockchain security firm Immunefi.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cCrypto Losses in Q1 2023,\u201d investigated a variety of crypto hacks and scams in the first quarter of the year. It found that Ethereum and BNB Chain were the two largest targets for hackers and scammers, with 68.8% of total losses from these networks combined. BNB Chain, in particular, made up 41.3% of total losses from hacks and scams.\n\nOne type of scam, in particular, reigned supreme on BNB Chain: rug pulls, a type of scam where developers raise funds and then close up shop without delivering a product or service. Immunefi stated that 73.3% of all rug pulls in the crypto ecosystem happened on BNB Chain in the first quarter.\n\nRelated: Uniswap launches on BNB Chain ecosystem to drive growth and liquidity\n\nImmunefi tech Lead Adrian Hetman speculated that the large number of rug pulls on the chain may be due to a culture that promotes forking open-source code:\n\n\u201cBNB Chain still has a serious issue with developers using forked code. Its community lacks a security-first approach and attracts many users looking for a quick way to earn money. That\u2019s why we continue to see the biggest number of exploits and rug pulls in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nDespite the prevalence of these scams on BNB Chain, Immunefi also stated that rug pulls and other frauds are a much smaller problem in the crypto community than hacks or exploits. Hacks were the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d of losses in Q1 2023, the report said, whereas all frauds combined (including rug pulls and other scams) made up only 4.3% of total losses.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has seen spectacular hacks and exploits, draining millions of dollars from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. On Feb. 1, the DeFi lending app BonqDAO was the victim of an oracle hack, losing $120 million in crypto. On Feb. 17, decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible was hacked for over $2 million. And on March 13, Euler lost over $195 million of crypto in the largest DeFi attack of the quarter."

For instance, V3 will offer considerably lower fees\u2014up to 25 times lower compared to the previous version.\n\nAs noted earlier, CAKE\u2019s revenue had been on a declining trend. V3\u2019s lower fee could attract new users, which could then result in an increase in the network\u2019s revenue.\n\nApart from low fees, another key aspect of PancakeSwap V3 is capital efficiency. By selecting a specific price range when providing liquidity, liquidity providers could now \u201cconcentrate\u201d their capital into smaller price intervals with V3. It was also interesting to note that PancakeSwap V3 was built on top of Uniswap V3 with added refinements.\n\nWill V3 propel MATIC?\n\nThough the update looks promising, PancakeSwap\u2019s network value does not seem to have been affected positively yet. This was evident from a look at DeFiLlama\u2019s data, which pointed out CAKE\u2019s stagnant TVL. However, the V3 launch brought hope for a change in the coming weeks, as it might help increase CAKE\u2019s TVL.\n\nBefore the launch, CAKE\u2019s price was under the bears\u2019 influence. However, things seemed to have started to change as CAKE\u2019s declining momentum slowed down. According to CoinMarketCap, CAKE was trading nearly 0.4% lower than yesterday. At the time of writing, it was valued at $3.68 with a market capitalization of over $673 million.\n\nThanks to the relatively better price action, CAKE\u2019s MVRV ratio also recovered slightly on 4 April. Whales\u2019 interest in CAKE also increased as whale transaction counts spiked lately. CAKE\u2019s volume increased considerably, reflecting investors\u2019 interest in trading the token. Another positive development was that CAKE\u2019s weighted sentiments drifted up swiftly, which indicated the crypto community\u2019s confidence in the token.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 CAKEs worth today?\n\nGoing forward\n\nThe effects of V3\u2019s launch might soon be reflected in CAKE\u2019s chart, as suggested by a few market indicators. The MACD displayed a slight bullish crossover, suggesting a price hike in the near term. PancakeSwap\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a slight uptick and was headed towards the neutral mark, which looked bullish.\n\nHowever, nothing can be said with utmost certainty as CAKE\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) went down and was resting below the 50 mark."

LSDs are financial instruments that allow investors to retain their staked assets\u2019 earning potential while maintaining liquidity. They enable token holders to participate in various DeFi applications and earn yields while still having the flexibility to trade their staked assets.\n\nAccording to analyst Dynamo Patrick, LSD\u2019s have become increasingly popular in the crypto space and have overtaken many sectors in the DeFi space, and have managed to rank second in terms of deposits made in the sector.\n\nPopular LSDs in the crypto space include Lido, Frax Finance, and Rocket Pool.\n\nA large majority of the staked ETH has been deposited through Lido. According to Dune Analytics\u2019s data, 31.4% of all staked ETH has been deposited through the protocol. Due to the dominance of Lido, the protocol has seen a massive surge in TVL over the last few months.\n\nCoupled with that, the revenue generated by Lido increased by 22.1% over the last month. The main reason for the spike in revenue on the network would be the increased daily activity on the protocol.\n\nNot just Lido\n\nHowever, it won\u2019t just be Lido that is impacted by the interest in staking, other protocols, such as Frax Finance and Rocket Pool also stood a chance of benefiting from the attention on LSDs.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s XRP\u2019s market cap in LDO\u2019s terms\n\nEach protocol\u2019s token, LDO, RPL and FRAX has started to witness a rise in interest as a result.

The expert identified BTC liquidity stacked at the $29,000 level where there is a series of \u201cstop loss\u201d set up by traders. The analyst supports his theory of a \u201cbull trap\u201d with an imbalance on the one-hour time frame at $29,000.\n\nCrypNeuvo is convinced of a pullback after Bitcoin\u2019s run up to $29,000, based on the liquidation levels heatmap.\n\nBitcoin liquidation levels heatmap\n\nWhile Bitcoin yielded massive gains since the beginning of 2023, emerging as one of the highest performing assets, this is likely to end soon.\n\nKyledoops, a YouTuber at Crypto Banter uses CrypNeuvo\u2019s thesis to support the alt season narrative. When Bitcoin completes the \u201ccorrection\u201d or pull back, it is likely to fuel capital rotation in altcoins, as seen typically in previous alt seasons.\n\nAltcoins are finding support, steadying before alt season kicks in\n\nAltcoins wiped out their gains over the weekend with the exception of few in the top 30 assets by market capitalization. In his latest YouTube live stream, Kyledoops noted that altcoins have started their recovery against Bitcoin, gearing up for alt season.\n\nAnalysts are closely watching Bitcoin\u2019s price chart and key resistance levels for signs of the alt season.\n\nAltcoins to watch: ARB, MAGIC, Ethereum Layer 2 coins\n\nIn addition to blue chip altcoin projects ImmutableX (IMX), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX), analysts are closely monitoring Arbitrum (ARB), Magic (MAGIC) and Layer 2 coins for gains this alt season.\n\nAmong all narratives this cycle, the Ethereum Layer 2 narrative is heating up with the announcement of airdrops and rewards in the ecosystem. MATIC, ARB, Optimism (OP) and IMX are the most popular tokens in the Layer 2 ecosystem and these cryptocurrencies are likely to recover in the short-term. These tokens witnessed a rally in the past week before wiping out gains over the weekend.\n\nLayer 2 coins\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding ARB, there are wallet addresses on-chain, accumulating the token. A recovery in ARB is likely once the uncertainty surrounding the token settles. Hustle, a pseudonymous analyst on Crypto Banter, is bullish on ARB and MAGIC in the next phase of alt season."

        "content": "Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots who were trying to perform \u201csandwich trades\u201d got outsmarted by a rogue validator, leading to a loss of $25 million worth of digital assets.\n\nIn a tweet, blockchain security firm CertiK highlighted that bots trying to execute sandwich transactions \u2014 spotting when traders are trying to purchase tokens and getting in between the trade for some profit \u2014 lost a massive amount of crypto to a validator that went rogue.\n\n#CertiKSkynetAlert\n\n\n\nIt appears that several MEV bots were exploited in Ethereum block https://t.co/6GwTvIKfPA\n\n\n\nThe MEV bots were executing sandwich trades which start by swapping millions for a small amount of tokens. The reverse transactions were then replaced by a validator. pic.twitter.com/6v051qg9U8 \u2014 CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 3, 2023\n\nAs the bots began to swap millions, the reverse transactions were replaced by a validator, according to CertiK. This eventually led to a loss of $1.8 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), $5.2 million in USD Coin (USDC), $3 million in Tether (USDT), $1.7 million in Dai (DAI) and $13.5 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH). Most of the funds have been transferred to three different wallets at the time of writing.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, CertiK went into more detail about how the attack happened. The security firm explained that the vulnerability was because of the \u201ccentralization of power\u201d with the validators. As the MEV bots tried to perform a front-run and a back-run in transactions for profit, the rogue validator swooped in to back-run the MEV\u2019s transaction, leading to the losses.\n\nRelated: CoW Swap hacker milks over 550 BNB using \u2018solver\u2019 exploit\n\nThe CertiK team told Cointelegraph that this event is one of the largest exploits on MEV bots that they have recorded since September 2022. They explained that:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recorded a total of approximately $27 million since MEV bot exploits since September 2022, with this incident accounting for the vast majority.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the CertiK team also highlighted that this could affect other MEV searchers that are conducting strategies like sandwich trading. \u201cThere is a possibility that MEV searchers will be wary of conducting non-atomical strategies, such as sandwich trading, since this exploit only really affects this particular strategy,\u201d the team said.\n\nWhile MEV bots have the potential to earn vast amounts of digital assets, they are also prone to hacks and exploits. On Sept. 28, 2022, an MEV bot earned 800 Ether (ETH), worth $1 million at the time, through arbitrage trades. An hour later, the bot lost everything to a hacker who exploited a vulnerability in the bot\u2019s code.\n\nMagazine: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health"

        "title": "Vitalik Proposes zk-EVM Integration For Ethereum $ETH - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "In a recent post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delved into the potential integration of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zk-EVMs) at Ethereum's base layer, which could expedite the verification process without sacrificing decentralization and security.\n\n\n\nAccording to Buterin, the use of zk-EVMs could execute smart contracts on the blockchain through ZK proofs.\n\nButerin emphasized Ethereum's \"multi-client philosophy,\" which fosters decentralization at the protocol level. Introducing zk-EVMs at Ethereum layer 1 would result in a third type of client, joining \"consensus\" and \"execution\" clients. The consensus client employs proof-of-stake to ensure agreement among network nodes, while the execution client processes new transactions using standard EVM and maintains an up-to-date copy of the blockchain state.\n\nIn weighing the pros and cons of treating layer 1 protocols as a \"clearinghouse\" by transferring most activities to layer 2, Buterin cautioned that layer 1-based apps could become \"economically nonviable.\" Furthermore, small funds may get \"stuck\" if gas fees escalate.\n\nButerin elaborated that an \"open\" zk-EVM system would necessitate different clients with distinct zk-EVM implementations, wherein each client awaits a proof compatible with its implementation before validating a block. This approach would preserve the \"multi-client\" paradigm and facilitate the development of new clients, further decentralizing Ethereum at the base layer.\n\nAccording to Buterin, zk-EVMs might be the solution to \"The Verge,\" an aspect of the Ethereum roadmap aimed at simplifying base layer verification. Although the zk-EVM infrastructure could create data inefficiency and latency challenges, Buterin believes these obstacles are surmountable.\n\nThe implementation of the zk-EVM ecosystem would simplify the process of running a full Ethereum node. As Buterin explained, Ethereum blocks would be smaller, and anyone could operate a fully verifying node on various devices, including laptops, phones, or browser extensions, all while maintaining the benefits of Ethereum's multi-client philosophy. The core argument here, at least in Buterin's stance, is the effective decentralization of political power, especially in the case of DAOs and emerging Ethereum-based and Ethereum-compatible projects.\n\nSignificant strides have been made with zk-EVM by Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform Polygon, which recently open-sourced its zkEVM to the Polygon mainnet on March 27. The move promises to decrease transaction costs and increase the throughput of smart contract deployments. Other organizations, such as StarkWare, ConsenSys, Scroll, zkSync, and Immutable, are also working on zk-EVM scaling solutions.\n\nButerin's contemplation of zk-EVMs at Ethereum's base layer showcases a commitment to balancing scalability with the platform's core values of decentralization and security. As layer 2 solutions progress and zk-EVMs move closer to implementation, the Ethereum ecosystem wloud also, by extension, experience significant advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and decentralization.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

They include enabling liquidity providers to focus their capital on smaller price ranges, a characteristic that leads to better fee earnings from the same amount of deposits.\n\nPancakeSwap V3 offers four trading charge tiers; 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%. V2 only offered one tier, which was 0.25%. Each fee tier can have a liquidity pool for each token pair, with asset pairs tending to gravitate toward the fee tier with the best incentives for both liquidity providers and traders.\n\nBy encouraging the largest amount of liquidity from Liquidity Providers, this strategy aims to strike a balance between traders paying the lowest fee tier and other participants.\n\nTwo additional features will be added to PancakeSwap V3 in the future: a position management function and the V3 \u201cVIP\u201d trading rewards program.\n\nThe VIP program is a tiered structure that rewards traders for their trading volume with special advantages including the potential to receive a 5% trading fee rebate \u2013 which may encourage more platform activity and increase PancakeSwap\u2019s revenue.\n\nUsing the \u201cposition manager\u201d feature, traders can seamlessly deposit liquidity and gradually optimize that position based on costs and benefits. By doing away with the necessity for manual calculations for third-party integrations, the tool enables users to automatically alter their positions and earn fee incentives while remaining within bounds.\n\nRead also;"

        "content": "PancakeSwap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the BNB Chain, announced today the launch of its much-anticipated version 3 (v3) ecosystem upgrade. The update will be available on BNB Chain and Ethereum.\n\nPancakeSwap Debuts V3\n\nThe protocol\u2019s last upgrade to v2 occurred in April 2021. In the latest modification, PancakeSwap lives up to its promise to deliver a competitive trading fee in four tiers \u2013 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%. These fees are 25 times lower than v2 fee grades, which sat at 0.25%.\n\nThe DEX regards the fee ranking as a suitable balance \u201cbetween traders paying the lowest fee tier\u201d and incentivizing the highest liquidity from LPs.\n\nAnother updated feature of the latest v3 upgrade is capital efficiency. Unlike the v2 modification that generated low yield as liquidity was evenly distributed, the newest version will allow liquidity providers to concentrate their assets in sections where more trading activities occur. In other words, liquidity providers will see more gains from yield farming, making their funds work harder for them.\n\nOther features unveiled in the latest upgrade include an improved smart router, automatic APR display and ROI calculator to improve trading activities.\n\nThe developers behind PancakeSwap also added that the v3 upgrade would see two new features in the future, a built-in limit order that will allow for the creation of effective limit orders and a VIP trading rewards program that will introduce a 5% trading fee rebate.\n\nPancakeSwap v3 is Available on Two Blockchains\n\nThe decentralized exchange is integrated with three blockchains, BNB Chain, Aptos, and Ethereum. However, the latest ecosystem improvement will be BNB Chain and Ethereum.\n\nInterestingly, PancakeSwap\u2019s v3 upgrade was built on top of Uniswap\u2019s v3 launched in May 2021. It makes the exchange compatible with tools on Uniswap v3 while giving more refinements. Note that Uniswap is the leading DEX with a total value locked (TVL) of $3.93 billion, while PancakeSwap has $2.47 billion, as shown on the analytics platform DeFiLlama.\n\nMeanwhile, the v3 upgrade had minimal effect on the protocol\u2019s native token CAKE. The asset traded at $3.71 at press time.\n\nYour crypto deserves the best security. Get a Ledger hardware wallet for just $79!"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has seen a lot of ups and downs over the years, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) being the two most dominant players in the market.\n\nWhile these two cryptocurrencies have enjoyed great success and have seen some incredible price increases in the past, experts believe that RenQ Finance (RENQ) is poised to outperform them in terms of returns in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the reasons behind this prediction and what it means for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nThe Rise of RenQ Finance\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to create a more accessible and decentralized financial ecosystem. The platform provides users various decentralized financial services, including yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision. By utilizing blockchain technology, RenQ Finance eliminates the need for intermediaries and centralized authorities, making financial services more accessible to all.\n\nRenQ Finance has become a popular investment option among traders and investors due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and a strong emphasis on security and interoperability. The platform\u2019s ongoing presale has been a success, with the first three presale stages raising $4.5 million in just four weeks.\n\nRenQ Finance has experienced a surge in price, increasing by approximately 1500% to reach its current price of $0.035. Experts believe that RenQ Finance has the potential to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of returns in 2023 if it continues to perform at this pace.\n\nThe platform\u2019s commitment to creating an accessible and inclusive financial ecosystem, combined with its use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology for investment strategies, makes RenQ Finance a unique player in the DeFi space with promising growth potential.\n\nBitcoin could test new highs in 2023\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that operates without the need for a central bank or single administrator. It was introduced to the world in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin\u2019s popularity has since grown rapidly, and it has become the most well-known cryptocurrency worldwide.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has been volatile, but it has shown impressive growth in recent years. In 2021 alone, Bitcoin rallied nearly 70%, with industry insiders remaining bullish on its potential for further growth. Despite a dip in value after reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, experts predict that Bitcoin has the potential to reach new heights.\n\nSome experts believe that if Bitcoin were to reach its previous record high in 2023, it could easily surpass $100,000. This means that Bitcoin would need to rally by around 270% to hit this impressive milestone. Despite the potential for volatility, many investors and traders see Bitcoin as a valuable asset with significant potential for growth.\n\nEthereum to reach a new peak\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that enables the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts, providing users with more control over their digital assets and transactions without the need for a central authority.\n\nCurrently ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has a circulating supply of 120,457,776 ETH and is traded on various exchanges. Its all-time high price of $4,811 was reached over a year ago, and the cryptocurrency has since undergone price fluctuations.\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price stands at $1,813.82, reflecting a 0.76% change in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is valued at $216,441,564,793.78, and it has a year-to-date change of 52.08%.\n\nWith the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade scheduled for April 12 and the cryptocurrency\u2019s bullish performance, there are expectations that Ethereum could potentially reach new peaks before the end of 2023.\n\nWhy Experts Believe RenQ Finance Will Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nRenQ Finance is a promising cryptocurrency that has been gaining attention from investors and experts in the crypto industry.\n\nOne of the main reasons why experts are bullish on RenQ Finance is its relatively new status in the market. The platform\u2019s innovative approach to DeFi has yet to be fully reflected in its price, and as more investors become aware of its potential, demand for the token is likely to increase, driving its price up.\n\nFurthermore, RenQ Finance has recently seen a surge in price, with a 75% increase in value during its presale stages. Experts predict a potential price gain of 5000% for RENQ, which could make it a highly profitable investment option in the coming years.\n\nFinally, RenQ Finance\u2019s commitment to security and interoperability makes it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth and stability. The platform\u2019s use of blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and transparent, while its ability to facilitate cross-chain trading enables users to trade assets across different blockchain networks.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol PancakeSwap has launched version 3 of its automated market maker platform on BNB Chain and Ethereum, with the upgrade encompassing performance improvements and lower fees.\n\nEnhanced capital efficiency is cited as a key aspect of the upgrade, with a change in how liquidity providers can allocate capital on specific price intervals. In the previous version of PancakeSwap, liquidity from providers (LPs) was distributed uniformly along the price curve of trading pairs, which the platform notes was inefficient given that assets typically trade within certain ranges.\n\nV3 allows liquidity providers to select a custom price range to provide liquidity, allowing specific control over capital investments to higher volume trading ranges. The release also touts the provision of four new trading fee tiers from 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%, which is a change from V2\u2019s standard 0.25%.\n\nRelated: PancakeSwap governance proposal set to cap CAKE supply at 750M\n\nEvery token pair can have liquidity pools for each tier. PancakeSwap expects asset pairs to be drawn to tiers where incentives for LPs and traders align, with the approach an effort to balance between traders targeting the lowest fees while still incentivizing LPs.\n\nThe PancakeSwap team unpacked the different trading fee tiers in correspondence with Cointelegraph. Assets such as stable pairs where impermanent loss is low (price changes after depositing to a liquidity pool) and prices typically match fall into the 0.01% tier.\n\nThe higher percentage trading fee tiers cater to assets that have higher impermanent loss or lower liquidity. This mechanism intends to provide more fee revenue and incentive for LPs.\n\nPancakeSwap caters to a broad DeFi user base, accounting for over $2.5 billion of total value locked and serving over 1.5 million unique users.\n\nThe platform also revealed upcoming features that are still in development, including a trading rewards program incentivizing traders with exclusive benefits, while a position manager feature aims to improve user experience when depositing tokens as liquidity.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has been front and center in DeFi-related news in March, with its highly-anticipated airdrop seeing around $3.3 million consolidated from over 1,400 addresses into two controlling wallets.\n\nMagazine: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading"

        "content": "Cross-chain messaging protocol developer LayerZero Labs has raised another $120 million, according to an April 4 announcement. The company plans to use the capital to increase its headcount and expand its reach into the Asia-Pacific region. The company had previously raised $135 million in March 2022.\n\nLayerZero Labs is best known for its cross-chain messaging protocol, LayerZero, which is often used to create asset bridges between blockchain networks. It is also a supporter of the Stargate multichain bridge.\n\nWith the completion of this fundraising round, the company now has a $3 billion valuation. Over 33 investors participated in the latest funding round, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, BOND, Circle Ventures, Christie's, OpenSea Ventures and Samsung Next.\n\nRelated: Uniswap DAO debate shows devs still struggle to secure cross-chain bridges\n\nRyan Zarick, co-founder and chief technology officer of LayerZero Labs, said the new fundraise will help to create a multichain environment where applications can make the best use of each network\u2019s unique benefits:\n\n\u201cImagine a future where a single user-facing application can harness the speed of Solana, the security of Ethereum, and the cheap file storage of Arweave, while also being fully abstracted to the user.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis is our vision, made possible by the LayerZero protocol that seamlessly connects all blockchains and enables chain-agnostic applications to be built across various blockchains to create a best-in-class user experience. The days of choosing one chain to build on are over; the future is omnichain applications.\u201d\n\nThe issue of securing cross-chain messages has become acute in recent years, as more than $3 billion was stolen from blockchain bridges in 2022, according to a report from Chainanalysis. LayerZero has attempted to solve this problem by using a relayer and oracle to secure messages, where a message is only confirmed if both the relayer and oracle agree that it is valid.\n\nOn January 31, LayerZero received 37.58% of the vote to become Uniswap\u2019s bridge protocol for cross-chain governance between Ethereum and BNB Chain, coming in second behind Wormhole. On March 30, Gnosis announced that LayerZero would integrate with its multi-bridge platform, Hashi, to further increase the security of blockchain bridges."

        "content": "With the software solution provider MicroStrategy buying up Bitcoin (BTC) it underlines the growing institutional investment in cryptocurrency. But it also shows the faith that is held in major cryptos such as Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH) which have dominated the crypto market for the past several years. As we look at what has made these two so successful, we will look at an exciting presale coin Dogetti (DETI), and examine what could make it one of the breakout coins on the market.\n\nBitcoin Is The Oldest And Biggest Cryptocurrency To Purchase\n\nBitcoin tokens were bought in large droves by MicroStrategy, an enterprise data warehouse analytics and reporting tool that provides business intelligence software solutions. MicroStrategy has acquired a lot of Bitcoin, purchasing another 6,455 BTC tokens for approximately $150m across the past five weeks, roughly around $23,238 for every coin.\n\nThe depth of MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin investment underlines why the BTC token remains the largest and most widely used cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nBitcoin trading is popular amongst investors due to the resilience of the BTC token and is the most lucrative coin on the market. Right now Bitcoin trading is around $28,440 per token with a market cap of around $549 billion. The value in deciding to buy Bitcoin is that as the oldest cryptocurrency, it is essentially the gold of the crypto market, and is the most utilised and most trusted.\n\nEthereum Is The Most Trusted Blockchain For DeFi Projects\n\nOne of the most successful cryptocurrencies to date is Ethereum. The second-largest crypto, it has cultivated a reputation of trust, accessibility, and reliability. It might be smaller than Bitcoin, but its blockchain technology surpasses Bitcoin in many aspects and makes its platform a favourite for developers, particularly those in DeFi spaces.\n\nOn top of this, Ethereum is due for a major software upgrade called Shanghai which will allow Ether users to withdraw staked ETH coins freely. It\u2019s believed that with millions of ETH coins currently tied up, this upgrade would be a major boon as they can now stake and withdraw Ethereum tokens freely.\n\nWhat Could Make Dogetti A Successful Cryptocurrency?\n\nThe simplest description of Dogetti (DETI) would be as a crypto mafia dog. It borrows from famous gangster tropes to sell you a pitch on the importance of family and loyalty and regards its members as part of its family.\n\nDogetti\u2019s selling point is in how it embeds its members into what it does. This gives investors a stake in the meme-based cryptocurrency that they may not find elsewhere. It\u2019s reflected in the ecosystem of Dogetti (DETI). Take, for example, its NFT Marketplace which allows Dogetti members to buy, sell or trade digital assets. There is a 6% on transactions and from this 2% is shared among those holding DETI tokens. In addition, its feature DogettiDAO enables members of the Dogetti (DETI) family to have a say on the meme coin\u2019s future.\n\nDogetti (DETI) is appearing to be a potentially lucrative cryptocurrency for investors.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum's Upcoming EIP-4844 Upgrade Has Game-Changing Potential, Says Bitwise CIO - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Investments, recently shared his optimism for the future of Ethereum (ETH) and its upcoming upgrades.\n\nAccording to an article by The Daily Hodl published on Tuesday (April 4), during an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Hougan expressed his excitement about the development activity in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly regarding Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844). This upgrade aims to significantly reduce transaction costs, which could unlock many new applications.\n\nHougan said,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s going on in the Ethereum ecosystem and particularly EIP-4844 and how it will quash costs on layer-2 solutions. I think people don\u2019t understand how important that is. They don\u2019t understand the value of a price that\u2019s effectively zero. If you think about the cost of crypto transactions, it has gone from a few dollars on average with spikes into the hundreds to a handful of 20 cents,10 cents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be sub-penny by the end of this year if Ethereum executes on its roadmap. And the applications that open up at sub-penny that aren\u2019t open at 10 or 20 cents per transaction are really enormous. And I know that sounds very theoretical, but I think it\u2019s a game changer. So I\u2019m really excited about that.\u201c\n\nHougan also touched upon the current state of the crypto market and noted that investor confidence is beginning to return. He emphasized that we are in a bull market and expects more people to realize this fact as the year progresses.\n\nAccording to Binance Academy, EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal to enhance the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability. Sharding, a method of partitioning databases into smaller segments, improves efficiency and performance. When applied to the blockchain, specifically Ethereum, it can help lower transaction costs and increase throughput.\n\nDanksharding, a type of sharding proposed for Ethereum, is anticipated to increase Ethereum\u2019s transactions per second (TPS) to around 100,000. To put this into perspective, Ethereum\u2019s base layer processes about 15 TPS, and its layer 2 rollups handle roughly 100 TPS as of Q1 2023.\n\nEIP-4844 serves as the initial step before full danksharding implementation, aiming to increase TPS to approximately 1,000. One of its key features is the introduction of a new transaction type that accepts \u201cblobs\u201d of data, crucial for enabling full danksharding. The implementation of EIP-4844 is expected in the second half of 2023, though it could face delays.\n\nBinance Academy also highlights innovations in danksharding, such as the merged fee market, where a single proposer selects transactions for all shards, and proposer/builder separation to address the issue of maximal extractable value (MEV). These innovations contribute to Ethereum\u2019s potential growth and increased scalability.\n\nTwo months ago, Hougan appeared on the \u201cMaking Money with Matt McCall\u201d podcast, offering insights into the cryptocurrency market and assets investors should consider. He underscored the importance of having both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in one\u2019s portfolio, with Bitcoin being the go-to choice for institutions.\n\nRegarding Ethereum, Hougan praised the ecosystem\u2019s technological progress, with an impressive number of developers and rapidly decreasing transaction costs. He also suggested looking into Cosmos (ATOM) as an exciting alternative to the two major cryptocurrencies, pointing out its potential to drive the market forward in the future."

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) battles to hold support above $1,800, crypto traders and investors are carefully watching for any indicators suggesting that boosted growth is in the cards for the market\u2019s second-largest asset by market cap.\n\nBased on the current market analysis, the recent closing prices at key levels may influence the price of ETH\u2019s future performance. Specifically, the level of support at $1,671 serves as a crucial level of market interest, as it signifies the price point at which the demand for the asset has previously been strong enough to prevent it from falling further. If the price of ETH stays above this level, it could indicate that the demand for the asset is still strong, leading to a potential upward price trend.\n\nOn the other hand, the resistance level of $1,911 may be a significant challenge for ETH, as it represents a price level at which the asset has struggled to surpass in the past. If the price fails to break through this level, it could indicate a potential reversal in the asset\u2019s upward trend and may lead to a downward price trend.\n\nThus, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithms at the crypto tracking platform PricePredictions. As it happens, the algorithms using artificial intelligence (AI) technology predict that Ethereum will be trading hands at $1,823 on April 30, 2023, according to the latest data retrieved on April 3.\n\nEthereum 30-day price prediction. Source: PricePredictions\n\nSpecifically, this estimation relies on technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as moving averages (MA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), relative strength index (RSI), average true range (ATR), and others.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is trading at $1,806, recording a decrease of 0.92% on the day, but a gain of 2.94% across the previous week, adding up to a total market cap of $217.4 billion.\n\nEthereum 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, the Ethereum sentiment on the one-day gauges at the finance and crypto monitoring website TradingView is bullish. Namely, its summary suggests a \u2018buy\u2019 at 15, resulting from oscillators pointing at a \u2018buy\u2019 at two and moving averages in the \u2018strong buy\u2019 zone at 13.\n\nEthereum 1-day price gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum on-chain and technical indications point to a bullish argument for the price of ETH in the short to medium term. Despite a multitude of unfavorable developments, including the failure of FTX, hikes in interest rates, and more stringent restrictions in the United States, the price of Ethereum has more than doubled since reaching a low point in June, when it was about $880.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "How Blockchain Technology Makes File Storage More Practical and Cost-Effective - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Storing files on the blockchain is a crucial topic of discussion among blockchain enthusiasts and developers. While it is technically possible to store files directly on the blockchain, it is not a practical approach due to high costs and limitations in storage capacity. Let\u2019s explore alternative solutions for storing files in a decentralized and cost-effective manner using blockchain technology.\n\nWhy storing files directly on the blockchain is not feasible\n\nStoring files directly on the blockchain may seem like a logical solution for decentralized file storage, but it is not a practical one. There are several reasons why storing files directly on the blockchain is not feasible.\n\nFirst, storing files on the blockchain can be incredibly expensive. Blockchain transactions are processed using \u201cgas,\u201d which is a fee paid to the network to execute a transaction. The cost of storing a file on the blockchain would be proportionate to the size of the file. For example, storing a 1 MB file on the Ethereum blockchain would cost around $57,332.91 in gas fees alone at the time of writing of this article, which is not a viable option for most users.\n\nIn Ethereum, the block size is not determined by the maximum size limit, but rather by the gas limit. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas (or energy units) a user needs to complete the transaction. A higher gas limit means more work is required to complete a transaction. This cost varies with the transactional workload on the Ethereum network.\n\nFor example, it takes about 640,000 gas to store 1 kilobyte of data in a block (at a standard gas price of 20,000). Ethereum has a current block limit of 15 million gas, which can be expanded to 30 million based on demand. Therefore, the block size in Ethereum can be up to 46 kilobytes, depending on the gas limit.\n\nTo provide an example of the high cost of storing files on the blockchain, let\u2019s take the Ethereum blockchain as an example.\n\nThe Cost of Storing 1kb on Ethereum\n\nEthereum stores data in slots. Each slot is the size of 256 bits.\n\nAccording to Ethereum\u2019s yellow paper, It requires 20,000 gas to store a single slot of 256 bits.\n\n8 bits make one byte, so one slot is 32 bytes (256/8= 32 bytes).\n\n1kb equals 1024 bytes, so it has 32 slots (1024 bytes/32 bytes = 32 slots).\n\nThe amount of gas required to store 1kb is 32 slots*20,000 gas = 640,000 gas\n\nTo include the file in the call data transaction\u2019s field, it will cost additional gas.\n\nEach byte costs 16 gas so the total will be 32 slots * 32 bytes * 16 gas = 16,384 gas\n\nThe base gas fee for any transaction is 21,000 gas\n\nSo the total gas required to store 1kb = 640,000 + 16,384 + 21,000 = 677,384 gas\n\n1 gas is equal to 0.00000005 ETH\n\nSo to store 1kb it costs 677,384 gas* 0.00000005 = 0.0338692 ETH\n\nThe current price of ETH is $1,787.57 so the cost of storing 1kb will be $60.66\n\nThe Cost of Storing 1MB on Ethereum\n\n1MB = 1,000,000 byte\n\n1,000,000 byte / 32 bytes = 31,250 slots\n\n31,250 slots * 20,000 gas = 625,000,000 gas\n\n31,250 slots * 32 bytes * 16 gas = 16,000,000 gas for call data\n\nBase gas cost is 21,000 gas\n\nTotal gas = 625,000,000 + 16,000,000 + 21,000 = 641,021,000 gas\n\n1 gas is equal to 0.00000005 ETH\n\nSo store 1MB it costs 641,021,000 gas * 0.00000005 ETH = 32.05105 ETH = $57,332.91\n\nClearly, this cost is prohibitive for most users and businesses, making storing files directly on the blockchain an unrealistic option. However, there are alternative methods for decentralized file storage that are more practical and cost-effective, which we will explore in the next section.\n\nStoring files in a decentralized way\n\nDecentralization is a fundamental concept in the blockchain world, and the same goes for file storage. Decentralized file storage ensures that data is not stored in one central location, which can be a single point of failure. In a decentralized storage system, data is distributed across multiple nodes or computers, making it more secure and less vulnerable to attack or manipulation. This distributed architecture also ensures that no single entity has complete control over the data, ensuring greater transparency and accountability.\n\nIn a decentralized file storage system, metadata plays a crucial role. Metadata is data that describes other data and provides context, making it easier to manage and locate specific files. In the context of decentralized file storage, metadata typically includes information about the file\u2019s location, access rights, and other attributes. The metadata is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable and transparent, which ensures that the data cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhile storing files directly on the blockchain is not feasible due to high costs and technical limitations, storing a document\u2019s hash on-chain while keeping the whole document elsewhere is a practical solution. The document could be stored in a centralized database or on a distributed file storage system, while the hash is stored on the blockchain. By putting the document through a secure hash algorithm like SHA-256 and storing the hash in a block, the hash value becomes a unique digital fingerprint of the document. This approach saves a huge amount of space and cost, as hash values are far smaller than whole documents. Moreover, it ensures the integrity and authenticity of the original document, as any change in input would result in a completely new hash value, different from the original document.\n\nDecentralized storage networks\n\nDecentralized storage networks offer a way to store data in a distributed and secure manner. Unlike traditional centralized storage services, which store data on a single server or data center, decentralized storage networks store data on a global network of nodes. This makes them less susceptible to data breaches and data loss, as data is redundantly stored in multiple locations.\n\nExamples of decentralized storage networks include Arweave, Filecoin, and Storj. These networks work by allowing users to rent out their unused storage space in exchange for tokens or other rewards. When a user wants to store a file, it is broken up into multiple pieces and distributed across the network of nodes. The data is encrypted and replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring that even if one node fails, the data is still available. Let\u2019s explore Arweave and Filecoin more in the following sections.\n\nArweave\n\nArweave\u2019s innovative approach to decentralized storage is called the permaweb, a permanent and decentralized web built on top of the Arweave. The permaweb consists of a set of modular and interchangeable protocols. It addresses the critical flaw of the traditional web, which is the lack of memory. When documents are removed from one server in the network, they are lost from the knowledge base. The permaweb on Arweave allows developers and users to share a resilient knowledge base that is replicated in vast numbers across the world, perpetually.\n\nThe base protocol of the permaweb is Arweave, which is powered by two fundamental components: a scalable blockchain-like structure that uses a new mining system and a sustainable endowment to ensure the availability and permanence of arbitrarily-tagged data. This approach makes it possible to store large amounts of data in a decentralized manner without the high costs associated with blockchain storage. On top of the Arweave protocol is a decentralized network of gateway servers that makes the data easily accessible to web browsers without the need for modification or specialist software.\n\nBy combining these elements, the permaweb on Arweave provides a secure and decentralized storage solution that is designed to last for centuries. Unlike centralized storage solutions, which can be vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, the permaweb provides a resilient and immutable storage system that is resistant to tampering and censorship. It\u2019s no wonder that Arweave is quickly gaining recognition as one of the most promising decentralized storage networks on the market today.\n\nFilecoin\n\nFilecoin is a unique decentralized storage network that offers built-in economic incentives and cryptography to ensure files are stored reliably over time. This system is built on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol, which uses content addressing to allow permanent references to data and avoids relying on specific devices or cloud servers for addressing content. Filecoin extends the capabilities of IPFS by adding an incentive layer on top, incentivizing content to be reliably stored and accessed.\n\nFilecoin operates through a peer-to-peer network in which users pay to store their files on storage providers, which are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored them correctly over time. The available storage and the price of that storage are not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files in that anyone can participate in. This ensures that the storage costs are distributed evenly across the network, with no central authority controlling the prices.\n\nFilecoin has multiple use cases, including Web3 native NFT and metaverse/game assets storage, incentivized permanent storage, and archiving Web2 datasets as a cheaper alternative to cloud storage. For instance, NFT. Storage uses Filecoin to provide a simple decentralized storage solution for NFT contents and metadata, while Shoah Foundation and Internet Archive leverage Filecoin to back up their contents. Moreover, Filecoin supports a wide range of formats of data, including audio and video files, allowing Web3 platforms such as Audius and Huddle01 to leverage Filecoin as the decentralized storage back end for music streaming and video conferencing.\n\nBest practices for decentralized file storage\n\nWhen it comes to decentralized file storage, there are several best practices that should be followed to ensure data reliability, privacy, and security.\n\nFirstly, it is recommended to store the metadata on the blockchain, while storing the actual file in a decentralized storage network like Arweave or Filecoin. This way, the metadata can be publicly accessible and verifiable on the blockchain, while the actual file is stored in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\nSecondly, data redundancy is crucial to ensure that the data is always available and reliable. By storing multiple copies of the file in different locations, the risk of losing the data due to a single point of failure is greatly reduced. Decentralized storage networks often have built-in redundancy mechanisms to ensure data is always available.\n\nThirdly, protecting data privacy and security is of utmost importance. Encryption should be used to protect the data while in transit and at rest. Access to the data should also be controlled to ensure that only authorized parties can access it. Decentralized storage networks often offer built-in encryption and access control mechanisms.\n\nBest practices for decentralized file storage include storing metadata on the blockchain, utilizing a decentralized storage network for the actual file, ensuring data redundancy for increased reliability, and protecting data privacy and security. By following these best practices, users can ensure that their data is stored in a secure and reliable manner.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile it is possible to store files directly on the blockchain, the high cost and limitations in the amount of data that can be stored make it an impractical approach. Decentralized file storage networks such as Arweave and Filecoin offer a much more reliable and cost-effective method for storing files in a decentralized way. By utilizing a combination of storing metadata on the blockchain and the actual file on a decentralized storage network, data redundancy can be ensured for increased reliability. It is also important to prioritize data privacy and security in the storage process.\n\nAs the blockchain industry continues to grow, decentralized file storage is becoming more and more prevalent. It is important to understand the limitations of traditional file storage methods and to explore and utilize the various decentralized storage networks available for secure and reliable file storage. With the right approach and tools, decentralized file storage can provide a more robust and secure storage solution for individuals and businesses alike."
