        "content": "Ethereum Spot ETFs Could Be Next, According to Bloomberg Analyst\n\nWith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on January 10, the path is now clear for spot Ethereum ETFs to be approved in 2024, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nBalchunas believes there is a 70% chance that spot Ether ETFs will be approved by May, the month the SEC must make a final decision for several applications. Balchunas previously stated that he could not see a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved but spot Ether ETFs are not. He compared the two cryptocurrencies, saying that \"Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nThe earliest deadline for spot Ethereum ETFs decision is in May later this year for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF. BlackRock\u2019s deadline is in August, however if the SEC does approve, it could approve all applicants like it did for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nPrior to the SEC's spot Bitcoin approval, Valkyrie Funds' chief investment officer Steven McClurg said he wouldn't be surprised if spot Ether and XRP ETFs come to market after Bitcoin. Several major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs. The SEC must make decisions on these applications by various dates ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) gained 8.5% over the past 24 hours, and rallied over 15% in the past week, breaking above the $2.5K level, as investors speculate on the potential of a spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "According to CoinMarketCap, native tokens of Ethereum applications, including Lido DAO, Rocket Pool, and Aribtrum, take the lead ahead of spot Bitcoin ETF approval day.\n\nLido DAO (LDO) takes the top spot on the gainers on the Jan. 10 charts with a live price of $3.80, with a 24-hour trading volume reaching $385 million, in what is a 16.1% increase. The surge in the value of Ether (ETH) and native tokens of Ethereum-based applications is said to be driven by trader optimism surrounding the potential approval of an Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) following the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot Ether ETF, may have its way paved by the approval of its Bitcoin counterpart.\n\nTop crypto gainers of the day | CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: Stacks, Injective, Internet Protocol emerge as crypto top gainers\n\nFor similar reasons, Rocket Pool (RPL) has also seen an increase in value today, operating as a decentralized Ethereum staking pool that offers a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) of up to 4.3% for ETH2 staking. As of the most recent update, the live price of Rocket Pool stands at $31.76, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $22 million, revealing a 14.9% increase in Rocket Pool\u2019s value over the last 24 hours.\n\nRounding out the third spot is Arbitrum (ARB), which stands out as an Ethereum layer-two (L2) scaling solution, employing optimistic rollups to enhance speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness within the Ethereum network. As of the latest data, the live price of Arbitrum is currently $1.94, accompanied by a 12.1% increase in value.\n\nWith the market experiencing significant volatility this week in response to ETF updates, investors are making many big moves in the crypto space.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

However, ETH remained stable near the $2,180 and $2,170 levels. A low was formed near $2,170 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a decent increase above the $2,240 level. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,245 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the $2,320 resistance, but the bears were active near $2,350.\n\nA high was formed near $2,358 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor decline below the $2,320 level. The price moved below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high.\n\nETH is now trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,350 level. The next major resistance is now near $2,400.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main uptrend hurdle sits at $2,450. A close above the $2,450 resistance could start a decent upward move. The next key resistance is near $2,540. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,540, there could be a rally toward $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,350 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,280 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,260 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high. A downside break and a close below $2,260 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,170 support.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA crypto whale, or a large holder with a significant amount of cryptocurrency, just made a large purchase of 4,677 ETH, valued at roughly $11 million, according to data from Lookonchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interesting thing about this purchase is that it seems to reflect a bold bullish bet on the Ethereum price.\n\nThis whale appears to be bullish on ETH and bearish on BTC, according to Lookonchain. Surprisingly, the whale exchanged his wrapped Bitcoin for Ethereum, borrowing 241 WBTC worth $11 million from Aave, which he exchanged for 4,677 ETH.\n\nWhile the real intentions of the whale remain unknown, indications point to the fact that the whale expects the price of ETH to rise shortly.\n\nEthereum outperforms Bitcoin\n\nExpectations for Bitcoin ETF approval are rising, and eyes are currently on Ethereum, which is presently outperforming Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 2.11% in the last 24 hours to $45,647, following seesaw price activity in yesterday's trading. Ethereum, on the other hand, was up by 5.47% in this same time frame to $2,422.\n\nThis outperformance is causing Ethereum to rise against Bitcoin on multiple time frames. According to Matthew Hyland, a crypto analyst, this is not surprising, as both the BTC Futures in 2017 and the Coinbase IPO in 2021 saw ETH outperform BTC shortly after.\n\nWhile bullish expectations remain for the ETH price, it should be kept in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nOn the other hand, legendary trader Peter Brandt retains a bearish bias from the standpoint of a swing trader rather than a \"hodler.\"\n\n\"My bias remains to be short ETH,\" Brandt said in a tweet, noting his belief that the Ethereum chart lacks underlying strength."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, currently shows a lack of bullish momentum contrary to the generally bullish sentiment around Bitcoin spot ETFs. The ETH price has been resonating between the $2400 and $2140 horizontal levels for the past five weeks, with the overhead supply preventing the buyers from a higher rally. Will potential approval from the US SEC bolster the Ether price to escape this uncertainty?\n\n$2400 Breakout Will Trigger a Direction Rally\n\nA steep support trendline leads to the current recovery trend in the ETH price.\n\nA potential recovery may face new resistances at $2680 and $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $20.8 Billion, indicating a 68% gain.\n\nAn ascending trendline in the daily time frame chart shows the Ethereum price recovery is intact and the current sideways trend is likely a post-rally consolidation to recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum whales have accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of Ether despite its underperformance relative to Bitcoin. A recent tweet from renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals that the Ethereum smart money has significantly increased its holdings by accumulating more than 410,000 ETH tokens during the past month(December).\n\nThis accumulation amid the crypto market\u2019s progress towards the first spot Bitcoin ETF hints the ETH may also witness a major impact of US SEC approval as the potential for spot Ethereum ETF will also accelerate.\n\nBy press time, the ETH price shows a 3.77% jump and teases a bullish breakout from the $2400 resistance level. If buyers succeed in closing a daily candle above this barrier, it could lay a solid foundation for additional upward movement.\n\nSuch a breakout could potentially result in a 10% rise in ETH, setting its next target at around $2,680. Following this, a prolonged recovery could target the $3,000 and $3280 mark.\n\nThis Support Prevents ETH From Major Correction\n\nOver the past two months, the ETH price has been receiving dynamic support from an ascending trendline. The coin price rebounded several times from this support indicating the buyers are actively accumulating at a dip which is a key sign of sustainable recovery. Thus, it also indicates losing this support could intensify selling pressure and trigger a new correction in this asset.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator suggests the bullish momentum is strengthening.\n\nAverage Directional Index: A low value of ADX(15%) hints the ongoing consolidation has managed to offer buyers sufficient break to kickstart a new rally.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Trust Ethereum layer 2s? You shouldn't have to - DLNews",
        "content": "A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nEthereum layer 2 activity is surging. But are the rollups ready for it?\n\nProjects pick Celestia stakers for token airdrops\n\nDeFi security may not be ready for another bull run\n\nHow decentralised are layer 2s?\n\nDeFi users are piling into layer 2 blockchains, pushing several metrics to new highs.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nArbitrum, the biggest layer 2 by total value locked, surpassed the Ethereum mainnet in decentralised exchange transaction volume. At the same time, the combined TVL of all layer 2s registered a fresh all-time high of over $20 billion.\n\nEven smaller layer 2s like Metis are benefitting from the excitement surrounding Ethereum\u2019s scaling options.\n\nEthereum\u2019s faithful cheer the increased adoption of layer 2s, which are faster and cheaper than the main Ethereum network they rely on to finalise transactions.\n\nBut there\u2019s an elephant in the room: most layer 2s are still nowhere near as decentralised as they would like to be.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nUsers must trust that transactions are verified correctly by a centralised entity \u2014 usually the company building the layer 2 \u2014 instead of through a decentralised consensus like the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis is a problem because it goes against DeFi\u2019s founding principle of not having to rely on or trust any single entity to transact.\n\nFor the average DeFi degen, whether or not a specific layer 2 is decentralised probably doesn\u2019t matter that much.\n\nBut for more sophisticated investors \u2014 such as institutions \u2014 having to trust the companies behind layer 2s will make some think twice before committing serious cash to them.\n\nThe first layer 2 to fully decentralise its transaction processing should benefit greatly \u2014 and I expect at least one to make it happen in 2024.\n\nA new airdrop trend emerges\n\nCelestia stakers had a great start to 2024: two projects have promised them airdrops of valuable tokens, with another strongly hinting at the prospect.\n\nSo why are these projects being so generous?\n\nIn a nutshell, because they rely on the Celestia blockchain for their transaction validation, and those who stake their Celestia tokens are pivotal to that.\n\nIf the projects running on Celestia can incentivise more people to stake Celestia tokens, the more secure they are.\n\nIt\u2019s likely this new trend of airdropping tokens to Celestia stakers is only just beginning. More projects building on Celestia \u2014 such as Berachain, Monad, and Kinto \u2014 are also set to launch later this year.\n\nCertiK calls out DeFi security \u2014 then gets hacked itself\n\nCrypto security firm CertiK warns the brewing bull run will be a key test for the DeFi sector in a new report.\n\nCertiK said the DeFi industry needs to decrease the correlation between the money deposited into it and the total amount lost in hacks and scams, if it wants to be taken seriously.\n\nWhile CertiK makes a valid point, a security breach in its own house dampened its effect.\n\nJust two days after publishing the report, CertiK\u2019s X account was compromised following an employee\u2019s interaction with a scammer posing as a representative from a media organisation.\n\nThe breached CertiK account disseminated a message to the security firm\u2019s 343,000 followers, claiming a vulnerability in the decentralised exchange Uniswap\u2019s router contract and linking to a phishing site.\n\nAfter a year of mishaps for CertiK, where the firm signed off on multiple projects that went on to get hacked or rug pull depositors, 2024 isn\u2019t off to a great start.\n\nData of the week\n\nL2Beat provides a nifty dashboard that keeps track of how decentralised each Ethereum layer 2 is.\n\nWhen it comes to general-purpose layer 2s, Arbitrum is the furthest along, but it has yet to make validation permissionless.\n\nL2Beat keeps track of what stage of decentralisation each Ethereum layer 2 is at. (L2Beat)\n\nThis week in DeFi governance\n\nVOTE: Establish the Arbitrum DAO procurement committee\n\nTEMP CHECK VOTE: Add PayPal\u2019s PYUSD to the Aave v3 Ethereum market\n\nPROPOSAL: Make Celestia liquid staking safer and more aligned with the blockchain\n\nPost of the week\n\nWe couldn\u2019t pass up on the opportunity to highlight some rare praise for DefiLlama from one of crypto\u2019s most notorious pseudonymous voices: Gwart.\n\nWhile Gwart\u2019s posts are usually heavily sarcastic, we\u2019re hoping this one is sincere!\n\nI will say something nice here: the most useful thing in DeFi is DefiLlama \u2014 Gwart (@GwartyGwart) January 8, 2024\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nAnd now $3,000,000,000 of leveraged stETH on Aave that was \"very liquid\" is relying on $300mn of Curve liquidity; there is still virtually no off-chain liquidity.\n\n\n\nEspecially with volatility from ETF news, if any large stETH holder gets impatient and sells, things could get ugly https://t.co/jgNhjesvc5 pic.twitter.com/AFL4Di6NBQ \u2014 Riyad Carey (@riyad_carey) January 5, 2024\n\nCelsius\u2019 move to unstake its Ether holdings has clogged the validator exit queue.\n\nSeveral analysts, including Kaiko\u2019s Riyad Carey, have pointed out that such a situation could put liquidity for Lido\u2019s stETH token in a potentially perilous position.\n\nHave you joined our Telegram channel yet?

        "title": "Ethereum Price Technical Setup Suggests Fresh Surge Above $2,400 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price climbed higher above the $2,350 resistance. ETH outpaced Bitcoin and might even attempt a clear move above the $2,400 resistance.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase above the $2,350 resistance level.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key rising channel forming with support near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh surge if there is a close above the $2,400 level.\n\nEthereum Price Starts Increase\n\nEthereum price formed a base above the $2,220 level and started a fresh increase. ETH saw a sharp upward move despite a drop in Bitcoin below $46,500. The price gained pace for a move above the $2,300 and $2,320 levels.\n\nIt even broke the $2,350 resistance and tested the $2,400 zone. A high was formed near $2,399 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor drop below $2,360. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,243 swing low to the $2,399 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key rising channel forming with support near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,380 level. The next major resistance is now near $2,400. A clear move above the $2,400 level might send ETH toward $2,440. A close above the $2,440 resistance could start a decent upward move.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near $2,550. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,550, there could be a rally toward $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,400 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,243 swing low to the $2,399 high.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,300 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,300 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,240 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,150 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,400\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Despite ETHBTC trending lower in favor of Bitcoin (BTC), there is a chance that the second most valuable cryptocurrency will recover in the months ahead. Taking to X in support of Ethereum (ETH), a crypto analyst, Mckenna, said a favorable combination of protocol-related and regulatory factors may support ETH, plugging the bleed versus BTC and sparking a refreshing rally.\n\nEthereum Under-performing Bitcoin: Will This Continue?\n\nLooking at the ETHBTC weekly chart, it is evident that Bitcoin bulls have had the upper hand since August 2022. During this time, Bitcoin gained 42% versus ETH, with bulls pressing on when writing.\n\nTo illustrate, Bitcoin is at a 2022 low versus ETH and will likely extend gains once a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto community expects this authorization to cement Bitcoin\u2019s position, possibly drawing in billions in capital.\n\nSome analysts argue that this event could support altcoins, including Ethereum. So far, Ethereum, though edging lower versus Bitcoin, is firm against the USD. McKenna also notes that once a spot Bitcoin ETF is live in the United States, attention will shift to the SEC on whether it will also greenlight a similar product, but for Ethereum.\n\nThese 2 Factors Might Support ETH\n\nDespite the ETH weakness versus BTC, Mckenna expects Ethereum to recover in the medium to long term. This is because of the expected preference for proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems over proof-of-work (PoW) methods that power Bitcoin.\n\nPoW is a computationally intensive process that uses much energy for block confirmation. This has led to criticism from those who are concerned about the environmental impact of crypto mining. For this reason, Ethereum adopted a PoS system, fully transitioning in 2021 after the Merge.\n\nBeyond the energy efficiency, the analyst also notes that the PoS in Ethereum provides ETH stakers with a base yield that will be considered \u201cthe safest bond instrument in the entire digital asset space.\u201d Subsequently, this may support ETH, with many viewing it as a safe haven. This assurance is based chiefly on the fact that Ethereum is the second most valuable crypto network, with over $276 billion in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAdditionally, ETH will, in the long run, be deflationary following the activation of EIP-1559 in August 2021. This system burns a portion of gas fees- the base fee- taking a portion of ETH out of circulation. According to Ultra Sound Money, over 17,600 ETH have been destroyed in the last week alone, 1,000 ETH more than those network issues.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price briefly broke past the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, up 10% within the weekly time frame, ahead of the much-anticipated Bitcoin ETF Approval.\n\nThe crypto market experienced widespread volatility on Jan 9 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced false Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval in a now-denounced post on X.\n\nDespite the raging controversy, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has maintained a steady uptrend, trading as high as $2,440 on Jan. 10.\n\nEthereum vs Bitcoin: Crypto derivatives traders are betting bigger on ETH\n\nBetween Jan. 7 and Jan. 10, Ethereum\u2019s 11% price growth performance has dwarfed Bitcoin\u2019s 4%. Interestingly, vital derivative market metrics now suggest that ETH price could further outperform BTC if the SEC issues a timely positive verdict on Bitcoin Spot ETFs.\n\nFirstly, the funding rate represents the interest paid by bullish traders to inverse traders to keep their LONG futures contract positions open. As of morning trading hours Eastern time on Jan. 10, ETH currently has a Funding rate of 0.014%, which marginally exceeds currently exceeds BTC\u2019s 0.12%\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs Bitcoin (BTC) Funding Rate | Source: Coinglass\n\nPut concisely, a higher positive funding rate in Ethereum than in Bitcoin implies increased demand for long positions in the ETH derivatives market, potentially reflecting a more optimistic sentiment.\n\nIn further confirmation that Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin, the open interest dynamics have also flashed similar signals since the week\u2019s turn.\n\nYou might also like: Bloomberg ETF analyst: Bitcoin ETF to be approved today\n\nETH open interest growth has outpaced BTC\n\nETH Open Interest has increased by 14.6% from $3.71 billion at close on Jan. 7 to $4.57 billion at the time of writing on Jan 10. Meanwhile, BTC open interest has witnessed only a 5% boost, from $6.4 billion to $7.3 billion during this period.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nOpen interest represents the dollar value of all active futures contracts for a specific cryptocurrency. An increase in open interest implies more new entrants are bringing fresh capital than those closing out their positions.\n\nThe chart above clearly illustrates that the percentage increase in ETH has outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s open interest amid intense speculation on the spot BTC ETF verdict. This affirms that crypto traders are betting on Ethereum to deliver larger price gains in the days ahead.\n\nWill ETH reach $3,000 after BTC ETF approval?\n\nDespite Bitcoin pulling more media traction, the current ETH Funding rate and Open Interest trends imply that crypto traders anticipate higher price gains in Ethereum after a positive ETF verdict. If this scenario continues, ETH\u2019s price will likely reclaim the $2,500 territory.\n\nHowever, IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price (IOMAP) data, which groups the current ETH holders by their historical entry points, shows a major resistance sell-wall around the $2,475 range.\n\nThe IOMAP depicts that 567,150 addresses have acquired 398,810 ETH at the average price of $2,475.\n\nGiven that this cluster of holders has been holding at a loss for nearly two years, they could rapidly book profits as ETH price approaches their break-even point again.\n\nBut if the derivative traders continue doubling their bullish positions as depicted by the elevated ETH funding rates, Ethereum\u2019s price could break above $2,500 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConversely, if a material market even sends ETH price into a down trend, the $2,200 support level could be crucial.\n\nAs seen above, the 2.85 million addresses that had acquired 7.7 million ETH coins at the minimum price of $2,220 could mount a formidable buy-wall to avert a prolonged Ethereum price downswing.\n\nRead more: SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETF on accelerated basis\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ready For Liftoff: Ethereum Eyes Breakthrough As Analyst Signals Upward Trend - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a crossroads that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has shared a notably bullish perspective, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s approach to its 2022 low as a potential springboard for a breakout.\n\nIn his analysis, Van de Poppe underscores the importance of Ethereum\u2019s current positioning, suggesting that its proximity to last year\u2019s low could be a catalyst for absorbing liquidity and igniting a bullish trend.\n\nAnalyst\u2019 Ethereum Bullish Projection Amid Market Movements\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast hinges on the broader market context, particularly the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Should this approval materialize, he anticipates a significant impact on the ETH/BTC trading pair, potentially leading to a liquidation candle \u2013 a sharp price movement.\n\nSubsequently, Van de Poppe predicts a substantial shift in market dynamics with funds rotating into Ethereum. This move, he believes, will be accompanied by a \u201cbullish weekly divergence,\u201d setting Ethereum on an upward trajectory.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we\u2019ll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be struggling to catch up with Bitcoin\u2019s price performance. It recently surpassed the $2,300 mark, echoing Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $47,000 \u2013 its highest since April 2022.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen a slight retracement and is currently trading around $2,249. This slight dip comes amid a week when the asset experienced a 5.8% decline, contrasting with its significant trading volume surge from $13 billion last Tuesday to over $23 billion today.\n\nUpward Swing With Potential Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nThe critical factor in Van de Poppe\u2019s analysis is the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. The market is on edge, with major players like BlackRock leading the spot ETF race alongside others like Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie, and ARK 21Shares.\n\nThese firms have recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed Bitcoin ETFs, with the market sentiment heavily leaning towards a positive outcome.\n\nBlackRock just re-filed their S-1 based on last min comments given yesterday. Hard to tell what has changed at first glance, but imp thing is that the unheard of 24hr turnaround time bt filing, comments and re-filing tells us all parties aiming to get this show on road pronto. pic.twitter.com/61cPtGJ4Oy \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 9, 2024\n\nBlackRock, in particular, has stirred significant optimism in this spot Bitcoin ETF race. With an approval decision expected by January 10, tomorrow, such a development could bolster Bitcoin and catalyze a fund rotation into Ethereum.\n\nVan de Poppe isn\u2019t alone in his bullish stance on Ethereum. Crypto Tony, another prominent crypto analyst, shares a similar outlook. Tony posits that Ethereum\u2019s path to a bullish phase could commence if it maintains above the key level of $2,130.\n\nCurrently trading above this crucial point, Ethereum\u2019s stability at or above this level is considered a sign of market strength, potentially paving the way for future gains.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s value against Bitcoin has dropped to historical lows as market anticipation grows for an imminent launch of a spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\n\nData from Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko showed that the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily declined since the smart-contract-enabled blockchain transitioned into a proof-of-stake network in September 2022. During the last 24 hours, the metric dropped to 0.048, its lowest point since May 2021.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial measure for gauging Ethereum\u2019s performance in relation to Bitcoin. When this ratio rises, Ethereum gains strength or maintains its value better than Bitcoin, suggesting a market preference for ETH over BTC.\n\nConversely, a decrease in the ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to Bitcoin, potentially signaling investor leanings toward the perceived safety of Bitcoin.\n\nThis ratio goes beyond mere price movements as it encapsulates shifts in investor confidence and market sentiment between these two prominent cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data shows that BTC\u2019s price has greatly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s over the past year. During the period, the top cryptocurrency\u2019s price rose by more than 170% to a 21-month high of more than $47,000, while ETH was able to post a modest gain of 74%.\n\nBTC\u2019s positive run could be attributed to the surrounding market optimism and demands for the potential approval of a spot ETF. Over the past several months, several asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, and others, have actively engaged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the applications, fueling speculations that these products could begin trading as early as Jan. 11.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s lukewarm price performance came amid the launch of several futures-based ETFs for the digital asset last year. These ETFs barely made a ripple in the market as they saw tepid demand, forcing asset manager CoinShares to describe ETH as the \u201cleast loved altcoin\u201d compared to rivals like Solana."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture, with renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe predicting a potential bullish breakout. In a recent tweet, van de Poppe conveyed his insights, indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC), there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this, analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there.\n\n\n\nIf an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nAccording to the most recent data, Ethereum is presently valued at $2,294, indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge, escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally, ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations, as reported by CoinGlass.\n\nSpillover effect\n\nThe focal point of van de Poppe's analysis revolves around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency market anticipates a breakthrough, with BlackRock, a financial behemoth, leading the charge. BlackRock, along with other prominent firms such as Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie and ARK 21Shares, has recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMarket sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF, with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market, impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions. As Ethereum stands at this critical juncture, the market awaits further clarity from regulatory bodies and key players in the cryptocurrency space."

        "title": "After the Bitcoin ETF Fakeout: Ethereum ETH Price Soars - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) rallied past the key $2,400 level this week as traders speculated on the approval of a potential Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained over 5% in 24 hours to hit its highest level since last September.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEther price surged past $2,400 as traders bet on a potential Ether ETF following Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nBlackRock previously filed for an Ethereum Trust ETF which added to speculation of an Ether product.\n\nTokens like LDO, RPL, MNT, and OP also rallied as they are connected to Ethereum and could benefit from an ETF.\n\nAnalysts say Ether looks positioned for a breakout with a bullish chart pattern targeting $3,500 if resistance around $2,320-$2,382 is broken.\n\nDespite market chaos from fake Bitcoin ETF tweets, Ether price still managed to surge due to strong fundamentals and on-chain data.\n\nDriving the bullish sentiment was previous news that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum Trust ETF. The proposed \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d would allow mainstream investors easy exposure to spot Ether prices.\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF approvals are widely expected this year, the BlackRock filing added credibility to hopes for an Ether product as well. This is significant because an SEC-approved crypto ETF would bring in fresh institutional capital from pension funds, endowments, and traditional finance players.\n\nAlong with Ether, native tokens of Ethereum-based protocols also benefited from the ETF speculation. For example, staking tokens Rocket Pool (RPL) and Lido DAO (LDO) notched double-digit percentage gains. As staking rewards are a prime feature of Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake consensus, an influx of new demand from an ETF could be a boon for staking platforms.\n\nOn the technical analysis front, Ether\u2019s bullish chart signals also reinforced the positive fundamentals. According to analyst World of Charts, ETH appears to be consolidating in a \u201cbullish pennant\u201d pattern that has an ultimate target of around $3,500. To confirm this breakout, traders first want to see resistance levels at $2,320\u2013$2,382 convincingly taken out.\n\nThe promising on-chain data also buoyed market confidence in Ether\u2019s uptrend. Blockchain intelligence firm Santiment reported that the number of large \u201cwhale\u201d transactions on Ethereum rocketed higher in the past day. This suggests that deep-pocketed investors still have an appetite to accumulate more ETH at these levels.\n\nRemarkably, Ether managed to post gains despite the wider crypto market reeling from fake news of a Bitcoin ETF approval. A series of forged tweets from a hacked SEC account initially sent Bitcoin spiking before a swift plunge once the ruse was uncovered. Still, Ethereum proved resilient with its strong fundamentals and held onto daily gains of nearly 4%.\n\nWith ETF excitement building, technicals flashing bullish signals, and whales continuing to stockpile, analysts broadly agree further upside appears in store for Ether. The next key resistance level to watch is the psychological $2,500 mark, which opens the door to test $3,000 and beyond. As long as crypto adoption trends remain intact, Ethereum looks poised to continue outpacing the broader digital asset market."

Though this sudden uptrend gave investors hope of a sustained bull rally, an analyst had something different to say.\n\nEthereum finally turns bullish\n\nAfter a week-long decline, Ethereum investors were finally enjoying profits as the token\u2019s daily chart turned green.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,318.33 with a market capitalization of over $278 billion.\n\nHowever, the latest analysis from CryptoQuant suggested that the probability of ETH moving within a small price range seemed likely.\n\nCryptoOnChain, an analyst and author at CryptoQuant, mentioned in an analysis that derivative market charts indicate a relatively high number of short transactions, which looked bearish.\n\nThe analysis also mentioned that it was unlikely for ETH to initiate a bull rally before Bitcoin [BTC] manages to go above a key resistance level of $43,500.\n\nHowever, the king of cryptos has toppled the resistance level already. At press time, BTC was trading at $46,770.41.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto planned to have a closer look at ETH\u2019s metrics to understand whether the king of altcoins can touch $2,500 anytime soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s metrics look bullish\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that buying pressure on the token was high. This was evident from the fact that its net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average.\n\nAnother bullish signal was its active addresses, which increased in the recent past.\n\nBuying sentiment among US investors was also high as its Coinbase premium was green. Not only that, but things in the derivatives market also looked pretty optimistic.\n\nEthereum\u2019s funding rate remained green, meaning that derivatives investors were actively buying ETH at its higher price.\n\nIf ETH manages to sustain its bull rally, as suggested by the aforementioned metrics, the coin might face resistance in quite a few zones.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum\u2019s liquidation levels revealed that in order to maintain a bull rally, ETH must go above the $2,400 mark and then the $2,450 mark in the near future.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe possibility of ETH going above these levels was likely, as most market indicators were bullish.\n\nFor instance, its Money Flow Index (MFI) registered an uptick. Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend, increasing the chances of a continued uptrend."

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, is currently exhibiting signs of a bullish breakout, as observed by two prominent analysts in the crypto space. According to World Of Charts, Ethereum shows consolidation within a bullish pennant pattern.\n\nThis technical formation typically suggests continuing an upward trend in Ethereum\u2019s case. According to the analyst, if Ethereum successfully breaks out of this pattern, it could surge toward a significant level of $3,500.\n\n$Eth Trend Is Up Consolidating In Bullish Pennant Expecting Breakout Soon Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 3500$#Crypto #Eth #Ethusdt #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/nlqbMfh3k0 \u2014 World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) January 10, 2024\n\nCrucial Resistance Zone: Ethereum Path To Breakout\n\nAdding to World Of Charts\u2019 optimistic outlook, crypto trader Skew has identified the $2,320\u2013$2,382 range as a key resistance zone for Ethereum. This price range has historically acted as a barrier to Ethereum\u2019s upward movement, with \u201cnumerous rejections\u201d witnessed at these levels.\n\nSkew emphasizes the importance of Ethereum closing above $2,400 on the 1-hour and 4-hour charts. This decisive move would breach the resistance zone and confirm Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nSkew also noted that technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and stochastics still display significant momentum, supporting the potential for Ethereum\u2019s continued upward trend.\n\n$ETH 4H\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for ETH to shine & run, would definitely help if the BTC Spot ETF is legitimately approved later $2320 \u2013 $2382 has proven to be strong resistance with numerous rejections the key confirmation would be a solid 1H & 4H close above $2400 4H trend &\u2026 pic.twitter.com/taWbcC7eWY \u2014 Skew \u0394 (@52kskew) January 10, 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s Solo Bull Run Amid Market Turbulence\n\nDespite recent market turbulence, including the plunge of several cryptocurrencies, including BTC, following the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) fake spot ETF approval announcement, Ethereum has shown resilience and is currently in the green.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum has climbed by 5.5%, surpassing the $2,400 mark before a slight retracement to around $2,381 at the time of writing. This bullish trend is further supported by increased trading volume, which surged below $30 billion to approximately $39 billion in the past day.\n\nSkew suggests that Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum could receive an additional boost from the potential approval of a Spot BTC ETF. If such approval were to come to fruition, it could further support Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, another renowned crypto analyst, who also foresees Ethereum\u2019s approach to its 2022 low as a precursor to a potential breakout. Van de Poppe believes that Ethereum\u2019s current positioning near last year\u2019s low could be crucial in absorbing liquidity and fueling a bullish breakout.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s analysis highlights the broader market context, specifically the awaited decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. An approval, he predicts, could notably impact the ETH/BTC trading pair, potentially triggering a sharp price movement known as a liquidation candle.\n\nFollowing this, Van de Poppe anticipates a significant reallocation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence, propelling Ethereum onto an upward trajectory.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen believes that Ethereum (ETH) is about to collapse against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 789,000 YouTube subscribers that the ETH/BTC ratio is likely repeating a historical pattern and might soon lose a key support level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t ever bounce, and if it does bounce the bull market support band is what you would look towards and that\u2019s currently at around .055 BTC. So I would keep an eye on that in case there are any bounces.\n\nBut I still think that there\u2019s a good chance that we are just emulating what happened over here [in December 2017] and that we are about to enter this phase of the cycle [similar to 2019-2020] where support finally breaks [at the 0.049 BTC level], it comes down into these levels over here, finds some type of a bottom [at around 0.037 BTC], goes sideways for a while and then maybe by the end of the year starts trending back up [to 0.049 BTC].\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.049 BTC ($2,298) at time of writing.\n\nCowen acknowledges that the ETH/BTC pair has both lower highs and higher lows in the weekly time frame, which makes it difficult to predict the trading pair as bullish or bearish.\n\n\u201cHow best to explain Ether/Bitcoin higher lows is perhaps on some type of logarithmic regression curve. And it is important to point out the higher lows\u2026\n\nBut one concerning aspect are these lower highs. We can look at the higher lows, and a lot of people point to that\u2026\n\nI look at these lower highs and think, where\u2019s this thing ultimately heading? It\u2019s putting in lower highs, but it\u2019s also putting in higher lows. The truth is I don\u2019t know what the ultimate outcome of this is.

However, the altcoin leader has been consolidating between $2,150 and $2,400 since it broke out of the macro ascending triangle in the fourth quarter of 2023.

        "content": "While Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are still awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), executives from asset management firms are already speculating about the potential launch of spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nValkyrie Invest\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Steven McClurg, expressed his belief that the SEC\u2019s potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF could pave the way for similar offerings in the XRP and Ethereum markets.\n\nHowever, regulatory challenges and classifying XRP and Ethereum as securities may present hurdles toward these index funds.\n\nXRP And Ethereum Spot ETF Potential Hurdles\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has been classified as a commodity by regulators, XRP and Ethereum have been deemed securities. This divergence in classification poses potential difficulties and may necessitate a more complex approval process for spot ETFs tracking these cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe anticipated impact of spot ETF approval on the XRP and Ethereum price would mirror the pattern seen with Bitcoin. Still, the SEC\u2019s skepticism towards the broader cryptocurrency market could pose additional hurdles for XRP and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, the outcome of the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case holds significant implications and could hold the key for the cryptocurrency industry to pursue these index funds for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf Ripple, the blockchain payment company associated with XRP, emerges victorious and is not classified as a security by Judge Analisa Torres, it could establish a precedent for asset managers seeking to apply for an XRP ETF.\n\nThis legal precedent could also prompt potential litigation against the SEC to support an Ethereum ETF application.\n\nWhile discussions revolve around the possibility of spot ETFs for XRP and Ethereum, there is still uncertainty surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC may reject or delay the pending applications, making it uncertain whether these other index funds will materialize. Furthermore, US regulators\u2019 current classification of XRP and Ethereum as securities adds an additional layer of complexity to their respective ETF prospects.\n\nBitcoin ETF Decision Imminent\n\nAs reported on Monday by NewsBTC, Sources close to the process have indicated that the ultimate approval for Bitcoin ETFs may come on Wednesday.\n\nCNBC\u2019s sources suggest that this coincides with the application deadline for Ark Invest and 21 Shares, raising the possibility of a potential trading launch between Thursday and Friday. Several applications are expected to receive the green light, pending updates from the SEC on the filings.\n\nOverall, as anticipation builds around the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs, asset managers are already contemplating the prospect of spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the regulatory challenges and the classification of XRP and Ethereum as securities present significant hurdles for these index funds. The Ripple vs. SEC case outcome could have far-reaching implications, potentially setting a legal precedent for asset managers to pursue XRP and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nXRP is trading at $0.5673, showing a lack of bullish momentum with a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, it has experienced a continuous downtrend of 13% over the past 30 days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "So far, Ethereum appears to be showing signs of an impending bullish run, according to Crypto Tony, a renowned analyst in the crypto space. Crypto Tony suggests that Ethereum\u2019s journey to bullish momentum could commence if it successfully maintains its position above the crucial level of $2,130.\n\nFortunately, the asset trades above this price level and appears to be climbing further above it, with its current trading price of $2,264 at the time of writing.\n\nKey Levels For Major ETH Rally\n\nThe $2,130 price mark, as disclosed by Crypto Tony, is seen as a pivotal point for Ethereum, as maintaining this level could signal \u201cstrength and stability,\u201d setting the stage for further gains.\n\nThis optimism further escalates should Ethereum reclaim the range high at $2,500, a price level Crypto Tony revealed that would reinforce the bullish sentiment in the Ethereum market. Notably, Crypto Tony\u2019s bullish outlook aligns with the sentiments of other analysts in the crypto community.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update The ETH range is simple. Remain above $2,130 and we are bullish .. Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nFor instance, Ali Chart, another notable crypto analyst, has identified $3,830 and $5,100 price levels as Ethereum\u2019s following major targets based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) price bands.\n\nFor context, MVRV is a key on-chain metric or indicator that compares a cryptocurrency\u2019s market value (market cap) to its realized value, offering an alternative approach to assess the network\u2019s valuation by considering the price at which each unit last moved.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a crucial indicator that can be utilized especially for gauging the relative valuation of a crypto asset like Ethereum. When the MVRV ratio is high, it often suggests that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may be overvalued, and when it\u2019s low, the asset could be undervalued.\n\nAccording to the #Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands, the next key price targets for $ETH are $3,830 and $5,100! pic.twitter.com/cLo4crWkPF \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024\n\nAccording to a chart recently shared by Ali Chart on X, Ethereum is currently on an upward trajectory, with the next significant MVRV Pricing Bands at 2.4 and 3.2. These levels indicate that Ethereum may become overvalued, correlating to Ali\u2019s price targets for Ethereum at around $3,830 and $5,100, respectively.\n\nEthereum Whale Movements Backs Bullish Sentiment\n\nAdding to the bullish sentiments are recent whale movements. Spot On Chain has disclosed that an Ethereum whale, identified as \u20180x931\u2019, made a significant purchase of 21,192 ETH, valued at approximately $48 million, at an average price of $2,265.\n\nThis accumulation of ETH is a strong indicator of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future performance, as the whale has now held roughly 79,500 ETH since January 2023, sitting on an unrealized profit of $36.84 million.\n\nMoreover, last week\u2019s on-chain data from Santiment revealed that Ethereum\u2019s largest private wallets now hold a record 56.25 million ETH, representing 46.8% of the crypto\u2019s total circulating supply. This concentration of ETH in large wallets could be interpreted as a sign of long-term holding strategies among major investors.\n\nAmid these developments, Ethereum has been showing signs of recovery from its recent retracement. Despite a week of decline, the altcoin is beginning to exhibit an upward trajectory, with a near 2% increase in the past 24 hours, trading at around $2,272.\n\nThis recovery is further evidenced by a surge in trading volume, which has surged from a low of $11 billion last Monday to over $20 billion, indicating a possible increasing buying activity.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum Classic price formed a double-top reversal pattern that hints at a 21% decline.\n\nPrice indicators highlight the potential of the pattern failing due to bullish broader market cues.\n\nThe anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF approvals will likely have a bullish impact on altcoins, benefiting ETC.\n\nEthereum Classic price was seemingly adhering to the micro bearish reversal pattern, which failed despite the recent correction in the crypto market. The short-term outlook ahead of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval is now looking bullish as ETC is bouncing back from the crucial support of $19.33.\n\nEthereum Classic price notes a bearish reversal pattern\n\nEthereum Classic price on the 4-hour scale invalidates the double-top bearish reversal pattern that has been observed in the past four weeks. This pattern consists of two peaks or tops of nearly identical height positioned closely together, with a trough in between. It suggests a possible shift in market direction.\n\nThe potential trend reversal is indicated by the price encountering a resistance level on two separate occasions without successfully surpassing it. This is often interpreted as a sign to consider selling or initiating short positions as further declines in the market.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum Classic, this double top was formed at $23.42, with the neckline or support level of the pattern being marked at $19.33. This is also the breakout level, and an extended decline below this line would confirm the bearish reversal pattern. Furthermore, a successful pattern would only be observed when ETC falls to the target price of $15.24, which, according to the pattern, would register a 21% decline on the 4-hour chart.\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic price took the other route and, instead of falling through the neckline, bounced off it to note minor recovery, trading at $19.90 at the time of writing. Although this does not rule out the potential for decline, the price indicators do suggest invalidation of the pattern is likely, too.\n\nETC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator are giving out mixed signals, with the former still sitting in the bearish zone and the latter noting a bullish crossover.\n\nEthereum Classic RSI and MACD\n\nIf Ethereum Classic price continues the current path and broader market bullish cues kick in, ETC could move sideways or upwards beyond $20 and invalidate the bearish pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Ethereum namesake falls through the neckline and falls below $19, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, and the reversal pattern could be deemed mildly successful since absolute success would warrant a 21% correction."

        "content": "It has been a volatile week in the altcoin market so far, with most coins currently in the red.\n\nHowever, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) have bucked this trend, showcasing impressive resilience amid the broader market downturn.\n\nEthereum Eyes Breakout as Trading Volume Spikes\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading around the $2,430 level \u2013 just below last week\u2019s high.\n\nETH has posted two bullish daily closes in a row and looks to be heading for a third if the current momentum can be sustained.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, ETH\u2019s price is still trapped in a range between $2,150 and $2,450 \u2013 a range that has been in play since early December.\n\nHowever, the recent bounce from the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily time frame suggests that the token could be positioned to break out of this range to the upside.\n\nSpot trading volume for ETH has soared 35% in the past 24 hours as investors look to get involved before any breakout occurs.\n\nThis uptick in trading volume has come at the same time as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ticking into \u201cExtreme Greed\u201d territory.\n\nAs such, all of the necessary factors are there for ETH to potentially make a run back to December\u2019s yearly high in the coming days.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Continues to Post Presale Gains as Stake-to-Mine Feature Catches Attention\n\nAlongside Ethereum, another altcoin that\u2019s making progress while the market struggles is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nUnlike ETH, Bitcoin Minetrix is not yet listed on the open market and is still in its presale phase \u2013 yet has just passed the $8 million funding milestone.\n\nInvestors have been piling into the presale in recent weeks due to the discounted price of BTCMTX that\u2019s on offer.\n\nCurrently, investors can buy BTCMTX tokens for just $0.0127 \u2013 although this price is only available for one more day before increasing by 8% in the next stage.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale has seen enormous traction, mainly due to the project\u2019s groundbreaking Stake-to-Mine feature.\n\nThis feature enables everyday crypto users to stake BTCMTX tokens and earn \u201ccloud mining credits\u201d as a reward.\n\nThese cloud mining credits can then be used to mine Bitcoin \u2013 significantly streamlining the mining process.\n\nGiven that the Bitcoin mining sector is expected to be valued at over $4.7 billion by 2028, this Stake-to-Mine setup has the potential to tap into a significant and growing market.\n\nMore than 16,500 people now follow Bitcoin Minetrix on Twitter, demonstrating the growing interest in the project\u2019s features.\n\nWith a stellar roadmap containing plans for a dedicated mobile app and cloud mining partnerships, Bitcoin Minetrix could be an altcoin with an exciting future ahead.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nSEC ETF Confusion Triggers Altcoin Selloff\n\nAlthough Ethereum and Bitcoin Minetrix are performing well, most coins in the altcoin market are currently experiencing a downturn.\n\nInvestor sentiment appears to have shifted bearish in the past 24 hours, leading to price drops for leading altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP).\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been one of the worst-hit altcoins, dropping over 8% in the past 24 hours alone.\n\nThis bearish trend appears to be linked to the ongoing confusion around whether a spot Bitcoin ETF will be launched in the US or not.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the SEC\u2019s official Twitter account was hacked, leading to a fake tweet being posted that said a spot ETF had been given the green light.\n\nHowever, shortly after, SEC chair Gary Gensler announced this was incorrect and that a spot BTC ETF had not yet been approved.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this led to chaos in the crypto market, causing the price of Bitcoin to rally and then drop.\n\nThe volatility spread to the altcoin space, contributing to the sell-off in major coins and tokens.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Will ETH Price Hit $2400 in Next 48 Hours Ahead of Bitcoin ETF Verdict? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights With a consolidation range formation below the $2400 mark, ETH price coils up huge trend momentum.\n\nThe recent overnight recovery with high anticipations around the Bitcoin Spot ETF fuels the rally in altcoins in Ethereum.\n\nRising momentum and improving sentiments tease a breakout run in ETH price to $2700.\n\nKeeping a bullish stance in the long consolidation range, the ETH price finds constant support at the bottom base of $2200. Becoming a multi-contact point of reversal, Ethereum price continuously the streak of bullish engulfing formation from the crucial support level.\n\nLasting for more than 30 days, the Ethereum price constantly struggles to enter a decisive trend. Nevertheless, the recent market-wide recovery aligns with our ETH price prediction, which holds a bullish standpoint for the upcoming trend.\n\nBuyers Preparing Breakout Challenges $2400 Barrier.\n\nSource \u2013 TradingView\n\nDespite the recent failure to sustain the New Year\u2019s rally, the ETH price avoids a downfall like other altcoins of lesser market cap. With the strong buying activity at the $2200 support level, the bulls are prolonging the range formation and coiling up more trend momentum.\n\nThe intent is clear to provide a high-speed move upon the fracturing of the boundary on either side. Moreover, the spike in the buying pressure, evidenced by the spike in trading volume supporting the price jumps, improves the breakout chances.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price trades at $2308 and takes a 1.04% intraday pullback following the 4.94% jump last night. As the tradition of $2200 bouncing the Ethereum price continues, the $2400 breakout possibility sustains.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nRSI indicator: The daily RSI line shows a sideways trend, diluting the prevailing downfall near the halfway line. Moreover, the bullish divergence in the past two dips at the $2200 support increases the bull run chances.\n\nMACD Indicator: The MACD and signal lines close up the gap with the recent jump in ETH price and tease a bullish crossover. Further, the recent price jump in Ethereum shows a spike in average lines, reflecting improved sentiment and a potential comeback for Ethereum.\n\nThe Bears Are On The Verge Of Liquidation\n\nFollowing the recent liquidation event of almost $100Mn Liquidation from the bulls, the ETH price stabilizes normally within the range. Further, the recent liquidation chart from Coinglass shows a spike in liquidations on the bearish side.\n\nAs bears lose $42Mn due to liquidation on Monday and the uptrend gaining momentum, the Ethereum price may soon make a strong comeback. This can lead to more bearish liquidations in the coming days.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready to Cross $2400?\n\nAs per the technical analysis, the ETH price action shows a high momentum bullish trend entering a sideways track. Therefore, as per the price pattern analysis, a bullish flag pattern forms in the daily chart. Hence, the breakout of the consolidation range is most likely on the upside as the flag pattern is a trend continuation pattern.\n\nThe recent surge has tested the $2400 level and presented a breakout entry for traders who missed the $220 breakout. Additionally, the likelihood of Ethereum crossing the $2500 level is increasing, with significant upside potential remaining. The uptrend could potentially reach the $2700 level.\n\nConversely, a reversal could drive the price of ETH back to $2200."

This report highlights that he had previously declared an investment of up to $45,000 in Ether during 2023.\n\nFinancial Disclosure Reports Database submitted by Mike Collins\n\nCollins reported investments in Ethereum totaling $110,000 as part of his mandatory financial reports to Congress under the STOCK Act on January 9, 2024.\n\nHis recent transactions include purchasing Ethereum worth $15,000 on January 3 and an additional $50,000 on January 8. This active engagement in cryptocurrency trading dates back to at least 2023.\n\nThe reports align with an 11% rise in Ethereum\u2019s market value over a week. This increase may be linked to expectations about the U.S. SEC\u2019s decision on a Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Inflows Surge to $29 Million \u2013 Can ETH Hit $5,000 This Month?\n\nThe Ethereum price has bounced by 5% in the past 24 hours, hitting $2,411 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has actually dipped by 0.1%.\n\nETH\u2019s move today means it is now up by 1.5% in a week and by 7.5% in the last 30 days, with the biggest altcoin in the market also sitting on an 81% gain in the past year.\n\nThese moves come as weekly Ethereum inflows top $29 million, according to the latest CoinShares data, making ETH the most popular altcoin among funds.\n\nAnd with the market hoping for a big surge in the event of Bitcoin ETF approvals today, the Ethereum price could rally strongly very soon.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Inflows Surge to $29 Million \u2013 Can ETH Hit $5,000 This Month?\n\n\n\nMore than most other major coins, ETH really looks like it\u2019s on the brink of making strong price gains in the next few days.\n\nIts RSI (purple) has just risen back up to 60, a sure sign of increasing momentum, particularly after the indicator dropped below 50 a few days ago.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s 30-day average is climbing more steeply again after slacking in recent days, another indicator that buying pressure is growing for the coin.\n\nOne of the encouraging signs as far as ETH is concerned, is that its support level (green) has risen consistently in recent weeks, implying that even if it doesn\u2019t rally continuously, it\u2019s not going to fall hard anytime soon.\n\nAnd as the latest CoinShares report makes clear, ETH is the most popular alt in the market this week, with its inflows comfortably exceeding those of its nearest rival, Cardano (ADA).\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 2024 is off to a strong start, with US$151 million in inflows! Total inflows since the Grayscale vs SEC lawsuit now stand at US$2.3 billion. Notable asset inflows include:$BTC: US$113m inflows$ETH: US$29m inflows$ADA: US$3.7m inflows$AVAX: US$2m inflows$LTC: US$1.4m\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9wfshmqxsB \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) January 8, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the market is getting excited about ETH because it could be one of the main beneficiaries in the event that the SEC approves Bitcoin ETFs today, which many think is likely.\n\nIf the regulator does approve Bitcoin ETFs, it\u2019s possible that Ethereum ETFs could follow sooner or later, something which would obviously be a major win for Ethereum.\n\nYet Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are so strong that it\u2019s more than capable of continuing to rise with ETFs.\n\nIt still accounts for more than half of the total value locked of the entire crypto sector, with the platform attracting the biggest adopters last year, including PayPal and Coinbase.\n\nAs such, 2024 is likely to be another good year for the Ethereum price, which could hit $3,000 in the next few months.\n\nOther High-Potential Altcoins for Big Gains\n\n\n\nTraders looking for lower cap alternatives to ETH may be interested in looking at newer alts and presale tokens, which can often rally big when listing on exchanges for the first time.\n\nOne coin likely to do this is Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF), a deflationary ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised close to $5 million in its presale, which has now closed.\n\nMajor players like @BlackRock, @ARKInvest, and more are adjusting their filings for a US #Bitcoin #ETF, now leaning towards cash redemption over in-kind transactions. The #SEC's stance signals a shift. What's your take on this regulatory move?#BitcoinETF hits beyond the $4.8\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bxixnW8m3T \u2014 BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) December 19, 2023\n\nDespite its sale running for only a short period of time, Bitcoin ETF Token was able to raise so much money because of its highly deflationary tokenomics.\n\nNamely, the coin set to burn 25% of its max supply over the course of its lifespan, burning this amount in five 5% instalments, as well as through a transaction tax.\n\nThe first of these will come when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF gains a trading volume of more than $100 million, and with the SEC likely to approve its first ever BTC ETF today, this milestone could arrive sooner rather than later.\n\nBy burning 25% of its supply, Bitcoin ETF Token will experience steadily rising demand, which could push its price up increasingly higher.\n\n#BitcoinETF Token Announcement! \ud83d\udce3 We can proudly announce that around 21 million #Tokens worth over $100K have been burnt through transaction taxes! This is also the equivalent of #Bitcoin's total supply! \ud83c\udf10 pic.twitter.com/D8z2nvj4rG \u2014 BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) January 3, 2024\n\nWhile its presale has now closed, participants can begin to claim and stake their purchased tokens.\n\nAnd given that holders can stake BTCETF, it could end up being a very deflationary token, with much of its original supply being taken out of circulation.\n\nIn turn, its tokenomics could help it have one of the biggest exchange listings of the year, so new investors are advised to act quickly once it does list.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "content": "Today, we continue our two-part article series on Ethereum apps. To recap, we reveal 10 Ethereum apps to watch in 2024. These 10 apps all serve very different purposes. And, I\u2019m sure that you, as a user, will find one that\u2019s just right for you.\n\nBefore we begin, do check out the first part of this article series here. If you\u2019ve done so, let us check out App #6 below.\n\n6) Daylight\n\nNumber 6 of the Ethereum apps we\u2019re watching in 2024 is Daylight. Daylight\u2019s main product is an Application Programming Interface (API). In short, an API provides a way for two programs to talk to each other. Daylight\u2019s API does just that, for:\n\nWallets.\n\nTools.\n\nCreators.\n\nPost-transaction recommendations are now live on @daylight! After someone transacts, we surface the top 3 mints they are most likely to do based on our relevance data: social graph, holdings, etc. Next year, we will power this in our app partners to increase engagement. pic.twitter.com/Q3JAMXleJc \u2014 Kyle McCollom \u2600\ufe0f (@kylemccollom) December 22, 2023\n\nBut, what does Daylight\u2019s API do exactly? Well, its API focuses on recommendations. For instance, let\u2019s say you mint an NFT from a collection. With this data, Daylight\u2019s API recommends another three other NFT collections that you may like. Hence, you\u2019ll find more NFTs that suit your preference.\n\nDaylight isn\u2019t just for NFTs though. Said API can be integrated within wallets or apps. In turn, this creates a lot of potential use cases. With your transaction data, Daylight helps you find more of what you like in crypto.\n\n7) Dookey Dash\n\nNumber 7 of our 10 Ethereum apps is Dookey Dash. The creator of this game is the renowned Yuga Labs. Yes. That\u2019s the same team behind blue-chip NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks.\n\nI love to play with numbers. In some of these games, I concede defeat when trying to achieve top ranks. So, I make self-achievements like matching my lb rank with token ID. Got close with @yugalabs #DookeyDash REAL close with @10KTFshop Bell rankinghttps://t.co/taQOZqc2eX pic.twitter.com/8Vzfykwqsk \u2014 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0d (@CDNHODLer) January 5, 2024\n\nIn summary, Dookey Dash is an NFT game. One that is simple but requires skills and reflexes. As you can see from the video above, you\u2019ve got to dodge a ton of obstacles. At the same time, you\u2019ve got to collect items too. The longer you last in the game, the higher the points you get.\n\nSadly, the game is not open to the public at the moment. But, you can follow the Yuga Labs Twitter account. Once the game is back, they\u2019ll announce it. You can then try it out first-hand.\n\n8) Unlonely\n\nNow, if you aren\u2019t into just having fun yourself, check out Unlonely. It\u2019s one of the more fun Ethereum apps you can use. That\u2019s because it links you up with others on the livestream. So, it\u2019s similar to a \u201cWeb 3 Twitch\u201d platform. Indeed, any lonely person with this app will for sure feel \u201cUnlonely\u201d.\n\nwe\u2019re cooking\u2026 let us cook \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83e\udd0c if you\u2019re new to love on leverage and weren't able to catch everything live (or just miss us too much already), here\u2019s a one stop shop to tide you over until the next one \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/7IFCPz2vcS \u2014 \ud83d\udfe2 Live on Unlonely (@unlonely_app) October 18, 2023\n\nWell, of course, Unlonely isn\u2019t all about just watching each other online. You can participate in prediction markets too! All while on the live stream. So, you can bet if a couple will go on another date or not. Or, you can bet on live sports results. The possibilities are endless here. Hence, if you frequently use Twitch, do check Unlonely out too!\n\n9) Hypersub\n\nNext is Hypersub, one of many NFT Ethereum apps. Hypersub is an NFT subscription platform. But unlike other apps, it has a special feature that you might or might not like. It grants NFT creators the ability to add an expiration date to their NFTs. So, you could be the owner of an NFT you like, but only for a limited time.\n\n9. hypersub @withfabricxyz a nft subscription platform. although still nascent, i think the idea of adding a time expiration for creators is really special. creators usually get the short-end of the stick when offering \"lifetime\" access to their offering. pic.twitter.com/DGwWeVzscj \u2014 0xDesigner (@0xDesigner) December 28, 2023\n\nWith this feature, Hypersub can attract many NFT creators.

        "content": "According to disclosure documents filed with the U.S. House of Representatives, Georgia Representative Mike Collins purchased up to $65,000 worth of Ether (ETH) in 2024.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 9 filing with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, Rep. Collins revealed he had purchased up to $15,000 worth of ETH on Jan. 3 and up to $50,000 worth of the token on Jan. 8. The U.S. lawmaker has been trading ETH since at least 2023 according to similar filings, reporting total purchases up to $110,000.\n\nSource: Financial Disclosure Reports Database, U.S. House of Representatives\n\nUnder the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, U.S. lawmakers are largely required to report investments to Congress. However, they are still permitted to oversee or propose legislation on matters potentially related to their investments, which many have called a potential conflict of interest between their public service and personal wealth.\n\nCollins\u2019 ETH purchases came as the token\u2019s price surged more than 11% in the last seven days, from roughly $2,200 on Jan. 3 to $2,466 at the time of publication. Some experts have speculated that ETH could rally in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission potentially approving a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund for the first time \u2014 an event expected by Jan. 10.\n\nRelated: US lawmakers introduce bipartisan bill proposing ban on members investing in \u2018financial instruments\u2019\n\nThe disclosure filings came roughly nine days before the U.S. government is set to shut down should Congress fail to pass a spending bill before Jan. 19. Previous shutdowns have created ripples across markets, including cryptocurrencies, partly due to economic uncertainty.\n\nRepublican Party candidates for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election will face off in Iowa on Jan. 10 for the first debate of the election season.

The CIO went on to add that Grayscale recently added XRP to their publicly traded which in turn shows that there is interest.\n\nMcClurg believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will deem the ETFs effective at close of business Wednesday and the trading to begin on Thursday morning,\u201d McClurg said in an interview.\n\nDozen Applications in Pipeline\n\nSo far, there are nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls who are significantly dropping their management fees in hopes of beating out their competitors, yet another sign of imminent approval.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, Fidelity lowered their fees to 0.25% from the previous 0.39% and has offered a fee waiver to 0% through July 31.\n\nIncluding Fidelity, 5 out of the 11 issuers have revised their fee structures or offered temporary waivers after they received feedback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 8.\n\nWith the previously lowest fee of 0.24% offered already, Bitwise reduced it to 0.20% with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion; Wisdomtree lowered its fee of 0.50% to 0.30% also with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion.\n\nSEC\u2019s X Account Hacked\n\n\n\nEarlier today, when the SEC\u2019s X account shared a false tweet suggesting the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in the US. The excitement in the crypto community was short-lived as Chair Gary Gensler quickly revealed that the SEC\u2019s X account had been compromised, and the tweet was unauthorized.\n\nFollowing the false SEC announcement, the cryptocurrency market was marked by heightened sensitivity to regulatory actions, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a notable dip to $46,000, reflecting nearly 1.50% decrease on Wednesday."

News can trigger volatility and leave large wicks. So a pump to that level and a big rejection afterward is a likely scenario.\u201d\n\nThe trader shares a chart predicting Bitcoin\u2019s price action \u201cfor the next few days.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that Bitcoin will soar toward $51,000 upon news of the approval of a spot market Bitcoin ETF. After the rally, he suggests that Bitcoin will likely correct down to the $30,000-$31,000 as whales \u201csell the news.\u201d\n\nThe trader also predicts Ethereum will rally to as high as $2,600 before correcting. And he expects other altcoins to also undergo a massive correction after a brief move to the upside.\n\n\u201cInteresting week ahead. ETF news should be released soon. As explained these days, I expect the market to pump first. BTC to $48,000-$50,000, ETH to $2,500-$2,600. Alts should pump more, especially low caps. After this, which should take a few days, the market should reach a very important local top. That\u2019s when I will start opening swing short positions, aiming for new lows.\u201d\n\nLooking further out, the trader maintains his long-standing prediction that Bitcoin will eventually collapse to the $12,000 level, which his chart suggests will happen around April.\n\n\u201cBTC HTF (high timeframe) idea.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $46,776 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours.

In addition, this incident triggered a volatile day for Bitcoin prices, which in turn led to a significant drop in Bitcoin Futures Open Interest (OI).\n\nHowever, amid a slip in Bitcoin OI, the Ethereum Futures Open Interest witnessed an unprecedented surge, indicating a shift in market sentiment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum OI Soars As BTC Faces Backlash Amid Fake ETF Approval Drama\n\nThe SEC found itself embroiled in controversy after an unauthorized post on its official X handle falsely claimed approval for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. This misinformation sparked enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts, only to be quelled when SEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that no such approval had been granted, revealing a compromised official handle.\n\nMeanwhile, as a consequence, the crypto community expressed strong dissatisfaction, accusing the U.S. SEC of market manipulation. Notably, according to CoinGlass data, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest plummeted by 3.29% over the last 24 hours to 431.76K BTC or $19.69 billion, reflecting the impact of the misleading information on investor confidence.\n\nIn contrast, while Bitcoin faced a downturn, Ethereum emerged as a resilient player in the market. Ethereum Futures Open Interest witnessed an impressive surge of 12.08% over the past 24 hours, reaching 3.33 million ETH or $8.05 billion. This surge was mirrored on various platforms, with Binance recording a 10.39% increase and Bybit experiencing a remarkable 16.07% jump in Ethereum OI.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock and ARK 21Shares Slash Bitcoin ETF Fees In New S-1 Filings\n\nPrice Changes Amid Market Turbulence\n\nThe crypto market was down on Wednesday, which several experts attributed to the recent SEC chaos.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long been a favourite among crypto enthusiasts and investors. Over the years, ETH has seen significant price appreciation, but the question on everyone\u2019s mind is, can it reach $10,000?\n\nAccording to crypto analyst and author Chris Burniske, the answer is a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d and he\u2019s not alone in his optimism. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the journey Ethereum has taken so far and explore the factors that could propel it to the coveted $10,000 mark. Additionally, we\u2019ll introduce a promising token, Retik Finance (RETIK), as a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Remarkable Ascent\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cking of smart contracts,\u201d has had a remarkable journey since its inception. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform is designed to support decentralised applications (DApps) and smart contracts. This fundamental difference has opened up a world of possibilities and applications, making ETH an indispensable part of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s price history tells a compelling story of growth and adoption. It began trading at just a few cents when it launched in 2015, and by 2017, it had breached the $1,000 mark. The subsequent years saw its price surge to new heights, with ETH reaching an all-time high of over $4,800 in November 2021. This impressive price trajectory underscores Ethereum\u2019s significance and potential in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nChris Burniske\u2019s Bold Prediction\n\nChris Burniske, a respected crypto analyst and author, shared his thoughts sometimes back on Ethereum\u2019s future in a Twitter post. He expressed his astonishment at the persistent scepticism surrounding ETH\u2019s potential, despite its consistent price appreciation. Burniske boldly stated, \u201cFor the haters that have been negative on ETH at $1, $10, $100, and $1,000, but refuse to let data change their view, see ya at ETH $10,000.\u201d While Burniske doesn\u2019t anticipate Ethereum reaching this milestone in the next few months, he firmly believes that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens. He set his sights on the year 2025 as the timeframe for Ethereum to hit $10,000, a prediction that has garnered significant attention and sparked optimism among ETH supporters.\n\nCommunity Consensus\n\nBurniske\u2019s prediction resonated with many members of the crypto community, and their responses to his post indicate widespread agreement. Some Ethereum enthusiasts even go a step further, suggesting that ETH could reach $10,000 as soon as 2024. The sentiment among believers is that Ethereum\u2019s fundamental value proposition, combined with its growing adoption and use cases, makes a five-figure price tag entirely plausible in the coming years.\n\nFactors Fueling Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nSeveral key factors contribute to the bullish outlook for Ethereum and its potential journey to $10,000:\n\nSmart Contracts and DApps: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities are at the heart of its appeal. The platform enables developers to create decentralised applications, opening up a wide range of use cases in finance, gaming, NFTs, and more. As the DApp ecosystem continues to expand, demand for ETH to power transactions and interact with these applications will likely grow.\n\nEthereum Upgrade: The Ethereum Cancun upgrade, which is expected to happen in Q1 of 2024, will increase the scalability, security, and efficiency of the Ethereum network, optimising operation and reducing gas fees through a process known as proto-danksharding.\n\nDeFi and NFTs: The decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors have exploded in recent years, with Ethereum serving as the primary platform for these innovations. The growing popularity of DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces drives demand for ETH as the preferred choice for transactions and collateral.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Ethereum has attracted the attention of institutional investors, with major financial institutions and corporations exploring its potential. Institutional investment can bring significant liquidity and credibility to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance: A Promising Token to Watch\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey to $10,000 is on the horizon, the crypto landscape is continually evolving, with new projects emerging to address various needs and challenges. One such project that has been gaining traction is Retik Finance (RETIK). As we look ahead to Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on promising tokens like RETIK. Retik Finance is a decentralised finance (DeFi) project that aims to redefine the DeFi space by introducing innovative utilities that bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Its ecosystem includes features like the Retik Wallet, Retik DeFi Debit Card, and Retik Pay, all designed to simplify financial transactions and promote accessibility to DeFi for users of all backgrounds. The project\u2019s presale stages have been a resounding success, raising over $6.7 million from the sale of over 134 million tokens. With experts predicting gains of up to 20,000%, Retik Finance is poised to make a significant impact in the crypto world.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we embark on the journey into 2024 and beyond, Ethereum\u2019s path to $10,000 remains an exciting narrative in the crypto space. Chris Burniske\u2019s bold prediction, combined with the strong fundamentals and growing adoption of Ethereum, instils confidence in its potential to reach this milestone. While Ethereum takes center stage, it\u2019s crucial to keep an eye on promising projects like Retik Finance (RETIK), which are innovating and offering solutions to the evolving needs of the crypto community. As Ethereum\u2019s journey unfolds, it\u2019s clear that the crypto landscape holds immense opportunities for those who dare to dream and believe in the transformative power of blockchain technology.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.

This noteworthy move underscores a sentiment shift within the market, per a post on X from crypto analyst The Wolf of All Streets on January 10.\n\nETH price movement on January 9. Source: The Wolf of All Streets\n\nWith the recent data and the potential that this approval holds over the altcoins price, Finbold utilized artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT from OpenAI to predict the Ethereum price in the case of ETF approval by the Security and Exchanges Commission (SEC).\n\nChatGPT scenarios for ETH price\n\nChatGPT outlined Ethereum\u2019s most likely scenario and potential range in case of spot-Bitcoin ETF approval, putting the ETH price range from $5,000 to $7,000 due to the positive market sentiment and environment.\n\nMost likely ETH price range scenario. Source: ChatGPT and Finbold\n\nIn a bullish scenario, approval of a Bitcoin ETF may spark greater institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, benefiting Ethereum due to its significant market presence. Positive developments such as advancements in Ethereum\u2019s technology, adoption of Ethereum 2.0, or favorable progress in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications could amplify the optimistic outlook and propel the price range from $8,000 to $10,000.\n\nBullish ETH price range scenario. Source: ChatGPT and Finbold\n\nIn a bearish scenario, regulatory setbacks, security issues, or market downturns may occur, leading to adverse developments and a potential sell-off in the cryptocurrency market. Technical challenges or delays in Ethereum 2.0 implementation could further undermine investor confidence, resulting in downward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price, potentially increasing it from $3,000 to $4,000, noted the AI.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the time of press, ETH was trading at $2,402, rising 4.61% in the previous 24 hours, adding to gains of 1.44% in the last week and an increase of 6.95% in the past 30 days.\n\nETH 24-hour price chart.

There is a consensus of a \u2018strong buy\u2019 with 17 buy signals, supported by moving averages confirming another \u2018strong buy\u2019 with 14 buy signs. Additionally, oscillators align with a \u2018buy\u2019 rating, featuring 3 buy signals.\n\nETH technical analysis.

        "content": "Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje, known as the godfather of decentralized finance (DeFi), further raised concerns over probabilistic finality in blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum as the market sees expanding use cases and adoption in traditional finance. He said Fantom has already solved state bloat as Ethereum developers look to solve state bloat in the chain.\n\nAndre Cronje Says Fantom Has Resolved S tate Bloat Issue\n\nIn response to Ambient Finance founder Doug Colkitt\u2019s belief that Ethereum is the only chain looking to solve state bloat in its long-term plan, Andre Cronje said \u201cI am pretty confident in saying we already solved state bloat at Fantom.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum roadmap entails using Verkle trees to allow for \u201cdata to be small enough to be attached to every block.\u201d It could help validators and nodes to become stateless as all \u2018state\u2019 can be stored more efficiently off-chain.\n\nHowever, Andre Cronje said any blockchain that uses probabilistic finality or any variant of the longest chain rule won\u2019t resolve this issue. Bitcoin and Ethereum chains depend on probabilistic finality. Finality refers to when a block of transactions is considered permanent and cannot be altered or reversed.\n\nFantom uses aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism, which does not require the longest chain rule.\n\nMoreover, Fantom introduced the new database Carmen, a flat storage method that does not use tree or dictionary structures while maintaining a cryptographic signature of the world state. This greatly reduces the bloat of the current active state (two epochs). Carmen supports real-time pruning, and although archive nodes still need to retain all data, most validators can enable pruning.\n\nAfter adopting the above technology, Fantom\u2019s status is reduced from about 2TB (archive) to 60GB (archive). Cronje said state bloat has been one of Fantom\u2019s core milestones since its early days.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock And VanEck Files Updated S-1 For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval"

        "title": "Peter Brandt Maintains Short Bias on Ethereum Amidst Price Halt - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nOver the past month, Ethereum (ETH) has exhibited a price range between $2,100 and $2,400 amidst the anticipation of a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nDespite being hopeful about the prospects of long-term benefits for the crypto ecosystem, investors have grappled with divergent opinions on whether this event could trigger a bullish or bearish short-term scenario.\n\nBrandt\u2019s Bearish Outlook\n\nRenowned trader Peter Brandt, however, remains unmoved by the fundamental factors driving the market sentiment. On Tuesday, he reiterated his bearish stance on ETH, grounding his analysis on technical chart patterns.\n\nBrandt took to Twitter to express his viewpoint, stating, \u201cI know in advance that this Tweet will land like an egg dropped onto a pile of scrap metal. My bias remains to be short $ETH. I\u2019m a swing trader in ETH, not a hodler.\u201d\n\nBrandt emphasized his reliance on chart patterns for analysis and highlighted a rising wedge pattern, contrary to some who interpret it as an ascending triangle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, the rising wedge serves as a predictive tool for potential bearish reversals. This formation is characterized by a diminishing price range featuring ascending peaks and ascending troughs, all encapsulated by upward-sloping trendlines.\n\nNotably, last month, the legendary trader Peter Brandt reiterated his bearish sentiment by shorting Ethereum with a target price range between $650 and $1,000. Brandt has expressed concerns about Ethereum\u2019s usability issues, citing higher fees and slow transaction speeds. He even speculates that Ethereum may not remain a listed asset in the next decade, favouring alternatives like Solana.\n\nContrasting Views\n\nElsewhere, seasoned market analyst Aksel Kibar pointed out the well-defined consolidation between $2,143 and $2,410, emphasizing the importance of a decisive move beyond $2,410 with daily solid candles for a long-term bullish thesis.\n\nDaniel Yan, co-founder at Matrixport, a Singapore-based crypto management firm, highlighted Ethereum\u2019s recent rally but cautioned about the resistance zone between $2,400 and $2,500. He noted the necessity for weekly closes above $2,425 and $2,525 for a clear breakout.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nDespite Brandt\u2019s scepticism, the upcoming Dencun Upgrade, incorporating Proto-Danksharding to enhance scalability, could be a game-changer for Ethereum. Scheduled for later in the year, this upgrade aims to boost the capabilities of layer-2 scaling solutions, potentially aligning Ethereum with its long-term objectives.\n\nCrypto analyst Nilesh Rohilla suggested that whatever the ETH chart indicates, the upcoming upgrade and speculation regarding an ETH spot ETF could propel the Ethereum price to $3,000-$3,500 within the next four months.\n\nIn a market driven by technical analysis and contrasting opinions, Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory remains uncertain, with traders closely monitoring both fundamental developments and chart patterns.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,421 after a 6.92% surge over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data."

        "content": "Several large financial institutions are set to launch an Ethereum Layer 2 chain using Polygon CDK.\n\nThe chain called Libre promises to offer broader distribution capabilities for asset managers.\n\nFollowing the development, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron has dubbed the CDK \u201cthe home for institutional assets.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are coming\u201d is a common saying within the crypto industry that espouses the belief that traditional financial markets will eventually be democratized on the blockchain. While the saying has often come across as a far-flung dream, the Polygon network continues to defy the narrative.\n\nBuilding on milestones recorded last year by bringing funds from Franklin Templeton and Hamilton Lane on-chain, the Polygon ecosystem will now welcome the first financial institution-backed and focused Ethereum Layer 2 chain.\n\nPolygon Labs: \u201cThe Institutions Have Arrived\u201d\n\nIn an X post on Wednesday, January 10, Polygon Labs unveiled the Libre Chain, a protocol powered by the Polygon CDK and backed by some of the biggest names in institutional blockchain adoption, asserting that \u201cthe Institutions have arrived on Polygon.\u201d\n\nLibre\u2019s backers include a subsidiary of Japan\u2019s largest Investment bank, Nomura Group called Laser Digital, WebN Group, an incubation hub backed by alternative investment giant Brevan Howard\u2019s founder Alan Howard, Brevan Howard itself, Hamilton Lane, and the visionary Avtar Sehra. Sehra is regarded as one of the pioneers of tokenization, widely known for his work with Nivaura. This project brought asset tokenization to Bitcoin and Ethereum when most argued that such use cases be restricted to private blockchains.\n\nThe institutions have arrived on Polygon CDK. For the first time, a financial institution-focused L2 is being built, settling to Ethereum.\n\n\n\nIntroducing Libre, institutional web3 infrastructure for the distribution of alternative asset funds, launched by WebN and @LaserDigital_.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Ybs3Ul8Fzv \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) January 10, 2024\n\nPer Polygon Labs\u2019 blog post, Libre chain, the latest offering from these heavyweights, will empower regulated institutions to tokenize and issue alternative investments on the blockchain compliantly. The motivation? To allow for broader distribution for asset managers \u201cby safely and securely streamlining legal, regulatory, and operational workflows.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Layer 2 chain is set to launch in Q1 2024 and will first see adoption from Hamilton Lane and Brevan Howard. In addition to issuing and creating tokenized assets, there are plans to introduce more features like collateralized lending and automated rebalancing of separately managed accounts (SMAs).\n\nResponding to the development, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal hailed the potential of the project to unlock new investment opportunities.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see Libre select Polygon CDK's scalability and security to revolutionize the alternative investments space. Libre demonstrates the immense potential of blockchain technology to unlock new opportunities for investors globally.\"\n\nPolygon Labs Institutional Capital Head Colin Butler teased the Libre Chain launch last week, stoking significant excitement within the Polygon community.\n\nPolygon CDK: \u2018The Home For Institutional Assets?\u2019\n\nFollowing the Libre Chain announcement, Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron asserted that the Polygon CDK was \u201cthe real home for bringing institutional assets onchain.\u201d Boiron contended that the Polygon Ethereum Layer 2 development kit\u2019s zero knowledge technology and modularity offered asset managers the tools to tap into the DeFi ecosystem while maintaining a fully controlled environment.\n\nPolygon CDK \u2013 the real home for bringing institutional assets onchain.\n\n\n\nInstitutions are betting on a robust onchain future where they fully control the environment on a chain created for asset managers and wealth advisors around the world.\n\n\n\nInstitutions know the value add of\u2026 https://t.co/Be0OWg90tV \u2014 Marc Boiron (@0xMarcB) January 10, 2024\n\nLibre is the latest addition to Polygon\u2019s growing multichain ecosystem powered by the CDK. Other projects and firms building with the tech stack include Palm Network, Flipkart, and OKX.\n\nPolygon\u2019s multichain vision outlined under its 2.0 roadmap intends to create \u201cthe ultimate value layer\u201d on Ethereum, promising to allow users to navigate the ecosystem like a single blockchain with unified liquidity.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe Libre chain has yet to launch.\n\nWhether the Libre chain will attract other financial institutions remains to be seen.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nInstitutional adoption has long been one of the biggest desires of crypto industry participants. The Libre chain powered by Polygon represents a massive step towards this ambition.\n\nRead this for more on how Polygon is driving institutional adoption:\n\nHere\u2019s How Polygon Is Driving Institutional Adoption of DeFi\n\n\n\nSee also how Fox is using Polygon to combat fake news:\n\nHere\u2019s How Fox Is Using Polygon (MATIC) to Combat Deepfakes"

        "content": "Steve McClurg, co-founder and chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds, has suggested the potential approval of Ethereum or XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following the expected launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent Bloomberg interview.\n\nThe prediction comes from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is reportedly likely to approve Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, whereby trading is anticipated to commence as early as Thursday.\n\nXRP And Ethereum Spot ETFs on the Horizon\n\nRecent market developments support McClurg\u2019s optimism regarding Ethereum and Ripple ETFs. He highlighted Grayscale\u2019s addition of XRP to one of their publicly traded trusts to indicate the growing interest in diversified cryptocurrency investment products.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: @ValkyrieFunds Chief Investment Officer @stevenmcclurg says it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if he saw \u201cRipple\u201d ($XRP) and Ethereum spot ETFs coming to market now that the @SECGov is about to approve one for Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/EBcwvbgChs \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 9, 2024\n\nWhile Valkyrie has not officially confirmed plans to pursue ETFs specifically for Ethereum and Ripple, McClurg believes the market conditions are favorable for such offerings.\n\nHe emphasized that these potential ETFs could be more retail-focused, providing easier access to a broader range of investors who may not have deep knowledge of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, McClurg expressed uncertainty about the future launch of such products, stating, \u201cI really don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to do that or not.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory classification of cryptocurrencies introduces complexities in the approval process for spot ETFs. While Bitcoin has been categorized as a commodity, XRP and Ethereum are considered securities, leading to potential challenges and a more intricate approval procedure for ETFs tied to these assets.\n\nThe expected impact of spot ETF approval on XRP and Ethereum prices could mirror the pattern observed with Bitcoin. However, the SEC\u2019s cautious stance on the broader crypto market may pose additional obstacles for ETFs linked to XRP and ETH.\n\nCrypto Firms Optimistic About Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nAbout a dozen companies have submitted applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, anticipating their approval to attract new investors and billions in inflows within their first year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has seen a surge to a 21-month high this year, driven by expectations of imminent approval, as the SEC faces a January 10 deadline to decide on an application by Ark 21 Shares.\n\nMcClurg mentioned that they have yet to receive any indication from the SEC as Valkyrie prepares to launch its Bitcoin ETF, and no one has received a definite confirmation. However, he expressed confidence, stating, \u201cI\u2019m about 95% sure that we will be trading on Thursday.\u201d\n\nIn response to the evolving landscape, Invesco, Bitwise, Valkyrie, and WisdomTree have adjusted their fees in the applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as indicated in updated filings with the SEC."

        "content": "Wed 10 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States could herald a new era for cryptocurrencies. According to Steve McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Funds, ETFs on Ethereum and Ripple could quickly follow.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin ETF, is it Ripple and Ethereum\u2019s turn?\n\nConfident about the future, Steve McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Funds, stated in a recent Bloomberg interview that he \u201cwould not be surprised to see spot Ripple or Ethereum ETFs come to market\u201d following the approval of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nThis optimism is based on the impending decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly replicate the price of Bitcoin, expected this week. Valkyrie\u2019s ETF is among the concerned products.\n\nMany observers see this as a major positive signal for the entire crypto sector. This regulatory advancement could pave the way for mainstream investors to adopt financial vehicles directly backed by cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith this precedent, Mr. McClurg anticipates that ETFs on other significant digital assets, like Ether or XRP, will quickly in turn receive the regulatory green light, capitalizing on the growing interest of investors in the asset class.\n\nA Growing Interest from Investors\n\nMr. McClurg emphasizes that investors\u2019 interest in diversifying their crypto holdings remains increasingly strong. He specifically mentions the recent decision by Grayscale to add Ripple to one of its publicly traded trusts.\n\nSuch publicly-focused financial vehicles facilitate access to cryptocurrencies for novice investors, he believes, paving the way for mass adoption.\n\nThough confident, Mr. McClurg admits that the regulatory approval process remains unpredictable. Nothing is yet entirely certain regarding the launch of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cAnything could still happen\u201c, he said, acknowledging that the regulatory environment remains complex. Administrative or political hurdles could still postpone the deadline or complicate the efforts of other players wishing to propose new crypto index funds.\n\nHowever, the potential validation this week of a first Spot Bitcoin ETF nonetheless seems to signify a turning point. If confirmed, this regulatory step forward could unlock the arrival of a new generation of crypto investment products, finally making these assets accessible to the general public.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum's value against Bitcoin hits new lows, while market anticipates US Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nPotential approval of Bitcoin ETF seen as a positive sign for future Ethereum ETF launch.\n\nSpeculation rises about a potential XRP ETF, fueling hope for XRP price increase.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio has hit its lowest point since May 2021, signaling a decline in Ethereum\u2019s value against Bitcoin. This drop coincides with rising market expectations for the launch of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. It\u2019s also been a consistent trend since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake network in September 2022, according to data from Kaiko, a crypto intelligence platform based in Paris.\n\nThe crypto industry is eagerly watching the US SEC\u2019s stance on Bitcoin ETFs. Valkyrie\u2019s Steven McClurg has even suggested that approvals for Ethereum and XRP ETFs might follow.\n\nExcited to know the prospects? Come, let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ETF Potential\n\nSteven McClurg\u2019s views are rooted in Ethereum\u2019s status as the second-largest digital asset, currently priced at $2,272.26, even after a recent decline of 3.67%. Given Ethereum\u2019s market influence, it\u2019s seen as a strong candidate for an ETF.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: @ValkyrieFunds Chief Investment Officer @stevenmcclurg says it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if he saw \u201cRipple\u201d ($XRP) and Ethereum spot ETFs coming to market now that the @SECGov is about to approve one for Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/EBcwvbgChs \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 9, 2024\n\nThe SEC\u2019s positive attitude towards Bitcoin ETFs, combined with proactive efforts from Gary Gensler, has given hope to many in the crypto community. Notable firms, including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and Valkyrie, are awaiting the SEC\u2019s decision on their ETF proposals.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Postpones Ruling on Ethereum ETFs, Opens Door for Public Input\n\nWhen Will the SEC Decide?\n\nThis week, the SEC may decide on Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Time is running out for pending applications. Multiple companies have applied for Spot Ethereum ETFs, but none have announced a Ripple XRP ETF. XRP ETF would make cryptocurrencies easier to use in regular banking, and other major cryptocurrencies may follow suit.\n\nA green signal for Bitcoin ETFs might pave the way for the introduction of an Ethereum ETF in the future. This positive decision for Bitcoin ETFs could set a precedent for Ethereum and potentially other cryptocurrency-based ETFs to enter the market.\n\nAlso Read: Will SEC Delay Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Due to Hack? Possible Reasons Explained\n\nIs An XRP ETF On the Horizon?\n\nThere\u2019s a growing buzz about a potential XRP ETF, signaling a possible boost for XRP\u2019s ecosystem. While past attempts at an XRP ETF triggered short-lived price swings, McClurg\u2019s recent hint rekindles hope, especially when XRP trails behind other cryptocurrencies in value. Presently, there are no active Ripple XRP ETF applications, but Grayscale might consider adding XRP to its traded trusts. XRP\u2019s current value stands at $0.5738, down 1% from 24 hours ago.\n\nAn anticipated Ripple XRP Spot ETF filing could significantly spike XRP\u2019s price. Notably, an influential figure in the XRP community, \u201cXRP whale,\u201d suggests an ETF application might emerge by April, with the ETF potentially launching before 2024 ends. Despite this optimism, no official announcements have come from potential issuers regarding an XRP ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum has been increasing in the past day in the hopes that an ETH ETF might be next in line on the SEC\u2019s agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, the probability of a further bullish continuation seems to remain high, considering what the charts are demonstrating.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been trapped between the $2,100 and $2,400 levels over the last month. A breakout from either side of this range can determine the trend\u2019s short-term direction.\n\nA bearish breakout would likely result in a decline toward the 200-day moving average, located around the $1,900 mark. On the other hand, a break above the $2,400 level would pave the way for the price to target the $2,700 resistance zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, the recent choppy price action becomes much more clear. The cryptocurrency has tested both the higher and the lower boundary of the range several times.\n\nCurrently, the price is testing the $2,400 resistance area. A breakout from this level would result in a rally higher toward the $2,700 area, while a rejection could lead to a drop back to the support zone at $2,100.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has been going through a consolidation phase, the underlying dynamics of the futures market are displaying an interesting sign.\n\nThis chart demonstrates open interest, which is one of the most essential metrics for future market sentiment evaluation. It measures the number of open futures positions. Higher values are typically associated with higher volatility and vice versa.\n\nIt is evident that while the price has been moving in a tight range recently, the open interest has dropped considerably. A significant decline in open interest without a price plunge is considered a bullish signal, as it hints at the fact that the futures market is not overheated anymore, and the price can continue its gradual uptrend in the coming weeks."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF being launched in the US has the crypto community buzzing, with some analysts speculating that these funds could be approved as early as this week.\n\nWe tasked the AI model ChatGPT with providing an in-depth price prediction for Ethereum (ETH) if one of these ETFs was given the green light.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted a new altcoin, Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), that could be primed to benefit from the tailwinds associated with ETF approval.\n\nHow Could Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Affect Ethereum\u2019s Price?\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin are separate blockchains with different use cases, the two leading cryptos have often moved in tandem in the market and look likely to continue doing so.\n\nThe reasons are multifaceted \u2013 for one, regulatory approval of a spot BTC ETF could mean greater legitimacy for cryptocurrencies as an asset class.\n\nIn turn, this may inspire investor confidence in altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, launching a successful BTC ETF may increase the appetite for a spot ETH ETF down the line, which would likely boost the ETH price in anticipation.\n\nHowever, some analysts caution that the actual debut of a spot BTC ETF could be underwhelming relative to expectations.\n\nThis might start a wave of profit-taking that spills over into Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nStill, the overall consensus suggests a spot ETF would introduce new institutional inflows, outweighing any short-term volatility.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum investors are eagerly anticipating the potential launch of one of these funds in the US.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Bullish ETH Price Prediction If SEC Gives Spot ETF Green Light\n\nMoving from market speculation to AI-generated projections, we consulted ChatGPT to analyze how the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could impact Ethereum\u2019s price outlook.\n\nWith ETH currently trading around $2,270, ChatGPT delivered an overwhelmingly bullish forecast.\n\nThe AI model argues ETF approval would accelerate crypto asset adoption, attract institutional dollars, and create a halo effect, boosting the broader altcoin market \u2013 all positive for Ethereum.\n\nConsidering these factors and Ethereum\u2019s independent growth drivers within the DeFi space, ChatGPT sees significant upside potential even after the recent rally.\n\nIn the model\u2019s most optimistic scenario, if a spot BTC ETF gets the green light, ChatGPT predicts ETH could reach between $3,000 and $4,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThis would represent a rally of up to 76% from current levels.\n\nWhile this forecast is entirely hypothetical, ChatGPT makes a strong case for ETH benefiting from a regulatory breakthrough on the Bitcoin front.\n\nWhich Other Coins Could Rise After Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval?\n\nWhile all the attention is being given to Bitcoin and Ethereum, a spot BTC ETF could open the floodgates for capital into smaller-cap tokens.\n\nOne under-the-radar project on the verge of a significant breakthrough is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an innovative Stake-to-Mine platform in its presale phase.\n\nChatGPT Predicts 687% Price Pump for Bitcoin Minetrix as Presale Nears $8M Milestone\n\nAs a crypto project striving to open Bitcoin mining to mainstream investors, Bitcoin Minetrix is well-positioned to ride the wave of interest from spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe project\u2019s novel \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model lets users earn BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than running expensive mining hardware.\n\nThis feature has already helped raise over $7.9 million in presale funding, showcasing strong investor interest.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT how BTC ETF approval could impact Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s price outlook in 2024.\n\nThe AI model cited several bullish factors, including increased crypto legitimacy, which would translate into potential tailwinds for mining tokens like BTCMTX.\n\nConsidering these factors, ChatGPT forecasts that BTCMTX\u2019s price could rise as high as $0.10 if the token is listed on exchanges following spot ETF approval.\n\nShould ChatGPT\u2019s prediction come true, it would represent a staggering 687% increase from the current presale price of $0.0127.\n\nWith anticipation ramping up in the Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram group, ChatGPT\u2019s bullish forecast could fuel further enthusiasm and attract more attention to the project.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

        "content": "Split, Croatia, Jan. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DegenX - a 100% DAO-owned and controlled multi-chain DeFi ecosystem - launched LinkBridge, a cross-chain bridge connecting DGNX to Ethereum. This new bridge will enable DGNX token holders to access Ethereum's vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps) and services. Moreover, it will create liquidity and trading opportunities for DGNX on Ethereum. The innovative new bridge is a development milestone for the DGNX project and its growing community.\n\n\n\n\n\nDegenX had recently developed Broccoliswap , a multi-token and multi-chain aggregator, via a custom\n\nimplementation of Rubic - a renowned all-in-one cross-chain swap aggregator. This enables Broccoliswap to provide the best rates and lowest fees for swapping tokens across different blockchains.\n\nFollowing its recent release, Broccoliswap is at the forefront of DegenX Ecosystem utilities, generating fees and redirecting them to DGNX token holders via the project's proprietary technology, Liquidity Backing. This mechanism ensures maximum security for new and experienced crypto users while helping them maximize returns when trading assets.\n\nToken swapping may be a complex process for many crypto enthusiasts and DeFi participants. Broccoliswap provides a solution by simplifying this process and delivering a quick and seamless route to multi-chain token swaps. The bridge includes automatic slippage calculation, token tax calculation, and bridging without constant network switching. This way, users don't have to tweak every setting of an asset swap, such as selecting the proper chain, setting slippage, adding tokens to the wallet, auto-correcting failed bridge transactions, and more.\n\nBroccoliswap opens the doors to all the utilities and features within the DegenX Ecosystem, allowing users to tap into the limitless opportunities of the crypto space. Overall, the bridge provides a smooth and user-friendly DeFi experience, making cross-chain token swapping broadly accessible and convenient.\n\nAbout DegenX\n\n\n\nDegenX is a EU-based decentralized finance company building a unique ecosystem of cutting-edge DeFi utilities and products. The team comprises industry experts from several areas, including Solidity and full-stack development, graphic design, marketing, operations, and business.\n\nFueling the DegenX Ecosystem is the DGNX token - a governance and utility token built on Avalanche. DGNX is backed by its base asset, providing the token with an ever-increasing intrinsic baseline value. Token holders enjoy numerous benefits, including the right to propose or vote on proposals and stake their tokens with the StakeX smart contract.\n\nThe DGNX token was initially deployed on the Avalanche C-Chain and has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 tokens. The team plans to bridge the DGNX token to other blockchains while maintaining the same maximum supply across networks.\n\nThe project has successfully completed smart contract auditing and KYC procedures with SolidProof, one of the industry\u2019s top auditors."

        "content": "The monthly sales volume of NFTs on the Solana network surpassed that of NFTs on Ethereum in December 2023, marking the first time this has occurred.\n\nData from the analytics platform, CryptoSlam, shows that Solana NFT sales amounted to approximately $366.5 million in December 2023, surpassing the $353.2 million recorded on the Ethereum network during the same period.\n\nHere are stats from the report:\n\nCryptoSlam\u2019s \u2018organic\u2019 sales figures, which exclude suspicious trades marked as \u2018wash trading,\u2019 show that approximately $381 million worth of Ethereum sales were excluded, while only $10.1 million worth of Solana sales were removed from the data.\n\nSolana\u2019s total of $366.5 million in trades nearly reached the network\u2019s all-time high, as reported by CryptoSlam. The previous peak was approximately $373.5 million worth in October 2021, a time when the cryptocurrency space was gaining significant momentum.\n\nSolana witnessed approximately double the number of unique buyers and sellers compared to Ethereum during the same month. Additionally, the network recorded a significantly higher total number of NFT transactions during that period.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, Solana had approximately 218,000 sellers and 279,000 buyers involved in nearly 6.6 million NFT transactions. In contrast, Ethereum had around 114,000 sellers and over 143,000 buyers participating in about 698,000 transactions during the same period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT sales volume in December 2023 remained relatively stable, hovering around the previous month\u2019s total of nearly $350 million. In contrast, Solana experienced a substantial surge from approximately $83 million worth in November 2023.\n\nThe increase in users and transactions on Solana may be attributed to the broader momentum surrounding the platform and the excitement surrounding specific projects, which offer potential access to airdrops and other incentives. For instance, Tensorians, the NFT project associated with the prominent Solana marketplace, Tensor, recorded $28 million worth of trades in December 2023, while Mad Lads generated $24.5 million in trades.\n\nThe leading Ethereum NFT project in December 2023 was the Bored Ape Yacht Club, with NFT trades amounting to $19.5 million. Following closely, Pudgy Penguins secured the second spot with approximately $18.3 million worth of trades.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, Bitcoin Ordinals trades, the protocol facilitating NFT-like media on the Bitcoin blockchain, generated more trading volume than Ethereum and Solana combined in December 2023. The data indicates a total of $881.2 million worth of trades across over 493,000 transactions.

        "content": "If you\u2019re trying to make the most of the various opportunities offered by decentralized finance, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll have to use more than one blockchain. In order to transfer tokens from one blockchain platform to another, you\u2019ll need to use a bridge.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll showcase the best crypto bridges available at the moment. When selecting the best cross-chain bridges for crypto transfers, we considered liquidity, the number of supported blockchains, the quality of the interface, and other factors.\n\nKey takeaways: Utilizing decentralized finance opportunities often requires interacting with multiple blockchains, necessitating the use of bridges for token transfers between platforms.\n\nWhile crypto bridges offer flexibility, they have been frequent targets for exploits and hacks, highlighting the need for cautious use and risk assessment when transferring tokens between blockchains.\n\nWhen choosing a bridge, ensuring compatibility with targeted blockchains is crucial. We've selected the 6 best crypto bridges on the market to help you on your DeFi journey.\n\nThe 8 best crypto bridges: Examining top choices for transferring tokens between blockchains\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that blockchain bridges have, unfortunately, been a very popular target for exploits. In fact, some of the biggest hacks and exploits that we have seen to date have targeted bridges. Bridging tokens between blockchains is still a relatively new concept, and many implementations have been exposed for having critical vulnerabilities that the developers didn\u2019t catch before deploying their bridging solutions.\n\nSo, when you\u2019re bridging tokens between blockchains, we recommend you exercise some caution and never bridge more than you can afford to lose. Given the history of blockchain bridge hacks, it\u2019s probably smarter to err on the side of caution even when using a popular and reputable bridging solution.\n\nThe best crypto bridges to transfer tokens between blockchains: Synapse Protocol - A well-rounded token bridging solution Arbitrum Bridge - The go-to bridge for transfers between Ethereum and Arbitrum Portal Token Bridge - A bridge for both EVM and non-EVM blockchains Celer cBridge - Celer\u2019s token bridging solution Stargate - Token bridge with diverse range of supported platforms Hop Protocol - Bridge specialized for Ethereum layer 2s Allbridge - Solid bridging solution for stablecoins and standard tokens Connext - A bridge for EVM blockchains and layer 2s\n\n1. Synapse Protocol - A well-rounded token bridging solution\n\nSynapse Protocol is a network that enables communication between different blockchains. The network allows any kind of data to be sent across supported blockchains, which allows it to be used for sending NFTs, smart contract calls and other data in addition to tokens.\n\nThe Synapse Protocol is the backbone of the Synapse Bridge, which is one of the most popular blockchain bridges on the market today. One of the reasons for its popularity is that Synapse Bridge supports a wide variety of blockchains, including EVM and non-EVM chains. You can use Synapse to transfer tokens to layer 2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, as well as layer 1 blockchains, like Fantom and BNB Chain.\n\nYou can connect to Synapse Bridge using MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, or Rabby Wallet.\n\nAccording to decentralized finance tracker DeFi Llama, Synapse Protocol has a TVL (total value locked) of about $107 million at the time of writing.\n\nKey features:\n\nEmploys a unique bridging mechanism that aggregates liquidity from multiple sources, ensuring high liquidity and minimizing slippage\n\nLeverages a combination of Layer-2 scaling solutions and optimized smart contracts to handle cross-chain transactions efficiently\n\nSupports cross-chain staking and yield farming opportunities\n\nIntegrated decentralized exchange (DEX) and a launchpad platform\n\nA native token called SYN, which serves as the governance token and facilitates staking rewards\n\n2. Arbitrum Bridge - The go-to bridge for transfers between Ethereum and Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum is currently by far the most popular layer 2 for Ethereum, according to layer 2 data aggregator L2Beat. It boasts a TVL of $5.9 billion, which is over two times higher than the second-ranked Optimism ($2.7 billion).\n\nBridging crypto assets between the Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum is becoming an increasingly common task for anyone who\u2019s active in DeFi. For bridging between these two networks, we recommend the Arbitrum Bridge.\n\nIf you want to learn more about using this bridge, we recommend you check out our in-depth Arbitrum Bridge guide where we explain the process step-by-step. The bridge supports 6 different types of Ethereum wallets, so you\u2019ll likely be able to use it regardless of which wallet you prefer.\n\nHowever, you need to keep in mind that Arbitrum Bridge only supports the Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks. If you\u2019re looking to bridge to other networks as well, we recommend you explore the other bridges we\u2019ve featured in this article.\n\nWhen bridging between Ethereum and Arbitrum, it\u2019s important to understand that going from Ethereum to Arbitrum is very fast, but withdrawing funds from Arbitrum back to Ethereum takes about 7 days.\n\nKey features:\n\nOffers significantly reduced transaction fees compared to Ethereum's mainnet\n\nUtilizes a rollup mechanism, which packages multiple transactions together and submits them to Ethereum as a single transaction\n\nAll transactions on Arbitrum are secured by Ethereum's robust consensus mechanism\n\nIntegrates seamlessly with Ethereum's ecosystem, allowing users to easily connect their MetaMask wallets and interact with dApps on both chains\n\nDesigned to be developer-friendly\n\n3. Portal Token Bridge - A bridge for both EVM and non-EVM blockchains\n\nThe Portal Token Bridge is a cross-chain bridge for crypto that\u2019s based on the Wormhole protocol. When using this bridge, the tokens you are sending are locked using a smart contract, and an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens is created on the destination chain.\n\nOne of the Portal Token Bridge\u2019s strongest features is its selection of supported blockchain, which is among the largest among all cross-chain bridges. The bridge supports blockchains that you might not be able to find on many other multi-chain bridges, including Sui, Sei, Near and Aptos. Of course, the Portal Token Bridge also supports more common networks such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Polygon.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Portal also offers an NFT bridge, which supports transfers of NFTs based on the ERC-721 and SPL standards. Overall, the Portal Token Bridge is a great choice if you\u2019re active on many different blockchains and would like to keep all your bridging under one roof.\n\nKey features:\n\nCross-chain bridge for crypto that\u2019s based on the Wormhole protocol\n\nSupports smaller blockchain ecosystems, including Sui, Sei, Near, and Aptos, in addition to more common networks such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Polygon\n\nIncludes an NFT bridge that supports transfers of NFTs based on the ERC-721 and SPL standards\n\nSupports cross-chain staking and yield farming opportunities\n\n4. Celer cBridge - Celer Network\u2019s token bridging solution\n\nThe Celer cBridge is a cross-chain crypto bridge developed by the team behind Celer Network. The bridge is powered by the Celer Network blockchain interoperability protocol, which allows developers to create inter-chain decentralized applications.\n\nMore specifically, the Celer cBridge uses the Celer State Guardian Network (SGN), which is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that monitors layer 1 transactions that have implications for layer 2 platforms, and passes information from layer 2 to layer 1 when necessary.\n\nA very impressive aspect of the Celer cBridge is the sheer amount of blockchains it supports, as it can be used to bridge crypto assets between 40 different blockchain networks, ranging from the largest platforms, such as Ethereum and Arbitrum, to more niche networks, such as Canto, Shiden, and Aurora.\n\nKey features:\n\nPowered by the Celer Network blockchain\n\nUses the Celer State Guardian Network, which is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that monitors layer 1 transactions\n\nIt can be used to bridge crypto assets between 40 different blockchain networks\n\nSupports bridging of NFTs\n\n5. Stargate - Token bridge with a diverse range of supported platforms\n\nThe Stargate token bridge supports a variety of EVM-compatible blockchains, including layer 1 and layer 2 platforms. It provides a sleek user interface and also provides estimates for slippage and gas costs so you\u2019ll be able to tell how many tokens you\u2019ll keep once the bridging is completed. You can also set your slippage tolerance before making a transaction in order to avoid losing too much value.\n\nOn Stargate, you can also stake assets to provide liquidity and earn the protocol\u2019s STG tokens in return. Additionally, STG tokens can be staked to obtain veSTG, which grants holders the right to participate in the protocol\u2019s governance process.\n\nThe Stargate protocol has a TVL of $318 million, which makes it one of the biggest bridging solutions in the DeFi sector.\n\nKey features:\n\nSupports a number of EVM-compatible blockchains, including layer 1 and layer 2 platforms\n\nBoasts a streamlined and easy-to-use UI\n\nProvides estimates for slippage and gas costs before each transfer\n\nYou can earn STG tokens by providing liquidity\n\nOne of the leading bridge platforms in terms of TVL\n\n6. Hop Protocol - Bridge specialized for Ethereum layer 2s\n\nHop Protocol is a solution that specializes in transferring tokens across various Ethereum layer 2s. The protocol is engineered in such a way that moving tokens between supported layer 2s is almost instantaneous.\n\nCurrently, Hop Protocol supports the Polygon, Gnosis, Optimism, Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Base scaling solutions for Ethereum, and it\u2019s arguably the best cross-chain bridge for crypto transfers between Ethereum layer 2s.\n\nHop operates on a fully non-custodial basis, ensuring that neither the funds of liquidity providers within the Automated Market Maker (AMM) nor the funds of users utilizing the Hop Bridge are ever held in custody by a single entity. The Hop Protocol has been audited by Solidified and Monoceros Alpha.\n\nKey features:\n\nFocused on Ethereum layer 2 solutions\n\nTransferring tokens is near-instantaneous\n\nSupports the Polygon, Gnosis, Optimism, Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Base scaling solutions for Ethereum\n\nOperates on a fully non-custodial basis\n\n7. Allbridge - Solid bridging solution for stablecoins and standard tokens\n\nAllbridge is a blockchain bridging platform that offers two main solutions \u2014 Allbridge Core and Allbridge Classic.\n\nThe Allbridge Core product focuses on stablecoins, allowing users to transfer stablecoins between EVM and non-EVM blockchain platforms. This is a valuable tool since many blockchain bridges are only limited to EVM-compatible blockchains. For example, one could use Allbridge Core to swap their USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain for USDC tokens on the Solana blockchain.\n\nAt the time of writing, Allbridge Core features 11 liquidity pools, with about $9.3 million worth of stablecoins locked. So, while the liquidity is not tremendous, it should certainly suffice for the average cryptocurrency user who's making low to medium sized swaps.\n\nMeanwhile, Allbridge Classic is an all-purpose bridging tool, which supports 20 different blockchain platforms in total and can be used to transfer a wide variety of token.\n\nKey features:\n\nSupports both EVM and non-EVM blockchains\n\nOffers two bridging solutions \u2014 Allbridge Core and Allbridge Classic\n\nAudited by Hacken, Kudelski Security and Cossack Labs\n\nSupports bridging between 22 different blockchains overall\n\n8. Connext - A bridge for EVM blockchains and layer 2s\n\nConnext offers a cross-chain transfer bridge which is based on the project's xCall technology. Connext supports various EVM-based layer 1 blockchains, as well as layer 2s such as Optimism and Arbitrum. The Connext bridge can be used to transfer a variety of ERC-20 tokens, as well as the USDC, USDT and Dai stablecoins.\n\nUsers can choose between different tokens to pay gas costs on the destination chain, and there is also a slippage tolerance setting that allows users to define the maximum amount of slippage they are willing to accept. However, the liquidity on Connext is currently quite low. This means users who are looking to bridge larger amounts should probably look elsewhere.\n\nNotably, the Connext platform introduces the xERC20 token standard, which is a cross-chain version of the popular ERC20 standard. The xERC20 standard allows token issuers to launch tokens without limiting themselves to a single ecosystem.\n\nKey features:\n\nSupports a variety of EVM-compatible blockchains\n\nProvides additional options for developers who want to build decentralized applications across multiple chains\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a crypto bridge, you\u2019re in luck since there\u2019s a wealth of options available on the market. In our article, we\u2019ve presented 6 high-quality bridges. Of course, the most important factor when choosing a bridge is making sure that it supports all the blockchains that you\u2019re trying to bridge tokens to.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the decentralized finance space, make sure to check out our article exploring the best alternatives to Uniswap.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the best cross-chain bridge?\n\nAccording to our research, Synapse Protocol is the best cross-chain bridge on the market today. However, there are also many other high-quality bridges available on the market.\n\nIs bridging crypto safe?\n\nUnfortunately, blockchain bridges have been the target of several hacks in recent years. In some cases, hundreds of millions worth of crypto assets were stolen. We recommend that you exercise caution when transferring tokens with bridges, and you shouldn\u2019t bridge more tokens than you can afford to lose in case the worst-case scenario does happen.\n\nWhat is the fastest blockchain bridge?\n\nOne of the fastest blockchain bridges is the bridge offered by Stargate Finance.\n\nWhat is the best bridge for Solana?\n\nOverall, the best bridge for Solana is the Portal Token Bridge, which is based on the Wormhole protocol."

        "content": "Ethereum, after a brief dip in Monday's trading session, has shown signs of resurgence, breaking above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average.\n\nThe momentum suggests a potential target of around $2,400. This level has repeatedly resisted price advances and represents a significant point of interest.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Bitcoin remains the primary driver in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe $2,400 level is expected to continue offering resistance. Should a breakthrough occur, the market might make a concerted effort to surpass the $2,500 level, which also holds considerable attention and resistance. Beyond that, the $2,750 level becomes the next potential target. Over the longer term, there is a possibility of ascending even further, with a measured move from the previous ascending triangle indicating a potential destination of $3,400 or potentially higher.\n\nConsolidation Phase\n\nIn the recent trading session, the market has been in a consolidation phase, accumulating momentum for an upward push. The $2,100 level is considered reliable support, complemented by the presence of the 50-day EMA in the same vicinity. These elements align to create a setup that suggests an impending upward move. Additionally, if there is an expectation of central banks adopting loose monetary policies, it could benefit Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Monitoring the 10-year yield is crucial in this context. A decline below the $2,000 level would necessitate a reassessment of the entire market. However, for now, the prevailing sentiment leans towards buying opportunities during dips.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nIn the end, Ethereum has displayed renewed strength, breaking above the 20-day EMA and potentially targeting the $2,400 level. Resistance is expected at this juncture, with subsequent targets at $2,500 and $2,750. A longer-term perspective suggests the possibility of reaching $3,400 or even higher. The market has been consolidating recently, with support at $2,100 and the 50-day EMA reinforcing this zone. The prospect of looser central bank policies could further boost Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Keeping an eye on the 10-year yield is essential. A drop below $2,000 would necessitate a reevaluation, but for now, buying the dips appears to be the prevailing strategy employed by most traders around the world. The market continues to see plenty of opportunities for people to take advantage of now.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD? Here\u2019s a list of some of the best crypto brokers to check out."

Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has said that Bitcoin spot ETFs will begin trading as a new issue tomorrow, Thursday, January 11.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Rally Hiatus Eyes Fresh Liquidity With Spot BTC ETF Approaching - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the window for spot Bitcoin ETF approval shrinks to 36 hours, market participants exhibit contrasting strategies. Bulls favor a breakout in Bitcoin and Ethereum price, while bears anticipate a correction triggered by the \u201csell-the-news\u201d narrative, potentially preceding a longer-term upward trend.\n\nEthereum Price Trend Continuation Depends On Critical Support Levels\n\nAlthough buoyant, Ethereum price stalled close to the stubborn $2,400 resistance. The leading smart contracts token has since early December consolidated within a narrow range, with resistance cut out at $2,400 and support around $2,200.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt is this consolidation that has led to ETH forming a bullish rectangle pattern which if validated may treat investors to a 10% move. Therefore, the next sessions could determine the next direction Ether takes.\n\nSimilarly, if the immediate support highlighted at $2,274 by the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in blue) remains intact, the least resistance would shift upwards, paving the way for Ethereum price to activate the rectangle breakout targeting highs at $2,600. It would be worth looking out for a daily candle close above this support line likely to reinforce the bulls\u2019 presence in the market.\n\nRecommended for you: Crypto Price Prediction For January 9: HNT, BONK, TIA\n\nLong-term success in a news-sensitive market necessitates a measured approach. While experienced investors navigate this volatility with practiced caution, novice traders might find it particularly challenging.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, although donning a sell signal, has the potential to send a call to buy ETH in the near term.\n\nBefore entering new long orders, traders must make sure that the MACD line in blue is above the signal line in red and accompanied by an upward-slopping movement.\n\nPrudence remains paramount even amidst bullish murmurs. As Ethereum price continues to lack directional momentum, a breach below the 20-day EMA (purple) support would lend credence to the prevailing bearish sentiment. This, coupled with the potential market response to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, could intensify downward pressure on Ethereum, potentially pushing it towards the $2,200 rectangle support level.\n\nCollecting liquidity from this support could mean that Ethereum price gains momentum to make another approach for a breakout to $2,600. However, if the support weakens amid increasing panic-selling pressure, ETH may be forced to retest $2,200 and perhaps brush the 200-day EMA (purple) support before the next significant trend reversal starts to build.\n\nThe token is also approaching the 2022 low on the ETH/BTC pair, which crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes holds immense liquidity to support the next breakout above $3,000.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nThe anticipation for the ETF would greatly impact the performance of Ethereum price. While a sell-the-news scenario is possible, investors cannot ignore the spike in capital flow likely to give cryptos like ETH and BTC momentum to hit higher highs.\n\nRelated Articles"

Meanwhile, bitcoin fell 4% as investors reeled from an imposter post on X falsely announcing bitcoin ETF approval, prompting SEC Chair Gary Gensler to clarify that no official approval had been made.\n\nThat didn't dampen hopes as the regulator faces a deadline on Wednesday to respond to an appeal from issuer ARK 21Shares on its bitcoin ETF application.\n\nTop Wall Street firms are also planning spot ether ETFs. BlackRock, a fund with a bitcoin ETF application in the pipeline, also previously filed for a iShares Ethereum Trust, a spot ether exchange-traded fund, with the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, BlackRock filed for a spot ether ETF with the Nasdaq exchange, sending the token up as much as 10%.\n\nAn ether ETF would be the first spot product tracking real time price movements instead of futures pinned to the asset.\n\nOther moves could further boost ether. In October, Standard Chartered said improvements to the Ethereum blockchain architecture as well as rising demand from gaming and tokenization could send ether's price to $8,000 by the end of 2026 and eventually to $26,000-$35,000."

        "title": "Neon EVM (NEON): the first Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana - OKX",
        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is known to be a foundational element in blockchain technology. It enables secure and automated smart contract execution, underpins decentralized applications (DApps), and provides interoperability across many different crypto projects.\n\nThe technology's widespread adoption, security measures, and support for token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 contribute to its role in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly among decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nNeon EVM represents fresh evolution for EVM. The promise of Neon EVM lies in its ability to integrate EVM capabilities into the Solana (SOL) blockchain. This means developers can leverage the familiar EVM environment for deploying and executing smart contracts on Solana, combining the strengths of Ethereum's (ETH) ecosystem with the speed and scalability of Solana's blockchain. Meanwhile, the interoperability enabled through Neon EVM opens up new possibilities for DApps and supports the transfer of Ethereum's projects to the Solana network.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n\nTo understand the impact of Neon EVM, let's start with the basics. The EVM lies at the core of Ethereum's functionality, serving as a decentralized runtime environment that executes smart contracts. In other words, it translates code into tangible actions, powering the development of a diverse range of DApps.\n\nWhat does EVM-based mean?\n\nThe term 'EVM-based' refers to blockchain networks directly built using the EVM architecture, incorporating the EVM natively into their infrastructure. This direct integration provides one-to-one compatibility, allowing smart contracts written for Ethereum to execute on EVM-based networks. Ethereum-based projects can migrate effortlessly to these platforms, benefiting from the familiarity of the Ethereum environment.\n\nWhat does EVM-compatible mean?\n\nWhen a blockchain is labeled EVM-compatible, it means the chain follows EVM standards without being directly integrated with the core architecture. While EVM-based chains directly replicate Ethereum's Virtual Machine, EVM-compatible chains maintain compatibility with Ethereum's tooling and smart contract standards but might introduce additional features or optimizations.\n\nSimilar to EVM-based blockchains, developers benefit from a familiar environment, using Ethereum-compatible programming languages and tools, such as the widely familiar Solidity language. This compatibility also allows for interoperability, providing a smooth transition for projects between Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM?\n\nNeon EVM is positioned as the first EVM on Solana, allowing developers to deploy EVM-compatible DApps on Solana with minimal reconfiguration. The platform enables DApps to process Ethereum-like transactions while embracing Solana's functionalities, including parallel execution of transactions and low gas fees.\n\nWith Neon EVM, developers can continue using familiar smart contract languages and Ethereum tools. This includes writing smart contracts in Solidity and Vyper, funding DApps with MetaMask, and deploying DApps on Solana through the Truffle environment, all while taking advantage of the efficiency of Solana transactions. This not only supports the transition for Ethereum developers but also potentially expands their reach by tapping into Solana's user base and accessing the platform's liquidity.\n\nNEON, the native utility and governance token, plays a broad role, from enabling transactions to decentralized governance through Neon DAO.\n\nHow does Neon EVM differ from Ethereum's EVM?\n\nOne difference between Neon EVM and Ethereum's EVM lies in the execution of transactions. While Ethereum's EVM executes smart contracts sequentially to maintain consistent and predictable outcomes, Neon EVM uses the parallel execution capability of Solana to enable smart contracts to be processed concurrently.\n\nTo allow for parallel transaction processing, Neon EVM bundles transactions and sends them to the Solana mainnet. Under ideal conditions, Neon EVM achieves a throughput of 4,500 transactions per second (TPS), surpassing Ethereum's general limit of around 1,500 TPS.\n\nHow does Neon EVM work?\n\nNeon EVM serves as a gateway for Ethereum-based applications to access the high transaction speeds and low transaction costs of Solana without changing its codebase. Here's an overview of the platform's key components and functionalities:\n\nNeon Proxy\n\nNeon Proxy allows for the migration of Ethereum DApps to the Solana blockchain. Acting as a bridge, Neon Proxy channels Ethereum-like transactions on the Solana network with minimal friction. This component packages Neon transactions, which represent Ethereum-style transactions, into Solana transactions. These packaged transactions are then processed on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its parallel execution capability and high throughput. Neon operators, responsible for running Neon Proxy servers, support this migration. They accept payments in NEON tokens and manage transactions within the Solana ecosystem using SOL.\n\nNeonScan\n\nNeonScan functions as both a block explorer and an analytics platform designed for users and developers. As a block explorer, NeonScan allows users to inspect and analyze transactions, blocks, and tokens associated with the Neon EVM on the Solana blockchain. This transparency provides users with a comprehensive view of the network's activity, allowing them to verify transactions, track token movements, and understand block information.\n\nNeonPass\n\nNeonPass is a tool that helps enable the transfer of ERC-20 tokens between the Solana and Neon EVM. This tool simplifies the cross-network cryptocurrency transfer process, allowing users to navigate the complexities with ease. Each transaction conducted through NeonPass incurs a gas fee, payable either in NEON or SOL tokens, depending on the originating network.\n\nNeon Faucet\n\nNeon Faucet is a service designed to help users obtain NEON and other ERC-20 test tokens. It's a resource for developers working within the Neon devnet, providing them with the necessary test tokens for application testing in a risk-free environment.\n\nBy using these tokens, Neon Faucet enhances the application development and testing processes on the Neon EVM platform before their deployment on the main network. Users looking to use Neon Faucet need to connect their crypto wallet to the service, which then allows them to access NEON and other ERC-20 test tokens for a thorough and secure testing experience.\n\nWho created Neon EVM?\n\nNeon EVM, developed by Neon Labs, operates under the oversight of the Neon Foundation for its development and governance. Marina Guryeva is the founder and CEO of Neon Labs and has been active in the blockchain space since 2015.\n\nGuryeva previously served as the Director of CyberFund, an investment platform for blockchain startups. In 2019, she assumed the role of Director at Commun, a blockchain-based social network. In 2021, Guryeva founded Neon Labs with the aim of integrating Solana's scalability and low transaction fees into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNEON token: powering transactions and governance\n\nThe NEON token, native to the Neon EVM ecosystem, serves a dual role. It functions as a utility token, facilitating transactions on the Neon platform including transfers, DApp deployment, interactions within DApps, and more. Beyond transactions, NEON serves as a governance token, empowering holders to actively participate in decentralized decision-making processes through Neon DAO.\n\nThe final word\n\nNeon EVM's mission within the Solana ecosystem is clear: to harness Solana's capabilities while providing Ethereum developers with a platform that feels like home. This integration brings forth a new era of possibilities for developers seeking high-performance blockchain solutions. As Neon EVM looks ahead on its roadmap, the promise of continued innovation underscores its commitment to shaping a multi-chain future."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio is a critical metric that is important to constantly monitor if you are operating with altcoins. This ratio signifies Ethereum's value relative to Bitcoin, and its movements can indicate general trends on the market. Recently, the ETH/BTC chart has shown a significant downtrend, which suggests that Bitcoin retains its dominance in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chart illustrates that Ethereum has not been able to outpace Bitcoin in terms of investment returns. This is particularly significant for investors who aim to \"beat\" the market by selecting assets that could potentially yield higher returns than Bitcoin. Currently, the performance of Ethereum, when measured against Bitcoin, has been less than stellar, indicating that Bitcoin remains the market leader and a stronger investment choice in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nETH/BTC Chart by TradingView\n\nDespite this, Ethereum has shown solid performance against the U.S. dollar, with an approximate 10% increase since December. This resilience in the face of a falling ETH/BTC ratio highlights Ethereum's inherent strengths and its ability to maintain value independently of Bitcoin's market movements. This divergence between Ethereum's performance in USD terms versus its value relative to Bitcoin could suggest that while Bitcoin may lead the market, Ethereum continues to offer value to investors.\n\nThe current state of the ETH/BTC chart raises the question: is an alt season, where alternative cryptocurrencies surge in value, imminent? Traditionally, alt seasons occur when altcoins gain significantly against both Bitcoin and the USD, but the current data suggests that the market may not be close to it.\n\nSolana heats up\n\nAs we move into 2024, Solana (SOL) is facing its first significant challenge of the year. After riding the highs of a bullish rally, SOL has entered a period of correction over the past two weeks, with prices retracting from their recent peaks.\n\nThe current price movement shows SOL approaching a local trendline resistance level, which could be a defining moment for the cryptocurrency. This trendline, drawn from recent highs, has been a barrier to SOL's price progression. A breakthrough at this point could signal the resumption of the bullish rally that Solana has been known for, suggesting a strong start to the year and reinforcing investor confidence in the asset's long-term prospects.\n\nThe possibility of a breakout is bolstered by the broader context of the crypto market's recovery after a challenging period. A successful push beyond the trendline could attract more buyers, potentially leading to an increase in trading volume and more sustained upward movement.\n\nIf Solana will be unable to push past the trendline resistance, the next level of support lies at the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The 26 EMA has historically provided a cushion during retracements, acting as a stepping stone for future rallies. If SOL's price were to retract to this moving average, it could offer a secondary point of entry for investors looking to capitalize on the asset's retracing.\n\nBonk suddenly wakes up\n\nThe Solana meme coin Bonk has staged an impressive rally. Over recent trading sessions, BONK has seen its value surge by more than 30%.\n\nThe BONK token was most recently labeled as the \"Shiba Inu\" of Solana. Its price action mostly reflects the bullish tendencies we saw on the market pushed by the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. The ETF approval has not only upheld the market's confidence but also potentially paved the way for increased institutional participation.\n\nThe recovery of BONK coincides with a pivotal moment on the crypto market, as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are also witnessing a bullish trend reversal. The market's shift toward a more positive outlook is a notable change from the correction we saw recently, where many assets struggled to maintain their value amid regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.\n\nA closer analysis of the provided chart reveals that BONK's price has rebounded sharply, now trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving average \u2014 key indicators that often signal strong bullish sentiment. The moving averages are sloping upward, confirming the momentum behind BONK's unexpected rise. Moreover, the increased trading volume accompanying this uptick in price points to an influx of investors who are driving the rally."

Cryptocurrency analyst Ali\u2019s data for December revealed a consistent upward trend, showcasing an increase of over 410,000 ETH in holdings by Ethereum whales.\n\nCurrent on-chain reports from Lookonchain highlight ongoing whale activity, with a notable instance of a whale making substantial Ethereum purchases from Binance. The whale withdrew 9,705 ETH ($22.9 million) from Binance and subsequently deposited it into Compound.\n\nTaking a bullish stance, the whale borrowed 12 million USDT to further acquire additional ETH.

        "content": "According to recent data, Ethereum (ETH) appears positioned for a potential price breakout. ETH has climbed over 4% in the last 24 hours, surpassing the key $2,400 resistance level that has blocked previous rally attempts.\n\nAnalysts are voicing optimism regarding Ethereum\u2019s technical setup and prospects in the near term. According to cryptocurrency analyst World of Charts, ETH looks to be consolidating in a \u201cbullish pennant\u201d formation on its price chart. This tightening trading range indicates building momentum that could result in an eventual breakout.\n\nThe analyst notes that a successful breakout from this pattern has a price target of around $3,500. However, ETH would first need to take out resistance around $2,320\u2013$2,382 to confirm the start of a new uptrend, which it did at press time.\n\nAlso read: BONK Surges 31%; How High Can The Meme Coin Go In 2024?\n\nWill Ethereum reach $3,500 soon?\n\nMeanwhile, crypto trader Skew also highlights the important $2,400 level, stating that a solid close above it on key time frames like the 4-hour chart would signal fresh upside chase potential. Key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and stochastics are reflecting plenty of remaining momentum to fuel further ETH gains if key resistance levels can be surmounted.\n\nEthereum is benefiting from several potential catalysts, including optimism around the network\u2019s ongoing technological developments.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Creates Short-Term Bullish Pattern; Will DOGE Price Hit $0.10?\n\nAdditionally, there is speculation that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could receive approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later this year.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) prices held steady on Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eleven Bitcoin ETFs. ETC, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, soared to a high of $2,630, its highest point since May 2nd, 2022. Similarly, the ETC soared to $27.73 (September 2022 high).\n\nThe biggest crypto news of the year so far was the decision by the SEC to approve eleven Bitcoin ETFs by companies like Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Ark Invest. This was a major decision because it will lead to more institutional demand for Bitcoin in the coming years. It was also a crucial thing because it had rejected several funds a while back.\n\nETH, and ETC prices rose after the decision because analysts believe that these companies will also apply for their ETFs. Blackrock has already filed for an Ethereum ETF, that will likely be known as the iShares Ethereum Trust. Also, Grayscale will likely file to transition its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. Indeed, ETHE\u2019s market price to NAV has moved from a discount to a 13.7% premium.\n\nRead more: How to buy Ethereum Classic.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF makes sense because it is the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world with a market cap of over $309 billion. It is also one of the most liquid tokens in the industry. Also, it is the most useful as it powers key players in industries like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming.\n\nThe challenge with Ethereum ETFs is that they will attract more scrutiny from the SEC because of the merge event that happened in 2022. This merge helped to transition Ethereum from a proof of work (PoW) network into a proof of stake (PoS). This means that, instead of being mined, it uses validators to confirm transactions.\n\nAs a result, the SEC believes that there should be more investor protection because it believes that it is a financial security. Therefore, we can\u2019t rule out a situation where the SEC initially rules out against Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum Classic, on the other hand, surged because of its close association with the main Ethereum. For starters, Ethereum Classic emerged from the original Ethereum and it uses the initial technologies like PoW. While ETC is less liquid, analysts believe that the SEC will approve its ETF if there is an application."

Coinbase Research, however, remains careful to point out that the link between halvings and price rises is still not completely made.\n\nBitcoin price performance since cycle low/ Source: Coinbase Research\n\nThe upcoming Cancun upgrade for Ethereum, scheduled to enhance scalability and security features in its protocols could also result in an increased transaction volume leading potentially to an increased ETH price.\n\nOverall, Coinbase\u2019s research indicates that the current crypto market cycle appears to be on track with this 2018-2022 cycle followed by potential upside before reaching its peak."

        "content": "Legendary trader Peter Brandt has once again come out against Ethereum (ETH) in a bid to reinforce his beliefs that the digital currency has a bearish future.\n\nThe Weak Ethereum (ETH) Price Chart\n\nAccording to a post on X, Peter Brandt noted his bias on Ethereum, adding that he believes a short position on X is the best approach at this time. Peter Brandt noted that he is a swing trader and not a HODLer, discounting any indication that he may be holding Ethereum (ETH) in particular for the long term.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPeter Brandt\u2019s post was accompanied by a price chart that shows Ethereum flirting around the resistance point at $2,448.25. While the digital currency has recorded an impressive liftoff from $1,242 as of late June 2022 to the $2,272 it is currently trading at at the moment, Peter Brandt chooses not to pitch Ethereum for a significant breakout moving forward.\n\nPeter Brandt sparked a bearish intrigue some weeks back when he revealed that he has shorted Ethereum (ETH) to a price range between $600 and $1000. Ethereum has not recorded a significant plunge in valuation from that time to date, in part because of the general sentiment in the market regarding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDrawing on the correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum has managed to stay resilient, a relationship Brandt believes cannot save the second-largest cryptocurrency from falling below the $2,100 support zone. In his words, should Ethereum fall below $2,100 and bounce back to prove him wrong, it will not be a big deal to him.\n\nThe Impact of Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nOne of the issues Peter Brandt has against Ethereum is its bad usability owing to higher fees and slow transaction speed. For these anomalies when compared to other notable alternatives like Solana (SOL), Brandt believes Ethereum (ETH) may not be a listed asset in the next 10 years.\n\nHowever, the forthcoming Dencun Upgrade that will employ Proto-Danksharding to help Ethereum scale up may prove to be the right game-changer that the protocol needs. Scheduled for later in the year, Dencun Upgrade will bolster the capabilities of even layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism, and Base in a way that can help Ethereum (ETH) achieve its ultimate goal.\n\nThe potential Ethereum (ETH) ETF product in view may also help transition the protocol to a more mature asset class, setting it free from unwholesome valuation plunges."

However, the trend has changed after they expanded their reach into well-established crypto groups.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Scam: Trading Platform Coinspaid Might be the Latest Victim\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverview of Wallet Drainers\u2019 Airdrop Scam\n\nAccording to a post by Scam Sniffer on X, phishing scams have been initiated by attracting crypto enthusiasts via fake airdrops. They have designed a webpage wherein one can claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThe scammers term the airdrop scam as an \u201cexclusive opportunity\u201d for the community. Moreover, they encourage people to connect their primary wallet to be able to access these airdrops. In addition, Scam Sniffer noted that these fraudsters can drain various types of crypto wallets via this webpage.\n\nThis update is an alarming one considering the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, Solana, and Tron. It could instill crypto investors into believing such wallet drainers in anticipation of high-end crypto rewards. Thereby, millions and billions of digital asset investments could be wiped off owing to such wallet drainer scams.\n\nHowever, it is possible to identify such scams via a few checks. The snapshot shared by Scam Sniffer shows that the concerned airdrop scam webpage has grammatical errors, which could be a way to be safe from such fraudsters. But, they can upgrade their strategies from time to time.\n\nHence, it\u2019s always better to check the source of such links. If a trusted entity isn\u2019t posting such airdrop updates, then avoid such offerings completely. Moreover, it\u2019s time to be even more cautious since hackers have been hacking reputed companies\u2019 X (formerly Twitter) accounts to promote crypto scams.\n\nCertik and Mandiant Official X Accounts Get Hacked\n\nEarlier this month, Certik, a blockchain audit firm, witnessed its X account being hacked. Thereafter, malicious links were posted that promised people to return the digital assets they lost to various crypto scams. The dubious link was available on their website for quite sometime before the Certik team managed to regain access.\n\nThe X account of Mandiant, a cybersecurity company, was successfully reclaimed by its rightful owner on January 4, 2024, after falling victim to hacking. The incident unfolded over several hours on X, with users presenting evidence of the account takeover. The attackers, posing as the Phantom, a non-custodial crypto wallet, used the compromised Mandiant X account to promote a cryptocurrency scam.\n\nAlso Read: Just In: Founder of ACE Crypto Exchange Arrested for Fraud"

Discover SCENE\n\nTwitter has axed the option for paying premium users (formerly Twitter Blue subscribers) to use a verifiable NFT image as their profile picture (PFP), two years after debuting the feature,\n\nLaunched last January, the feature was billed as an exclusive benefit for paying users, introduced in the era before billionaire Elon Musk purchased the social media platform later that year. It was also seen by crypto advocates as a forward-thinking move that validated NFTs, ahead of similar decisions by Meta to integrate NFTs into Facebook and Instagram later that year.\n\nHowever, the ability for X Premium subscribers to activate the feature via the iPhone version of the mobile app is no longer available. TechCrunch first reported the move early Wednesday, noting that X Premium marketing no longer mentions the feature. Decrypt independently confirmed that the option is not currently offered within the app.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUsers were previously able to designate an Ethereum NFT as a profile picture by confirming ownership via the blockchain, and the image would be shaped like a hexagon rather than the standard circular PFP. It\u2019s unclear whether users who still had an NFT equipped will still be able to use the verification method, or whether it profile pictures will still appear as hexagons on the platform.\n\nTwitter has yet to comment publicly on the decision. Decrypt reached out to the company and received an automatic reply stating, \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d Previously, under Musk\u2019s regime, the platform\u2019s press outreach email address returned a poop emoji to any received email.\n\nCrypto Twitter users have largely responded by memeing the news, with many people posting some variation of the following tweet: \u201cX has removed support for NFT PFPs. Just so you know: Digital property rights are not a joke. If any of you take screenshots of my [NFT] and pretend it's yours, I will sue you.\u201d\n\nX has removed support for NFT pfps.

If any of you take screenshots of my CryptoPunk and pretend it's yours, I will sue you. pic.twitter.com/SHnSNEjXqo \u2014 Farokh (@farokh) January 10, 2024\n\nWhile Twitter was the first of the social media giants to embrace NFTs, Meta moved on much faster. In March 2023, Meta announced that it was \u201cwinding down\u201d support for NFTs on Instagram to focus on other priorities. Meta is still building towards its vision of the metaverse, a more immersive future internet, but has shifted more attention to AI development of late.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNews of Twitter's removal of the NFT profile picture feature comes following major crypto-related drama on the platform. On Tuesday, the official account of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tweeted that it had approved trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But minutes later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler tweeted that the account had been \"compromised\" and that the approval was not yet made.\n\nTwitter confirmed late Tuesday that the SEC account lacked two-factor authorization to secure access, and that someone had gained unauthorized access to a phone number tied to the account. On Wednesday, the SEC said that it has asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to help investigate the issue, with the regulator claiming that the false tweet was not a saved draft that an unauthorized user posted ahead of schedule.\n\nEven so, the SEC is still expected to announce the official approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States on Wednesday, with analysts projecting a late afternoon announcement ahead of trading expected to begin Thursday.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Among the key factors contributing to the strength seen among the L2s is their dominance in terms of total value locked (TVL), with ARB topping the sector. Based on data from decentralized finance L2Beat, Arbitrum boasts a market share of 49.28% among L2s, followed by Optimism with 28.77%.\n\nNEW: @ValkyrieFunds Chief Investment Officer @stevenmcclurg says it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if he saw \u201cRipple\u201d ($XRP) and Ethereum spot ETFs coming to market now that the @SECGov is about to approve one for Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/EBcwvbgChs\n\nNow that BTC ETF has been approved, ETH ETF could be the next mania, with several participants in the crypto sector, including Valkyrie Fund CIO Steven McClurg, already envisioning an ETH ETF launch.\n\nEthereum L2s, among them, Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC), Immutable X (IMX), Mantle (MNT) and SKALE (SKL) are recording double-digit gains. This has inspired thoughts of a possible Ethereum season setting in, instigated by a push for ETH ETF with L2s going on a tear.\n\nEthereum ( ETH ) price is trading with a bullish bias, coming on the back of anticipation that an ETH spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) will come to the market shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the launch of the BTC ETF. The overflows from the ETH market have spilled to the blockchain\u2019s Layer 2 (L2) tokens.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
