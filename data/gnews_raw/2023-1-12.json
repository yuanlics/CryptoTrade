        "content": "Ethereum has reached another milestone as the number of validators on its network now exceeds 500,000, data from BeaconScan shows.\n\nValidators are essential in guaranteeing the integrity and security of the Ethereum network. They operate by consensus to process transactions on the blockchain by verifying that the conditions specified in each transaction\u2019s smart contract code have been met.\n\nA validator must deposit 32 ETH (roughly $45,000) to run a dedicated staking node on the proof-of-stake blockchain. Today, staked funds are locked in the network, and while they accrue staking rewards from Ethereum\u2019s inflation, validators are unable to access the funds until after the Shanghai upgrade, expected to happen in March, which will allow withdrawals of staked ether for the first time.\n\nThe increase in number of active validators is a positive sign for the Ethereum ecosystem, John Jefferies, chief marketing officer at Blocknative, a real-time Web3 infrastructure company, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThe network is on the verge of reaching 500,000 active validators, pointing to increasing confidence, positive market sentiment, and conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole,\u201d Jefferies said.\n\nJefferies predicted that once the Shanghai upgrade is completed and staked ETH becomes accessible, it is likely that there will be a more liquid and free-flowing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see even more people spin up validators after Shanghai as they gain the peace of mind knowing they can unstake their ETH more fluidly,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: BeaconScan\n\nEthereum recently saw its total value stake reach 16 million ETH (over $22 billion), implying that it would be extremely difficult and costly to attack the network\u2019s consensus, Ben Edgington, a lead product owner at ConsenSys, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWe can consider the security of the Ethereum network on two axes. One is the total value staked,\u201d Edgington said. \u201cThe other is the degree of decentralization.\u201d\n\nAlthough decentralization is a little more difficult to analyze, as many validators are run by the same entities, reports show that they are spread across at least 11,400 physical nodes in 80 countries.\n\n\u201c[This] is a considerable degree of decentralization, and much more distributed than we had under proof-of-work,\u201d prior to the Merge, Edgington said. \u201cMany of these nodes are run by home stakers such as myself, underpinning the protocol with a huge degree of resilience and diversity.\u201d\n\nUpdated Jan. 12, 2022 at 7:43 pm ET: Headline and first paragraph changed to reflect that Ethereum now has more than 500,000 validators.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

For the last five years, almost every investor has tried to find different ways to express that theme. But for the first time ever, we're coming out of a bear market with real product market fit,\u201d which includes four areas: bitcoin, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi). \u201cIf you want to express all of those areas of blockchain with one investment, it would be Ethereum. It has wrapped bitcoin, the largest stablecoin presence, the largest NFT presence and the largest DeFi presence,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIn some ways, ETH is basically a crypto index now.\u201d Dorman said he wouldn\u2019t worry about the potential sell-off pressure from unlocking staked ETH following the upgrade: \u201cThere might be some pent-up demand to get liquidity from those who have had no liquidity for the last six or so months, but that will easily be replaced by people who didn't stake the first time because they needed liquidity.\u201d"

        "content": "Are you interested in getting involved in the cryptocurrency market but don\u2019t know where to begin? Have you heard about Bitcoin and Ethereum, but aren\u2019t sure if you can buy one with the other? Look no further! In this blog post, we\u2019ll be exploring the ins and outs of buying Bitcoin with Ethereum.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both digital currencies that are becoming more widely accepted. Since these two virtual coins are both popular with investors, it makes sense to explore the possibility of using one to purchase the other. By understanding how to buy bitcoin with ethereum, you can open up a new way of investing that could help you grow your portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to buying bitcoin with ethereum, there are several steps that must be followed in order to complete a successful purchase:\n\nGet a suitable Ethereum wallet: Make sure the wallet you choose is secure and allows you to make purchases safely. Some wallets may also require the use of two-factor authentication or other forms of security. Connect your wallet directly to an exchange: Most exchanges allow users to transfer funds directly from their Ethereum wallets without having an intermediary party involved in the transaction. Calculate fees: Before making any purchases, make sure you understand what fees might be associated with your transaction, especially if you\u2019re buying from an exchange that isn\u2019t based in your own country or jurisdiction. Buy Bitcoin through an exchange: After connecting your Ethereum wallet to an exchange and calculating any applicable fees, you can then start buying Bitcoin directly from the platform by placing prices accordingly and responding quickly when those higher offer prices come along!\n\nHow to find the best bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nWhen deciding which Bitcoin exchange to use, it is important to consider a few factors:\n\nAmount of Bitcoin that the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them.\n\nthat the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them. Liquidity of the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold.\n\nof the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold. User reviews \u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision?\n\n\u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision? Security of each exchange and whether or not there have been any prior hacking attempts.\n\nFinding a reliable Bitcoin exchange requires research into available exchanges, particularly those that accept Ethereum as an alternative payment method in addition to fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Some popular exchanges offer both crypto-to-crypto trading along with fiat-to-crypto trading while others may have only one option available. Many exchanges also offer margin trading (trading on leverage) which may significantly increase your risk but can also potentially bring higher profits if handled well. Leverage should only be used by advanced traders who understand its risks!\n\nMany users choose to secure their own wallets as best protection against theft or losses due to scams; this will require additional research into best practices for securely storing cryptocurrency assets safely offline before making trades on any given platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to buying Bitcoin with Ethereum, it is important to evaluate the costs and benefits. Exchange rates vary from exchange to exchange, and the fees associated with buying or trading cryptocurrencies can add up quickly. It is recommended that potential buyers research the different exchanges available and use caution when transferring funds from one platform to another.\n\nMany exchanges offer users the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin with Ethereum through a cryptocurrency contract for difference (CFD). Before investing in crypto-assets, users should be aware of the risks associated with trading and ensure that they are comfortable assuming those risks. With careful attention and due diligence, it can be possible for investors to safely buy Bitcoin using their Ethereum holdings."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) price technicals suggest that 35% gains are in play by March 2022 due to several bullish technical and fundamental factors.\n\nEther price rises above two key moving averages\n\nOn Jan. 8, Ether\u2019s price crossed above its 21-week exponential moving average (21-week EMA; the purple wave) and 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA; the orange wave).\n\nHistorically, these two moving averages have separated bull and bear markets. When ETH\u2019s price trades above them, it is considered to be in a bull market, and vice versa.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart featuring 21-week EMA and 200-day SMA. Source: TradingView\n\nThe last time Ether crossed above its 21-week EMA and 200-day SMA was in April 2022. But this was a fakeout, in part due to the collapse of Terra (LUNA) the following month.\n\nBut while Ether\u2019s MA crossover does not guarantee further gains, the upside potential becomes greater if one looks at it in conjugation with other bullish factors, described below.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork, shark accumulation\n\nEther\u2019s price has risen by up to 20% in the first two weeks of January 2023, driven upward by an easing macro outlook and growing anticipation of Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade is expected to go live in March and will enable withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\nRelated: 5 signs that an altcoin bull run could be underway\n\nSeveral experts, including Messari research analyst Kunal Goel and IntoTheBlock head of research Lucas Outumuro, believe the Shanghai upgrade will make staking Ether more attractive despite the sell-off risks of unlocking a large chunk of Ether\u2019s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, a rise in Ethereum\u2019s richest addresses is already underway by entities called \u201csharks\u201d that hold anywhere between 100 and 10,000 ETH. The number of sharks has grown by 3,000 since November 2022, according to data from Santiment.\n\nEthereum shark addresses. Source: Santiment\n\nThis suggests a strong accumulation of ETH, which may be a key reason behind ETH\u2019s current rebound so far in 2023.\n\nETH\u2019s price eyes breakout above key trendline\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Ether is eyeing a breakout above a resistance confluence, namely the 50-3D EMA (the red wave) near $1,395, and a descending trendline that comes as a part of a prevailing symmetrical triangle.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn other words, a decisive close above the confluence could have ETH pursue a run-up toward its next upside target at its 200-3D EMA (the blue wave) near $1,880, up around 35% compared to current price levels.\n\nInterestingly, the $1,880 level was instrumental as resistance in May 2022 and August 2022.\n\nConversely, a pullback from the confluence would increase Ether\u2019s possibility of undergoing a correction toward the symmetrical triangle\u2019s lower trendline around $1,200, or a 15% price decline from current levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

While the rewards rates vary, MetaMask\u2019s site claims users can earn a yield of about 5.22% per year on ETH deposits with Lido, and 4.59% with Rocket Pool.\n\nAccording to Lido\u2019s website, over $6.9 billion of ETH is currently staked through its service, earning users roughly 4.9% annually. Lido is a so-called liquid staking provider, meaning users who stake ETH through Lido receive an equivalent amount of Staked Ethereum (stETH) in return for their staked tokens. This enables stakers to remain \u201cliquid\u201d while locking up their ETH, allowing them to use their stETH on other DeFi services.\n\nStaked Ethereum currently trades at a slight discount to ETH. While ETH is priced at around $1,418, stETH currently trades for $1,407, per CoinGecko data.\n\nStory continues\n\nLido is currently the most popular staking provider, with 29% of all staked ETH, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nRocket Pool is another liquid staking service, which provides users with rETH in return for their staked tokens. But Rocket Pool on MetaMask appears to have already reached \u201cmax capacity,\u201d meaning users may only have the option to stake ETH through Lido on MetaMask for now.\n\nRocket Pool staking via MetaMask has reached capacity.

We have seen an exciting engagement since the news went live four hours ago,\u201d Mian said.\n\nBut there are other options for ETH staking beyond the two providers MetaMask now offers through its platform. Coinbase, Binance US, Kraken, and Nexo also offer Ethereum staking, each with varying rewards rates. Of those centralized providers, only Coinbase and Nexo currently offer a liquid staking option, returning Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) tokens or Nexo Staked Ethereum (NETH) in exchange for ETH, respectively.\n\nSolo staking is also an option\u2014but users will need a minimum of 32 ETH (roughly $45,800) to do so.\n\nStaking Benefits\n\nBecause Ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain, more users staking ETH and running validators around the globe will, in theory, make the network more secure and decentralized over time. That\u2019s a good thing for the network, which has been criticized for being more centralized when compared to Bitcoin.\n\nBig Firms Dominate Post-Merge Ethereum Validation\n\nPassive income through staking rewards might also seem like a no-brainer to some who are long-term holders and don\u2019t plan to immediately sell or trade their bags of ETH in the short term.\n\nStaking Risks\n\nBut locking up crypto with a third party has its risks. There\u2019s a common phrase in crypto: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d And it has unfortunately rung true as the market deals with the devastating effects of Terra\u2019s crash and FTX\u2019s meltdown. Even now, as Gemini shutters its \u201cEarn\u201d program following the collapses of crypto lenders BlockFi and Celsius, should holders ever trust their crypto with a third party at all? What are the risks, and what do Ethereum developers think?\n\nEthereum Staking Pools: Who Runs the Largest Ones?\n\nMetaMask parent firm ConsenSys explained in a post last month what it believes to be the primary risks that come with staking ETH. Specifically, it points to potential risks surrounding compromised third-party software, buggy smart contracts, and substantial token price fluctuations.\n\nIt also raises the possible risks associated with undesirable governance decisions made through any related DAOs, issues with code transfers, \u201clegal uncertainty,\u201d and the possibility of compromised private keys. While that might seem like a broad range of potential risks, each one is possible if the user compromises their own data\u2014or a powerful third-party makes decisions that change the rules of the game.\n\nStaking Withdrawals\n\nBefore considering staking Ethereum, it\u2019s essential to know that unstaking is not currently available. This means that right now, your Ethereum can go in\u2014but it can\u2019t yet come out. This might come as a shock to some, as it means that staking is currently a one-way experience, but Ethereum developers have plans to change that very soon.\n\nEthereum Staking Tokens Rally as Shanghai Upgrade Nears\n\nThe Shanghai update slated for early this year will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\n\n\u201cAfter the Shanghai update, stakers will then be able to withdraw their rewards and/or principle deposit from their validator balance if they choose,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website reads.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden told Decrypt that withdrawals could come as soon as March.\n\n\u201cWe have launched three withdrawal devnets and will do some withdrawal shadow forks soon (where we enable the feature on a shadow copy of the normal Ethereum chain),\u201d he told Decrypt in a message. \u201cWithdrawals are expected to go live in March.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Ethereum holders should stake their ETH or not, \u201cpeople should listen to their gut whether they want to stake now or in a couple of months,\u201d van der Wijden said.\n\n\u201cThe code for withdrawals is mostly done, but it still needs to be thoroughly tested before being rolled out,\u201d he said."

This might come as a shock to some, as it means that staking is currently a one-way experience, but Ethereum developers have plans to change that very soon.\n\nThe Shanghai update slated for early this year will enable staked ETH withdrawals.\n\n\u201cAfter the Shanghai update, stakers will then be able to withdraw their rewards and/or principle deposit from their validator balance if they choose,\u201d the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website reads.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden told Decrypt that withdrawals could come as soon as March.\n\n\u201cWe have launched three withdrawal devnets and will do some withdrawal shadow forks soon (where we enable the feature on a shadow copy of the normal Ethereum chain),\u201d he told Decrypt in a message. \u201cWithdrawals are expected to go live in March.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Ethereum holders should stake their ETH or not, \u201cpeople should listen to their gut whether they want to stake now or in a couple of months,\u201d van der Wijden said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe code for withdrawals is mostly done, but it still needs to be thoroughly tested before being rolled out,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Crypto trader Jason Pizzino warns that Ethereum (ETH) could undergo a heavy correction after experiencing a modest rally this week.\n\nIn a new video, Pizzino tells his 279,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum\u2019s bear market downtrend remains intact despite the second-largest crypto asset by market rallying by over 10% this week.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t broken the bear market downtrend on the log scale yet, we haven\u2019t got past the monthly swing tops here at around $1,700 and $2,000. So there\u2019s still a little bit of resistance or a significant amount of resistance to the upside for ETH.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,400 at time of writing.\n\nPizzino says that despite Ethereum looking bullish for the short-term, that could change if the US dollar appreciates and Bitcoin (BTC) and other risk assets turn bearish.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin does happen to turn down and the S&P [stocks index] starts to turn down, the dollar index starts to rise and put pressure on the commodities, and of course, these risk assets will also be hit, then maybe we start to see Ethereum roll over.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, Ethereum could hit a low last recorded in December of 2020 once the critical support levels crumble.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be the two key areas \u2013 $1,080, watch that level, and then also watch $880 as well.\n\nIf these levels start to break, then we\u2019re probably going to test this particular zone right here [between $700 and $900] and that could lead to some much cheaper ETH prices.\n\nHopefully, we can get something between sort of $700 and $900 on ETH. Long way off, maybe it doesn\u2019t happen. But they are the key areas to watch here for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent tweet published by on-chain data vendor Santiment has offered one of the main reasons for the second largest crypto, Ethereum, to surge above the $1,400 level.\n\nHere's what has made a large contribution to Ethereum's price rise.\n\nUptick in number of ETH shark addresses\n\nOn Jan. 11, the second most popular token followed Bitcoin's bullish streak and briefly rose above the $1,400 level. Santiment team of analysts has shared that one of the major reasons behind this growth was a sharp increase in shark addresses over the past two and a half months.\n\nEthereum has reached that price level for the first time since early November.\n\nTheir tweet has it that, in the past 10 weeks, 3,000 new shark wallets emerged on the ETH network, storing from 100 to 10,000 Ethers each. Overall, the analysts have observed the highest peak of 48,556 wallets that heavy with Ether since February 2021.\n\n\ud83e\udd88 #Ethereum has jumped above $1,400 for the first time since November 7th. Over the past 10 weeks, ~3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network. 48,556 shark addresses is the highest level recorded since Feb, 2021. https://t.co/yJfTP3QhKI pic.twitter.com/4tzS0nsph9 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2023\n\nThe second reason is that Ethereum followed Bitcoin in its rise. On Jan. 11, the flagship cryptocurrency surged above the $18,000 level for the first time in a month.\n\nAs a reminder, at the start of November, Bitcoin was trading above the $21,000 level. However, a sudden crash of the FTX crypto giant and its pocket trading firm Alameda Research sent waves of shock through the crypto market. Bitcoin plunged to $15,883 and has been trading mainly in the $16,800 range since then.\n\nDOGE co-founder sells bunch of ETH\n\nAs covered by U.Today earlier, one of the two co-founders of DOGE meme token announced that he had sold \"a bunch of ETH\" at the $1,190 price mark. Billy Markus, the co-founder, also known on Twitter as Shibetoshi Nakamoto in honor of the mysterious Bitcoin creator, explained this sale, saying that he had to pay taxes for 2022.\n\nAlas, he sold the ETH just a day before the price went up above the $1,220 level.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum is sitting at $1,398 per coin, showing a nearly 5% rise in the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency is essentially decentralized digital or virtual money that lacks a central bank and a central authority. It can be compared to an online currency that operates without the help of conventional financial institutions like banks or credit card firms and instead relies on blockchain technology.\n\nIt is called a cryptocurrency because the money units are kept in blocks of cryptographic algorithms encrypted for security. Each block has a header that includes details like the transfer amount, date of creation, and various other fields and hashes that uniquely identify each transaction in that block.\n\nIn addition to its decentralized structure, which makes it highly challenging for hackers, millions upon millions of devices called miners take account of every single transaction to ensure that nothing ever gets lost or stolen.\n\nOne of the most well-known applications of blockchain technology is for developers to create their own cryptocurrency. Blockchain has numerous valuable characteristics, like total transparency and the impossibility for anyone outside the network to alter data that is kept there.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency platform by market value, trailing only Bitcoin. It is a decentralized blockchain technology platform that enables developers to create their currencies. Ethereum is one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap, Ethereum\u2019s value has risen by more than 100% during the past few years. When making a choice in the market, it is crucial to keep an eye on the current Ethereum price."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin on eating sushi in Ukraine, how crypto can help in a crisis, and what\u2019s next for Ethereum - Fortune",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is one of the most influential people in crypto. Nine years ago, he dreamed up Ethereum as a way to leverage the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin for all sorts of uses beyond currency. Since then, it\u2019s emerged as the bedrock layer of what advocates say will be a new, open-source, decentralized internet.\n\nMeanwhile, even as the technology he invented is changing the world, Buterin has defied the stereotype of a crypto bro, focusing more on learning and ideas than on wealth and status. He recently visited Ukraine and spoke with Fortune contributor Anna Tutova, sharing his thoughts on everything from global politics to crypto\u2019s potential to help people trapped in crisis situations and war. This includes Ukraine itself, which has reportedly received over $184 million in crypto donations\u2014including $5 million from Buterin, who\u2019s denounced Russia\u2019s brutal and lawless invasion.\n\nReminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 24, 2022\n\nButerin also discussed the latest developments in the world of Ethereum, including plans to make the platform more scaleable. Here is an edited version of their conversation.\n\nAnna Tutova: Can you tell more about your trip to Kyiv? How did you like it? How was the conference?\n\nVitalik Buterin: The trip to Kyiv itself was fascinating because I normally go to places by airplane and it\u2019s just fairly fast and convenient. The airplanes are not landing in Ukraine while the war is going on. I came in by train from Warsaw, and that was this big, long 18-hour train ride, though it was also the most comfortable 18-hour train ride I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nWe stayed at a hotel in the middle of town. I got a chance to see different parts of the city that day and the morning of the next day as well. Then I had a meeting with the vice prime minister of Ukraine and attended the Kyiv Tech Summit. I think one of the reasons I wanted to go was just I really wanted to see what kinds of things people would actually be working on in a tech summit in the middle of the war, what people would say, what kind of things people would be up to.\n\nI got a chance to talk to some of the hackers. It was a small group, but it was definitely a very dedicated and devout group, there were people who were working on blockchain-based projects trying to do identity for refugees or cryptocurrency-based applications, etc. On a panel with government officials, we held some interesting discussions on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and how all of these different ideas could be valuable to Ukraine. It was not a large event, but it still felt like a very high-quality event. I thought it was a great community.\n\nVitalik Buterin in Ukraine. Vitalik Buterin/Anna Tutova\n\nAT: Can you tell more which projects you liked there? What type of projects do you think are needed during this time of the war?\n\nVB: People told me that cryptocurrency was very valuable as a way for the governments to get resources and supplies that they very urgently needed in the first couple of weeks when the war started, when none of the other financial systems was working and the foreign governments had not started bringing in supplies yet. And cryptocurrency continues to be important to a lot of the different groups, just as a form of fundraising and as a way of moving money to people.\n\nAside from cryptocurrency as money, I think digital identity applications are interesting. Because there are a lot of refugees who obviously left quickly without a lot of things, and they need some kind of a way to interact with the economy to prove that they are trustworthy, to prove something about themselves, so that people would be willing to work with them and to be able to give aid and goods and services to them. And it was interesting to see that people were starting to use pretty advanced ideas around zero-knowledge (ZK) stuff that I had been talking about for the last one to two years. There was also an interesting project to integrate the Ukrainian digital ID. And there was one group that was trying to create an integration between all of that into a Gitcoin passport.\n\nAT: How did you like Kyiv?\n\nVB: Kyiv was surprisingly easy as it looked like a normal European city. The government\u2019s areas were definitely very militarized\u2014there were some soldiers. And there were a lot of posters such as, \u201cBe brave like Ukraine.\u201d But aside from that it just seemed like people were going about their lives and going for groceries, going to restaurants, doing all the normal things. And one of the ways that people described it to me, it was almost just the act of continuing to live a normal life in the middle of invasion.\n\nThe food was great. One of the best sushi restaurants I\u2019ve ever been to was the one in Kyiv. It was called Ikigai. And aside from that, we just had all kinds of food, some Ukrainian, some vegan-friendly, Georgian places. I was impressed. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to coming back next time for longer.\n\nAT: It sounds like you had a great trip. Was it scary for you when you were in Ukraine because of the war?\n\nVB: I definitely did not know what to expect. I\u2019m obviously following things on the Internet and on Twitter. I do theoretically know that Kyiv is about 450 kilometers away from the front line at this point. But at the same time, I did not know what to expect. So, are there going to be some kind of missile attacks? Like what would Ukrainian security itself look like? And just all kinds of very unknown, unknown things. But, in general, it ended up just being more normal in a lot of ways than I expected.\n\nAT: How do you generally see the development of the crypto industry in Ukraine? You travel quite a lot, you see different countries, different jurisdictions. On which level is crypto in Ukraine?\n\nVB: So, the Ukrainian crypto community in general is definitely strong. Even a lot of these projects that are known internationally to us, some of their founders are Ukrainian. I think NEAR Protocol is obviously a good example there.\n\nThe Ethereum foundation has a couple of Ukrainians. And a lot of just very good and very smart developers. And the other thing, which is interesting and unique, is the extent to which the government is very willing to participate in this space and try to be very active and forward-thinking.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of a trip to Estonia that I had about five years ago. Talking to the governments felt like talking to a startup. And Ukraine really gave me a very similar feeling. Also, I\u2019ve been to Montenegro recently, even the governments there are trying to pass the blockchain law and try to be as blockchain friendly as possible. It seems like Eastern Europe is definitely a place where people really want to do things and the very active involvement of people in institutions and the government is interesting.\n\nOne contrast might be Latin America. I\u2019ve also been very impressed by the crypto community, especially Argentina and Brazil. I was just on the east of Mexico about a month ago. And in that case, you definitely don\u2019t see as much government attention.\n\nAT: Let\u2019s talk about Ethereum stuff. You recently achieved a big milestone, the Ethereum Merge, the transition from energy consuming proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, but let\u2019s start with a more general question: How did you get into crypto?\n\nVB: I first got into crypto back in 2011. I heard about Bitcoin on the internet. I heard about Bitcoin again from my dad, and I thought this is interesting. I went on the Bitcoin Forum and I started looking for people that would be willing to give me jobs that pay Bitcoin, and I found someone who was willing to pay five Bitcoins\u2014which back then was $4\u2014for every article that I would write for his blog. I started writing articles, and so I started my Bitcoin career as a writer. I did the Bitcoin magazine for two years.\n\nIn 2013, I dropped out of university and became a Bitcoin person full time. I also started my nomad adventure then\u2014what I thought would just be a six-month trip around the world to explore all of the different Bitcoin communities. But then around the end of the trip I came up with the idea for Ethereum, and from then the trip just kept on getting more and more extended. And so, I\u2019ve been sort of on the go about nine years now. But, I came up with the idea for theory after seeing some of the other ideas that other people had.\n\nPeople in Israel, for example, would try to use the Bitcoin blockchain to do things other than just a Bitcoin currency. And I felt the idea was very interesting. I wanted to make an even-more-powerful and more-general-purpose version that people could build any applications on. So, I started Ethereum, and then the project just kept on growing.\n\nAT: So what are your next steps to improve Ethereum scalability, and what are your next milestones?\n\nVB: So Ethereum\u2019s roadmap for scaling is this approach that we call a rollup-centric roadmap. It\u2019s like a hybrid between the Bitcoin-like roadmap, where they basically say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change Layer-1. Layer-1 is what it is going to be. But we are going to build second-layer things on top.\u201d So, with Bitcoin there is the Lightning network, and we\u2019re basically trying to scale entirely through these Layer-2 things that plug into Layer-1, but that work differently, so they have more scalability. This is versus a more EOS or Solana kind of approach to scale, which is basically focused on keeping everyone on Layer-1, but making the Layer-1 itself as powerful as possible.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want the network to become centralized, but people also understand the need for functionality. So, this rollup-centric roadmap makes some improvements to Layer-1 to make it possible to build these Layer-2 protocols that can support many more transactions. And then it\u2019s up to the Layer-2 protocols to actually build the thing that supports those transactions. There are already a lot of these platforms: Optimism, Arbitrum, Scroll, Starkware, zkSync. As well Polygon, which started as a kind of more trusted and a little bit more centralized sidechain thing, but they hired these very good zero-knowledge teams and they\u2019re on their way to becoming more like a rollup themselves.\n\nAT: So, you mentioned a lot of zkEVM rollups and different Layer-2 solutions. What are your thoughts on zero-knowledge proofs and zkEVMS?\n\nVB: ZK proofs as a technology are going to be as important as blockchains. I think, obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are really powerful in their ability to add privacy and add scalability to our blockchain applications. And the two technologies are very complementary. Because blockchains give you things like censorship resistance and a guarantee that rules are being followed, something like a smart contract. But in order to get those guarantees, blockchains sacrifice scalability, and they really sacrifice privacy. By default, you have basically no privacy on a blockchain. But then zero-knowledge proofs let you keep the censorship resistance and keep the guarantee that rules are being followed, but you get back scalability and you get back privacy. At some point, we are going to get to a world where we can just start adding ZK proofs to everything.\n\nAT: I noticed that you support Scroll quite a lot.\n\nVB: Yeah, they have a great team, great people, they\u2019ve been working hard at making zkEVM possible. I think other teams are great too\u2014the Starkware team has been working at this longer than everyone else, and I also have to thank them for just teaching me a lot of the math behind how zk-SNARKS work. They contributed a lot to the development of the whole space, and they\u2019re also working on Cairo, which is their own programming language for Starks.\n\nAnd there are projects, which are on top of Cairo, that are also making zkEVMs\u2014ImmutableX and some of the products they\u2019re building. In a lot of cases, there are very good compromises between decentralization and a kind of centralization that might be needed to make applications more efficient for the short term. I basically think that the Starkware idea of validiums would obviously be probably a better thing for institutions to be using than the private blockchains that everyone was excited about five years ago. So they\u2019re doing lots of great stuff. The Polygon team contributed a lot and their zkEVM development is great as well. The Loopring team as well had zkEVM rollups running years ago, when no one else did. I\u2019m very happy with the kind of community that we\u2019ve built.\n\nAnna Tutova is the CEO of Coinstelegram, a crypto media and public relations firm."

        "title": "Why a 'Tiny' NFT Game Is Ditching Solana for Ethereum's Immutable X - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe ongoing crypto winter has been painful for the entire industry, but 2022 was particularly rough for Solana. The collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, which were closely linked to and financially entrenched in the Solana ecosystem, accelerated a decline in a year marked by technical issues and high-profile hacks.\n\nAlthough Solana hosts a thriving NFT ecosystem and growing gaming push, the turbulent times and 94% token price plunge have pushed some creators to look for greener pastures elsewhere. Solana game Tiny Colony is the latest project to chart a move to another blockchain, following a similar announcement from the creator of DeGods and y00ts.\n\nTiny Colony developer Tinyverse Games announced its plan today to move its still-in-development NFT game\u2014a blockchain-based construction and management simulator\u2014from the Solana blockchain to Ethereum scaling network, Immutable X.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Immutable has been very gaming-focused since the beginning,\" Tinyverse co-founder and CEO Arshia Navabi told Decrypt. \"They have an amazing development team and incredible technology focused around gaming.\"\n\nIn Tiny Colony, players must build and manage underground humanoid ant colonies, and strategically farm, mine, hatch larvae, and defend their colony to survive. Players earn NFTs that can be used in-game or traded on marketplaces. An early version of the game was launched for testers on Solana last summer, but the full version will now debut later this year on Immutable X.\n\nTiny Colony is a relatively small project compared to Ethereum games that have respectively yielded over a billion dollars or more worth of NFT sales, such as Axie Infinity and the Bored Ape Yacht Club's Otherside.\n\nThe project originally launched via Solana marketplace Fractal and has generated more than $3 million worth of NFT sales to date, according to Tinyverse. The game's NFTs currently start at less than $5 worth of SOL apiece on the secondary market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn NFT is a blockchain token that represents a unique item. In video games, that can mean things like in-game characters, accessories, digital land plots, and more. Elsewhere, NFTs are used for things like profile pictures (PFPs), artwork, sports and entertainment collectibles, and access passes to exclusive events and experiences.\n\nNavabi told Decrypt that Tiny Colony will let current Solana NFT holders swap for an Immutable X version of the same asset through a process it's calling a \"burn-in mint.\" More details on the redemption process will be shared \"over the next month or so\" as the technical process is finalized with help from Immutable X developers.\n\nWhy Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is both the creator of the Immutable X network and the developer of the NFT-based card game, Gods Unchained. Immutable X is a layer-2 scaling solution that enables faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum's own mainnet. Navabi said that Immutable's focus on gaming and the player experience was an ideal fit for Tiny Colony.\n\nConsidered by some to be an \"Ethereum killer,\" Solana has been a prominent alternative destination builders for decentralized apps (dapps) and NFTs, due to low fees and the ability to handle a larger bulk of transactions per second than Ethereum's own mainnet.\n\nBut the buzz that Solana garnered in 2021 didn't sustain throughout 2022, with network outages, increasing competition, and NFT market turmoil apparently helping to fuel a sharp decline in the token price. SOL has fallen from a November 2021 peak of $260 to a current price of around $16\u2014a much steeper drop than leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWe\u2019re fortunate that we haven\u2019t lost any funds in the FTX fallout, but we do have significant SOL reserves that we\u2019ll need to hold onto for a longer timeframe while the value of SOL and the market recovers. \u2014 Tiny Colony (@TinyColonyGame) November 17, 2022\n\nTinyverse previously commented on Solana's decline in a November tweet thread, writing that it while it didn't lose funds in the FTX collapse, it has \"significant SOL reserves that we\u2019ll need to hold onto for a longer timeframe while the value of SOL and the market recovers.\"\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, Solana was an incredible starting point for us. We got everything we have today because of [Solana],\" Navabi told Decrypt. However, when Tinyverse began discussions with Immutable and learned about its future plans and focus on games and NFTs, Navabi said he \"immediately got hooked.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFounded in 2021, Tinyverse consists of gaming, film, and TV veterans that have worked on projects for Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime, and Paramount, as well as gaming brands EA, Capcom, and PlayStation.\n\nAlthough Ethereum's own technical limitations make it too slow and expensive for many Web3 games, scaling networks like Immutable X and Polygon have increasingly been embraced by creators to enable games that allow for user-owned assets without significant transaction fees along the way.\n\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Tiny Colony to the rapidly growing Immutable X family and provide the team with our full suite of tools and solutions to make the game as accessible, engaging, and performant as possible,\" Immutable VP of Global Business Development Andrew Sorokovsky said in a statement.\n\nImmutable X's lack of gas fees for completing transactions was a key reason for the move, Navabi said, calling the network user-friendly for traditional (or Web2) gamers who may not understand what using gas means.\n\n\"Game developers and producers should stop expecting Web2 gamers to understand these elements, and just try to make this a very good landing home for them\u2014and make our Web3 games a very familiar space for them,\u201d he said. Navabi added that he believes Immutable X's \"strategies, timelines, and focus are very aligned with that.\"\n\nSolana exodus?\n\nTiny Colony's pivot comes less than a month after DeLabs announced that two of Solana's top PFP projects, DeGods and y00ts, will bridge to other platforms.\n\nDetails on the process are still unclear, but DeGods will shift to Ethereum and y00ts will migrate to Polygon, with the latter move facilitated by a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs (formerly Polygon Studios). Polygon Labs has reportedly tried recruiting other Solana projects, as well, with president Ryan Wyatt acknowledging in a tweet reply in December that the team has \"reached out to many projects across multiple chains.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNavabi said that while Tinyverse did not receive direct funding for its move, Immutable will provide a grant of IMX tokens based on project milestones hit once it's live on Immutable X. He claimed, however, that moving away from Solana to a new home was never about the money.\n\n\"That wasn't our focus,\" he said. \"If our focus were money, then we would go to Polygon or these different blockchains that offer massive dollar incentives for us to switch over.\u201d"

At the moment, one should pay attention to the daily closure. If it occurs closer to the resistance than to the support, the breakout of the $1,418 mark may be a repreqsuite for a rise to the $1,430 zone.\n\nOn the daily time frame, the price of trading is within yesterday's candle, which means that the main altcoin needs more time to accumulate power for a further move. In this case, sideways trading in the area of $1,400-$1,430 is the more likely scenario for the next few days.\n\nOn the bigger chart, the price is about to close above the nearest support level at $1,352.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is setting bullish price targets on Bitcoin (BTC) and the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Aptos (APT) but warns prices may dip first.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 188,400 Twitter followers that Bitcoin will soon hit the $19,000 price range.\n\nThe king crypto is rallying in recent days. At time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $18,182.\n\n\u201cBTC: Eventually I think that $19,000 is the area that price will go to, just don\u2019t know if we dip first or not. I think we fill this gap out a bit and there\u2019s more liquidity higher than current price.\u201d\n\nNext, he says Aptos could surge by more than 31% if Bitcoin continues to rally.\n\n\u201cAPT: Targeting $7 to fill this gap overall as long as BTC plays nice.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Aptos is changing hands at $5.33.\n\nHe also warns that while the crypto market has been rallying in recent days the bottom is likely not in. However, he says there are opportunities to turn profits with the price action.\n\n\u201c[In my opinion] it\u2019s unlikely this is the bottom, there\u2019s still probably more pain to come. With that said, there are still opportunities like the ones we have had the last few weeks \u2013 enjoy these times because it could be a while before we get another mini alt run like this one.\n\nIn other words, make the absolute most of these short altcoin runs where they go 25%-2x+. Hop on the narrative quickly, cross the spread, be aggressive. The next time this happens could be months away and we could just be back within that small trading range.\n\n2018 and 2019 were both years for altcoin trading (alt/BTC pairs, which was primary back then). Lots of chop happened and I expect a lot of the same for 2023 \u2013 lots of chop to come. With that said, we\u2019re still going to see a lot of these mini alt runs here and there.\u201d\n\nSherpa also analyzes the liquidity network platform WOO Network (WOO), saying it could drop down to $0.14 if Bitcoin starts to fall.\n\n\u201cLots of talk about this one lately on CT [crypto Twitter], it\u2019s one of my long-term holds. Was in this one since the beginning and just hold it at this point. 200-day EMA [exponential moving average] acting as resistance initially (normal), if looking to bid this, would aim for $0.15 and $0.14 if BTC dips.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, WOO is valued at $0.165.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto project by market cap, has achieved another milestone. The project has crossed 16 million staked ETH, four months after its historic transition to a PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism.\n\nAccording to Etherscan.io, more than 16 million ether (ETH) has been put into the Beacon Chain staking contract on Ethereum. The 16 million ETH is worth around $22.38 billion at the current rates. Moreover, it represents more than 13.28% of the whole ether supply. The latest milestone is almost two years after Ethereum\u2019s staking contract went live in 2020.\n\nValidators stake their Ether (ETH) for a chance to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Validators cannot takeout their staked ETH until the upcoming Shanghai update. The Shanghai update will likely take place in late February.\n\nThe increasing number of staked ETH is a sign that the network\u2019s security is robust, and adoption is strong.\n\nTheoretically, it should be more difficult for a single player to sabotage the Ethereum chain with a higher amount of staked ETH. However, a handful of significant actors presently own most of Ethereum\u2019s stake, raising worries that the chain\u2019s management is becoming overly centralized.\n\nData from Nansen suggests that there are around 92,500 distinct staking depositors, while BeaconScan shows that there are approximately 498,000 active validators.\n\nThere is a growing concern among many investors that there might be a sell-off of ETH after the Shanghai update. The update will allow the now over 16 million ETH to be withdrawn. This could lead to many wanting to sell their holdings.\n\nHowever, there are other things to consider. Firstly, a majority of the staked ETH is currently at a loss. According to Dune, 71.7% of the staked ETH is underwater, and only 28.3% is in the money.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nUnder such circumstances, an investor is unlikely to sell their holdings. Instead, they might prefer to continue staking their ETH and earning rewards.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,401.25, up by 5.3% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "The internet has become quickly fascinated by ChatGPT \u2013 the language model chatbot that seems to effortlessly provide long-form answers to any question.\n\nCrypto Twitter seems especially fascinated with the AI bot \u2013 from Casa founder Jameson Lopp to Twitter\u2019s new chief and Dogecoin enthusiast, Elon Musk.\n\nWe decided to ask ChatGPT a number of questions related to Bitcoin and crypto adoption \u2013 including those that are still hotly debated by humans. Here\u2019s what the infamous bot had to say.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nWe first asked what ChatGPT thought about Bitcoin: \u201cDoes Bitcoin have intrinsic value?\u201d\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest critics, such as gold bug Peter Schiff, would say no, arguing that the asset is purely speculative and destined to crash to zero. Yet the AI bot\u2019s answer was a bit more nuanced:\n\n\u201cSome people might argue that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and its ability to function as a digital store of value could be considered as intrinsic value,\u201d it stated.\n\nIts answer captures the view shared by some of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest proponents that the asset can become the \u201cdigital gold\u201d of the 21st century, thanks to its unmanipulable monetary policy.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what ChatGPT pointed out afterward when asked to compare Bitcoin to Ethereum. \u201cIt\u2019s often referred to as digital gold,\u201d it stated. \u201cIts primary use case is as a digital alternative to traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the Euro.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, it described Ether as having \u201cmore potential for innovation than Bitcoin,\u201d thus making it more attractive to developers. As explained by BitMEX in July, Ethereum\u2019s scripting language and culture have historically been more welcoming to change than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2013 though more dapps are starting to develop on the Bitcoin lightning network.\n\nWho is Satoshi?\n\nChatGPT isn\u2019t all-knowing, however: it admitted that the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 \u201chas not been revealed and is not publicly known.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some individuals have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto or have been suspected of being the creator, none of these claims have been independently verified,\u201d it said. Bitcoin SV founder Craig Wright has often accused others of defaming him when he claims to be the enigmatic founder \u2013 but he\u2019s yet to see much recent success in court.\n\nWhen asked if Bitcoin would ever become the world reserve currency, the bot didn\u2019t rule out the possibility. While it still lacks the \u201cinfrastructure, regulations, and stability,\u201d to be considered as such, it is still \u201cpossible that the future may bring changes to this situation\u201d as the technology grows and develops.\n\nFinally, ChatGPT is not a total nocoiner.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency and blockchain technology are not a scam,\u201d it said when asked \u201cIs crypto a scam?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut like any other financial market, there are risks and frauds to be aware of,\u201d it clarified."

        "content": "Ethereum, the world's most commercialised blockchain, is set to see the completion of another historic update, called the Shanghai update. As of now, people who staked Ether tokens to validate the blockchain had no way to withdraw their tokens. It is estimated that $22.38 billion (roughly Rs. 1,82,520 crore) worth of Ether tokens are currently staked on the blockchain. Around March, when the upgrade is slated to be complete, it will change the situation.\n\nThe amount of staked ETH spiked when Ethereum was preparing to switch from its power-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) module to a green alternative. That eco-friendly module is called the \u2018Proof-of-Stake' (PoS).\n\nIn PoS, blockchain validators stake their personal Ether tokens to create new blocks and verify transactions. In return, stakers get interest on their tokens.\n\nCalled the Merge, Ethereum's upgrade to PoS successfully completed in September last year.\n\nSome people will be able to withdraw ETH that have been staked since 2020, in a first opportunity to do so.\n\nAs per Blockonomi, over 15 million Ether tokens are currently staked at the network.\n\nAfter March, PoS Ethereum validators would get a choice to either keep their tokens staked or withdraw them.\n\nWhen staked ETH tokens are open to be withdrawn, it could encourage more people to become part of the network.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade is due in March 2023, enabling withdrawals from the beacon chain.\n\n\n\nThis allows ETH currently staked in ETH2.0 validators to be unstaked and withdrawn.\n\n\n\nHere's Arkham's primer on Liquid Staking Derivatives, and what we can see happening on-chain :point_down: pic.twitter.com/moQG9Jjtbb \u2014 Arkham | Crypto Intelligence (@ArkhamIntel) January 10, 2023\n\nWhen the update completes, it could shake Ether's value point, which at the time of writing stands at $1,398 (roughly Rs. 1.10 lakh).\n\nEthereum developers are reportedly looking to launch a public testnet for the Shanghai update in February.\n\nThe blockchain upgrade will also bring fixes and small improvements to its infrastructure.\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

The service begins with a public beta through the MetaMask portfolio decentralized application.\n\nUsers will be able to stake through Lido and Rocket Pool and view Lido (stETH) and Rocket Pool (rETH) staking token balances. These tokens can also be swapped back to ETH through MetaMask Swaps.\n\nLiquid staking is a method of staking assets on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to earn rewards while maintaining the ability to freely transfer and trade their assets. The assets are deposited in a smart contract, earning rewards based on the total amount staked by all users.\n\nMetaMask product manager Abad Mian told Cointelegraph that the service saw increased user demand for staking solutions following Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022.\n\n\u201cFrom an internal survey, 85% of respondents said they like to review several options before deciding where to stake their assets. In addition, over 74% of respondents stated that they are staking or interested in staking.\u201d\n\nMian also confirmed that MetaMask will explore the potential of offering additional liquid staking providers. He also clarified that MetaMask was not providing staking services directly but connecting users to Ethereum\u2019s major liquid staking providers through smart contract functionality.\n\nCointelegraph also enquired about the possibility of staking services being rolled out to MetaMask Institutional, the platform\u2019s offering serving institutional clients. While Mian declined to comment specifically, he noted that MetaMask continues to evaluate its offerings across its range of services.\n\nMian also said that the impact of staking tools on Ethereum\u2019s decentralization would depend on their popularity, user experience and demand for staking services.\n\n\u201cStaking is just one factor that can impact decentralization in a blockchain network.\u201d\n\nBlockchain analysis carried out by Nansen in December 2022 revealed that demand for liquid Ethereum staking services was on the rise following the Merge. As of Jan. 13, the Ethereum staking contract contains over 16 million ETH, with Lido\u2019s liquid staking pool the largest contributor with over 4.6 million ETH deposited."

        "content": "The Bybit crypto exchange has started a new web3 staking pool, enabling users to leverage its ethereum (ETH) staking options in time for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nIn a March 31 statement, shared with crypto.news, Bybit said it had developed a new staking product that simplifies interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nPreviously, users needed to complete eleven steps to add liquidity to Curve Finance. Per Bybit, the new product will reduce the process to three steps.\n\nThe crypto exchange also claimed that the new product could improve the annual percentage rate (APR) of ETH staking by as much as 6.5%.\n\nMoreover, Bybit says that its customers will not have to buy ETH to access the web3 staking pool as they can use BTC, USD Coin (USDC), and Tether (USDT).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Bybit_Official/status/1641289144688148482\n\nAccording to Bybit\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Ben Zhou, the company plans to roll out the new ETH staking option to coincide with Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe highly liquid and trading-integrated ETH staking pool will be rolling out around the time of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade [and] will open up many new opportunities for our users.\u201d Ben Zhou, Bybit co-founder and CEO.\n\nYou might also like: Bybit trading volumes surge amid USDC volatility\n\nShanghai upgrade to improve staked ETH usability\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a planned hard fork slated to occur by April 12, 2023. It will implement EIP-4895, allowing validators to withdraw ETH staked on the Beacon Chain from December 2020.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer that was launched in parallel to the original proof-of-work (PoW) execution layer of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade comes only months after the Merge, which combined the two layers, making Ethereum fully proof-of-stake and reducing its energy consumption by at least 99.5%.\n\nEthereum developers also expect the upgrade to improve the liquidity and usability of staked ETH (stETH), which accounts for about 14% of all ETH or 16 million tokens.\n\nIn addition to the ETH staking pool, Bybit said it would host two Shanghai upgrade-themed trading events in April. The first event, dubbed \u201cShanghai Upgrade Trading Bash,\u201d will be for Bybit\u2019s derivatives traders, and they\u2019ll have the opportunity to win part of a 450,000 USDC prize pool.\n\nThe second event, known as the \u201cSupreme Scorer 2023,\u201d will be open to all Bybit users, and they will have a chance to share in an 80,000 USDC bonus pool.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Liquid staking, also known as soft staking, is a more advanced form of traditional staking that's available on many new-generation smart contract protocols. With liquid staking, users can access their locked funds for other crypto-based activities while still earning rewards from their original deposit.\n\nLiquid staking experienced massive adoption in 2022 following the boom of decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. This article will explore the concept of liquid staking, its merits and drawbacks, and the best liquid staking providers in the market.\n\nEthereum's switch to PoS\n\nThe Ethereum network is crucial to our discussion, as it ushered in a new era of financial applications. Launched in 2015 by a team of eight developers, Ethereum is an advanced version of the Bitcoin network. According to principal founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum aims to expand the use of blockchain technology beyond value transfer.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum was created to be a more open and fluid crypto project, enabling the development of other applications on its principal software. This was possible due to its integration of smart contracts \u2014 bits of computer code that can self-execute based on predefined rules. Following its success, Ethereum became the hotbed for decentralized applications (DApps) and DeFi.\n\nHowever, Ethereum was built using the same consensus mechanism as the Bitcoin network: the Proof of Work (PoW) system. The PoW mechanism promotes competition among mining nodes spread across the globe, making it highly secure and decentralized. But this resulted in slow transaction speeds and high network fees.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum's role as the facilitator of more value-added services resulted in high gas fees, slow throughput, and high energy demands.\n\nThe team officially began transitioning from a Proof of Work protocol to a Proof of Stake (PoS) in December 2020, when they launched the Beacon Chain (Ethereum 2.0). The transition process was completed two years later, in September 2022, when the Ethereum network joined the ranks of Proof of Stake blockchains. Commenting on the migration, Buterin noted that the network now consumes 99.9% less energy than its previous consensus mechanism.\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nStaking borrows from the traditional concept of a yield-bearing savings account. In a bank, customers deposit their funds into an account and earn a certain percentage for keeping it there. Meanwhile, the bank loans this money to businesses as debts through the fractional reserve system. In return, the bank earns high interest and pays the customer a little token in interest rates.\n\nHowever, staking differs from what is obtained in the traditional sense in a few ways. Crypto assets \u2014 digital assets \u2014 are used to stake instead of fiat money.\n\nAnother major difference is that users earn higher staking rewards due to the principles that bind this practice. All blockchain systems are transparent and lack a central authority, so staking protocols operate without a go-between. This way, users earn the rewards that would have been used to settle intermediaries.\n\nIn its most basic form, staking requires users to lock up their crypto assets for a particular period to secure a network. Users are rewarded with newly minted coins of the underlying network for pledging their digital currencies. Staking is fast becoming an independent industry, with over $18 billion recorded in the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum staking options\n\nThere are now several staking offerings. Each option caters to a particular preference and is geared towards optimizing their potential growth. Below, we explore the different forms of staking and their potential limitations:\n\n1) Self-staking\n\nThis involves an individual becoming a validator on the Ethereum PoS blockchain. Validators are users who stake a large amount of the network\u2019s underlying asset to verify transactions on the platform. Instead of competing, validators take turns confirming transactions, thereby reducing the network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nSelf-staking on the Ethereum network comes with a high threshold. To become a validator and be accepted into the Ethereum ecosystem, one must stake a minimum of 32 ETH. This makes self-staking a capital-intensive exercise.\n\nAnother issue with this system is that a validator\u2019s staked ETH could be grossly impacted if there is a network issue or the validator makes a mistake when working. The Ethereum network will automatically slash the validator\u2019s staked ETH by half, forcing them to buy more ETH to continue operating.\n\nAdditionally, when a validator locks in their ETH, they can only unstake or access them once the lock time frame is completed. This can significantly impact them in the short term, as they can\u2019t move their assets to another platform if needed.\n\n2) Exchange staking\n\nA less capital-intensive staking option is exchange staking. Typically, this option involves a centralized crypto exchange creating a pool where customers can deposit their assets for staking. The exchange then takes these crypto assets and deposits them in a network to become a validator.\n\nThe upside to exchange staking is that users or pool contributors can easily unstake anytime they want. This doesn't affect the exchange pool due to the large amount of staked tokens.\n\nAnother benefit is that users can stake any amount of the crypto asset they have. They don\u2019t have to meet the 32 ETH threshold imposed on self-stakers or validators. In return, these exchanges reward pool contributors daily or monthly for trusting them with their crypto assets.\n\nBut this option isn't entirely rosy. Given the centralized nature of this system, stakers are often left in the dark as to how the exchange utilizes its funds. They also trust a centralized party with their funds. Another issue is that the platform could easily be breached or folded due to insolvency, making it impossible for users to recover their assets.\n\nThe last limitation of using an exchange staking medium is that most charge a withdrawal fee when users want to remove their funds.\n\n3) Locked staking\n\nAlthough not an outright staking system, locked staking comes with many limitations. Staked assets in this system will be largely inaccessible until the staking time frame elapses. This is ideal for users who want to build up their financial discipline and don't intend to access their funds for a long period.\n\nLocked staking usually ranges between one and three months on most exchanges. Validators who staked directly on the Ethereum protocol have a longer withdrawal window than most.\n\nWhat is liquid staking?\n\nLiquid staking is the newest staking service. This staking option requires users to pledge their funds to secure the network, but it's liquid or fluid in the sense that users can still access their funds.\n\nUnlike the traditional PoS system, liquid staking involves the storage of funds in DeFi escrow accounts. This allows users to access their tokens whenever they want, as the funds are highly liquid.\n\nWith liquid staking, users can generate multiple revenue streams from their crypto assets because they can lock their assets and still access them. They can use the liquid versions of their assets on other DeFi protocols and earn more on their initial deposits.\n\nHow does liquid staking work?\n\nWhile liquid staking shares similarities with other staking options, the methods used for execution are quite different. A new generation of protocols, known as liquid staking protocols, has been developed to provide the potential for traders to grow their crypto holdings.\n\nThese protocols allow users to stake any amount of an asset and unstake them without impacting the initial deposit. This way, deposits are locked on liquid staking platforms, and users are issued a tokenized version of their crypto assets. This derivative form carries the same value and operates one-to-one with the original asset. However, they're usually pegged with a different emblem to identify them.\n\nFor instance, if a staker deposits 1 ETH into one of such liquid staking services and requests a derivative, the user will receive one stETH, with the \"st\" representing staked ETH.\n\nThese new tokens can then be transferred out of the protocol, stored elsewhere, traded, or even spent without disrupting the initial deposit. The fluidity that liquid staking services offer isn't the only thing that makes them unique. Users will earn staking rewards on their initial deposits and generate more funds from their derivative tokens simultaneously, making it a win-win situation.\n\nIf a staker wants to withdraw their initial deposit, they must return an equivalent deposit valuation to access their funds. Some liquid staking protocols charge a fee for using their platform, but the fees vary.\n\nAdvantages of liquid staking\n\nStaking introduced a new experience for coin holders, allowing anyone to put their assets to work and potentially see them grow. However, liquid staking has taken the system even further. One of the benefits of liquid staking is its mobility.\n\nLocking funds for a long period can become a bad financial decision due to the volatile nature of crypto assets. When digital currencies are locked, their valuation also changes based on the underlying asset\u2019s performance. If a bear market is in full swing, staking, in the traditional sense, could result in a loss for a user. However, with liquid staking, users can easily withdraw a tokenized version and deposit it in more income-generating systems to cover such losses.\n\nAnother benefit is the multiple income streams liquid staking affords. Stakers can easily lock their funds on one platform and use a tokenized version as collateral to get crypto-backed loans. These loans can then be deposited on higher growth accounts, thereby providing more turnover. This makes liquid staking a huge favorite among DeFi-facing users.\n\nDisadvantages of liquid staking\n\nMuch like every financial-based system, liquid staking has its downsides and risks.\n\nOne such risk is that the tokenized asset could depeg from the original staked token. This happened with the Ethereum network, where stETH traded lower than ETH. This was due to extensive use of the tokenized version, resulting in an elastic supply.\n\nAnother risk of liquid staking is that if a user loses their tokenized asset in a trade, they also lose access to their deposited funds. The only way to retrieve the earlier deposit is to make another deposit equivalent to it.\n\nWhile liquid staking is innovative, it's powered by smart contracts. Smart contracts are highly efficient; however, they can be riddled with bugs, creating a pathway for hackers to drain users\u2019 funds. If this happens, users could lose all their funds with no means of retrieving them.\n\nTop liquid staking providers\n\nLiquid staking is an advanced crypto staking service, exclusively provided by a few platforms. Below, we list some top liquid staking protocols and the assets users can stake on them.\n\n1) Lido \u2014 overall best platform for liquid staking\n\nLido Finance, Lido for short, is the most well-known liquid staking provider. The platform, launched in 2020, allows users to stake their Ether tokens without locking them up. Lido launched by providing liquid staking services for the Ethereum network but has since expanded its offerings to Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama.\n\nOn Lido, users can stake across the PoS blockchains and deploy their crypto assets in other activities. This includes accessing lending platforms, like Aave, and participating in other high-growth opportunities. Once users stake their funds, Lido presents them with a tokenized variant depicted as \"st+the asset ticker.\" Stakers can then withdraw these derivatives and use them in 27+ DeFi applications and crypto wallets.\n\nStaking rewards on Lido range from 4.8% to 15.5%. Besides offering a liquid staking service, Lido also runs a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered by its network token LDO. With the digital token, users can vote on network proposals and potentially see growth in their assets through staking.\n\nFor its liquid staking services, Lido charges a 10% fee.\n\n2) Rocket Pool \u2014 Ethereum liquid staking protocol\n\nAn alternative liquid staking service is Rocket Pool. This protocol, launched in 2016, provides a user-friendly process for users to stake their ETH tokens on its platform. Rocket Pool operates as a base layer for trustless and decentralized ETH2 staking. The platform only caters to the Ether crypto asset.\n\nNonetheless, it offers dual services for its customers. Users can either stake their ETH directly on Rocket Pool and get a tokenized version of their asset pegged as rETH or directly run a node on the Rocket Pool ecosystem.\n\nGiven its dual-service offerings, Rocket Pool rewards users separately. For those who only stake ETH in return for rETH, the Rocket Pool service rewards them with a 4.16% annualized potential reward. On the other hand, those who stake ETH while simultaneously running a node earn a fixed 6.96% annualized potential reward plus a variable RPL reward issued by the platform for securing the Ethereum network.\n\nWith Rocket Pool, node operators don't need to submit the entire 32 ETH needed to run a node before operating on the Rocket Pool space. Instead, Rocket Pool lets validators start with half, which is 16 ETH. This makes it a more cost-effective option for node operators in the Ethereum PoS protocol.\n\n3) Tempus Finance \u2014 fixed income for tokens\n\nThe next top liquid staking protocol for DeFi users is Tempus. This new generation DeFi tool makes it possible for users to earn a fixed income on their tokens. This way, users can earn a fixed amount of passive revenue from their digital assets across all the protocols they deploy them on.\n\nAccording to the Tempus team, their multi-chain solution can be deployed in three different use cases.\n\nUsers can fix their future growth on their crypto assets. They can also speculate on the rate of their future growth. They can deploy their tokenized assets into liquidity pools and earn trading fees.\n\nTempus supports most reward-giving tokens on the Ethereum and Fantom blockchains, including stETH, yvDAI, xSUSHI, and aUSDC. Meanwhile, the protocol also operates an automated market maker (AMM), making it easier to provide liquidity on tokens that provide earnings.\n\nThe protocol doesn't charge any fees for staking. However, users need to pay swap fees to provide liquidity in the AMM pools.\n\n4) Hubble Protocol \u2014 borrow against staked crypto\n\nThe hubble protocol gained traction after participating in a Solana hackathon. Since then, the new liquid staking platform has gained massive popularity.\n\nHubble protocol has become popular because of its borrowing services. Users can borrow against their crypto and use the borrowed tokens as collateral on other DeFi platforms. This way, users can multiply their staking exposure as they earn from both their initial deposits and the loans they can access. The USDH stablecoin plays a crucial role in the hubble protocol as it is used in crypto loan services.\n\nHubble supports multiple assets and enables users to deposit from different networks. The platform then provides up to 11x leverage on the collateral, which users can use to trade. This exponentially increases their potential growth from their deposits.\n\nHubble charges a 0.5% fee on loans.\n\n5) Meta Pool \u2014 liquid staking for near protocol\n\nMeta Pool caters to the Near smart contract network. The liquid staking service allows users to stake their Near assets and get stNEAR in return. stNEAR can then be used for DeFi activities in the larger Near ecosystem and its growth-aggregating system, Aurora.\n\nMeta Pool delegates users\u2019 deposits to 65+ validators who monitor the performance of the deposited assets. In return for locking up funds in the DeFi protocol, Meta Pool rewards users with a 9.76% annualized potential reward, exclusive of the staking rewards from other growth activities. If the tokenized asset is deployed on the Aurora protocol, users can also gain 9.76% in rewards.\n\nMuch like all protocols reviewed in this article, Meta Pool provides immediate unstaking for assets. However, this comes with a 0.3% charge.\n\n6) OKTC liquid staking \u2014 stake and earn OKT with ease\n\nOKTC liquid staking is a cutting-edge liquid staking solution on OKT Chain (OKTC). Provided by OKX it allows users to stake and earn OKT tokens while maintaining liquidity.\n\nIn return for staking OKT, users will receive staked OKT (stOKT), a versatile KIP-20 token that can be freely traded and utilized within the OKTC ecosystem. Additionally, users can earn swap fees by providing liquidity to OKTC Swap.\n\nReady to get started? Explore our comprehensive tutorial for detailed guidance.\n\nWhether you're an existing OKX trader or new to the platform, join us and start earning rewards with OKTC liquid staking.\n\nUsing liquid staked ETH for DeFi\n\nOne of the most viable ways users tap into the potential of liquid staking is its use in DeFi. This is largely executed through yield farming, as the pegged assets can be used in growth-generating protocols.\n\nYield farming allows users to lock up their funds and use a wrapped version of their assets elsewhere. As a result, they can use their wrapped assets as collateral to obtain crypto loans and execute trades, earning revenue both actively and passively.\n\nFinal verdict on liquid staking: an advanced staking strategy\n\nLiquid staking is a new generation system that enables users to put their assets to work and potentially see them grow. Instead of locking their funds with no access to them, liquid staking provides users with a liquid version of their assets to be used on other platforms. This makes the staking service a favorite among users, as they can easily redeem their assets anytime they want.\n\nWhile the process can bring gains, liquid staking is an advanced strategy and should only be used by advanced stakers.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs liquid staking risky?\n\nYes, liquid staking comes with risks. The tokenized version could easily depeg from the original asset or lose its value. Another issue is that users can only redeem their assets if they return the equivalent value of their initial deposit. Meanwhile, these liquid staking platforms can easily be hacked if poor security measures are in place.\n\nWhat's the difference between liquid staking and staking?\n\nThe major difference between liquid staking and staking is that the former is more liquid. Liquid stakers receive a tokenized version of deposited crypto assets, which they can use on other platforms. However, staking doesn't offer this privilege.\n\nWhat are liquid staking tokens?\n\nLiquid staking tokens are tokenized versions of users\u2019 deposits. With the initial deposits locked, users are issued liquid staking tokens, which can be transferred, traded, and used on other platforms.\n\nIs liquid staking good?\n\nLiquid staking can be a viable method of generating growth from digital assets. This staking method allows users to access their tokens while securing the network with them. However, it's better suited to advanced stakers due to its inherent complexities.\n\nIs liquidity better than staking?\n\nThis largely depends on a user\u2019s needs. Liquid staking can be a better option for experienced DeFi users. In contrast, staking is better for retail traders interested in making their idle crypto assets work for them in the long term."

        "title": "What is Function X? - Real Vision",
        "content": "Given its ambitions to make crypto more accessible, it is not surprising that the Function X ecosystem is more than just a blockchain. It consists of nine key components, which all focus on one goal: To decentralize all services, apps, websites, communications, and most importantly, data. The nine components are:\n\nthe public blockchain f(x)Core the transmission protocol f(x) FXTP the file storage protocol f(x) IPFS the f(x) operating system (OS) f(x)Bridge\n\nf(x)Wallet\n\nthe trading platform MarginX\n\nCryptoBnk\n\nthe f(x) token $FX\n\n\n\n1. The public blockchain f(x)Core\n\nThe f(x)Core is the core network of the entire Function X ecosystem. It provides inter-blockchain communication to connect multiple blockchains, such as BNB and Ethereum. The underlying consensus model and algorithm of f(x)Core is Proof of Stake (PoS). Its native coin is named $FX. It is also working as a hub (serving as the point of connection for all devices on a local area network) and is the first core to be launched on the Function X Network. The role of a core is to facilitate transfers between blockchains. If a blockchain connects to a core via Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC), it automatically gains access to all other blockchains that are connected to that core.\n\n2. FXTP as a replacement for HTTP\n\nFXTP is the Function X transmission protocol. It is a decentralized transmission protocol, similar to HTTP. In HTTP, the server (which is controlled by an entity) decides how (and if) the data is sent or even monitored. It can easily be hacked or blocked. With FXTP, the data is sent out and propagated to the destination based on consensus (blockchain technology) and will allow decentralization and P2P transmission of data in a distributed network.\n\n3. The file storage protocol f(x) IPFS\n\nf(x) IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) is a protocol and network designed to store data in a distributed system. A person wanting to retrieve data, such as a file, will call an identifier (hash) of the file, and IPFS combs through the other nodes and supplies it to the person.\n\n4. The f(x) Operating System (OS)\n\nThe Function X Operating System is a modified version of Android. The Android OS benefits from being open and having plenty of users. This gives room for f(X) OS to spread faster across the globe. The f(x) OS has two modes:\n\nThe common Android mode that, of course, supports all Android features; and The Blockchain mode that offers full decentralization. Even calls, browsers, apps, and messages are totally decentralized.\n\nUsers can switch easily between these two modes and third-party devices that run on the f(x) OS can connect automatically to the Function X Blockchain. The purpose of Function X OS is to allow smart hardware and IoT (Internet of Things) devices to harness the upside and potential utility of the decentralization approach. Every smart device in the Function X ecosystem can be a node and each will have its own address and private key, uniquely linked to its node name.\n\n5. The f(x)Bridge\n\nThe f(x)Bridge is a cross-chain bridging service that supports cross-chains internally (between f(x)Core and other Function X chains) as well as between other chains (e.g., between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain). Through decentralized validators, assets can be moved safely between f(x)Core and different chains. Even if two chains have different rules, governance models, and protocols, a cross-chain bridge allows the two disparate chains to be connected. This comes with high transaction speed, low transaction cost, the ability to trade assets, and other useful features.\n\n6. The f(x)Wallet\n\nThe f(x)Wallet is a non-custodial, private key-supported wallet for ERC-20, Function X tokens, and more. Digital assets can be managed, transferred, and grown with different dApps, including DeFi protocols. This wallet enables staking $FX, $PUNDIX, and other tokens. It can be downloaded here for iOS and here for Android.\n\n7. The trading platform MarginX\n\nMarginX is the first community-based on-chain DEX built on the Function X network to facilitate the trading of stock-based perpetual contracts. It runs via a multi-chain and on-chain infrastructure. By providing a platform where investors can buy, sell, and create derivative products of any financial asset, it aims to bridge the traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency world. Currently, it is only available on testnet.\n\n8. The DeFi service CryptoBnk\n\nCryptoBnk is a DeFi service that mirrors a standard savings account. The primary difference is that there are no bankers that need to be paid. This results in a higher APY. In order to earn yield on tokens, users can store them via the CryptoBnk dApp for a set amount of time in a smart contract of their choice. Rewards are earned based on how many tokens are staked.\n\n9) The f(x) Token\n\nThe $FX token is the governance token for the Function X project. It can be used to vote, as collateral, generate synthetic assets, delegate, and secure the core network. Its main use case is as a means of payment for services such as staking, vote eligibility for network upgrades, smart contract creation, and data storage as well as paying transaction fees.\n\nThe $FX coin has been available on Ethereum since 2019 and on Function X since 2021. They are fully interoperable, and users can transfer $FX in and out of both blockchains while maintaining a fixed total supply and liquidity. The governance mechanism available with Function X provides users with the opportunity to vote for token burns and additional methods of reducing the total coin supply, which reduces the risk of $FX becoming a high inflationary coin due to its staking ratio."

        "title": "From 'Bitcoin Billionaires' to SEC Charges: A Brief Crypto History of the Winklevoss Twins - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss went from being the co-originators of Facebook deceived by Mark Zuckerberg (as dramatized in the film \u201cThe Social Network\u201d) to early crypto adopters who became \"Bitcoin billionaires.\" Now their firm has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC hit the twins\u2019 cryptocurrency exchange Gemini with charges of securities violations on Thursday due to its Gemini Earn program, which promised a return to customers who deposited their crypto holdings. Genesis, its lending partner in the program and a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), was also charged in tandem with Gemini.\n\nThe charges come after several weeks of increasingly public disputes between Gemini and DCG leadership following November\u2019s collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which triggered a fresh wave of industry contagion as funds stored on FTX were either locked away or missing. Genesis is reportedly on the hook for more than $900 million worth of Gemini customer funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did it come to this? Here\u2019s a look at the Winklevoss twins\u2019 rapid rise in the crypto industry and the recent moves that led to a public spat between Gemini and DCG, the SEC charges, and an apparently vast hole in Gemini\u2019s finances.\n\nFounding Gemini\n\nThe Winklevoss twins received some $65 million in cash and Facebook stock in the 2008 settlement over the creation of the social media giant. After establishing family office Winklevoss Capital in 2012, the brothers began amassing large amounts of Bitcoin. The twins owned as much as 1% of the circulating supply of the leading cryptocurrency as of November 2013, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThey went from buying up a stash of Bitcoin to leading an investment round in BitInstant, an early Bitcoin exchange whose founder Charlie Shrem was later imprisoned for money laundering related to the Silk Road marketplace. Also that year, the twins attempted to launch the first-ever Bitcoin ETF (or exchange-traded fund), which was rejected by the SEC.\n\nIn 2015, the Winklevoss brothers opened Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange licensed in its home state of New York. The platform expanded over the years and acquired NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in 2019, ahead of the eventual NFT market boom in 2021. Parent company Gemini Space Station was valued at $7.1 billion as of November 2021.\n\nCameron and Tyler were deemed \u201cBitcoin billionaires\u201d for the first time in 2017 (as chronicled in the Ben Mezrich book of the same name) as Bitcoin\u2019s price surged to nearly $20,000, and Forbes currently estimates each brother to have a net worth of $1.1 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut with the crypto industry in turmoil over the past several months, Gemini and its founders have faced new challenges. In June 2022, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Gemini \u201cfor making material false or misleading statements\u201d as it sought approval of its Bitcoin futures product, and Gemini laid off 10% of its staff as the crypto market tumbled.\n\nGemini vs. Genesis\n\nA fresh wave of crypto industry turmoil sparked Gemini\u2019s recent troubles, kick-started by the early November collapse of crypto exchange FTX and sister trading firm Alameda Research.\n\nSoon after, Genesis announced that it would suspend customer withdrawals from its lending arm due to the \u201cFTX impact,\u201d citing \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d in being unable to continue business as usual. Genesis was Gemini\u2019s partner for its interest-bearing Earn product, and Gemini said that it would have to freeze customer funds as a result.\n\nIn December, the Financial Times reported that Genesis held some $900 million worth of customer funds from the Gemini Earn program. Digital Currency Group\u2014which owns Genesis, Grayscale Investments, and other crypto firms\u2014is allegedly dealing with liquidity problems, according to Cameron Winklevoss, although founder and CEO Barry Silbert has assured investors otherwise.\n\nAt the start of 2023, the private negotiations between Gemini and Genesis spilled into public when Winklevoss penned an open letter to Silbert. In the letter, he accused Silbert of \u201cbad faith stall tactics\u201d towards finding a resolution to the dispute over the funds, suggesting evasive tactics on the part of the DCG head. Silbert denied the accusations.\n\nThe allegations intensified on January 10 as Cameron Winklevoss called for Silbert\u2019s resignation, suggesting misrepresentation and accounting fraud at DCG. The company responded by calling Winklevoss\u2019 claims \u201canother desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt\u201d on the part of the Gemini founders, which it said were \u201csolely responsible for operating Gemini Earn and marketing the program to its customers.\u201d\n\nGemini then announced that it had officially terminated its Earn program, which it said would force Genesis to pay back what it said is over $900 million worth of customer funds that it holds. The program had operated for nearly two years in partnership between Gemini and Genesis.\n\nSEC charges\n\nThat situation remains unresolved as of this writing, but now both Gemini and Genesis both face a new hurdle in the form of the SEC charges related to Gemini Earn. The agency alleges that the firms sold unregistered securities to customers, raising billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in the process from hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. \"Today's charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.\"\n\nIn a tweet response, Tyler Winklevoss questioned the timing of the charges, saying that Gemini had been in discussions with the SEC for 17 months and that the program was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.\n\n1/ It\u2019s disappointing that the @SECGov chose to file an action today as @Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive. \u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 12, 2023\n\n\u201cDespite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re optimizing for political points instead of helping us advance the cause of 340,000 Earn users and other creditors.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cGemini has always worked hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations.\u201d Genesis and DCG have yet to comment on the SEC charges."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAfter an epic battle for control at the beginning of January, Bitcoin bulls managed to topple bears this week, with the price soaring past $18,000 on Dec 12 for the first time since mid-December.\n\nAt press time, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by traded volume was exchanging hands at $18,687 after a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Earlier in the day, the price rose as high as $18,780, marking the sixth consecutive day for the asset to print a bullish candle.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nFor most of the day, the crypto market remained green, with Ethereum adding roughly 6% to tap a two-month high of $1,400. On the other hand, Cardano, Solana and XRP traded mostly sideways, adding about 5% each.\n\nAvalanche was the biggest gainer among the top 20 coins by market capitalization, adding 21.11% in the past day. On Wednesday, the network partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale blockchain services for businesses and governments. Overall, the global crypto market cap rose by 4.78% to tap $900 Billion, marking the largest single-day push this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s impressive ascent over the past seven days has been attributed to a return of big social dominance spikes as the asset\u2019s plunge offers extremely discounted prices. After being kept at bay by poor market liquidity towards the end of 2022, onchain data shows that whales with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC added around 20,000 BTC to their holdings between Jan 5 and Jan 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Glassnode noted that over 13% of the circulating supply had returned to profit, making it a significant milestone since mid-2022.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin rallies to $18.2k, over 13% of the Circulating Supply has returned to profit. The observed sharp move upwards in this metric helps to confirm that a large volume of BTC was acquired between $16.5k and $18.2k,\u201d wrote Glassnode sharing the chart below.\n\nOn the other hand, observers have attributed Ethereum\u2019s recovery to the impending Shanghai upgrade. The upgrade, due in March, will allow users to unstake and withdraw their Ether which has been locked into the Beacon chain since December 2020. Furthermore, the upgrade is expected to reduce centralization on Ethereum, allowing more projects to onboard and, as a result, liquidity to flow into the ecosystem.\n\nThat said, the markets seem to be pricing that in advance. 3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network over the past week bringing the total number of shark addresses since Feb 2021 to 48,556.\n\nAt the same time, onchain data showed that shark and whale addresses holding different cryptocurrencies have been accumulating Tether, the top stablecoin by market cap, as they prepare for the next bull run. According to Santiment, \u201cThere are now 21,459 addresses that hold $100k or more USDT, just 1% from a new all-time high.\u201d"

        "content": "Crypto adoption in India is being driven primarily by the GenZ and millennial population. An overwhelming majority of crypto investors in the country fall in the 18-25 (45 per cent) and 26-35 (34 per cent) age groups, found a 2022 analysis by homegrown crypto exchange CoinSwitch.\n\nCrypto, truly, is a young person\u2019s asset class, with just 8 per cent of retail investors above 45 years of age.\n\nIn 2022, which brought about a bloodbath for the global crypto industry, Indian investors shied away from panic selling, and instead, held on to their investments. New investors too started building their crypto portfolio in the bear market to complement their equity investments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most valuable crypto, continues to be the most popular token in India, with 12.12 per cent of investments going towards it. This is followed by investments in DOGE (11.54 per cent), Ethereum (9.43 per cent), Shiba Inu (6.92 per cent), and Polygon (4.3 per cent). Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are meme coins, which are inspired by internet memes, and are more volatile than the rest.\n\n\u201cIndia set aside 40 per cent of its crypto investments on top dollar CRE8 coins and DeFi utility tokens in 2022, and only about 6 per cent in metaverse tokens. In fact, a greater share of investments (~8 per cent) was made on Ethereum alternatives (Layer1 networks that rival the blue-chip smart-contract chain) than metaverse tokens,\u201d CoinSwitch revealed in its report.\n\nDelhi ranked on top in terms of crypto investments (by value) in the country. This was followed by the IT hubs of Bangalore and Hyderabad. \u201cJaipur has the highest crypto adoption among tier-2 and tier-3 cities, followed by Lucknow and Pune,\u201d CoinSwitch stated.\n\nCrypto, meanwhile, continues to be a male-dominated sector, with only 8 per cent of CoinSwitch\u2019s 19 million users being women in 2022. A prior analysis by global crypto exchange KuCoin had pegged India\u2019s overall crypto population at 115 million, with 52 per cent of them investing in the asset class to generate a passive income.\n\nAlso Read: Budget 2023: CoinSwitch expects govt to incentivise crypto users and 'reduce the burden of taxes'"

        "content": "Richard Heart took to Twitter teasing a PulseChain screenshot, adding, \u201cIts [sic] working on private v3 testnet.\u201d\n\nWord of PulseChain first broke in July 2021, with the accompanying press release openly admitting its intention to fork the Ethereum code and add \u201csignificant enhancements,\u201d including cheaper gas fees and quicker block times, at three seconds versus ETH\u2019s 13 seconds.\n\n\u201cPulseChain is a new Blockchain-based cryptocurrency ecosystem that offers significant enhancements over the legacy Ethereum platform.\u201d\n\nThe project is backed by the development company Everything Blockchain, with VC firm Overwatch Partners also in the mix.\n\nPulseChain\n\nPulseChain\u2019s intention is to build a better version of Ethereum, but with key changes in the PRC20 standard and the Pulse (PLS) token, which can be staked with validators to earn yield.\n\nAt the same time, PulseChain does not seek to challenge ETH directly. Instead, it will \u201cincrease Ethereum\u2019s value\u201d by \u201csharing the load\u201d with the original chain.\n\nNot only did PulseChain take the Ethereum source code, but the state of the blockchain was also copied. Meaning ETH users have duplicate assets which are held on PulseChain. However, that does not necessarily mean a doubling of portfolio balances.\n\n\u201cPulseChain will re-enable priced out use cases: Instead of launching empty, PulseChain brings the ETH system state and ERC20s, this rewards holders and founders of Ethereum based projects.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the project will launch the PulseX decentralized exchange (DEX,) enabling token swaps from other blockchains. In turn, PulseX has its own native token \u2013 PLSX.\n\nThe PulseChain website currently states the version 2 testnet is live \u201cwith validator rotation, registration, and staking.\u201d As a public testnet, interested individuals can experiment with the protocol using testnet PLS tokens (tPLS).\n\nScam rumors\n\nGiven PulseChain\u2019s association with Heart, some have automatically labeled the project a scam. For example, Twitter user @IpsDeFi, who identified himself as the Community Manager at the tracking platform TapTools, recently said:\n\n\u201cPulsechain is just an evm fork lol. Big scam to lock up your tokens.\u201c\n\nSimilarly, in November 2022, Researcher Eric Wall shared an SEC letter, addressed to HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX influencers mentioning ongoing investigations. The letter was accompanied by a subpoena demanding addressees produce certain documentation.\n\n\n\nThe PulseChain website featured a disclaimer covering multiple points, including on airdrops, political statements, and taxation. There was also a reference to the Howey Test, used to determine U.S. securities status.\n\n\u201cYou must have no expectation of profit from the work of others.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin has warned that new blockchain chains will likely fail if they don\u2019t offer something unique to users.\n\nAccording to Buterin, emerging chains should put more focus on meeting the needs of the average user and work towards enacting a fresh philosophy into the crypto sector, he said during an Ethereum Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit.\n\nHe equated the situation to the existence of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), which were among the original social media sites and have partly remained the dominant players despite the emergence of other platforms. In this line, he noted that as two leading crypto projects, Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC), have established themselves and emulating them might lead to failure.\n\n\u201cI am just getting more and more convinced that chains that try to be indistinguishable from Ethereum to the average user are going to get ignored and fail, and users are going to interpret Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs Cosmos vs \u2026 as different ecosystems much as they do Twitter, Facebook,\u201d he said.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s comment on crypto chains. Source: Reddit\n\nButerin on crypto adoption\n\nThe Ethereum creator was responding to a user who stated that focusing on the underlying crypto chain should not be an issue for adoption to occur.\n\nButerin\u2019s sentiments align with his previous views noting that for crypto adoption to be realized, there is a need to give the sector room to mature. This comes as industry players opine that with new projects launching, for maturity to occur, the market will undergo a wipeout similar to the dot-com bubble.\n\nIn early December, Buterin also pointed out that the focus of the crypto space should be on developing the underlying technology and not the price at a time the market was battling extended sell-offs.\n\nIndeed, Buterin has been a big advocate of transparency in the crypto space while warning of the threat of human interference that can be placed over a protocol.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "It\u2019s been four months after the successful transition of Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Now, Ethereum \u2014 the second largest blockchain, passed another major milestone. Over 16 million of its native token, Ether (ETH) have been deposited into its Beacon Chain staking contract, data from Etherescam indicates.\n\nHere, the 16 Million ETH has more than 13.28% of the total Ether supply which also indicates around $22.98 billion at the current trading price. This comes almost after two years when Ethereum\u2019s staking contract went live in 2020 and its proof-of-stake Beacon Chain firstly got introduced.\n\nThe validators \u2014 who help run the Ethereum network, stake ETH just for a chance to write and authenticate the transactions to Ethereum\u2019s ledger. After this the staked funds get locked up with the network and accrue interest. However, it will be yet not possible to withdraw until the Ethereum network\u2019s Shanghai update, which is slotted in for March 2023.\n\nEthereum network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade will implement EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 4895. It will enable consensus layer withdrawals for the first time since December 2020.\n\nMeanwhile the increasing number of staked ETH can be a positive signal for Ethereum security and adoption. And additionally it may push some pressure on Ethereum\u2019s core developers to expedite their work to enable withdrawals.\n\nStaked Ether, or stETH, is a cryptocurrency token. It represents an equivalent amount of Ether (ETH) that has been staked. Staked tokens are locked up for an extended period to provide liquidity for staked ether.\n\nETH2\n\nAccording to the data sourced from Nansen, indicates the number of unique staking depositors stands at roughly 92.6k. The number of unique validators is about 500k.\n\nSource: nansen.ai\n\nIt must be noted that a larger amount of staked ETH should theoretically harden the staking for an individual actor to sabotage the Ethereum chain. Currently, the majority of Ethereum\u2019s stake belongs to a handful of large actors \u2013 raising concern that control over the chain may become too centralized.\n\nSource: nansen.ai\n\nThe above chart, sourced from Nansen, showed that out of the 16 million ETH staked, roughly 4.65 million have been staked through Lido Finance \u2013 a kind of community-driven validator collective.\n\nMoreover, the amount of staked ETH has gone up around 16.68% since the so-called Ethereum Merge took place in September 2022. The Merge fully transitioned the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism."

Almost four months after the event, the second-biggest blockchain by market cap has passed another major milestone.\n\nData from Etherscan showed that more than 16 million ether have been deposited into Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain staking contract.\n\nThe 16 million ETH figure accounts for over 13% of the total ether supply and represents nearly $22.38 billion at current prices.

        "content": "Just before the recent rally Ethereum (ETH) recorded since the year\u2019s turn, Dogecoin (DOGE) founder Billy Markus sold a large amount of his Ethereum holdings, missing out on the major opportunity to profit on the later bullish change in price.\n\nAs it happens, Billy Markus, known on Twitter as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, admitted to selling \u201ca bunch\u201d of his Ethereum holdings at a low price of $1,190 so that he could try and gather enough money to pay his taxes for 2022, according to the tweet he posted on January 12.\n\ni sold a bunch of eth at $1190 so i could pay 2022 taxes\n\n\n\nso everyone, you\u2019re welcome for this rally \ud83e\udd23 \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) January 12, 2023\n\nTax tribulations over selling NFTs\n\nFurther explaining his situation, Markus said that it was the result of selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and that \u201cyou always owe taxes if you do commerce in crypto.\u201d But in his case:\n\n\u201cI owed more than my crypto was worth, so I actually made negative money.\u201d\n\nAsked by a commenter about the price at which these Ethereum were purchased, Markus replied saying that he didn\u2019t buy any, but that he sold NFTs, for which the state of \u201cCalifornia and the IRS take 53% of the selling price at the exact moment of sale.\u201d\n\nAs a reminder, Markus is an American software engineer who, together with his friend Jackson Palmer, is credited with developing Dogecoin in 2013 as a joke, making fun of the volatility of established cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC). Later on, DOGE became popular due to its promotion by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.\n\nMissing out on the ETH rally\n\nSelling his Ethereum holdings in late December 2022 at a time when the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at the price of $1,190, Markus missed out on the subsequent rally that began soon after and brought the price of ETH to the current $1,397.\n\nIndeed, the price of Ethereum at press time represents an increase of 4.57% over the past 24 hours and an impressive 11.68% gain across the previous seven days, as its advances on the monthly chart amount to 8.67%, boasting a market cap of $170.99 billion.\n\nEthereum 1-month price chart.

        "content": "Is conference season underway? Hopefully Denver can warm up a bit over the course of the next month, as crypto fanatics and executives look to congregate around what has turned into one of the biggest annual crypto conferences every year, ETHDenver.\n\nLet\u2019s take a brief look at what sort of programming the free-to-attend conference is offering, speakers you can expect to see on-site, and more from the upcoming event.\n\nCan The Crypto Market Warm Up In The Cold Denver Climate?\n\nAfter months of bear market conditions \u2013 that have felt like years \u2013 some crypto spectators believe that conditions could be turning tide. Broader markets have finally been seeing some green to start this year, and while we\u2019re likely still far from being out of this current bear market cycle, it is possible that recent price action could be leading to a break from pain.\n\nRegardless, the cool Denver weather will be offering what many hope to be a warm home for bulls and bears alike. The conference is self-described as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest annual Web3 #BUIDLathon and Community Innovation Festival.\u201d ETHDenver\u2019s flagship \u2018#BUIDLathon\u2019 will be running this year from February 24 to March 1, with main event programming immediately following, operating from March 2 to March 5. A final programmed event, dubbed the \u2018Mountain Retreat,\u2019 will close off the slate in nearby slopes of Breckenridge, with snowboarding and skiing paired with open-sourced events in a more relaxed, laid-back setting.\n\nOne of Ethereum's (ETH) flagship conferences, ETHDenver, is back in 2023. | Source: ETH-USD on TradingView.com\n\nWhat You Can Expect\n\nProgramming in the initial #BUIDLathon looks to consist of a lot of programming that you would see in blockchain-specific events, including builder-specific engagement that includes over $2M in winning incentives. Bounties, community events, panels and happy hours will dominate the programming throughout #BUIDLWeek.\n\n#BUIDLWeek will be followed by general conference programming that will run the gambit when it comes to speaker sessions. The \u2018face\u2019 of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, will be a featured speaker, along with the Governor of Colorado Jared Polis, and Big Green DAO founder Kimbal Musk \u2013 among others.\n\nIn a statement shared with Bitcoinist, ETHDenver founder John Paller stated that \u201cETHDenver is about bringing diverse creativity around a common purpose and aims to propel the global blockchain ecosystem into the future\u2026 our artistic, community-driven festival is unlike any other event in the space because there is no cost for attendees, creating an accessible immersive and educational experience for anyone interested in participating. We welcome anyone that is interested in ideating and #BUIDLing towards a decentralized future to join us to get started or continue in their journey.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if that brisk Denver air can help cool off the sweltering heat of a bear market."

        "content": "Leading the price recovery today are the queens Bitcoin and Ethereum, both gaining more than 15% in 13 days, heading to close the second consecutive week in the positive.\n\nOn balance, this is an average gain of more than a percentage point daily for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn recent years, only January 2018 had seen such a solid start with only 2 out of 13 days ending fractionally lower.\n\nFurther helping to inflate the bullish sails is the strong performance of stock indexes, particularly the tech sector with the Nasdaq index up 5% since 1 January, confirming the continued correlation between the stock and crypto markets for about 2 years.\n\nRecent positive US inflation data, but also the release of other encouraging economic data, have changed investors\u2019 attitudes with the first favorable signs of turning the global economy around and hopes of recouping losses from the bear market of 2022.\n\nThe bullish price movement is accompanied by the collapse of daily implied volatility measured on the monthly forecast, which has fallen to its lowest level in 6 years.\n\nThe period of prosperity in the crypto markets is crowned by metrics measuring investor sentiment. In the past few hours, the \u2018Fear & Greed Index\u2019 has risen to 31 points, on a scale of zero to 100. This is the highest level since the beginning of last November.\n\nAmong the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, Cardano (ADA) climbs to the podium with a gain of over 25% in the past 7 days, which rises to 35% when adding up the previous week\u2019s performance.\n\nAnalysis of the price trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nThe first cryptocurrency for the largest market capitalization and the strongest network, rises above the psychological threshold of $19k for the first time in over two months.\n\nIn the last few hours, the price tries to push toward US$19,200, aiming for the historic US$20k level.\n\nTechnical signals supporting the uptrend are beginning to increase, even though support levels need to be consolidated to validate a solid bullish structure.\n\nTo continue a bullish trend in the coming weeks, it will be necessary not to return below $17,500.\n\nA break from the bulls must not allow the return of bearish speculation that would become aggressive below $17,200, undoing all the good work done so far.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nIt goes hand in hand with the price trend of ETH, which in the last few hours revisits $1,440, levels abandoned on 8 November, the first of the two worst days of the last six months in the midst of the FTX exchange storm.\n\nEthereum also needs to confirm in the coming days the support levels that the price has been tapping in recent days.\n\nIt is $1,300 the first support level in importance and proximity that will have to prove to be well defended by the buy positions used to protect the massive derivative strategies present and growing since the beginning of the year.\n\nIf, on the contrary, the rise should continue without the need for a pause, the run will find no technical obstacles until the $1,600 area where it will be inevitable to take profits for short-term traders."

        "content": "YEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2013 Ethereum token Ether (ETH) traded at just below $1,400 on Jan 12, after a near-20% upside move month-to-date. Moreover, data from the crypto analytical platform Santiment testified to the growing accumulation among ETH shark addresses, despite the abundance of bearish cues.\n\nEther (ETH) sharks are on the move\n\nIn detail, sharks are wallets holding approximately 100 to 10,000 ETH. According to the Santiment report, over 3,000 new shark addresses appeared in the previous ten weeks, bringing the total number to over 48,500 addresses, the highest since early 2021.\n\nMoreover, Santiment asserted that the shark addresses are a particularly important driving force behind the price increases and declines. Could the accumulation drive the price even higher?\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Hesitates, But Further Gains Seem Likely.\n\nLong-term predictions favor the bulls.\n\nRyan Selkis, the founder and CEO of the market intelligence platform Messari, predicted a profitable year for Ethereum. In his latest report, the analyst asserted that the Merge to proof-of-stake was \u201cspectacular,\u201d albeit it took six years and was \u201cboring\u201d to watch.\n\nThe fact that [the Merge] went off without any major hitches bordered on miraculous, and I will be the first to admit that it was completed much sooner and with less drama than I thought it would be. Vitalik and the Ethereum Core team deserve major kudos. said Selkis.\n\nAlso read: Could Bitcoin Price Drop to $13K in Q1/2023?\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that events influencing short-term prices might contradict long-term predictions. Ethereum uptrend also took cues from Bitcoin, which highly depends on the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes and the possible recession.\n\nNotably, along with the macro market conditions, several on-chain metrics tell the bulls to pace themselves.\n\nBearish factors could hinder the ETH price appreciation\n\nFor example, another analytical platform, Glassnode, pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) signal reached a 4-month high.\n\nNVT signal bearish for Ethereum\n\nIn short, Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio describes the relationship between market cap and transfer volume. Per analyst Willy Woo, its creator, NVT can be considered analogous to the PE (price to earnings) Ratio used in equity markets.\n\nA growing NVT indicates that investors are pricing Bitcoin at a premium. Per Glassnode\u2019s definition, NVT grows when \u201cMarket Cap growth outpaces utilization of on-chain transaction volume and value settlement.\u201d High NVT Ratio values have historically coincided with market tops and periods of overvaluation.\n\nGiven the upward trajectory of the current NVT reading, a leg down might be in the books soon enough.\n\nEthereum exchange inflow on the rise\n\nAnother bearish factor is the growing exchange inflow, which stood at a one-month high of 2,460 ETH on Jan 12.\n\nGenerally, exchange inflow is a bearish factor, as it testifies to the traders\u2019 reluctance to store their ETH. More funds on exchanges mean more investors consider liquidating. In the current bearish market, the traders\u2019 caution is understandable. Moreover, the charts paint a gloomy picture as well.\n\nEther technicals spell doom.\n\nEthereum, much like Bitcoin, has been trading in a bearish \u2018descending channel\u2019 pattern since mid-May. The pattern features a down-sloping resistance and flat support that form a triangle, connecting the swing highs and lows.\n\nEthereum (ETH) daily price action. Source: TradingView.com\n\nThe bearish pattern expects a plunge equal to the setup\u2019s maximal height once ETH confirms the triangle by dropping below the support. Notably, that has not happened yet. However, the ETH/USD price action retested the triangle\u2019s resistance on Jan 12, suggesting an upcoming downward correction.\n\nIn case of a confirmation, the triangle threatens to take the ETH price below $100. Furthermore, the token\u2019s decreasing trading volumes and the \u2018overbought\u2019 relative strength index intensify the fears, albeit not necessarily expecting ETH to drop to its 2018 lows.\n\nAlso read: FOMC meeting minutes confirm interest rate hikes in 2023 \u2013 more pain for stocks ahead\n\nDespite Shark address accumulation, on-chain metrics, technicals, and macro factors are still against the largest altcoin. However, the crypto market can be unpredictable. Thus, investors should carefully weigh all pros and cons before placing their bets.\n\nClick here to keep up with the ever-changing crypto market and never miss the scoop!"
