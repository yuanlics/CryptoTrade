        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), eyes a run-up toward $3,000 in Q2 2023 after wrapping the previous quarter with 55% gains.\n\nETH price nears potential breakout\n\nThe price of Ether has more than doubled after bottoming out in June at around $880, weathering a slew of negative events, including the collapse of FTX, interest rate increases, and stricter U.S. regulations.\n\nIn doing so, ETH/USD has painted an ascending triangle, confirmed by its rising trendline support and horizontal level resistance. The pattern suggests aggressive buying as lows get steadily higher while highs stay around the same level, indicative of a higher selling pressure at the given level.\n\nAs of April 2, ETH\u2019s price is testing its horizontal level resistance range ($1,700-1,820) for a potential breakout move.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart featuring an \u201cascending triangle\u201d bottom setup.\n\nA breakout will be confirmed if the price closes above the resistance range while accompanying higher volumes. Furthermore, the ascending triangle breakout target is measured with its length equal to the triangle height.\n\nIn other words, the bullish ETH price target is in the $3,350-3,900 range, depending on where traders see the triangle\u2019s rising trendline support, as shown by the T1 and T2 in the chart above. This would suggest 80% gains by June.\n\nConversely, a pullback from the $1,700-1,820 range risks delaying the upside setup and resulting in a broader price correction.\n\nEthereum whale accumulation remains strong\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, Ether\u2019s short-term and long-term trends look skewed toward the bulls.\n\nMost Ethereum whale cohorts have increased their ETH accumulation in recent weeks, according to the latest data from Santiment. For instance, the supply of Ether held by addresses with a 1,000-10,000 ETH balance (blue in the chart below) has grown by 0.5% in March.\n\nEther supply distribution among investors holding at least 1,000 ETH. Source: Santiment\n\nSimilarly, the 1 million-10 million ETH (brown) and the 10 million - 100 million ETH balance cohorts have witnessed 0.4% and 0.5% rises, respectively.\n\nThe growth appeared amid what appears to be the absorption of selling pressure introduced by the 100,000-1 million ETH (pink) and 10,000-100,000 ETH (orange) address cohorts.\n\nAt the same time, the growth could attributed to the network\u2019s proof-of-stake contracts \u2014 directly or by using third-party stakers such as Lido DAO (LDO).\n\nEthereum 2.0 total value staked [in ETH]. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe net Ether deposited at the official Ethereum 2.0 address crossed above 18 million ETH after rising about 3.5% in March.\n\nRelated: Analysts debate the ETH price outcomes of Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shapella upgrade\n\nThe deposits have grown ahead of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades on April 12, which will enable stakers to withdraw ETH from the PoS smart contract. Currently, this is not possible.\n\nMVRV Z-Score: Ethreum price bottom reversal\n\nMore bullish arguments stem from Ethereum\u2019s MVRV Z-Score entering a stage that has previously preceded long-term ETH price rallies.\n\nEthereum MVRV-Z Score. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe MVRV Z-Score assesses when Ethereum is overvalued and undervalued relative to its \u201cfair value.\u201d As a rule, the MVRV Z-score indicates a market top (red zone) when market value rises above realized value, while the opposite indicates market bottoms (green zone).\n\nEther\u2019s previous price recoveries coincide with its MVRV Z-Score bouncing from the green zone, suggesting the same could happen over the next three months.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Validator Goes Rogue, Frontruns MEV Bots for $25M - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum validators hellbent on maximizing revenue can employ special bots to extract the most value possible from every single block. Some of those bots were just attacked for $25 million.\n\nA rogue validator used a tool for obtaining the maximum extractable value (MEV) from the Ethereum blockchain and carried out a \u201csandwich attack.\u201d\n\nBut first, understanding sandwich attacks takes unpacking MEV as a concept.\n\nMEV is essentially frontrunning. MEV bots find additional revenue by exploiting knowledge of which transactions are about to be processed. This is done most commonly via arbitrage (taking advantage of price differences between exchanges).\n\nThese opportunities are often discovered by other revenue seekers, known as \u201csearchers.\u201d Once searchers identify profitable trades, they will submit them to a public mempool and wait for an Ethereum validator to approve the transaction.\n\nSome searchers have realized they can frontrun those trades by using bots that scan the public mempool, proposing blocks which have replaced the trade with their own transaction to grab another searcher\u2019s MEV.\n\nCompanies such as Flashbots prevent these kinds of events with tools known as MEV boost relays. Relays make sure MEV transactions are not revealed in the public mempool, so MEV hunters can\u2019t frontrun each other.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a will to frontrun MEV bots\u2026\n\nMEV relays are formed by two parties: proposers and builders. Proposers make bids on transactions, and builders secure the highest bid and generate blocks containing their transactions. They then send the blocks to validators, who will approve the transaction.\n\n\u201cOne of the core ideas behind Proposer-Builder Separation is that proposers cannot be allowed to see the contents of the block they\u2019re signing until they\u2019ve signed the block,\u201d a research analyst at Paradigm who goes by samczsun said in a tweet. \u201cTheoretically, this makes it extremely hard for a malicious proposer to deconstruct bundles.\u201d\n\nAs for this weekend\u2019s $25 million sandwich attack: Eighteen days earlier, the exploiter deposited 32 ETH ($57,500) to become a validator. This meant the exploiter was a proposer who could also reorder block transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that once they were able to propose a block as a validator, the attacker included additional transactions that weren\u2019t initially inside the block made by the builder. This enabled the attacker to front-run the front-running MEV bot, a Blockworks research analyst explained in a tweet.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThis is considered a sandwich attack \u2014 where the victim\u2019s transaction is stuck between two transactions created by the searcher.\n\nIn this case, the sandwich attacker pushed transactions worth $25 million across three main addresses, per PeckShield. Tokens gained include wrapped ETH, wrapped bitcoin, tether, USDC and DAI.\n\nThe incident was first identified by pseudonymous Twitter user 3155.eth. Usually, if a validator tampers with a transaction, they are slashed for malicious behavior and they lose some of their ETH stake.\n\nFlashbot developers have rolled out a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\n\u201cNow, mev-boost-relay will refuse to return the transactions if the block was not successfully sent to the network. Then, just for good measure, it delays the response by a second too,\u201d Paradigm\u2019s samczsun said.\n\nUpdated April 4, 2023 at 9:52 am ET: Flashbot developers have already rolled out a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "A guide to Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "In 2022, Ethereum developers pulled off a dramatic upgrade known as the Merge, changing the way transactions are validated on the network.\n\nPreviously, that task was the preserve of thousands of powerful \u201cmining\u201d computers, which checked the authenticity of transactions by way of an energy-intensive process known as Proof of Work. The Merge introduced the greener Proof-of-Stake model, replacing the miners with \u201cvalidators,\u201d users who have deposited at least 32 units of Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency, ETH, on the network.\n\nThat made the network something like 99% more energy-efficient, and around $26 billion has since been locked up on the network by over 520,000 validators.\n\nBut all is not perfect. Though validators are theoretically able to earn rewards on their deposit in the form of newly mined ETH, they still can\u2019t actually redeem these rewards\u2014or their initial deposit.\n\nNor has it helped that many of the validators began staking funds in 2020, via an early \u201ctestnet\u201d iteration of the staking protocol that was later \u201cmerged\u201d with Ethereum proper in 2022. The crypto market has undergone a series of violent swings since then, and a lot of stakers want their money back.\n\nWith more than two years having passed since staking was first made possible, it\u2019s safe to say that the upcoming Shanghai Upgrade, which will introduce a withdrawal feature, is a big deal.\n\nShanghai Upgrade\n\nScheduled for April 2023, the Shanghai Upgrade is arguably the most anticipated network upgrade to Ethereum since the Merge. Though it also includes a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) designed to reduce gas costs (transaction fees), most of the attention is centered on EIP-4895\u2014the holy grail of EIPs, which enables staking withdrawal.\n\nThere will be two types of withdrawals that come with Shanghai: partial and full.\n\nIf a validator wants to remain a part of the network, they can then opt for a partial withdrawal, keeping their minimum threshold of 32 ETH on the chain and redeeming the excess to their wallet address.\n\nUnder a full withdrawal, the validator is free to withdraw the entirety of their stake, but in doing so would forgo their participation in the chain.\n\nThere is one minor caveat. Validators who staked on the 2020 \u201ctestnet,\u201d known as the Beacon Chain, were given withdrawal credentials, known as \u201c0x00,\u201d but these are no longer valid. In order to execute a full or partial withdrawal, they will first need to upgrade their credentials to 0x01.\n\nWill Unstaking ETH Trigger a Sell-off?\n\nNot necessarily. To really understand this, we need to look at how many participants are actually \u201cilliquid stakers\u201d\u2014that is, stakers who can\u2019t immediately access their deposits.\n\nA big part of the staking market constitutes liquid staking participants provided through services like Lido as well as centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Not everyone has 32 ETH to tuck away in a deposit contract, so many users have participated in ETH staking with a liquid token tied to the value of their deposit. Since they have always had access to liquidity, it\u2019s fair to assume they aren\u2019t looking to sell off their holdings.\n\nAround 52% of stakers are illiquid, and while the majority of staked ETH is underwater, at least 2 million ETH were sent to the contract when the asset was trading between $400 and $700. This cohort might be looking to sell their ETH, but then again, they did send their tokens to the contract without a timeline for withdrawals and are likely ardent supporters of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Impotence Proposal\n\nBefore the details around withdrawals were ratified, there was significant controversy over the speed of its implementation. Many developers hoped to make the upgrade compatible with a sleeker, new Ethereum encoding method known as simple serialize (SSZ), which would have delayed its release by a few months. Popular calls to quickly enable withdrawals, however, led to developers tacking the feature onto April\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade\u2014potentially rushing it through and risking technical woes in the future.\n\nWhen and How Will Shanghai Be Deployed?\n\nShanghai was originally scheduled for March 2023 but has been postponed to sometime in April 2023. Developers make the decisions based on their assessment of progress, so this tentative date is subject to change.\n\nWhile deployment on the mainnet is still a few weeks away as of the time of writing, some have already begun testing out the withdrawal feature on one of Ethereum\u2019s testnets e.g., Zheijang and Sepolia."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) could be gearing for a rally en route to liquidating traders who are bearish on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nIn a new blog post, Justin Bennett says that the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) rally on Friday could hint at the short-term performance of the crypto markets.\n\nAccording to the analyst, crypto tends to follow in the footsteps of the stock market but there appears to be lag between the two asset classes. Bennett adds that should crypto take cues from equities, he sees Ethereum taking out resistance at $1,840.\n\nBennett says an Ethereum breakout could trigger a short squeeze as he notes that there\u2019s a \u201csignificant cluster\u201d of short liquidations up the the $2,000 price level for ETH.\n\nA short squeeze happens when large numbers of traders who shorted an asset decide to cut their losses in response to an unexpected price bump. The squeeze then triggers additional rallies.\n\nSays Bennett,\n\n\u201cThat could be telling, as cryptocurrencies like to target these areas, and $2,030 is the August 2022 high. Far more long liquidations are below current levels, but proximity matters, so the short liquidations up to $2,000 may influence ETH in the short term.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bennett says that the clock is ticking for crypto and Ethereum. According to the trader, the Ethereum short squeeze must happen in the coming days. Otherwise, he says that the rally may not materialize at all.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019d like to see crypto play \u2018catch up\u2019 to equities sooner rather than later if this is to materialize.\n\nIf we don\u2019t see ETH flush these shorts in the next few days, it\u2019s less likely to occur.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,818.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum ERC-4337 and its Potential for the Real-Estate Industry\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent upgrade to the ERC-4337 standard is the key to onboarding the $3.7 trillion world of traditional real estate to Web3. Deployed in a surprise announcement at ETHDenver, this new protocol standard caught many people off-guard with its list of improvements. So what is ERC-4337 all about?\n\nWhat is the ERC-4337 standard?\n\nERC-4337 ushers in a new standard for Ethereum wallets called account abstraction. Quite simply, Ethereum wallets that opted into ERC-4337 are now \u201csmart wallets\u201d that live entirely on-chain. The wallets are programmable, much like smart contracts themselves, and allow for important benefits such as:\n\nAccount Recovery\n\nTwo-factor authentication security\n\nBundled transactions\n\nIncrease interoperability between EVM-compatible tokens\n\nSetting spending limits on accounts\n\nHow can these new features help real estate?\n\nAnyone who has been a part of a real estate transaction can tell you one thing \u2013 it is an inefficient process stuck in the Web Zero era. Title searches are slow and aren\u2019t guaranteed to catch everything, people need to drive around in cars to hand physical pieces of paper to each other, and payments can take days to complete.\n\nFor years, many people have looked to blockchain technology as a way to modernize some of these pain points. Commonly discussed improvements include:\n\nUsing NFTs to represent property deeds\n\nReplacing title searches with Etherscan searches\n\nCollecting rent using stablecoins\n\nUsing contract signatures instead of notarized signatures\n\nWhile these ideas sound great, there also come with many hurdles to overcome. Account abstraction will help to resolve two of the biggest issues \u2013 account recovery and two-factor authentication.\n\nAccount Recovery\n\nCustodying crypto is a challenge, and losing access to a wallet holding something important like a deed or a landlord\u2019s operating account would be catastrophic. Just using crypto is scary for many people, and the idea of needing to keep a 24-word seed phrase safe forever is a hard sell to anyone already skeptical of the industry.\n\nFortunately, ERC-4337 allows users the ability to regain control of their wallets, even if the owner were to lose their private keys, with the use of \u201cGuardians\u201d.\n\nGuardians are individuals or entities users can elect to recover an account in the event of losing access to a wallet. An example of a Guardian would be a trusted friend, a university that distributes diplomas as NFTs, or even, someday, a local bank.\n\nERC-4337 decreases reliance upon seed phrases, greatly helping mainstream adoption\n\nBy allowing social recovery for Ethereum wallets, it\u2019s now much more likely that real estate companies will consider using smart contracts technology in their day-to-day business.\n\nTwo-factor authentication\n\nAnother key feature of ERC-4337 is the introduction of two-factor authentication support. To many, the crypto world is synonymous with getting hacked. \\With two-factor authentication, users can finally protect their accounts from hackers gaining access to their wallets, and within minutes, stealing all their assets.\n\nAdditionally, wallet owners will be able to set limits for transferable amounts. So, If a wallet contains 100 eth, for instance, users can restrict an ERC-4337-enabled wallet from sending more than 10 eth without first approving the transaction with two-factor authorization.\n\nThe ability to properly secure high-value items with two-factor authentication and spending limits makes it much more likely that real estate firms will feel comfortable using blockchain in the future. Before this implementation, there was too much risk involved for traditionally conservative real estate companies to consider using blockchain to any serious extent.\n\nCommon 2FA services include Google Authenticator and Authy\n\nWill Account Recovery and Two-Factor Authorization be enough to onboard the real estate industry into Web3?\n\nBy themselves, of course not. However, the applications of blockchain technology in real estate are endless. For example, it makes payments significantly easier, faster, and cheaper, resolves the need for inefficient record-keeping of physical papers, and gives us a verifiable method of tracking events over long periods of time. It\u2019s not so much a question of if real estate companies will begin using blockchain, but rather when it will become commonplace.\n\nAs our population becomes more comfortable with technology over time, it seems almost inevitable that blockchain technology will disrupt the real estate industry. With quality-of-life improvements from the ERC-4337 update such as account recovery and two-factor authentication, the path to uniting real estate and Web3 seems easier than ever before.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been going gangbusters this year and outperforming stocks by a wide margin. During the year\u2019s first quarter, the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) gained 70% while Ethereum (ETH-USD) was up 50%. The huge rally since the calendar turned to 2023 has many former skeptics now calling for BTC and ETH to hit new all-time highs by year\u2019s end. It\u2019s a stark reversal from last fall when the $8 billion collapse of FTX, a large crypto exchange, sent a chill through the industry and prompted analysts to say that a crypto winter looked likely to turn into a prolonged ice age. However, while this year\u2019s big reversal of crypto prices is welcome news, the gains have not been universal. Many cryptocurrencies, particularly smaller ones, have not enjoyed the same upswing as Bitcoin and Ethereum. But many cryptos remain undervalued, and there are bargains for investors who know where to look.

Despite that, TRON (TRX-USD) is one of the more interesting, affordable, and seemingly undervalued cryptos currently available to investors.\n\nAnd, while the cryptocurrency has risen 22% so far in 2023, its gains pale in comparison to those achieved by sector leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum. Plus, Tron\u2019s current price is 5% lower than where it was trading at 12 months ago.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCreated in 2014, Tron was designed, in part, based on Ethereum and helps to facilitate smart contracts. Also like Ethereum, TRX operates on an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake protocol, as well as a decentralized, open-source blockchain operating system.\n\nTron is an investor favorite when it comes to smaller, lesser-known cryptocurrencies. And despite Tron\u2019s ups-and-downs of the past year, TRX has gained over 60% since 2018. Now might be a good time for investors to take advantage of an attractive entry point in this crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nConcept art of the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) doubled in the first quarter of the year, but it remains 85% below where it was trading at in April 2022. Investors looking to buy the dip of a cryptocurrency should consider SOL. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has been negatively impacted by several high-profile hacks, the most notable one involving $320 million of Ethereum that was stolen from the Solana platform. Developers have spent much of the last year improving the security of Solana and protecting investors\u2019 capital.\n\nBeyond security improvements, another reason to consider SOL is that its public blockchain platform is able to facilitate smart contracts. This gives Solana a use that many smaller cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin (DOGE-USD, lack.\n\nAnd while the price of Solana has been turbulent, it has been gaining ground alongside most other cryptos this year. Many crypto fans also like the fact that Solana offers fast processing speeds and has comparatively low user fees.\n\nUndervalued Cryptos: Cardano (ADA)\n\nLitecoin logo\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter bottoming this past December, Cardano (ADA-USD) has been on an upswing in 2023, having gained 53% since the start of January. However, trading at 38 cents a token and still down 68% over the past 12 months, ADA looks undervalued and ripe for the picking.\n\nCardano appears to be a bargain considering that its current price is 86% below its all-time high of $2.85 reached in August 2021. And some crypto bulls continue to view Cardano as an up-and-comer in the sector.\n\nCardano competes directly with Ethereum in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Cardano\u2019s underlying blockchain technology got a boost in late 2021 when it completed what\u2019s known as the \u201cAlonzo hard fork.\u201d\n\nSome analysts say that upgrade put Cardano on equal footing with ETH. Yet investors can buy ADA for a fraction of the $1,800 that it costs to purchase a single Ethereum token.\n\nADA is now preparing for another upgrade, called \u201cHydra,\u201d that promises to make the cryptocurrency even more powerful and efficient.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that ZK-EVMs will become crucial to Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 security and verification process in the future.\n\nHow will Ethereum's multi-client philosophy interact with ZK-EVMs?https://t.co/MPpTPNhldR \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 31, 2023\n\nIn his latest blog post, Vitalik shares how he thinks the way in which Ethereum maintains its security and decentralization is its multi-client philosophy.\n\nButerin noted that the privacy-enforcing characteristics of ZK technology could disrupt the broader EVM ecosystem. By combining several transactions into one proof, Layer 2 protocols in ZK rollups have scaled Ethereum and successfully utilized ZK proofs.\n\nZK-EVMs, however, de facto become a third sort of Ethereum client, just as crucial to the network\u2019s security as execution clients and consensus clients are now, as they develop to verify execution on Mainnet.\n\nVitalik aims to preserve the advantages of the \u201cmulti-client philosophy\u201d while simultaneously making use of ZK-EVMs to increase the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and decentralization as the ecosystem grows.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder stated that if users use ZK-EVMs to verify layer 1, they could use a Single ZK-EVM, Closed multi ZK-EVM, or Open multi ZK-EVM.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the main technical issues of deploying ZK technology with many clients are related to latency and data inefficiency.\n\nAdditionally, because different ZK-EVM implementations or protocol rules are interpreted differently by different Ethereum clients, zero-knowledge proofs are handled differently by each client, says Buterin.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder says that the latency challenge could be addressed by being careful when designing the single-slot finality protocol and the data efficiency issue would have to be addressed by having a separate protocol for aggregating verification-related data.\n\n\u201cClients will likely start experimenting with ZK-EVMs to prove Ethereum block execution on their own, especially once we have stateless clients and there\u2019s no technical need to directly re-execute every block to maintain the state,\u201d Buterin added.\n\nSubscribe to The Crypto Times to Learn More About Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Outlooks!!"

        "content": "No transactions were completed on zkSync Era for four hours straight on Saturday.\n\nzkSync later explained what happened and why it couldn\u2019t respond immediately.\n\nTVL on zkSync Era has been growing exponentially.\n\nThe zkEVM wars have been getting more intense in the past few months. Polygon and zkSync launched their zkEVMs on Ethereum mainnet a week ago, and multiple other teams are working towards establishing their own versions of the scaling solution.\n\nHowever, for zkSync, the launch has been somewhat difficult, with the zkSync Era network experiencing downtime a week after being launched.\n\nzkSync Era Fails to Produce Blocks for 4 Hours\n\nzkSync Era, the arguably first zkEVM to launch on Ethereum mainnet, has experienced downtime just a week after its highly-anticipated launch.\n\nOn Saturday, the zkSync Era network stopped producing blocks for four hours. This means that essentially all activity came to a grinding halt as no transactions were completed.\n\nEven more interestingly, it took a few hours for the zkSync team to acknowledge the network issues.\n\nNETWORK UPDATE: Today, the zkSync Era network experienced downtime from 1:52\u20136:02 AM CET. Our team identified the cause and resolved the issue, and the system is healthy and operating 100% as expected again. We'll provide a post-mortem with further details to the community soon. \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 1, 2023\n\nzkSync later apologized for the downtime and explained that the block production halted because of the database for the block queue failures.\n\n\u201cThe database for the block queue failed, causing block production to halt. The database health alert did not trigger because it could not connect to it to collect metrics.\u201d\n\nzkSync also said that when the issues started, the \u201centire team was together at an offsite\u201d and couldn\u2019t respond quickly. However, when the team noticed something was wrong, a fix was issued in five minutes.\n\nProtocol liveness is @zksync's second top priority after security.\n\n\n\nWe want to share, with full transparency, the details of this incident with our community. Here's an overview of what happened, the reasons behind it, our response, and future plans to prevent liveness issues. https://t.co/ujxRqGQXKP \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) April 1, 2023\n\nDespite the bumpy start, zkSync Era has seen an exponential increase in total value locked (TVL). According to Layer-2 blockchain data firm L2Beat, zkSync Era has $107 million in TVL and has overtaken zkSync Lite and StarkNet.\n\nzkSync\u2019s main competitor, Polygon zkEVM, has $2.42 million in TVL, a 15,750% increase in the last seven days.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nNetwork downtime is expected as zkSync Era is still in alpha.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nzkSync Era is one of the most exciting Ethereum rollups. While the network is still in alpha, it\u2019s encouraging to see increased activity as users begin to experience Ethereum with low gas fees.\n\nRead more about the launch of zkSync Era:\n\nMatter Labs Launches Next Phase of Its zkEVM, Rebrands zkSync 2.0 to zkSync Era\n\nRead more about a secret Polygon zkEVM NFT project:\n\nPolygon (MATIC) to Drop Secret zkEVM NFTs: Here\u2019s How to Get Them"

        "content": "Blockchain developer and founder of Cardano Charles Hoskinson has shared a fresh take on the subject of his chief brainchild, this time in terms of staking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparing it to Ethereum (ETH) as the largest proof-of-stake blockchain by capitalization, Hoskinson notes a specialty of Cardano that, in his view, lies in the number of unique addresses involved in the staking process. The chart provided by Hoskinson shows that the number of unique staking participants' wallets on Cardano equals more than 1.2 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has 88,400.\n\nIt is as if a lot of people decided to build an excellent staking protocol years ago and achieved it, says a blockchain developer.\n\nHoskinson's figures are partially confirmed by a Staking Rewards portal. According to the data, Cardano's staking ratio is 68.11%, while Ethereum's is 15.6%. That means that the number of outstanding ADA delegated to staking is almost 4.4 times higher than for ETH.\n\nHowever, because of the price difference between Cardano and Ethereum tokens, the latter has a market staking capitalization 3.5 times larger at $34.29 billion.\n\nAlso, according to the website, Ethereum has a higher staking reward than Cardano, 4.92% versus 3.24%. If we take into account the adjusted reward metric, which considers the annual reward rate adjusted for network supply inflation, the gap is even larger, at 5.13% versus 0.17%."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants to see zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zk-EVMs) built on Ethereum\u2019s first layer to speed up the verification process on the base blockchain.\n\nButerin explained in a March 31 post that it\u2019s possible to integrate a zk-EVM on the base layer without compromising on decentralization and security. The technology enables Ethereum Virtual Machines to execute smart contracts on the blockchain with ZK proofs.\n\nHow will Ethereum's multi-client philosophy interact with ZK-EVMs?https://t.co/MPpTPNhldR \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 31, 2023\n\nEthereum was developed with a \u201cmulti-client philosophy\u201d to ensure decentralization at the protocol level, Buterin explained. By integrating zk-EVMs at the Ethereum layer 1, it would be the third type of client.\n\n\u201cOnce that happens, zk-EVMs de-facto become a third type of Ethereum client, just as important to the network\u2019s security as execution clients and consensus clients are today.\u201d\n\nThe other two clients are the \u201cconsensus\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d clients. The consensus client implements proof-of-stake to ensure nodes in the network reach agreement, while the execution client listens to new transactions broadcast to the network, executes them in standard EVM and holds a copy of the latest state of the blockchain.\n\nIn championing the idea of zk-EVM verification at the Ethereum base layer, Buterin firstly considered the advantages and drawbacks of treating the layer 1 as a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d by pushing almost all activity to layer 2\u2019s.\n\nHe said many layer 1-based apps would become \u201ceconomically nonviable\u201d and that small funds \u2014 worth a few hundred dollars or less \u2014 may get \u201cstuck\u201d in the event that gas fees grow too large.\n\nButerin explained that zk-EVMs would need to be \u201copen\u201d in that different clients each have different zk-EVM implementations and each client waits for a proof that is compatible with its own implementation before accepting a block as valid.\n\nHe prefers this approach because it wouldn\u2019t abandon the \u201cmulti-client\u201d paradigm, and an open zk-EVM infrastructure would also ensure that new clients could be developed, which would further decentralize Ethereum at the base layer.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum\n\nButerin said zkEVMs might be the solution to \u201cThe Verge,\u201d a part of the Ethereum roadmap that aims to make verification at the base layer easier.\n\nButerin acknowledged that the zk-EVM infrastructure might cause data inefficiency and latency issues, however, he said those challenges wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctoo hard\u201d to overcome.\n\nIf the zk-EVM ecosystem is implemented, it would make running a full node on Ethereum even easier, Buterin explained:\n\n\u201cEthereum blocks would be smaller than today, anyone could run a fully verifying node on their laptop or even their phone or inside a browser extension, and this would all happen while preserving the benefits of Ethereum\u2019s multi-client philosophy.\u201d\n\nEthereum layer-2 scaling platform Polygon has made considerable progress with its zk-EVM, having recently open-sourced its zkEVM to the Polygon mainnet on March 27, promising reduced transaction costs and increased throughput of smart contract deployments.\n\nStarkWare, ConsenSys, Scroll, zkSync and Immutable are also deploying similar zkEVM scaling solutions.\n\nMagazine: Attack of the zkEVMs!

According to new data from crypto market analytics platform Dune Analytics, the newly launched zkSync mainnet Era is garnering immense and intense traction among users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from Dune, the zkSync Era now has a total of 59,200 ETH tokens that have been bridged, while more than 254,500 wallets have been created in all. Atop all of the metrics listed, total transactions numbering close to 300,000 complemented the growth in the ecosystem across the board.\n\nZkSync Era \ud83d\udcca\n\n\n\n- 59.2k $ETH bridged\n\n- 254.5k wallets\n\n- 299.2k transactions\n\n\n\n95%+ bridged <1 $ETH, the majority of wallets being \"newbies\" according to this dashboard by @gm365\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0fhttps://t.co/0e29xQ6fxn \u2014 Dune (@DuneAnalytics) April 3, 2023\n\nScalability is notably a major challenge for most protocols as it is technically difficult to achieve scalability and decentralization easily. zkSync solves this problem through its hyperscalability feature that tends to process an unlimited number of transactions without a marginal impact on security or cost.\n\nThe launch of zkSync has been tagged as the future of scalability on Ethereum, and many legacy users of the network are gradually coming to appreciate what the scaling outfit is bringing to the table.\n\nzkSync to help raise bar on Ethereum\n\nWith solutions for scalability being floated by zkSync, the bar is currently being raised for the so-called Ethereum killers who boast of higher scalability and plan to use this as a basis for dethroning Ethereum as the biggest smart contract hub.\n\nWhile zkSync is also raising the bar for Ethereum-based scalability protocols, Polygon has tapped into the ZK technology with the launch of the zkEVM protocol. The ZK innovations are being backed by many of the top developers on Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin, who signed the first transaction when Polygon's zkEVM protocol launched.\n\nEthereum is changing hands at $1,807.97, up 3.10% in the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "Multichain decentralized application (DApp) protocol Astar Network will launch the second iteration of its smart contracts that support both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM VM) on its mainnet on April 6.\n\nIn an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, Astar Network founder Sota Watanabe explained that the new update would allow the creation of WASM or EVM projects within thei network and allow the inception of new multichain apps. According to Watanabe, the new upgrade will let people connect their Astar project to any Polkadot or EVM-based ecosystems.\n\nThe countdown to Wasm Launch Day has begun!\n\n\n\nJoin @WatanabeSota @henskensm and @Polkadot on April 6th to launch Astar's Wasm Revolution with Polkadot ink! smart contracts!\n\n\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Sign up Here: https://t.co/tHGApJmyyW pic.twitter.com/R9w4YeUHTR \u2014 Astar, Future of Smart Contracts for Multichain (@AstarNetwork) March 27, 2023\n\nWithin the announcement, the Astar Network team argued that simultaneously having two virtual machines and allowing interactions between the two is a \u201ckey success factor\u201d in an emerging layer-1 blockchain. The team claimed that even though the Ethereum network brought about the Web3 revolution through smart contracts, it cannot build the future of blockchain on its own.\n\nTo celebrate its launch, the Astar team invited community members to tune into a panel discussion led by its executives and various Polkadot developers to discuss how WASM can be utilized. Furthermore, the company will meet with its infrastructure partners who will build the foundations for the WASM environment.\n\nRelated: ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum\n\nIn other news, Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon has recently released its zkEVM beta to its mainnet, letting developers deploy smart contracts at lower costs. On March 27, Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal described zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs as the \u201choly grail of Ethereum scaling.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Web3 Foundation, the team behind Polkadot, has once again argued that the Polkadot (DOT) token is not a security. On Jan. 26, the firm restated that DOT has already morphed away from being a security and said that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has welcomed talks with the firm.\n\nMagazine: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading"

        "title": "DeGods, Y00ts migrate to new networks, but only one thrives - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "DeGods NFT migrated to Ethereum from Solana, with slow sales and declining activity.\n\nY00ts NFT collection saw a successful start on Polygon, while trade volume increased on both Ethereum and Solana.\n\nDeGods NFT has officially moved to the Ethereum [ETH] network, leaving Solana [SOL] behind. The migration was not without controversy, as it involved a couple of challenges from the Dust Labs.\n\nIn the last 24 hours since the migration, the impact on Ethereum NFT trading volume was closely monitored to assess how DeGods NFT has fared in its new home.\n\nDeGods makes a move to Ethereum\n\nDeGods has made good on its previous announcement by beginning its migration from Solana to Ethereum on 1 April, 2023. The project had pledged to cover gas fees for the first 24 hours of the migration to smooth the transition.\n\nYou can now migrate your DeGods to Ethereum.https://t.co/xn9gOwqn69 pic.twitter.com/keAVf8Hejd \u2014 DeGods III (@DeGodsNFT) April 1, 2023\n\nFor those who prefer to skip the queue and speed up their migration, the user will cover the gas fees. This approach aims to make the process as seamless as possible while giving users the option to prioritize their migration if they choose.\n\nLast year, Dust Labs made a surprising announcement regarding the migration of DeGods and y00ts from Solana to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively. According to project leader Frank DeGods, this move was motivated by a desire to explore new opportunities.\n\nThe decision to shift away from Solana\u2019s blockchain was likely influenced by the platform\u2019s challenges over the past year.\n\nHow DeGods fared so far\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, sales for DeGods on the Ethereum network have been relatively slow. As of this writing, the project has only achieved a trading volume of around 0.5%, with 17 sales representing roughly 6%.\n\nHowever, there is a silver lining, as the number of owners has already exceeded 700. While these figures may not be as impressive as some other NFT projects, it\u2019s important to remember that DeGods has only just migrated to the Ethereum network.\n\nAn analysis of Unique Active Wallets (UAW), transactions and volume data on DappRadar revealed that DeGods experienced a decline in activity. According to the graph, the most recent recorded activity was on March 26. The decline could be due to various factors, such as the migration to Ethereum or changes in market sentiment.\n\nIn contrast, the y00ts NFT collection enjoyed a successful start on the Polygon network.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s latest data, the project achieved impressive results within a 24-hour timeframe. The volume increased by over 190%, while sales more than doubled. Additionally, the project has already attracted over 1,300 owners.\n\nImpact on Solana and Ethereum NFT trades\n\nData from Santiment indicated that there has been a notable increase in NFT trade volume in USD on both Solana and Ethereum. As of this writing, the trade volume on Solana reached approximately $5.4 million. Moreover, there was a visible spike in NFT trade volume on the Solana network since 17 March.\n\nIn addition to Solana, the Ethereum network has also seen a noticeable increase in NFT trade volume since 17 March, according to Santiment\u2019s data. As of this writing, the NFT trade volume in USD on Ethereum reached around $7.8 million."

The expert identified BTC liquidity stacked at the $29,000 level where there is a series of \u201cstop loss\u201d set up by traders. The analyst supports his theory of a \u201cbull trap\u201d with an imbalance on the one-hour time frame at $29,000.\n\nCrypNeuvo is convinced of a pullback after Bitcoin\u2019s run up to $29,000, based on the liquidation levels heatmap.\n\nBitcoin liquidation levels heatmap\n\nWhile Bitcoin yielded massive gains since the beginning of 2023, emerging as one of the highest performing assets, this is likely to end soon.\n\nKyledoops, a YouTuber at Crypto Banter uses CrypNeuvo\u2019s thesis to support the alt season narrative. When Bitcoin completes the \u201ccorrection\u201d or pull back, it is likely to fuel capital rotation in altcoins, as seen typically in previous alt seasons.\n\nAltcoins are finding support, steadying before alt season kicks in\n\nAltcoins wiped out their gains over the weekend with the exception of few in the top 30 assets by market capitalization. In his latest YouTube live stream, Kyledoops noted that altcoins have started their recovery against Bitcoin, gearing up for alt season.\n\nAnalysts are closely watching Bitcoin\u2019s price chart and key resistance levels for signs of the alt season.\n\nAltcoins to watch: ARB, MAGIC, Ethereum Layer 2 coins\n\nIn addition to blue chip altcoin projects ImmutableX (IMX), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX), analysts are closely monitoring Arbitrum (ARB), Magic (MAGIC) and Layer 2 coins for gains this alt season.\n\nAmong all narratives this cycle, the Ethereum Layer 2 narrative is heating up with the announcement of airdrops and rewards in the ecosystem. MATIC, ARB, Optimism (OP) and IMX are the most popular tokens in the Layer 2 ecosystem and these cryptocurrencies are likely to recover in the short-term. These tokens witnessed a rally in the past week before wiping out gains over the weekend.\n\nLayer 2 coins\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding ARB, there are wallet addresses on-chain, accumulating the token. A recovery in ARB is likely once the uncertainty surrounding the token settles. Hustle, a pseudonymous analyst on Crypto Banter, is bullish on ARB and MAGIC in the next phase of alt season."

The reverse transactions were then replaced by a validator. pic.twitter.com/6v051qg9U8 \u2014 CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 3, 2023\n\nAs the bots began to swap millions, the reverse transactions were replaced by a validator, according to CertiK. This eventually led to a loss of $1.8 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), $5.2 million in USD Coin (USDC), $3 million in Tether (USDT), $1.7 million in Dai (DAI) and $13.5 million in Wrapped Ether (WETH). Most of the funds have been transferred to three different wallets at the time of writing.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, CertiK went into more detail about how the attack happened. The security firm explained that the vulnerability was because of the \u201ccentralization of power\u201d with the validators. As the MEV bots tried to perform a front-run and a back-run in transactions for profit, the rogue validator swooped in to back-run the MEV\u2019s transaction, leading to the losses.\n\nRelated: CoW Swap hacker milks over 550 BNB using \u2018solver\u2019 exploit\n\nThe CertiK team told Cointelegraph that this event is one of the largest exploits on MEV bots that they have recorded since September 2022. They explained that:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recorded a total of approximately $27 million since MEV bot exploits since September 2022, with this incident accounting for the vast majority.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the CertiK team also highlighted that this could affect other MEV searchers that are conducting strategies like sandwich trading. \u201cThere is a possibility that MEV searchers will be wary of conducting non-atomical strategies, such as sandwich trading, since this exploit only really affects this particular strategy,\u201d the team said.\n\nWhile MEV bots have the potential to earn vast amounts of digital assets, they are also prone to hacks and exploits. On Sept. 28, 2022, an MEV bot earned 800 Ether (ETH), worth $1 million at the time, through arbitrage trades. An hour later, the bot lost everything to a hacker who exploited a vulnerability in the bot\u2019s code.\n\nMagazine: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health"

        "title": "The highs of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will be reached in 2023, RenQ Finance (RENQ) will still outperform ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has seen a lot of ups and downs over the years, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) being the two most dominant players in the market.\n\nWhile these two cryptocurrencies have enjoyed great success and have seen some incredible price increases in the past, experts believe that RenQ Finance (RENQ) is poised to outperform them in terms of returns in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the reasons behind this prediction and what it means for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nThe Rise of RenQ Finance\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to create a more accessible and decentralized financial ecosystem. The platform provides users various decentralized financial services, including yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision. By utilizing blockchain technology, RenQ Finance eliminates the need for intermediaries and centralized authorities, making financial services more accessible to all.\n\nRenQ Finance has become a popular investment option among traders and investors due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and a strong emphasis on security and interoperability. The platform\u2019s ongoing presale has been a success, with the first three presale stages raising $4.5 million in just four weeks.\n\nRenQ Finance has experienced a surge in price, increasing by approximately 1500% to reach its current price of $0.035. Experts believe that RenQ Finance has the potential to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of returns in 2023 if it continues to perform at this pace.\n\nThe platform\u2019s commitment to creating an accessible and inclusive financial ecosystem, combined with its use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology for investment strategies, makes RenQ Finance a unique player in the DeFi space with promising growth potential.\n\nBitcoin could test new highs in 2023\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that operates without the need for a central bank or single administrator. It was introduced to the world in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin\u2019s popularity has since grown rapidly, and it has become the most well-known cryptocurrency worldwide.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has been volatile, but it has shown impressive growth in recent years. In 2021 alone, Bitcoin rallied nearly 70%, with industry insiders remaining bullish on its potential for further growth. Despite a dip in value after reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, experts predict that Bitcoin has the potential to reach new heights.\n\nSome experts believe that if Bitcoin were to reach its previous record high in 2023, it could easily surpass $100,000. This means that Bitcoin would need to rally by around 270% to hit this impressive milestone. Despite the potential for volatility, many investors and traders see Bitcoin as a valuable asset with significant potential for growth.\n\nEthereum to reach a new peak\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that enables the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts, providing users with more control over their digital assets and transactions without the need for a central authority.\n\nCurrently ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has a circulating supply of 120,457,776 ETH and is traded on various exchanges. Its all-time high price of $4,811 was reached over a year ago, and the cryptocurrency has since undergone price fluctuations.\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price stands at $1,813.82, reflecting a 0.76% change in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is valued at $216,441,564,793.78, and it has a year-to-date change of 52.08%.\n\nWith the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade scheduled for April 12 and the cryptocurrency\u2019s bullish performance, there are expectations that Ethereum could potentially reach new peaks before the end of 2023.\n\nWhy Experts Believe RenQ Finance Will Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nRenQ Finance is a promising cryptocurrency that has been gaining attention from investors and experts in the crypto industry.\n\nOne of the main reasons why experts are bullish on RenQ Finance is its relatively new status in the market. The platform\u2019s innovative approach to DeFi has yet to be fully reflected in its price, and as more investors become aware of its potential, demand for the token is likely to increase, driving its price up.\n\nFurthermore, RenQ Finance has recently seen a surge in price, with a 75% increase in value during its presale stages. Experts predict a potential price gain of 5000% for RENQ, which could make it a highly profitable investment option in the coming years.\n\nFinally, RenQ Finance\u2019s commitment to security and interoperability makes it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth and stability. The platform\u2019s use of blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and transparent, while its ability to facilitate cross-chain trading enables users to trade assets across different blockchain networks.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol PancakeSwap has launched version 3 of its automated market maker platform on BNB Chain and Ethereum, with the upgrade encompassing performance improvements and lower fees.\n\nEnhanced capital efficiency is cited as a key aspect of the upgrade, with a change in how liquidity providers can allocate capital on specific price intervals. In the previous version of PancakeSwap, liquidity from providers (LPs) was distributed uniformly along the price curve of trading pairs, which the platform notes was inefficient given that assets typically trade within certain ranges.\n\nV3 allows liquidity providers to select a custom price range to provide liquidity, allowing specific control over capital investments to higher volume trading ranges. The release also touts the provision of four new trading fee tiers from 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, and 1%, which is a change from V2\u2019s standard 0.25%.\n\nRelated: PancakeSwap governance proposal set to cap CAKE supply at 750M\n\nEvery token pair can have liquidity pools for each tier. PancakeSwap expects asset pairs to be drawn to tiers where incentives for LPs and traders align, with the approach an effort to balance between traders targeting the lowest fees while still incentivizing LPs.\n\nThe PancakeSwap team unpacked the different trading fee tiers in correspondence with Cointelegraph. Assets such as stable pairs where impermanent loss is low (price changes after depositing to a liquidity pool) and prices typically match fall into the 0.01% tier.\n\nThe higher percentage trading fee tiers cater to assets that have higher impermanent loss or lower liquidity. This mechanism intends to provide more fee revenue and incentive for LPs.\n\nPancakeSwap caters to a broad DeFi user base, accounting for over $2.5 billion of total value locked and serving over 1.5 million unique users.\n\nThe platform also revealed upcoming features that are still in development, including a trading rewards program incentivizing traders with exclusive benefits, while a position manager feature aims to improve user experience when depositing tokens as liquidity.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has been front and center in DeFi-related news in March, with its highly-anticipated airdrop seeing around $3.3 million consolidated from over 1,400 addresses into two controlling wallets.\n\nMagazine: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading"

        "content": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm, with unique digital assets selling for millions of dollars. These tokens are powered by blockchain technology, which ensures their authenticity and scarcity. However, buying and selling NFTs on the most popular blockchain, Ethereum, can be costly and slow due to high gas fees and network congestion. That\u2019s why some NFT enthusiasts are turning to Layer 2 solutions, such as ZKSync, that offer faster and cheaper transactions without compromising on security or decentralization.\n\nWhat is ZKSync?\n\nZKSync is a Layer 2 scaling protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to compress many transactions into a single proof that can be verified by the Ethereum network. This way, ZKSync can process thousands of transactions per second with minimal gas costs, while still inheriting the security and finality of Ethereum. ZKSync also supports smart contracts, which enable more complex and interactive NFT applications.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Buying NFTs on ZKSync\n\n1. Create a ZKSync wallet\n\nYou can use the official ZKSync wallet (https://wallet.zksync.io/) or any compatible wallet that supports ZKSync, such as MetaMask, Rainbow, Argent, or Gnosis Safe. You will need to connect your wallet to the ZKSync network and choose a username for your account.\n\n2. Deposit funds to your ZKSync wallet\n\nYou will need some ETH and/or ERC-20 tokens (such as USDC or DAI) to buy NFTs on the ZKSync chain. You can deposit funds from your Ethereum wallet to your ZKSync wallet using the \u201cDeposit\u201d tab on the ZKSync wallet interface. The deposit process will require a one-time gas fee on Ethereum, but after that, you will be able to transact on ZKSync with very low fees.\n\n3. Browse and buy NFTs on ZKSync marketplaces\n\nSeveral NFT marketplaces operate on the ZKSync chain, such as zkNFT (https://zknft.xyz/), you can also check all available NFT\u2019s on ZKSync chain here: (https://ecosystem.zksync.io/) .

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) battles to hold support above $1,800, crypto traders and investors are carefully watching for any indicators suggesting that boosted growth is in the cards for the market\u2019s second-largest asset by market cap.\n\nBased on the current market analysis, the recent closing prices at key levels may influence the price of ETH\u2019s future performance. Specifically, the level of support at $1,671 serves as a crucial level of market interest, as it signifies the price point at which the demand for the asset has previously been strong enough to prevent it from falling further. If the price of ETH stays above this level, it could indicate that the demand for the asset is still strong, leading to a potential upward price trend.\n\nOn the other hand, the resistance level of $1,911 may be a significant challenge for ETH, as it represents a price level at which the asset has struggled to surpass in the past. If the price fails to break through this level, it could indicate a potential reversal in the asset\u2019s upward trend and may lead to a downward price trend.\n\nThus, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithms at the crypto tracking platform PricePredictions. As it happens, the algorithms using artificial intelligence (AI) technology predict that Ethereum will be trading hands at $1,823 on April 30, 2023, according to the latest data retrieved on April 3.\n\nEthereum 30-day price prediction. Source: PricePredictions\n\nSpecifically, this estimation relies on technical analysis (TA) indicators, such as moving averages (MA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BB), relative strength index (RSI), average true range (ATR), and others.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is trading at $1,806, recording a decrease of 0.92% on the day, but a gain of 2.94% across the previous week, adding up to a total market cap of $217.4 billion.\n\nEthereum 1-week price chart.

        "title": "How Blockchain Technology Makes File Storage More Practical and Cost-Effective - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Storing files on the blockchain is a crucial topic of discussion among blockchain enthusiasts and developers. While it is technically possible to store files directly on the blockchain, it is not a practical approach due to high costs and limitations in storage capacity. Let\u2019s explore alternative solutions for storing files in a decentralized and cost-effective manner using blockchain technology.\n\nWhy storing files directly on the blockchain is not feasible\n\nStoring files directly on the blockchain may seem like a logical solution for decentralized file storage, but it is not a practical one. There are several reasons why storing files directly on the blockchain is not feasible.\n\nFirst, storing files on the blockchain can be incredibly expensive. Blockchain transactions are processed using \u201cgas,\u201d which is a fee paid to the network to execute a transaction. The cost of storing a file on the blockchain would be proportionate to the size of the file. For example, storing a 1 MB file on the Ethereum blockchain would cost around $57,332.91 in gas fees alone at the time of writing of this article, which is not a viable option for most users.\n\nIn Ethereum, the block size is not determined by the maximum size limit, but rather by the gas limit. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas (or energy units) a user needs to complete the transaction. A higher gas limit means more work is required to complete a transaction. This cost varies with the transactional workload on the Ethereum network.\n\nFor example, it takes about 640,000 gas to store 1 kilobyte of data in a block (at a standard gas price of 20,000). Ethereum has a current block limit of 15 million gas, which can be expanded to 30 million based on demand. Therefore, the block size in Ethereum can be up to 46 kilobytes, depending on the gas limit.\n\nTo provide an example of the high cost of storing files on the blockchain, let\u2019s take the Ethereum blockchain as an example.\n\nThe Cost of Storing 1kb on Ethereum\n\nEthereum stores data in slots. Each slot is the size of 256 bits.\n\nAccording to Ethereum\u2019s yellow paper, It requires 20,000 gas to store a single slot of 256 bits.\n\n8 bits make one byte, so one slot is 32 bytes (256/8= 32 bytes).\n\n1kb equals 1024 bytes, so it has 32 slots (1024 bytes/32 bytes = 32 slots).\n\nThe amount of gas required to store 1kb is 32 slots*20,000 gas = 640,000 gas\n\nTo include the file in the call data transaction\u2019s field, it will cost additional gas.\n\nEach byte costs 16 gas so the total will be 32 slots * 32 bytes * 16 gas = 16,384 gas\n\nThe base gas fee for any transaction is 21,000 gas\n\nSo the total gas required to store 1kb = 640,000 + 16,384 + 21,000 = 677,384 gas\n\n1 gas is equal to 0.00000005 ETH\n\nSo to store 1kb it costs 677,384 gas* 0.00000005 = 0.0338692 ETH\n\nThe current price of ETH is $1,787.57 so the cost of storing 1kb will be $60.66\n\nThe Cost of Storing 1MB on Ethereum\n\n1MB = 1,000,000 byte\n\n1,000,000 byte / 32 bytes = 31,250 slots\n\n31,250 slots * 20,000 gas = 625,000,000 gas\n\n31,250 slots * 32 bytes * 16 gas = 16,000,000 gas for call data\n\nBase gas cost is 21,000 gas\n\nTotal gas = 625,000,000 + 16,000,000 + 21,000 = 641,021,000 gas\n\n1 gas is equal to 0.00000005 ETH\n\nSo store 1MB it costs 641,021,000 gas * 0.00000005 ETH = 32.05105 ETH = $57,332.91\n\nClearly, this cost is prohibitive for most users and businesses, making storing files directly on the blockchain an unrealistic option. However, there are alternative methods for decentralized file storage that are more practical and cost-effective, which we will explore in the next section.\n\nStoring files in a decentralized way\n\nDecentralization is a fundamental concept in the blockchain world, and the same goes for file storage. Decentralized file storage ensures that data is not stored in one central location, which can be a single point of failure. In a decentralized storage system, data is distributed across multiple nodes or computers, making it more secure and less vulnerable to attack or manipulation. This distributed architecture also ensures that no single entity has complete control over the data, ensuring greater transparency and accountability.\n\nIn a decentralized file storage system, metadata plays a crucial role. Metadata is data that describes other data and provides context, making it easier to manage and locate specific files. In the context of decentralized file storage, metadata typically includes information about the file\u2019s location, access rights, and other attributes. The metadata is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable and transparent, which ensures that the data cannot be tampered with.\n\nWhile storing files directly on the blockchain is not feasible due to high costs and technical limitations, storing a document\u2019s hash on-chain while keeping the whole document elsewhere is a practical solution. The document could be stored in a centralized database or on a distributed file storage system, while the hash is stored on the blockchain. By putting the document through a secure hash algorithm like SHA-256 and storing the hash in a block, the hash value becomes a unique digital fingerprint of the document. This approach saves a huge amount of space and cost, as hash values are far smaller than whole documents. Moreover, it ensures the integrity and authenticity of the original document, as any change in input would result in a completely new hash value, different from the original document.\n\nDecentralized storage networks\n\nDecentralized storage networks offer a way to store data in a distributed and secure manner. Unlike traditional centralized storage services, which store data on a single server or data center, decentralized storage networks store data on a global network of nodes. This makes them less susceptible to data breaches and data loss, as data is redundantly stored in multiple locations.\n\nExamples of decentralized storage networks include Arweave, Filecoin, and Storj. These networks work by allowing users to rent out their unused storage space in exchange for tokens or other rewards. When a user wants to store a file, it is broken up into multiple pieces and distributed across the network of nodes. The data is encrypted and replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring that even if one node fails, the data is still available. Let\u2019s explore Arweave and Filecoin more in the following sections.\n\nArweave\n\nArweave\u2019s innovative approach to decentralized storage is called the permaweb, a permanent and decentralized web built on top of the Arweave. The permaweb consists of a set of modular and interchangeable protocols. It addresses the critical flaw of the traditional web, which is the lack of memory. When documents are removed from one server in the network, they are lost from the knowledge base. The permaweb on Arweave allows developers and users to share a resilient knowledge base that is replicated in vast numbers across the world, perpetually.\n\nThe base protocol of the permaweb is Arweave, which is powered by two fundamental components: a scalable blockchain-like structure that uses a new mining system and a sustainable endowment to ensure the availability and permanence of arbitrarily-tagged data. This approach makes it possible to store large amounts of data in a decentralized manner without the high costs associated with blockchain storage. On top of the Arweave protocol is a decentralized network of gateway servers that makes the data easily accessible to web browsers without the need for modification or specialist software.\n\nBy combining these elements, the permaweb on Arweave provides a secure and decentralized storage solution that is designed to last for centuries. Unlike centralized storage solutions, which can be vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, the permaweb provides a resilient and immutable storage system that is resistant to tampering and censorship. It\u2019s no wonder that Arweave is quickly gaining recognition as one of the most promising decentralized storage networks on the market today.\n\nFilecoin\n\nFilecoin is a unique decentralized storage network that offers built-in economic incentives and cryptography to ensure files are stored reliably over time. This system is built on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol, which uses content addressing to allow permanent references to data and avoids relying on specific devices or cloud servers for addressing content. Filecoin extends the capabilities of IPFS by adding an incentive layer on top, incentivizing content to be reliably stored and accessed.\n\nFilecoin operates through a peer-to-peer network in which users pay to store their files on storage providers, which are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored them correctly over time. The available storage and the price of that storage are not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files in that anyone can participate in. This ensures that the storage costs are distributed evenly across the network, with no central authority controlling the prices.\n\nFilecoin has multiple use cases, including Web3 native NFT and metaverse/game assets storage, incentivized permanent storage, and archiving Web2 datasets as a cheaper alternative to cloud storage. For instance, NFT. Storage uses Filecoin to provide a simple decentralized storage solution for NFT contents and metadata, while Shoah Foundation and Internet Archive leverage Filecoin to back up their contents. Moreover, Filecoin supports a wide range of formats of data, including audio and video files, allowing Web3 platforms such as Audius and Huddle01 to leverage Filecoin as the decentralized storage back end for music streaming and video conferencing.\n\nBest practices for decentralized file storage\n\nWhen it comes to decentralized file storage, there are several best practices that should be followed to ensure data reliability, privacy, and security.\n\nFirstly, it is recommended to store the metadata on the blockchain, while storing the actual file in a decentralized storage network like Arweave or Filecoin. This way, the metadata can be publicly accessible and verifiable on the blockchain, while the actual file is stored in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\nSecondly, data redundancy is crucial to ensure that the data is always available and reliable. By storing multiple copies of the file in different locations, the risk of losing the data due to a single point of failure is greatly reduced. Decentralized storage networks often have built-in redundancy mechanisms to ensure data is always available.\n\nThirdly, protecting data privacy and security is of utmost importance. Encryption should be used to protect the data while in transit and at rest. Access to the data should also be controlled to ensure that only authorized parties can access it. Decentralized storage networks often offer built-in encryption and access control mechanisms.\n\nBest practices for decentralized file storage include storing metadata on the blockchain, utilizing a decentralized storage network for the actual file, ensuring data redundancy for increased reliability, and protecting data privacy and security. By following these best practices, users can ensure that their data is stored in a secure and reliable manner.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile it is possible to store files directly on the blockchain, the high cost and limitations in the amount of data that can be stored make it an impractical approach. Decentralized file storage networks such as Arweave and Filecoin offer a much more reliable and cost-effective method for storing files in a decentralized way. By utilizing a combination of storing metadata on the blockchain and the actual file on a decentralized storage network, data redundancy can be ensured for increased reliability. It is also important to prioritize data privacy and security in the storage process.\n\nAs the blockchain industry continues to grow, decentralized file storage is becoming more and more prevalent. It is important to understand the limitations of traditional file storage methods and to explore and utilize the various decentralized storage networks available for secure and reliable file storage. With the right approach and tools, decentralized file storage can provide a more robust and secure storage solution for individuals and businesses alike."
