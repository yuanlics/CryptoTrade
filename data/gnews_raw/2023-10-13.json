        "title": "Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2: Differences, Adoption, and Drawbacks - Wilson Center",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThere are hundreds of active Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols across over one hundred blockchains. As the adoption and usage of DeFi continues to increase so does the need for the underlying blockchains the protocols are built on to be able to scale. Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and Tron can process thousands of transactions per second with transaction finality time, or the guarantee a transaction cannot be tampered with or reversed, on-par with traditional payment processors. While there are several billion dollars worth of total value locked (TVL) on DeFi protocols on these blockchains, the Ethereum ecosystem continues to dominate the DeFi space as users favor the security of Ethereum and the robust spread of protocols deployed on the network. According to DefiLlama as of August 17, 2023, the Ethereum ecosystem accounts for 68% ($50B) of DeFi TVL and 56% ($69B) of stablecoins deployed on-chain.\n\nHistorically, low scalability and high transaction costs on Ethereum have hindered adoption. Over the last year, this has begun to change with the emergence of Layer 2 solutions on the Ethereum blockchain. These solutions aim to address the scalability and cost issues associated with Ethereum's Layer 1. But what exactly are Layer 1 and Layer 2? How do they differ, and why are they crucial for the future of DeFi and the broader crypto ecosystem? This article delves into these questions, offering a comprehensive understanding of Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2, adoption trends, challenges, and an outlook on their future. Before you dive in, if you\u2019re new to DeFi concepts we recommend reading the previous article in this series, DeFi 101: The Good, the Bad, and the Regulatory, which provides a breakdown of how DeFi works and defines many of the concepts we will be discussing here today.\n\nEthereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum's main network, or Layer 1, is the Ethereum blockchain's base layer, where all transactions are settled. It is highly secure, thoroughly battle-tested, decentralized, and arguably the most trusted blockchain outside of Bitcoin. The Ethereum produced its first block in July of 2015 utilizing a \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW) consensus mechanism. This remained unchanged until September of 2022 when the Ethereum network completed the significant transition to a \u201cproof of stake\u201d (PoS) consensus mechanism. Let\u2019s break down what this means and why it matters.\n\n2015-2022: The Proof of Work Era\n\nOriginally, like Bitcoin, Ethereum operated on a \"proof of work\" (PoW) consensus mechanism. In this system, miners leveraged GPUs and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) to solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain. While this method provides strong security, it is energy-intensive, as it requires a vast amount of computational power.\n\nPoW also does not necessarily benefit from economies of scale as each subsequent block produced (how transactions are processed and stored) becomes more difficult to solve, requiring ever increasing amounts of computational power. This ever-increasing difficulty also severely limits scalability. For example, Bitcoin mining consumes roughly 0.5% of all energy produced worldwide but can only process 7 transactions per second. This energy consumption has been a point of criticism for many environmental advocates and has raised concerns about the sustainability of PoW-based blockchains.\n\n2022-Present: Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nIn response to these concerns and to improve the network's efficiency, Ethereum transitioned to a \"proof of stake\" (PoS) consensus mechanism in September of 2022. This method is far less energy-intensive, with estimates suggesting it reduces energy consumption by up to 99%. Unlike PoW, where miners compete to solve mathematical problems, PoS relies on validators who are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to \"stake\" or lock up as collateral. In Ethereum\u2019s case, validators stake native Ether ($ETH). Validators also participate in attesting or agreeing on the validity of proposed blocks. This process ensures that blocks added to the chain are valid and agreed upon by a majority of validators.\n\nValidators earn rewards for proposing new blocks and for attesting to the validity of transactions. These rewards come from transaction fees and, in some cases, newly minted cryptocurrency. To ensure validators act honestly, the PoS system has a punitive measure called \"slashing.\" If a validator tries to approve fraudulent transactions or behaves maliciously, a portion (or all) of their staked cryptocurrency can be taken away or \"slashed.\" This mechanism discourages dishonest behavior since validators have a financial stake in the network's proper functioning.\n\nEthereum Scalability Issues Remain\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s successful transition from PoW to PoS in September of last year was a monumental achievement. This transition reduced the energy required to run the network,and with no disruption to the operation of the network. However, this upgrade did little to address the issues of the network: scalability and prohibitively high transaction fees, also known as gas fees. In its current form, Ethereum Layer 1 can only process 20-30 transactions per second (TPS) -- for reference, Visa can process 24,000 TPS. It also carries high transaction costs with average gas fees in 2023 over $7, which is orders of magnitude higher than the fractional penny transaction costs of traditional payment processors. With transaction orders driven by an auction-esque system on Ethereum, during peak congestion times, gas fees can reach truly astronomical numbers. In November of 2021, during the bull market's peak, average Ethereum gas fees were over $40 per transaction, with individual transactions costing hundreds of dollars.\n\nEthereum Layer 2, the Scalability Solution\n\nEthereum Layer 2 blockchains (also known Ethereum Rollups) address these issues by processing transactions off the main chain, thereby increasing speed and reducing costs. They do this by rolling up collections of transactions: hence the name. The final, rolled-up transaction is presented to the Ethereum blockchain as a single transaction. By leveraging this rollup technology, Layer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum, like Arbitrum and Optimism, can process up to 40,000 TPS with transaction fees a fraction of the cost of Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nTypes of Rollups\n\nThere are primarily two categories of rollups: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: These rollups operate on a principle of trust. They assume that the data being processed is accurate and that no malicious actors are embedding fraudulent transactions. If there's suspicion of a deceptive transaction, it's challenged and verified directly on the Ethereum network. Both disputing parties have Ethereum (ETH) staked, and the one in the wrong stands to lose their staked amount.\n\nPros:\n\nFaster processing due to the assumption of validity.\n\nIncentivizes honest behavior with staked ETH at risk.\n\nCons:\n\nRelies on external actors to challenge suspicious transactions.\n\nPotential disputes can slow down transaction finality.\n\nNotable Optimistic Rollups:\n\nOptimism: Known for its scalability and speed, Optimism maintains Ethereum compatibility. It uses fraud proofs for transaction integrity, enhancing throughput and reducing costs, and is favored for its developer-friendly environment. The OP Stack, maintained by the Optimism Collective, is a standardized, shared, and open-source development stack designed to simplify launching production-ready Layer 2 blockchains. It aims to foster an interoperable blockchain ecosystem through the Superchain concept\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Arbitrum: A significant player in the Optimistic Rollups space, Arbitrum stands out for its approach to handling smart contracts and transaction batching, offering improved scalability for Ethereum transactions. Arbitrum Orbit allows for the creation of customizable L2 or L3 chains, leveraging Arbitrum Nitro for flexibility and tailored solutions to specific needs. Orbit chains can be either Rollups or AnyTrust chains, offering scalability with different levels of decentralization and performance. They enable dedicated throughput and traffic isolation, and permission access, enhancing gas price reliability and supporting custom token fees\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Base (by Coinbase): Developed by Coinbase as a public good, Base is an emerging Optimistic Rollup solution focusing on creating a seamless user experience. It aims to provide an accessible entry point for users new to the Ethereum ecosystem, balancing ease of use with the core benefits of scalability and reduced transaction costs. Base distinguishes itself by emphasizing simplicity, security, and developer support, aiming to foster greater adoption and innovation within the blockchain space. Zora: Zora introduces a unique approach to Optimistic Rollups, emphasizing decentralized commerce and creator economies. Their solution supports seamless integration of blockchain technology into digital marketplaces, providing an efficient platform for creators and users to interact and transact. Fuel Labs: Fuel Labs focuses on high throughput and low-latency processing, optimizing for simple transactions like token transfers. Cartesi: Cartesi enables developers to use mainstream software stacks for smart contract development, bridging traditional software with blockchain.\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups (zk-rollups): Zk-rollups utilize a cryptographic tool known as a zero-knowledge proof. This allows a user to prove a statement's authenticity without revealing additional details about it. In the crypto world, a specific type of zero-knowledge proof, termed zk-SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge), is employed. This ensures that only valid transactions are added to the rollup, eliminating the need for disputes.\n\nPros:\n\nEnhanced security through cryptographic proofs.\n\nEliminates the need for dispute resolution, ensuring smoother operations.\n\nCons:\n\nRequires more complex cryptographic operations, which might be resource intensive.\n\nDue to their complexity, zk-rollups are significantly more difficult to develop for relative to optimistic rollups.\n\nSeveral key projects have emerged as leaders in this space:\n\nLinea: Developed by Consensys (developer of critical web3 infrastructure like the MetaMask wallet and the Infura API suite, founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin), this project stands out for its ability to generate ZKPs directly from Solidity, Ethereum's primary programming language. This capability significantly eases the development process, lowering the risk of errors and streamlining the integration of advanced privacy features into Ethereum-based applications. Importantly, Linea also maintains a user experience akin to Ethereum, enabling both developers and users to continue using familiar wallets, tools, and interfaces. This dual benefit of simplicity in development and familiarity in user experience positions Linea as a user-friendly yet powerful tool in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Scroll zkEVM: Scroll is focused on security, transparency, and creating a reliable, decentralized infrastructure. It has a multi-layered architecture that includes a settlement layer, a sequencing layer, and a proving layer, with benefits like decentralized proving and low proving costs. Polygon zkEVM: Polygon's suite of ZK rollup solutions includes various rollups like Zero, Hermez, Nightfall, Miden, and zkEVM. Each solution has unique features, such as EVM compatibility, decentralized proving, and reduced centralization risks. Polygon 2.0 represents an upgrade to these systems, promising lower fees and higher scalability. StarkNet: StarkNet uses zk-STARK technology to ensure transaction correctness without revealing sensitive data. It features user accounts implemented as smart contracts, a sequencer for processing transactions, and a prover for generating cryptographic proofs. Benefits include native Account Abstraction and reduced transaction costs. zkSync Era: An advanced version of the zkSync protocol, zkSync Era is designed to be more efficient and scalable, supporting almost all smart contracts based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It offers enhanced scalability, security, and a better developer experience. Immutable: Immutable uses zk-Rollup technology, focusing on gaming via Immutable zkEVM. It stands out for EVM compatibility, low cost, and high scalability, optimized for gaming. Over 200 games plan to launch on Immutable making it one of the predominant players in the Web3 gaming space.\n\nSince many Layer 2 blockchains can operate in parallel with each other, the different approaches to rollups are not a zero sum game. Developers and users can choose the rollup that best serves their particular needs. Keep an eye out for an upcoming article in this series on DeFi Privacy where we discuss zero-knowledge proofs in greater detail.\n\nAdoption: Led by the Layer 2 chains, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync Eta, the adoption and usage of Layer 2s have steadily increased in the last year. Q2 2023 saw a 60% increase in Layer 2 transaction growth QoQ, accounting for 56% of total Layer 1 and Layer 2 transactions. Major centralized exchanges like Coinbase now allow users to transfer tokens directly to Arbitrum and Optimism, allowing users to bypass Ethereum Layer 1 entirely.\n\nCurrent Challenges and Upcoming Solutions: Layer 2 chains provide a much-needed boost to Ethereum scalability, but challenges remain, most notably congestion on Layer 1 and Layer 2 centralization.\n\nCongestion on Layer 1: As new Layer 2 chains are launched, and existing chains improve, Layer 1 Ethereum will eventually become primarily a settlement layer, with most transactions occurring on Layer 2 chains vs. the settlement/transaction hybrid role it now serves. The issue is that even though Layer 2 chains have significantly higher TPS, they ultimately have to settle transactions on Layer 1 in competition with the transactions happening directly on the chain. During the latest Meme coin hype cycle in May of this year, which saw Layer 1 gas fees double, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync era saw their gas fees increase by an order of magnitude. An upcoming Ethereum Layer 1 roadmap upgrade called \u201cdanksharding\u201d aims to address this bottleneck. At a high level, danksharding will dramatically decrease the cost of transactions on Layer 2s, ultimately enabling Ethereum to scale to over 100,000 TPS. This upgrade is slated for \u201clate 2023\u201d. However, while the promised performance improvements should not be questioned, due to the decentralized nature of Ethereum development and delays in previous upgrades, this date should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nCentralization: One of the key strengths of Layer 1 Ethereum is the security and reliability provided by its decentralization. However, Layer 2 rollups have centralization risks as they rely on operators to post data to Layer 1. The ecosystem is currently concentrated in a few operators. Rollups can suffer downtime if operators go offline. This is not atypical, as many crypto projects begin highly centralized to streamline development and become more decentralized as they mature. That said, until the Ethereum Layer 2 chains progress on this front in alignment with the Ethereum roadmap, their levels of centralization remain a potential attack vector.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2\n\nThe Ethereum community is actively working on upgrades and innovations to address the challenges faced by both Layer 1 and Layer 2. With the anticipated danksharding upgrade and ongoing efforts to decentralize Layer 2 solutions, the future looks promising. As these layers continue to evolve, they will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of DeFi and the broader crypto landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 are integral components of the blockchain's ecosystem. While Layer 1 provides a secure and decentralized foundation, Layer 2 solutions offer scalability and cost-effectiveness. By understanding their dynamics, strengths, and challenges, users and developers can make informed decisions and contribute to a more efficient, inclusive, and innovative DeFi landscape. As US policymakers navigate the complex world of DeFi, understanding these layers and their implications is crucial for informed decision-making and future regulatory considerations."

        "title": "Staking can modernize the Ethereum ETF - Blockworks",
        "content": "Before diving into the crux of this op-ed, let\u2019s be clear: The vision outlined here recognizes the pragmatic approach ETF issuers are currently taking.\n\nInitial Ethereum ETFs will be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d in structure and simply track the spot price of Ethereum as a first iteration. That said, just as the equity ETF market has evolved to offer a plethora of sophisticated products beyond simple price tracking offerings, so too must the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nWith that understanding, a particular vision emerges \u2014 one where, just as an investor in an equity ETF demands a pro-rata dividend, an Ethereum investor assertively seeks out staking rewards. To omit such rewards is akin to denying oneself a full, comprehensive return on investment.\n\nStaking is Ethereum\u2019s beating heart. It is the mechanism that rewards any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators, who then propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, and in return are rewarded with newly minted Ethereum as well as a portion of the transaction fees in the block.\n\nTo put it plainly, staking is the modern-day operating system for Ethereum. And therefore staking must play a role in an ideal Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs an example, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH (approx. $15 million) could earn an additional 32 ETH on a monthly basis by staking. This not only enhances the fund\u2019s revenue, but also contributes to Ethereum\u2019s network security. Staking ensures validators are actively participating and making the network more resilient against potential attacks.\n\nIncorporating staking rewards also gives investors a fuller experience of Ethereum ownership. These rewards can potentially provide enhanced returns over time when compared to solely tracking Ethereum\u2019s price performance, as has historically been the case.\n\nStaking rewards can offer a unique avenue for fund managers. They can be innovative in compensating investors, either by directly distributing the rewards pro-rata to investors like a dividend, or by reducing management fees and adding staking rewards to the fund\u2019s total allocation, thus increasing the net asset value (NAV) for each investor. This creates a win-win scenario for both the fund and the investor.\n\nWhy staking matters\n\nSince the Merge in 2022, Ethereum\u2019s supply has been on a decline. A portion of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users is burned, the amount of which is usually higher than the new supply issuance. This deflationary nature makes ETH scarcer by the day, increasing its inherent value.\n\nAn ETF that stakes and captures new issuance might, in essence, be capturing an increasingly valuable asset.\n\nA staking-centric approach reinforces Ethereum\u2019s network. As more ETH is staked and more validators join the network, the cost to attack Ethereum rises exponentially, fostering a more secure environment for transactions and smart contracts.\n\nStaking is not without its challenges. The dynamic unbonding period of Ethereum means that once staked, the assets aren\u2019t immediately liquid. To address this, an Ethereum ETF could strategically stake only 50% of its holdings.\n\nFurthermore, by incorporating a liquid staking protocol which adheres to KYC/AML norms, the ETF could allocate another 30% \u2014 ensuring the requirements of institutional investors are met without compromising liquidity.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: DeFi has a reputation problem\n\nLiquid staking is a mechanism where users stake their crypto assets \u2014 in this case, ETH \u2014 and receive a token representing their staked amount in return. These tokens can then be traded, sold or used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, essentially making them a liquid counterpart to an otherwise locked asset.\n\nIt\u2019s essential that institutional investors look for protocols who fulfill KYC/AML requirements. The remaining 20% could be maintained in spot ETH, offering additional immediate liquidity.\n\nAs Ethereum ETFs gain momentum, their success will hinge on delivering returns while addressing liquidity concerns.\n\nAn intelligent combination of staking platforms and liquid staking protocols can be the bridge between these two worlds, ensuring Ethereum investors get the complete value they deserve, analogous to the dividends stock investors have come to expect. This vision paves the way for an Ethereum ETF that truly resonates with the modern investor\u2019s needs.\n\nFor informational and advertising purposes only.

        "title": "Can Ethereum Reach $5,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "As equity markets benefit from a bounce-back year in 2023, so too has the crypto market.\n\nEthereum (ETH 5.05%) has climbed almost 30% this year, after it dropped 68% in 2022. But with it still being down significantly from its peak, some enthusiasts are hoping for huge returns in the years ahead.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum's price is sitting at about $1,500. For it to reach the $5,000 mark, that would translate to a gain of about 230%. Is this even a possible scenario? Let's take a closer look at this top digital asset.\n\nIt's gotten close\n\nEthereum's all-time high price was about $4,892, which was set in November 2021. At that point, the token's price skyrocketed 153,000% from its initial launch date in mid-2015. Some lucky early adopters got rich.\n\nBut it's worth pointing out that this huge price run-up happened during a major bull market in both the equity markets and the cryptocurrency industry. Monetary policy was still loose after the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince then, it's been a difficult ride for investors. Ethereum is currently 68% below its peak price. The so-called \"crypto winter\" was in full effect after a string of companies in the industry failing. Rapidly rising interest rates have also pressured riskier assets.\n\nWhile impossible to predict, investors can't ignore macroeconomic factors. They can both positively and negatively influence Ethereum's price action.\n\nThe bull case\n\nWithout a doubt, Ethereum has huge potential, according to the most supportive bulls.\n\nThanks to the added functionality and programmability of smart contracts, Ethereum is trying to become the world's decentralized computing platform. This blockchain innovation allows for two parties to transact for different use cases without the need for an intermediary. If it gains broader adoption, industries known for having expensive intermediaries are prone to disruption.\n\nSo far, the use cases have included various decentralized applications like financial protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While activity here has cooled off, developers continue working on trying to make the network better. According to a report by venture firm Electric Capital, Ethereum has 1,901 active developers working on it, significantly more than any other cryptocurrency. This bodes well for its ability to introduce advancements.\n\nSpeaking more to the development aspect, Ethereum's Merge upgrade is what many consider to be a positive step, particularly as it relates to scalability. Ethereum can only process 11 transactions per second, and when demand is high, transaction fees can soar.\n\nThe Merge transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which can lower energy expenditures and set it up for further scaling enhancements. Future upgrades could add more capabilities to Ethereum. And in turn, this could drive usage and demand for the token, causing its price to rise.\n\nReasons to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs is the case with any unproven asset or new technology, there is a ton of uncertainty around the ultimate outcome.\n\nWith any cryptocurrency, there's always inherent technical risk. What happens if there's a bug in the software code that exposes private keys? Then everyone's crypto holdings can be stolen.\n\nIn Ethereum's case, its complex development roadmap introduces the possibility of errors to being made. This means its technical risks are even higher compared to a simpler and more straightforward crypto like Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the biggest bear arguments for Ethereum is that it's becoming more centralized, which goes against the entire premise of cryptocurrencies as tools for decentralization and giving power back to the users. The PoS consensus mechanism leads to larger pools of token holders controlling the processing of transactions.\n\nMoreover, a single person, co-founder Vitalik Buterin, has major influence over the direction of Ethereum. He can make decisions to his benefit at the expense of the average Ethereum user. And this can be a detriment to the integrity of the network.\n\nEthereum has promise, but the uncertainty remains sky-high. So I think investors hoping for the token to reach $5,000 should temper expectations. Unless wild enthusiasm takes over the crypto market again, that's a very lofty price target to set your eyes on"

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is trading around a 15-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC), and the lowest since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWill it continue to weaken for the remainder of 2023? Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the charts.\n\nEthereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair dropped to as low as 0.056 BTC earlier this week. In doing so, the pair broke below its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.058 BTC, raising downside risks further into 2023.\n\nThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nETH/BTC stares at similar sell-off risks in 2023 after losing its 200-week EMA as support. In this case, the next downside target looks to be around its 0.5 Fib line near 0.051 BTC in 2023, down about 9.5% from current price levels.\n\nConversely, ETH price may rebound toward its 50-week EMA (the red wave) near 0.065 BTC if it reclaims the 200-week EMA as support.\n\nBitcoin bull case overshadows Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s persistent weakness versus Bitcoin is reflected in institutional capital flow data.\n\nFor instance, as of Oct. 6, Bitcoin-specific investment funds had attracted $246 million year-to-date (YTD), according to CoinShares. On the other hand, Ethereum funds have lost capital, witnessing outflows worth $104 million in the same period.\n\nNet flows into crypto funds (by asset). Source: CoinShares\n\nThe discrepancy is likely due to growing buzz about a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETF) approval in the United States.\n\nTrade pundits argue that a spot Bitcoin ETF launch will attract $600 billion. In addition, Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving on April 24, 2024, is also acting as a tailwind versus the altcoin market.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price gets new $25K target as SEC decision day boosts GBTC\n\nThe halving will reduce the Bitcoin miners\u2019 block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, a bullish case based on historical precedent that cuts new supply in half.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum scaling solutions based on zero knowledge rollups are increasingly popular.\n\nThe latest, Scroll, promises a higher degree of EVM compatibility than previous generations.\n\nDevs envision a transformation that promises to unlock new horizons for dApp builders within L2\n\nEthereum scaling solutions based on zero knowledge (ZK) rollups have exploded in recent times, and the technology\u2019s proponents argue it represents the blockchain\u2019s future. Already, there are over a dozen projects exploring ZK rollups for a variety of applications.\n\nThe latest Layer 2 to enter the fray \u2014 Scroll \u2014 launched discretely on October 8. But how can the new technology stand out in an increasingly crowded field?\n\nDoes Ethereum Need Another ZK Rollup Solution?\n\nTo date, more than a dozen Ethereum scaling solutions have been developed that deploy ZK rollups.\n\nSome of these are application-specific. For instance, the dYdX crypto exchange built its own ZK roll-up system to help reduce fees for users.\n\nOther solutions are more ambitious, like Loopring, which used the technology to build a general-purpose business platform for trading, swapping, liquidity provision, and payments.\n\nZKSync Era has the highest TVL of all zkEVMs.\n\nFinally, at the most universal level, L2s like Starknet, ZKSync Era, and Linea are open to any Web3 application that could benefit from the scalability and lower gas fees offered by ZK rollups.\n\nAlthough there are plenty of ZK rollup-based L2s already available, Scroll was developed with the vision of creating a user-friendly platform for the full spectrum of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nZK Rollups for the Masses\n\nOne major challenge Ethereum developers faced when working with ZK rollups was the lack of full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). As such, they remain out of reach for many Ethereum dApp developers.\n\nHowever, Scroll contributes to recent advances in EVM-compatible rollups known as zkEVMs.\n\nzkEVM has arguably become the gold standard technology for scaling Ethereum. In this article, I want to share some of the lessons we have learned while building the zkEVM, and how we\u2019ve been thinking of different trade-offs along the way.https://t.co/fQlORnU41r \u2014 Ye Zhang \ud83d\udcdc (@yezhang1998) February 20, 2023\n\nIn fact, the new platform could even be the first \u201ctype 1\u201d zkEVM according to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s four-part categorization whereby type 1 zkEVMs \u201cstrive to be fully and uncompromisingly Ethereum-equivalent.\u201d\n\nThe lack of strong Ethereum equivalence in existing solutions makes them very difficult to use for the average dApp developer. Many ZK rollups require the use of obscure programming languages and a deep understanding of zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nHowever, with Scroll, developers can implement smart contracts using any EVM-compatible language.\n\nArguing that existing solutions are \u201cdeveloper-unfriendly,\u201d Scroll\u2019s developers have said they want to \u201cprovide the best developer experience [\u2026] so that existing Ethereum applications can simply migrate over onto the zk-Rollup as is.\u201d\n\nAccelerating Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n\nThe ZK in ZK rollups refers to the use of zero-knowledge proofs: a cryptographic process for verifying information without revealing its content.\n\nZK rollups offload complex computation and state storage off-chain, processing numerous transactions in a batch and posting only summarized data to the Ethereum mainnet. Using ZK proofs, they can succinctly verify that the summary data is true.\n\nA major obstacle to the widespread use of ZK proofs is the time necessary to generate them. For example, the ZCash network can take over 30 seconds to generate proof for each anonymous transaction. Meanwhile, Filecoin requires around an hour to make each proof.\n\nHowever, Scroll co-founder Ye Zhang has developed a new hardware acceleration method that can increase the speed of proof generation by 100x.\n\nZhang et al\u2019s novel architecture for accelerating zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nIn a recent blog post , Zhang observed that the ultimate goal for the Ethereum community was to \u201cbuild an Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM which can be used to prove mainnet blocks.\u201d\n\nHe also proposed a future Ethereum in which \u201cvalidators don\u2019t need to re-execute a layer 1 block, but instead, they only verify a succinct zk proof.\u201d\n\nThe dream is surely a lofty one, which could dramatically streamline Ethereum\u2019s entire operation. \u201cImagine one day, you can prove the whole history of Ethereum via one single proof,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that super exciting?\u201d"

This will possibly be in parallel with testing efforts on public testnets.\n\ngm, here's my writeup of this week's Ethereum dev call where devs talked about ongoing issues and bugs on Devnet #9 and had a long debate on the merits of EOF.https://t.co/CbYKBaFlmZ \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) October 13, 2023\n\nEthereum developers are gearing up for the upcoming release of Devnet #10. According to the article, Devnet #10 might be ready, hopefully next week.\n\nBarnabas Busa, an Ethereum engineer, underlined that developers are still working through \"big questions\" in the process of testing Dencun.\n\nDevelopers may not proceed with the launch of Devnet #10, likely the final devnet for Dencun, before the upgrade is launched on public Ethereum testnets like Goerli, until these questions are answered.\n\nThe forthcoming Devnet #10 will include a large validator set, maybe with 330,000 active validators. Its launch criteria include updated trusted setup files from the EIP 4844 KZG ceremony, improved visibility for blob transactions, the MEV pipeline and network stability.\n\nThe current Devnet #9 has a 93% participation rate, which means that 93% of validators are actively participating in network consensus. The 7% of invalidators that are not operational are mostly Geth (EL) and Teku (CL) validator nodes.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade contains the eagerly awaited Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, often known as proto-danksharding, which seeks to improve scalability and lower transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism."

Ethereum Express also introduces a robust proof of data availability system, utilizing Merkle proofs to ensure the validity and accessibility of data across the network.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Express emphasizes cross-chain communication and interoperability. The \"Time Crossing\" protocol facilitates trustless interactions between chains by establishing a root of trust between them, enabling secure cross-chain asset transfers and automatic verification of state changes. Additionally, Ethereum Express incorporates multi-chain architecture, allowing application-specific chains to be built on top of its infrastructure, providing flexibility and customization for various projects, especially those in the GameFi sector. Moreover, Ethereum Express supports cross-chain contract calls, enabling DeFi applications on one chain to be directly invoked from another.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum Express is a forward-looking blockchain network that addresses scalability, security, and interoperability challenges within the blockchain and DApp ecosystem. Its innovative consensus mechanisms, data availability sharding, and cross-chain communication protocols make it a promising platform for the future of blockchain technology, catering to a wide range of applications and use cases.\n\nAbout ETE Token\n\nETE token, short for Ethereum Express Token, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Express blockchain network. ETE plays a pivotal role within the ecosystem, serving as both a medium of exchange and a store of value. Users can utilize ETE tokens for transaction fees, staking, and participating in the network's governance processes. Additionally, ETE tokens are essential for incentivizing network security and validators, ensuring the integrity and robustness of the Ethereum Express network. As a fundamental element of this innovative blockchain platform, ETE token underpins its functionality and contributes to its vibrant and decentralized ecosystem.\n\nBased on ERC20, ETE has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). The distribution of ETE tokens is designed to be fair and equitable, with a portion allocated for initial investors, validators, ecosystem development, and user adoption, fostering a balanced and sustainable growth of the Ethereum Express network.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst says Ethereum (ETH) challenger Cardano (ADA) may be approaching a long-awaited breakout moment.\n\nAli Martinez tells his 31,100 followers on the social media platform X that ADA could move above the upper bound of an enduring consolidation range as early as December.\n\n\u201cCardano\u2019s current consolidation trend eerily mirrors the 2018-2020 phase! If history repeats, ADA could stay in this consolidation phase until July 2024.\n\nBarring unforeseen events like the COVID-19 crash, ADA could break out as soon as December!\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader is looking for ADA to cross the $0.50 mark. If that happens before the end of the year, he believes it would likely surpass the $6 level by the end of 2024.\n\nADA is trading for $0.24 at time of writing.\n\nThe trader is also weighing in on Bitcoin (BTC). He says the crypto king needs to convincingly close above $28,233 to ignite a bull cycle. He bases the prediction on the Warm Supply Realized Price indicator, which comprises the less active component of the short-term holder supply, right through to the start of the long-term holder cohort.\n\n\u201cBitcoin Warm Supply Realized Price indicator suggests that the bull run will only reignite if BTC secures a sustained close above $28,233!\u201d\n\nMartinez is watching the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that aims to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.\n\n\u201cBitcoin: In the past month, the four-hour chart RSI has been the real MVP for spotting those local highs and lows!\n\nThe strategy is simple: buy BTC when RSI dips below 30.35. Sell BTC when RSI exceeds 74.21.\n\nNotice the RSI recently dropped below 30.35, signaling a potential buy-the-dip opportunity!\u201d\n\nNext up, the trader says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which traces a series of price points to signal possible trend reversals, is suggesting Ethereum could soon bounce.\n\n\u201cEthereum is moving within a steady range. Interestingly, the TD Sequential presented a buy signal at the lower end of this range, suggesting ETH could rebound to $1,630.\n\nBut be cautious: if ETH closes below $1,530, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,536 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been on a downtrend for the last couple of weeks. The second largest crypto by market cap is down by 5% over the last week and by 2.8% over the last month. However, banking giant Standard Chartered believes that the future is bright for ETH.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Standard Chartered, ETH could reach a price of $8,000 by 2026. This represents a growth of about 419% from current levels. The bank\u2019s bullishness arises from Ethereum\u2019s development in terms of smart contracts, gaming, and tokenization of assets.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: $100 Weekly Investment Turns Into Millions in 2023\n\nHowever, Standard Chartered does not expect ETH to stop at $8,000. The bank expects the crypto to eventually reach $35,000. According to the bank\u2019s Head of FX Research, West, Geoff Kendrick, \u201cWe see the $8,000 level as a stepping stone to our long-term \u2018structural\u2019 valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000.\u201d\n\nReaching $35,000 would mean a growth of about 2172%. However, it should be noted that this prediction is considering the future performance and revenue streams of the project. Kendrick stated, \u201cThat valuation assumes future use cases and revenue streams that may not have emerged yet, although the real-world use cases of gaming and tokenization should support their development.\u201d\n\nHe further added that this prediction is \u201cvery long-term,\u201d and is estimated to take place by 2040.\n\nIf Ethereum reaches $35k, how much should you invest to become a millionaire?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nIf ETH were to hit $35k, an investor would need about 28.57 ETH. The value of 28.57 ETH at current price levels is about $44,000. Hence, an investor could potentially become a millionaire by 2040 with an investment of $44,000 right now.\n\nAlso Read: JPMorgan: Ethereum Has Become \u2018More Centralized\u2019 Since Merge\n\nHowever, there is also the possibility that Standard Chartered\u2019s prediction never comes to fruition. The bank\u2019s prediction considers revenue streams that do not exist yet. Hence it is very difficult to say for sure if ETH will actually hit $35k or not."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs bears continue calling the shots in the crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) has not attained significant momentum to exit the $1,500 level.\n\nAs a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market cap finds itself at a crossroads because it\u2019s sitting at a crucial area illustrating a make-or-break scenario.\n\nLeading analyst Ali took to X, formerly Twitter, to explain this development. He stated, \u201cEthereum is moving within a steady range. Interestingly, the TD Sequential presented a buy signal at the lower end of this range, suggesting ETH could rebound to $1,630. But be cautious \u2013 If ETH closes below $1,530, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.\u201d\n\nSource:TradingView/Ali\n\nThe analyst added that $1,530 was a critical demand zone, and Ethereum ought to trade above it to avoid a steep correction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum was hovering around the $1,550 area at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. Therefore, ETH continues to maintain a bullish image despite it being on shaky grounds.\n\nEthereum Whales are on a Buying Spree\n\nDespite the downturn being experienced in the market, ETH whales are not relenting in their quest to accumulate more coins.\n\nLeading market insight provider Santiment acknowledged that both the top 10 exchange and non-exchange wallets were getting richer by the day as their spending rate was going through the roof.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nAccording to Santiment data, the 10 largest non-exchange and exchange addresses hold ETH worth $61.6 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the bearish momentum in the general crypto market is not dampening the spirits of ETH whales as they continue accumulating more coins.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is set for massive growth based on a recent analysis by Standard Chartered Bank. The financial giant stipulated that ETH could skyrocket by 5x and hit $8,000 by the end of 2026, as reported by ZyCrypto.\n\nEthereum continues to be king in various crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nTherefore, Standard Chartered believes this, coupled with real-world adoption in areas such as tokenization and gaming, will spur Ethereum demand, which is bullish for ETH price."

        "content": "Mastercard in conjunction with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, revealed Thursday the latest results of their CBDC pilot project.\n\nNotably, the pilot included a live transaction where an NFT was purchased on the Ethereum blockchain using a \u201cwrapped\u201d version of the CBDC, according to a statement.\n\nJointly developed with financial services company Cuscal and blockchain platform Mintable as part of the bank and cooperative\u2019s research project, the tech is designed to make CBDCs interoperable across various chains.\n\nThe pilot, which places a real legal claim on the RBA, involved selected industry participants and demonstrated how a CBDC could provide payment and settlement services to Australian households and businesses.\n\n\u201cMastercard has seen demand from consumers to participate in commerce across multiple blockchains, including public blockchains,\u201d Richard Warmold, the company\u2019s Division President of Australasia said.\n\n\u201cThis technology not only has the potential to drive more consumer choice, but it also unlocks new opportunities for collaboration between the public and private networks to drive genuine impact in the digital currency space.\u201d\n\nDuring the live test, Ethereum wallets of both the buyer and seller were \u2018allow-listed,\u2019 demonstrating the tech\u2019s capacity to enforce controls on public blockchains.\n\nSecuring the necessary quantity of the pilot CBDC on the RBA\u2019s dedicated platform, the project then generated a corresponding amount of wrapped pilot CBDC tokens on Ethereum.\n\nAuthorization protocols are strict. The pilot CBDC can only be held, used and redeemed by authorized parties who have cleared Know Your Customer verifications and have been risk-assessed by licensed service providers.\n\nThe project is part of a broader strategy under Mastercard\u2019s wider Multi-Token Network (MTN) initiative, launched in June 2023, that aims to act as a \u201ctestbed for developing live pilot applications and use cases with financial institutions, fintechs and central banks,\u201d Blockworks previously reported.\n\nIt aligns with Mastercard\u2019s ambition to leverage blockchain tech across an array of payment use cases to facilitate what the company is touting as the mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum price drops to a 7-month low as data points to more downside - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) price experienced a 7% decline between Oct. 6 and Oct. 12, hitting a seven-month low at $1,520. Although there was a slight rebound to $1,550 on Oct. 13, it appears that investor confidence and interest in Ethereum are waning, as indicated by multiple metrics.\n\nSome may argue that this movement reflects a broader disinterest in cryptocurrencies, evident in the fact that Google searches for \u201cEthereum\u201d have reached their lowest point in three years. However, Ether has underperformed the overall altcoin market capitalization by 15% since July.\n\n\u201dEthereum\u201d keyword search, globally. Source: Google Trends\n\nInterestingly, this price movement coincided with Ethereum\u2019s average seven-day transaction fees declining to $1.80, the lowest level in the past 12 months. To put this in perspective, these fees stood at over $4.70 just two months ago, a cost considered high even for initiating and closing batched layer-2 transactions.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty and lower staking yield back ETH\u2019s price decline\n\nA significant event that impacted Ether\u2019s price was the remarks made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson regarding U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Director William Hinman\u2019s classification of Ether as a non-security asset in 2018. Hoskinson, who is also an Ethereum co-founder, alleged on Oct. 8 that some form of \u201cfavoritism\u201d influenced the regulator\u2019s decision.\n\nEthereum staking has also garnered less interest from investors participating in the network validation process, as the yield decreased from 4.3% to 3.6% in just two months. This change occurred alongside an increase in ETH supply due to reduced activity in the burn mechanism, reversing the prevailing scarcity trend.\n\nOn Oct. 12, regulatory concerns escalated after the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution (ACPR), a division of the French Central Bank, highlighted the \u201cparadoxical high degree of concentration\u201d risk in decentralized finance (DeFi). The ACPR report suggested the need for specific rules governing smart contract certification and governance to protect users.\n\nDerivatives data and dropping TVL reflect bears\u2019 control\n\nTaking a closer look at derivatives metrics provides insight into how professional Ether traders are positioned following the price correction. Typically, ETH monthly futures trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium to compensate for delayed trade settlement, a practice not unique to the crypto markets.\n\nETH 2-month futures premium vs. spot market. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe premium for Ether futures reached its lowest point in five months on Oct. 12, signaling a lack of demand for leveraged long positions. Interestingly, not even the 8.5% Ether price rally between Sept. 27 and Oct. 1 could push ETH futures above the 5% neutral threshold.\n\nEthereum\u2019s total value locked (TVL) decreased from 13.3 million ETH to 12.5 million ETH in the past two months, indicating reduced demand. This trend reflects diminishing confidence in the DeFi industry and fewer advantages compared with the 5% yield offered by traditional finance in U.S. dollars.\n\nEthereum network TVL ex-native staking. Source: DefiLlama\n\nTo assess the significance of this decline in TVL, one should analyze metrics related to decentralized application (DApp) usage. Some DApps, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, are not financially intensive, rendering the value deposited irrelevant.\n\nTop Ethereum DApps 7-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nRegrettably, for Ethereum, the drop in TVL is accompanied by decreasing activity in most ecosystem DApps, including the leading DEX, Uniswap, and the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea. The reduced demand is also evident in the gaming sector, with Stargate showing only 6,180 active accounts on the network.\n\nWhile regulatory concerns may not be directly related to Ether\u2019s classification as a commodity, they could adversely affect the DApps industry. Furthermore, there is no assurance that key pillars of the ecosystem, such as ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation, will remain unaffected by potential regulatory actions, particularly in the United States.\n\nConsidering the reduced demand for leveraged long positions, declining staking yields, regulatory uncertainties and a broader lack of interest (as reflected in Google Trends), the likelihood of Ether dropping below $1,500 remains relatively high.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's recent developments in the futures market are causing a stir. The charts are whispering some alarming messages, and those in the know are paying close attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpen interest is an essential metric for understanding the futures market. It represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not yet been settled. When open interest is high, it indicates that many traders have open positions on the market. For Ethereum, open interest has been ramping up continuously. But what does this mean? And more importantly, why should we be concerned?\n\nThe recent charts for Ethereum depict ever-increasing open interest. The continual upward trend in open interest indicates a growing number of investors betting on the future price movements of ETH, either up or down. While high open interest can be seen as a sign of heightened activity and interest in Ethereum, it also suggests that there is a lot of speculative trading happening. Speculative trading, as history has shown us, can lead to intense volatility.\n\nWhen examining the attached open interest chart, one notices a stark divergence. While Ethereum's price has seen fluctuations and is showing signs of consolidation, the open interest continues to surge. This divergence can be a precursor to significant price swings. When there is a discrepancy between price movement and open interest, it often suggests that a considerable price shift is on the horizon.\n\nThis \"scary\" surge in open interest, paired with volatile price actions, could lead to what traders term a \"long squeeze\" or a \"short squeeze.\" If the majority of these open contracts are betting on Ethereum's price to go up (long positions) and the price starts to drop, it could trigger a cascade of sell-offs."

        "content": "Upland is now preparing the next steps to make Spark tradable outside of Upland via a Token Trability Event (\u201cTTE\u201d)\n\nPALO ALTO, California --News Direct-- Upland\n\nUpland, the leading web3 Metaverse Super App, announces its plans to make its in-game utility token Spark tradable on Ethereum following an overwhelming majority (87.25%) approval in a recent community governance vote. This initiative allows Upland to accelerate on its mission to build the world\u2019s largest digital open economy in the metaverse through its dynamic ecosystem of players, entrepreneurs, creators, and developers by allowing its utility token, Spark, to be traded outside of Upland\u2019s boundaries.\n\nUpland presented the Sparklet White Paper to the community to review in late September, which outlined the initiative to bridge the in-app token Spark to Ethereum where it will be mirrored and minted as the Sparklet token, equivalent to one-thousandth of Spark. The Sparklet White Paper details the need for Spark to support value creation in the metaverse. It is the resource required for world-building, joint community projects, no-code NFT minting, and \u201cmanufacturing\u201d of 3D map assets, such as cars, decor, and more. Current and future utility details along with tokenomics, Sparklet vesting schedules, implementation, and token distribution were also presented to the Upland community in the White Paper for comment ahead of the governance vote.\n\nWith the community approval of the Sparklet White Paper, Upland is now preparing the next steps to make Spark tradable outside of Upland via a Token Tradability Event (\u201cTTE\u201d), where Spark, a utility token on the EOS blockchain, will be mirrored by the Sparklet token on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy executing the Spark TTE, Upland advances its path toward progressive decentralization, where Spark holders will now be able to trade Sparklet in liquid markets. Additionally, it aims to enhance its presence within the broader Web3 industry through listing on external exchanges, attracting a larger user base to the platform, and enhancing the platform\u2019s network effects.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAdhering to our mission to build the largest digital open economy, Sparklet allows us to take the next step towards progressive decentralization in a responsible way by offering tradability to our users while having mechanisms in place that can shield and protect Upland\u2019s economy from unwanted externalities,\u201d says Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Upland, Dirk Lueth. \u201cThe upside of Sparklet traded on an external exchange means of course higher visibility and more credibility for Upland, which contributes to a positive ripple effect in the web3 community, and also improved liquidity for current Spark holders.\u201d\n\nSpark holders in Upland will have different reasons why they want to increase or decrease their holdings. For instance, some players might want to accelerate building structures on their virtual properties which requires more Spark while others are done with most of their world-building plans and have a reduced need for Spark which they can now liquidate via Sparklet. Creators, Entrepreneurs and Brands might need different amounts of Spark because they want to increase or decrease their manufacturing capabilities. And finally Developers might create additional demand because they introduced a new utility for Spark.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to study the Spark economy since we launched it two years ago, which gives us the confidence to provide the right model for it to be sustainable for decades to come in Upland,\u201d says Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Upland, Idan Zuckerman. \u201cWith Sparklet, we are excited that players will be able to truly own Spark and trade it in liquid markets.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Spark needs to be staked in Upland in order to build or manufacture items. The white paper states that there are over 130,000 players in Upland who hold Spark, with 93.6% of those who purchased Spark using it to build in Upland.\n\nSparklet equals one-thousandth (1/1,000) of one Spark and will exist on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. Sparklet tokens will be able to be uploaded from Ethereum to Upland, where they will be converted into Spark at x/1,000 factor, while Spark tokens can be reclaimed from Upland to Ethereum using the reverse calculation.\n\nAs part of the TTE, a total of 1,000,000,000 Sparklet tokens as finite supply will be issued on Ethereum. These tokens will be mirrored by 1,000,000 Spark that will be minted in Upland on the EOS blockchain. The community-approved Sparklet White Paper highlights that the amount of Spark that is under ownership in Upland will always be exactly equal to the amount of Sparklet that is present in an escrow on the Ethereum bridge.\n\nUpland, a US based company headquartered in Silicon Valley, CA, has not issued a tradable token given regulatory uncertainties in the US crypto space. Recent developments such as the groundbreaking SEC v. Ripple ruling the United States Southern District Court of New York opened the door for token tradability. Upland has never sold its internal utility token to investors.\n\nTo read the Sparklet White Paper and follow the announcements of Upland\u2019s utility token, refer to the Sparklet pages on the Upland website www.upland.me/sparklet and follow Upland on X (formerly Twitter) and Discord.\n\nAbout Upland\n\nUpland, the Metaverse Super App, is a web3 metaverse platform mapped to the real world on a mission to build the largest digital open economy. Our ecosystem is a diverse community of players, entrepreneurs, creators, developers, and brands, all benefiting from true ownership and guaranteed intellectual property rights powered by blockchain technology. Currently, Upland is one of the most widely-used web3 platforms with over 3 million registered accounts, nearly 300,000 landowners, and have sold more than 6 million NFTs. Our platform offers various activities for players and creators, including virtual property trading, world-building, collecting, and fun competitions like car racing. Metaverse entrepreneurs can also operate their own shops, contributing to our thriving economy powered by UPX, our native currency which serves as a medium of exchange, and Spark, a utility token that fuels the value creation by the highly-engaged community. We're headquartered in Silicon Valley, with additional offices in Las Vegas, Ukraine, and Brazil. Upland was founded by serial entrepreneurs in July 2018 and launched in June 2019. Upland is accessible on the web, the App Store, and Google Play, allowing users from around the world to experience the metaverse.\n\nContact Details\n\nUpland\n\nLindsay Anne Aamodt\n\nlindsay.a@upland.me\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/upland-community-approves-governance-vote-to-make-utility-token-spark-tradable-on-ethereum-657458724"

Join us as we delve into VanEck\u2019s forecasts for Ethereum\u2019s value and the factors shaping their predictions.\n\nMost importantly, discover what this could mean for your investments and the crypto market as a whole.\n\nUnderstanding the Base Case\n\nVanEck\u2019s core estimate for Ethereum\u2019s future value is an impressive $11,000 per coin. They believe this projection is possible as Ethereum\u2019s market size is expected to grow from $2.5 billion annually to a substantial $50 billion within the next six to seven years. This suggests a substantial increase in Ethereum\u2019s worth compared to its current price.\n\nWhile some reports speculate that Ethereum could reach $50,000 by 2030, VanEck\u2019s base case of $11,000 remains their most recent and steady estimate.\n\n\u201cWe just refreshed this internally to make sure it\u2019s still valid. Our base case is $11,000 per coin for Ethereum, and that\u2019s based on a topline that grows from about 2.5 billion dollars annuallyized today to $50 billion over the next six to seven years. I mean, we\u2019re going to need to see some decentralized apps go viral and get mass adoption to achieve that price target.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Decoding Ethereum\u2019s Decline: Are Foundation Sales a Red Flag?\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis takes into account various crucial factors, such as Ethereum\u2019s growing adoption and the expansion of its market. This optimistic outlook depends on the expectation that Ethereum will keep growing. Nevertheless, it\u2019s vital to remember that market changes and developments can significantly impact these projections.\n\nHe mentioned that the crypto landscape might change due to macroeconomic factors. Typically, Bitcoin becomes more dominant during cryptocurrency bear markets, while Ethereum is considered a riskier asset. However, investors seek even riskier assets when the cryptocurrency market is bullish, leading to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies performing well.\n\nRead More: How Ripple Case Developments Could Impact Ethereum\u2019s Fate\n\nIn conclusion, VanEck\u2019s analysis paints a promising picture for Ethereum\u2019s future value, with a base case of $11,000 per coin."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThis week, observers caught wind of a stark contrast between large holders of the two top cryptocurrencies on the market\u2013highlighting a seemingly opposite sentiment among whales in Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, Ethereum whales that hold 1,000 or more ETH (worth roughly $1.5 million) have been in a sharp downtrend since 2020, with $20 million ETH being sold off.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin whales have been quietly accumulating. Those holding 1,000 or more BTC (roughly $26.9 million) have remained mostly flat over the same time period\u2014albeit with a couple of sharp drops, perhaps due to the FTX collapse or profit-taking after a successful 2021 bull run.\n\nThe apparent disparity in activity by whales led to a flurry of theories shared across social media, with prominent figures in the Bitcoin aisle seizing the chance to fire shots at its Ethereum community counterparts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteven Lubka, head of private client services for Bitcoin financial services Swan, told Decrypt that his company has seen a large number of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) looking to offload their ETH for BTC. He pointed, above all, to the legal concerns surrounding the industry.\n\n\u201cEthereum is under regulatory pressure, whereas Bitcoin is not,\u201d he said.\n\nHis voice resonated with Jesse Shrader, CEO and co-founder of Amboss, a data analytics firm for the Lightning Network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin provides a simple function: better money,\u201d Shrader said. On the other hand, \u201cwhile Ethereum provides a bounty of enthralling complexity, it risks losing the plot to smart contracts and critical hard fork protocol changes.\u201d\n\nBut the Glassnode data, and the conclusions drawn, seem incomplete.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDoes the chart correctly adjust for staking?\u201d asks Kunal Goel, senior research analyst for Messari. He explained to Decrypt that \u201ctransfers to a staking contract might look like selling on chain but is not really selling at all.\u201d\n\nAt present, staking in the Ethereum network requires users to lock (or pledge) a 32 ETH in a smart contract in order to help the blockchain validate transactions. This appears to be driving the alleged drop in holdings by large entities.\n\nGoel added that although the large difference in dollar amounts between large holders does not disqualify whales from being compared, \u201cthe data needs to be correct.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 Dragosch, head of research for Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA), a crypto asset manager, echoed Goel\u2019s views. He called the ETH whale-selling drama a \u201cnothing burger,\u201d noting that the percentage supply of ETH in smart contracts has been increasing \u201cconcordantly.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted on Twitter that Glassnode does not include Ether tied in smart contracts to the previously mentioned whale supply metric. In fact, Dragosch added, the percentage of ETH supply held by the top 1% of addresses has not declined at all.\n\nThe numbers might seem to say one thing at first glance, but tell a different story: Bitcoin and Ethereum whales continue to be bullish."

        "content": "A recent report from a top-tier bank has sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community with its bold prediction for Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) growth.\n\nStandard Chartered has suggested a potential surge of over 2,000% could be on the cards for ETH \u2013 piquing the attention of investors worldwide.\n\nThis bullish sentiment around ETH has also left investors wondering if other tokens, like Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), might also be poised for sizable gains in the year ahead.\n\nETH in Precarious Position as Price Reaches Critical Support Level\n\nEthereum is currently facing a difficult situation, with the token\u2019s price hovering on the edge of a breakdown below the crucial support level at $1,500.\n\nAfter a brief recovery in late September, ETH rejected the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near $1,735, sparking a steep downtrend.\n\nNow that ETH is just above $1,500, any break below could trigger an even sharper decline.\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, ETH is trapped in a descending wedge pattern, featuring clear lower highs and lower lows.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain data from CoinGlass shows that the 4-hour short volume has increased by 137% to $1.24 billion, indicating bearish sentiment among traders.\n\nOverall, Ethereum is clearly at a major inflection point, with the next few days likely to decide whether the bulls or bears will be in control \u2013 and where ETH will head in the remaining months of 2023.\n\nStandard Chartered Predicts Bright Future for Ethereum\n\nEven with Ethereum stuck in a web of uncertainty, bullish predictions for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency keep rolling in.\n\nThe latest prediction from Standard Chartered Bank forecasted that ETH could rocket over 2,000% in the coming years.\n\nThe UK-based financial giant sees Ethereum hitting $8,000 by the end of 2026, representing a 419% increase from current levels near $1,500.\n\nDriving this price surge are emerging real-world use cases in gaming, NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and enterprise adoption \u2013 cementing ETH\u2019s dominance as the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform.\n\nLonger-term, Standard Chartered predicts Ethereum could reach between $26,000 and $35,000, a staggering 2,173% upside.\n\nUpgrades like proto-danksharding in 2024 are expected to boost Ethereum\u2019s capabilities and justify higher valuations for ETH.\n\nWith major banks like Standard Chartered now calling for colossal ETH price targets like these, the stage looks set for Ethereum to graduate to a key player in the financial and technological landscape.\n\nIs Bitcoin Minetrix The Next Token Set for Lift-Off After Raising $1.2m?\n\nAfter Ethereum, there\u2019s another trending token that\u2019s catching the attention of the crypto community \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nThis innovative project is drawing attention as a potential breakout star thanks to its unique \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model, which allows token holders to earn BTC rewards without the need for mining hardware.\n\nHosted on the Ethereum blockchain, BTCMTX promises yields as high as 488% per year for stakers \u2013 far higher than most comparative staking protocols.\n\nOnce the platform launches, stakers stand to benefit doubly, earning both BTCMTX tokens and BTC payouts through the Stake-to-Mine setup.\n\nGiven the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s unique approach could boost potential rewards for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe promise of double income has created a considerable buzz around Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale, helping it raise $1.2 million in just over three weeks.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale will feature ten stages, each with an incrementally increasing price point for BTCMTX \u2013 meaning the earlier investors get in, the lower the price they\u2019ll secure.\n\nAdding to the presale\u2019s appeal is that Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s platform has been comprehensively audited by Coinsult, one of the world\u2019s premier blockchain security firms.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team is even hosting a $30,000 \u201cMinedrop\u201d giveaway, where ten lucky winners will each come away with $3,000 worth of BTCMTX tokens.\n\nWith big names in the crypto space endorsing BTCMTX and its ability to decentralize the crypto mining process, Bitcoin Minetrix is being touted as the next token on the brink of a massive pump.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

Currently, there are only 223 validators in the entry queue \u2013 a far cry from the peak earlier this year.\n\nThe average wait time for a validator to join the network is also down to just 1 hour and 50 minutes, compared to the 45 days validators had to wait in line in June.\n\nSome market participants have noted that the declining waiting times might be a sign of declining demand for staking. Interestingly, the demand for ETH staking was amplified when the Shanghai upgrade went live in April, with institutional investors depositing three times the amount deposited in the previous month.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade enabled the ability for validators to withdraw their staked ETH after more than two years. Although, it is worth noting that at the time of the upgrade, the majority of ETH staked was underwater.\n\nStill, while the demand for staking ETH now appears to have weaned off, the number of active validators has been on the rise. Data shows that there are currently 857,000 active validators on the network, with around 22% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply staked.\n\nThe counterintuitive numbers might be caused by the increased popularity of liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool, which together have $15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL)."

        "content": "Time to Dump Ethereum (ETH) and Buy Bitcoin (BTC)? 3 Reasons Why That Might Be a Good Idea\n\nEthereum Logo / Source: Adobe\n\nIt\u2019s been an ugly month so far for Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network, that remains the dominant blockchain used to power most sectors within web3, including DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, GambleFi and SocialFi.\n\nThe ETH price, which was last trading just under $1,550 after hitting new seven-month lows earlier this week at $1,520, is down a little over 7.5% for the month.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is thus on course to post its third negative month in four, having now pulled back around 28% from April\u2019s yearly highs close to $2,150.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was last trading with losses of only around 0.5% for the month.\n\nAt current levels in the $26,800s, BTC is down a more conservative 16% from its earlier yearly highs near $32,000, which were hit back in June.\n\nWith the ETH/BTC pair having recent hit its lowest level in 15 months earlier this week under 0.058 following a downtrend that has lasted around one year, some investors are asking whether now might be the time to dump Ethereum and buy Bitcoin.\n\nHere are three reasons why that might be a good idea.\n\nThe Technicals Tell a Bearish Story\n\nETH/BTC has been stuck within a bearish falling wedge patter for the best part of a year.\n\nThat is, until about one week ago, when the cross bearishly broke to the downside of this pattern.\n\nETH/BTC has since proceeded to find strong resistance at the downtrend that had formerly been offering support.\n\nThat, combined with the fact that the cross has also in recent months been finding strong resistance at its major moving averages, suggests momentum remains firmly in the hands of the bears.\n\nRecent technical developments strongly suggest a continuation of the recent bearish market bias, and that a test of the mid-2022 lows around 0.049 remain is on the cards for the months ahead.\n\nEther Faces Demand Headwinds and Inflation\n\nWhilst falling spot trading volumes across crypto major cryptocurrency exchanges are indicative of overall subdued demand for cryptocurrencies right now, the poor demand problem seems to be particularly acute for Ether.\n\nA batch of Ether futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) went live in the US last week, but despite a lot of hype, only managed to attract very weak trading volumes, suggesting institutions remain on the sidelines for now.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise given Ether future trading volumes have been shrinking sharply now since March.\n\nAs per data presented by The Block, Ether future trading volumes were only around $250 billion in September, down from around $770 billion in March.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just trading data that suggests fading demand.\n\nVarious on-chain metrics such as active users, number of transfers, total transfer volume and new addresses have been stagnating now for some time.\n\nThat has culminated recently low gas fees and the Ether supply turning inflationary.\n\nAs per Glassnode, the Ether supply was last just over 119.98 million, up from under 119.9 million in late August.\n\nDemand for Ether staking had been a bright spot for the token this year.\n\nBut ETH staking yields are currently consistently below 4%, as opposed to closer to 5% for long-term US government bonds.\n\nThese bonds are considered a risk-free asset, so investors may continue to prefer parking their cash in the safe haven bond market, rather than risking it with Ether for a lower yield.\n\nBitcoin Looks Like the Better Near-term Bet\n\nAs well as facing technical and demand headwinds, Ether also faces greater regulatory risks in the US than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, after all, is the only cryptocurrency that the current SEC leadership has explicitly said it doesn\u2019t think is a security.\n\nThe SEC has been on a rampage in 2023 suing major US firms and labeling cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nWhile the agency hasn\u2019t yet explicitly stated their view that Ether is a security, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has in the past argued that he thinks ETH is a security.\n\nThat means that investors will remain on edge about the regulatory outlook for ETH in the US until there is more certainty, which will probably only come from 1) Congress passing comprehensive crypto legislation or 2) a series of decisive defeats for the SEC in its various lawsuits against US crypto firms (which are unlikely to culminate any time soon).\n\nBitcoin thus remains a safe haven within the crypto space.\n\nWith bullish narratives around Bitcoin likely to grow into 2024, with the SEC expected to greenlight various spot Bitcoin ETFs and the halving coming up in April, now is probably a good time to pivot towards the world\u2019s foremost cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz has countered the Cardano founder\u2019s comments about possible motives behind the United States regulators\u2019 determination that Ether (ETH) is not a security.\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson addressed the much-debated ETHgate theory in an AMA session on Oct. 8, arguing that the government\u2019s actions were not about corruption.\n\nETHgate is a conspiracy theory alleging that Ethereum received a free pass from U.S. regulators, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been reiterating its stance that ETH isn\u2019t a security for years.\n\nDespite SEC director William Hinman defining Ether as not a security in 2018, U.S. regulators have been struggling to establish the status of other coins, including XRP (XRP), which has created significant impediments to their adoption.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, Hinman\u2019s speech drafts on the regulatory status of Ethereum \u2014 which were released in June 2023 \u2014 do not prove corruption but favoritism.\n\n\u201cNone of that activity presupposes corruption, just favoritism,\u201d Hoskinson argued in the AMA, adding that \u201cthis is how the internet works, and it can\u2019t be fixed now.\u201d\n\nThe Cardano founder emphasized that there has been no evidence proving anything apart from favoritism by the SEC. \u201cWhat evidence do you have of that? Where are the emails? Where are the meetings?\u201d Hoskinson asked. He also argued that XRP serves different customers, doesn\u2019t even have smart contracts and has an entirely different business model. He added:\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that dilute your entire goal of making Ethereum not a security to also do that? Are you so scared of XRP that\u2019s going to happen? You really believe that? If you do, you\u2019re a crazy person in my book.\u201d\n\nHoskinson\u2019s fresh ETHgate-related remarks have quickly triggered a response from the XRP community, particularly executives like XRP chief technology Schwartz. The XRP community specifically clashed with Hoskinson over the definition of corruption.\n\n\u201cI would argue that a government actor showing favoritism aligned with the personal interests of themselves and their friends is corruption,\u201d Schwartz wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Oct. 12.\n\n\u201cSo saying word \u2018corruption\u2019 in much polite way is \u2018favoritism\u2019,\u201d one commenter stated on X.\n\nRelated: Sam Bankman-Fried just like Bernie Madoff, Cardano founder says\n\nSome community members also alleged that Hoskinson\u2019s questions about ETHgate evidence might be related to the fact that he allegedly has a lot to hide about his early days in Ethereum.\n\nApart from his role at Cardano, Hoskinson is also one of the eight Ethereum co-founders alongside Vitalik Buterin and even briefly held the position of Ethereum\u2019s CEO between 2013 and 2014. Following a public fall-out between the co-founders, Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 to subsequently launch Cardano.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives \u2014 Mt.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBlockchain sleuth @OnchainDataNerd has reported that earlier today, a whale awakened after three years of zero activity and made a big transfer of ETH to the Binance exchange.\n\nDormant whale moves millions in ETH to Binance\n\nThe whale deposited 4,500 ETH currently worth almost $7 million in fiat to Binance while the coin's price still remained at $1,542.\n\n@OnchainDataNerd pointed out that this whale had purchased 11,900 ETH in total for $2.89 million back in June 2020 on the Bitfinex exchange. Three years ago, the whale paid $243 per Ether, and now the coin's price has gone up by more than six times.\n\nIf he sells all his Ethereum bought then now, the profit will constitute $15.56 million, per @OnchainDataNerd's X post.\n\n16 hours ago, Whale 0x88e, who has been dormant for 3 years, deposited 4.5K $ETH ($6.94M) to #Binance at $1542.\n\n\n\nNotably, he accumulated 11.9K $ETH ($2.89M) from #Bitfinex at an avg price of $243 in June 2020.\n\n\n\nIn total, he currently has an estimated profit of $15.56M. pic.twitter.com/UTrqzAFV1D \u2014 The Data Nerd (@OnchainDataNerd) October 14, 2023\n\nClose to 60,000 ETH sent to top exchanges today\n\nA lot more Ethereum has been moved to centralized crypto exchanges than what the above-mentioned whale deposited. According to recent X posts by prominent blockchain tracker Whale Alert, whales have moved 59,860 ETH in total to two leading crypto exchanges \u2014 Coinbase and GateIO.\n\nLumps of 22,699 ETH and 22,157 ETH were deposited to Coinbase by anonymous whales, and 15,000 ETH was transferred to GateIO. Altogether this amount of crypto makes up $92.3 million in fiat.\n\nTop 10 Ethereum wallets increase their balances\n\nAs reported by on-chain data aggregator Santiment earlier this week, top 10 Ethereum wallets, both belonging to exchanges and not associated with them, have been accumulating additional amounts of the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, the top 10 addresses on exchanges contain 8.51% of the total Ethereum supply. As for wallets outside crypto exchanges, they have increased their holdings to a whopping 39.22 million ETH."

        "content": "ETF provider ProShares is poised to further expand its crypto offerings with an inverse Ethereum futures fund.\n\nThe planned ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH) aims to gain exposure to potential declines in the Ethereum price.\n\nProShares filed details of the new fund on Friday, just weeks after debuting three long-only Ether Futures ETFs in early October. SETH would trade on NYSE Arca and track the inverse daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index.\n\nThe fund would allow investors to benefit from downward moves in Ethereum without directly shorting the asset.\n\nAccording to ProShares, they expect the SEC to approve the registration statement on October 15th, with a launch target in early November.\n\nSETH would join the provider\u2019s Bitcoin inverse futures ETF, the Short Bitcoin Strategy fund launched in June 2022.\n\nCurrently, it has attracted around $75 million in assets so far. ProShares\u2019 long Bitcoin futures ETF (BITO) remains the largest, with $850 million in assets under management.\n\nThe pending introduction of an inverse Ether product comes as Ethereum hovers near $1,500, down 6% in the past week. The cryptocurrency had rallied earlier in October on optimism over the SEC\u2019s approval of futures-based ETFs.\n\nOn August 4, ProShares and Bitwise filed an application with the SEC for exchange-traded funds with a focus on bitcoin and ether. After which, ProShares moved quickly with VanEck and Bitwise to offer the first three Ether funds immediately after SEC greenlighting on October 2nd.\n\nThe products open crypto exposure to a broader investor base via the ETF structure\u2019s convenience.\n\nBut the debut of an inverse fund also allows for capitalizing on potential volatility declines or bearish sentiment. ProShares has established itself as a leader in crafting diverse crypto investment vehicles for various market conditions.\n\nThe SEC took over two years to approve Ether Futures ETFs after the historic first Bitcoin fund. How fast the assets can grow remains uncertain amid the crypto market flux. However, tailored options continue to broaden access for investors with differing risk appetites."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were struggling on Friday, marking the fourth consecutive session of decline. The lower-than-expected inflation numbers in the United States pushed the dollar index and treasury yields higher, denting the sentiments for the riskier asset class.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was seen in red once again as the last crypto token declined marginally but managed to hold above 26,500 levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped more than a per cent to slip below $1,550-level. Pain in the altcoins continued to weigh on the market sentiments.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has been witnessing a slight dip for the sixth consecutive day. The dip in the crypto markets can be attributed to the September CPI data that came out the previous day, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures. \"The US Dollar Index has climbed, pressuring \u2018risk-on\u2019 asset classes like equities and crypto,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. Toncoin and Solana dropped about 3 per cent each, while Tron, Polkadot and Polygon shed about a per cent each. Shiba Inu inched up maringally, while the US dollar pegged USD Coin also inched maringally up in the early trade.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, dropping to $1.04 trillion-mark, as it declined about half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes tanked about 13 per cent to $22.64 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has been trading around the $26,600 level. The US CPI for September rose by 0.4 per cent instead of the anticipated 0.3 per cent and triggered rise in the US Dollar index. This may have made investors slightly cautious regarding their investments, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Traditional markets have been impacted similarly. Bitcoin will now need to breach the resistance at $26,900 or will potentially seek support around the $26,500 mark. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently at its weakest point since March 2023 and is trading above $1,500,\" he added.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)is currently facing difficulty breaching a previous resistance level ($0.061) and is in a downward momentum. DOGE attempted a rebound to this level this week that coincides with its 50-day moving average but price has instead broken down from a horizontal channel.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-DOGE\n\n\n\nIn case of a further decline, the recent low (at $0.056) serves as an early support level, with the $0.052 zone providing the next line of defence. Price may consolidate in the near term if it continues to hold $0.056 support. Its14-day RSI is in the oversold territory and is currently at 30.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.056, $0.052\n\nResistance: $0.061, $0.064, $0.067\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with prices of individual coins rising and falling dramatically over short periods. Two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), have seen significant price movements over the past year. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the correlation between their price movements and analyze which of the two might be a more profitable investment. Let\u2019s take a look at this Ethereum vs Cardano article in more detail.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Price Movements Over the Past Year\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nMonth Price (USD) Nov 2022 $1,572.65 Dec 2022 $1,295.77 Jan 2023 $1,196.71 Feb 2023 $1,586.49 Mar 2023 $1,606.04 Apr 2023 $1,821.70 May 2023 $1,868.89 Jun 2023 $1,873.91 Jul 2023 $1,933.32 Aug 2023 $1,856.19 Sep 2023 $1,645.58 Oct 2023 $1,671.16\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nMonth Price (USD) Nov 2022 $0.4063 Dec 2022 $0.3189 Jan 2023 $0.2464 Feb 2023 $0.3909 Mar 2023 $0.3525 Apr 2023 $0.3989 May 2023 $0.3973 Jun 2023 $0.3744 Jul 2023 $0.2870 Aug 2023 $0.3075 Sep 2023 $0.2554 Oct 2023 $0.2540\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Correlation Analysis\n\nFrom the data, it\u2019s evident that both Ethereum and Cardano experienced fluctuations in their prices over the past year. Ethereum\u2019s price ranged from a low of $1,196.71 in January 2023 to a high of $1,933.32 in July 2023. On the other hand, Cardano\u2019s price saw a low of $0.2464 in January 2023 and a high of $0.3989 in April 2023.\n\nWhile both cryptocurrencies experienced their lowest prices in January 2023, Ethereum\u2019s price rebounded more significantly than Cardano\u2019s in the subsequent months.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Profit Predictions for Christmas 2023\n\nTo determine which cryptocurrency would have been more profitable:\n\nEthereum (ETH) : If an investor purchased 1 ETH in January 2023 at $1,196.71 and sold it in July 2023 at $1,933.32, the profit would be $736.61.\n\n: If an investor purchased 1 ETH in January 2023 at $1,196.71 and sold it in July 2023 at $1,933.32, the profit would be $736.61. Cardano (ADA): If an investor purchased 1,000 ADA in January 2023 at $246.40 (total) and sold it in April 2023 at $398.90 (total), the profit would be $152.50.\n\nFrom the above calculations, it\u2019s clear that an investment in Ethereum would have been more profitable than Cardano over the past year, with a profit margin almost 5 times greater.\n\nTo predict the potential profitability of Ethereum and Cardano by Christmas 2023, we can use their current prices as a starting point and consider their historical performance and market trends.\n\nAssuming a linear growth based on their past year\u2019s performance:\n\nEthereum (ETH) : Predicted Price = $1,671.16 + (Average Monthly Growth * 2.5 months)\n\n: Predicted Price = $1,671.16 + (Average Monthly Growth * 2.5 months) Cardano (ADA): Predicted Price = $0.2540 + (Average Monthly Growth * 2.5 months)\n\nWithout exact average monthly growth rates, it\u2019s challenging to provide a precise prediction. To compute the monthly growth rates, we\u2019ll use the formula:\n\nGrowth Rate=(End Price\u2212Start Price/Start Price )\u00d7100\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the monthly growth rates for both Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) based on the provided data:\n\nEthereum (ETH) Monthly Growth Rates:\n\nETH/USD Monthly Rate- TradingView\n\nNov to Dec 2022: (1295.77\u22121572.65/1572.65)\u00d7100 = -17.60% Dec 2022 to Jan 2023: (1196.71\u22121295.77/1295.77)\u00d7100= -7.65% Jan to Feb 2023: (1586.49\u22121196.71/1196.71)\u00d7100 = 32.56% Feb to Mar 2023: (1606.04\u22121586.49/1586.49)\u00d7100= 1.23% Mar to Apr 2023: (1821.70\u22121606.04/1606.04)\u00d7100 = 13.43% Apr to May 2023: (1868.89\u22121821.70/1821.70)\u00d7100 = 2.59% May to Jun 2023: (1873.91\u22121868.89/1868.89)\u00d7100 = 0.27% Jun to Jul 2023: (1933.32\u22121873.91/1873.91)\u00d7100 = 3.16% Jul to Aug 2023: (1856.19\u22121933.32/1933.32)\u00d7100 = -3.99% Aug to Sep 2023: (1645.58\u22121856.19/1856.19)\u00d7100 = -11.34% Sep to Oct 2023: (1671.16\u22121645.58/1645.58)\u00d7100 = 1.55%\n\nCardano (ADA) Monthly Growth Rates:\n\nADA/USD Monthly: TradingView\n\nNov to Dec 2022: (0.3189\u22120.4063/0.4063)\u00d7100 = -21.54% Dec 2022 to Jan 2023: (0.2464\u22120.3189/0.3189)\u00d7100 = -22.75% Jan to Feb 2023: (0.3909\u22120.2464/0.2464)\u00d7100 = 58.65% Feb to Mar 2023: (0.3525\u22120.3909/0.3909)\u00d7100 = -9.82% Mar to Apr 2023: (0.3989\u22120.3525/0.3525)\u00d7100 = 13.14% Apr to May 2023: (0.3973\u22120.3989/0.3989)\u00d7100 = -0.40% May to Jun 2023: (0.3744\u22120.3973/0.3973)\u00d7100 = -5.77% Jun to Jul 2023: (0.2870\u22120.3744/0.3744)\u00d7100 = -23.36% Jul to Aug 2023: (0.3075\u22120.2870/0.2870)\u00d7100 = 7.14% Aug to Sep 2023: (0.2554\u22120.3075/0.3075)\u00d7100 = -16.96%\n\nBased on the current prices, Ethereum seems to have a higher potential for profitability by Christmas 2023, given its more substantial price and historical performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile past performance is not indicative of future results, the data suggests that Ethereum has been a more profitable investment compared to Cardano over the past year. However, investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "The dynamic crypto landscape is marked by fluctuations, with investors often on the lookout for bullish waves. In the current scenario, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are witnessing a decline.\n\nMeanwhile, Tradecurve Markets (TCRV), an up-and-coming token, emerges as a promising contender with the potential to mint crypto millionaires.\n\n>Visit The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nWill Ethereum (ETH) Bounce Back?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is often regarded as the pioneer of smart contracts. Notably, it is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, ETH. Ethereum functions as a platform for several cryptocurrencies as well as for the execution of smart contracts.\n\nHowever, the recent downturn in its price has led investors to reconsider their strategy. This Ethereum decline can be attributed to a shift in sentiment, profit-taking, and the bearishness of the broader crypto market.\n\nNevertheless, as a blue-chip token and the second-leading token after Bitcoin, Ethereum will rally in the future. Certainly, a bounceback is on the cards.\n\nIs Cardano (ADA) Dead?\n\nCardano (ADA) is popular for its focus on sustainability and scalability. As a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform, it allows the creation of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts with modularity. At the heart of the Cardano ecosystem is ADA, which primarily functions as a governance token.\n\nThe answer to this question, whether Cardano is dead or not, depends on the timeframe being used as a metric. For instance, since June 2022, ADA has been hovering around or below $0.6. In addition, it has significantly declined from its peak by over 90%.\n\nOn the other hand, with an ROI of over 1,000% since its launch, Cardano is far from dead. The decline in its price can be linked to the bearish sentiment around the broader market. Hence, it is expected to rally alongside the larger market during the bull season.\n\n>>Visit The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nWhat is Tradecurve Markets (TCRV)?\n\nAmidst the decline in the price of Ethereum and Cardano, Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) has positioned itself as a compelling alternative investment. Its innovative concept aims to solve several problems in the trading world. To this end, it will combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Therefore, it will become a hybrid trading platform where users will be able to trade diverse financial instruments and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIts unique value proposition will make it an all-in-one trading platform for the trading of cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, commodities, and several other financial instruments. That isn\u2019t all; user privacy will be protected as investors will be able to trade global assets without KYC checks. In addition, all assets, regardless of their type and nature, can be traded from one account.\n\nFurthermore, it will offer deep liquidity across thousands of assets, making up one of its several competitive edges. Additionally, retail traders will gain access to leveraged products, advanced trading tools, zero commission, and tight spreads.\n\nThis novel trading platform will function in three simple steps. First, users will open an account via their email address without KYC, which should take about 2 minutes. Next, traders will decide which crypto they want to add and make the deposit. Finally, the crypto balance can then be used as collateral to trade assets using leverage.\n\nIn light of the points mentioned above, Tradecurve Markets is poised to revolutionize the trading world. Hence, it will skyrocket in value. Moreover, over 18,000 users have already been onboarded, proof of its impending adoption.\n\nThe token, in its current presale stage, is priced at $0.03 per token. However, industry experts predict a rally of 80x before the end of 2023, minting crypto millionaires from early investors in the process.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) presale:\n\nBuy presale: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum or Bitcoin \u2013 Why Scorpion Casino is a Better Investment than High-Cap Cryptos at this Point - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the market with high transaction volumes every day. But the return on investment from these assets is disappointing. Most investors see them as long-term investments without expecting any substantial returns in the short term.\n\nThe Investment Outlook of Ethereum and BTC\n\nDespite the frequent upturns, BTC and ETH are prone to market volatilities, which haven\u2019t been kind for some time now.\n\nYet, they show great promise for the coming years. To give you a better perspective, Bitcoin and Ethereum have lost 60.65% and 66.59% of their values since hitting all-time highs in 2021.\n\nBitcoin 1-year price action, CoinMarketCap\n\nThe Bitcoin-halving of 2024 is much-awaited and is seen as a pivotal event in the history of the market. Although the event cuts down the block rewards of the Bitcoin blockchain by half, it will bear a strong bullish impact on most of the market.\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to climb 1X to 2X in the first half of 2024, as a result. Although price corrections may follow later, they will prove to be solid investments this year, especially if you managed to buy the dip.\n\nScorpion Casino (SCORP) Has Higher Upside Potential\n\nRollbit is one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2023. From $0.001996 in October 2022, it jumped to $0.21 in August 2023! The token boasts a 5442.40% ROI on the yearly chart. That\u2019s substantially larger than Bitcoin and Ethereum can hope to give in a lifetime if you buy into them now.\n\nRollbit 1-year price action, CoinMarketCap\n\nWhat has any of that got to do with Scorpion Casino?\n\nScorpion Casino \u2013 a licensed online gambling and sports betting platform \u2013 is predicted to be the next Rollbit.\n\nMuch of the craze has to do with the new rush of investors to the industry, predicted to expand in the coming years.\n\nBeing a blockchain-based platform, Scorpion Casino provides the added advantage of transparency and fairness when it comes to the selection of winners as well as the distribution of rewards.\n\nThe dynamic platform boasts an extensive array of offerings. With a staggering 30,000 monthly betting options, a diverse collection of 210 casino games, and 160 live games, it hosts a wide range of players from around the world.\n\nSports enthusiasts can also use the platform to apply their expertise in more than 35 sports \u2013 including football, tennis, American football, horse racing, basketball, golf, boxing, and MMA \u2013 as a source of side income.\n\nThe casino houses a vast selection of over 200 games \u2013 including slots, blackjack, roulette, poker, and live casino games \u2013 from major game providers like Evolution, NetEnt, Play N Go, Novomatic, EGT, and AMATIC.\n\nThe project has also recently joined forces with Tenset as its Bronze Sponsor.\n\nTenset Infinity \u267e keeps expanding with 65th airdrop and Bronze sponsor @ScorpionCasino \ud83c\udf81 New online crypto platform offering 35+ sports to bet on and 200+ casino games \ud83c\udfb2 Read: https://t.co/46TEMrJvDY\n\nTG: https://t.co/sK5srvtdJL pic.twitter.com/ykqkyJ5yhk \u2014 TenseT.io (@TenseT_io) September 13, 2023\n\nScorpion Casino\u2019s Staking and Burning Mechanisms will Fuel its Price Action\n\nSimilar to Rollbit, Scorpion Casino has implemented a burning mechanism that will make sure that the token stays resilient to market volatility. Like all burning mechanisms, it is also designed to cut down the supply of the native token over time.\n\nBut there is more.\n\nThe burning mechanism is accompanied by a staking system with earning potential of up to $10,000 USDT per day.\n\nBut how reliable is this daily passive income?\n\nTo analyze that, we need to first take a look at the following diagram.\n\nAs you can see, the platform sets aside a share of the daily profit generated on the gaming dashboard for the staking rewards pool. Or, the staking reward system doesn\u2019t solely rely on minting out new tokens.\n\nThis makes a big difference since most crypto staking systems prove to be flimsy over time with depleting APY and token prices. Since the SCORP staking system relies on the platform revenue, it will prove to be more resilient. As long as the gaming dashboard maintains an active user base, stakers will continue to get attractive rewards.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile ETH and BTC are evergreen cryptocurrencies with more room for growth, they can\u2019t give exponential returns due to their massive market caps. Their growth potential is limited to a little over the much-needed price correction.\n\nPromising new cryptocurrencies like Scorpion Casino, on the other hand, have a steep way ahead. A conservative price prediction for SCORP tokens this year is 7X-10X from the presale price, factoring in the unique value propositions and competence of the project as well as the growth potential of the online gambling industry.\n\nBUY SCORP AT PRESALE PRICE\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Before delving into the relationship between gas fees, NFTs, and DeFi, it\u2019s essential to grasp what gas fees are.

Gas is the unit of measure for computational work on the Ethereum network. When users interact with Ethereum through transactions or smart contracts, they need to pay a fee, denominated in gas, to compensate miners for processing these operations.\n\nThe Basics: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?\n\nGas is a unit of measurement for computational work on the Ethereum network. Every transaction or operation executed on Ethereum consumes a certain amount of gas, which is paid for in Ether (ETH). This fee compensates miners for their computational efforts in verifying and processing transactions.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees and NFTs\n\nEthereum gas fees and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are intricately connected within the Ethereum ecosystem. Gas fees are an essential component of the Ethereum blockchain, as they ensure the secure and efficient execution of smart contracts, including those related to NFTs. In this detailed explanation, we\u2019ll explore the relationship between Ethereum gas fees and NFTs, the factors that influence gas costs for NFT transactions, and potential solutions to mitigate the impact of gas fees on NFT operations.\n\nGas Fees and NFTs: How They Are Related\n\n1. Minting NFTs:\n\nMinting an NFT, which means creating a unique digital asset and recording it on the blockchain, involves executing a smart contract. This process consumes gas, as it requires computational work to validate and record the new NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n2. Transferring NFTs:\n\nWhen NFTs change hands, whether through sales, trades, or auctions on NFT marketplaces, these transactions are also smart contract executions and, thus, involve gas fees. The seller incurs the cost when transferring the NFT to the buyer.\n\n3. NFT Marketplaces:\n\nNFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare are built on the Ethereum blockchain. The operations conducted on these platforms, such as listing NFTs for sale, making offers, or accepting bids, all consume gas. Therefore, users engaging in NFT trading on these platforms must pay gas fees associated with their transactions.\n\n4. Gas Costs and Rarity:\n\nThe rarity and uniqueness of an NFT can influence the gas fees associated with it. High-value NFTs, especially those with unique characteristics or from well-known artists, tend to have higher gas fees when minted or transferred. The more complex the smart contract, the higher the gas cost.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Everything To Know About NFT Gas Fee\n\nFactors Impacting Gas Fees for NFTs\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the variability of gas fees for NFTs:\n\nNetwork Congestion:\n\nGas fees tend to rise during periods of high network congestion. When there is a surge in activity on the Ethereum network, such as during the release of a popular NFT collection or a DeFi craze, gas fees can skyrocket, making NFT operations more expensive.\n\nGas Price Setting:\n\nEthereum users can set the gas price they are willing to pay for a transaction. When demand for block space is high, setting a low gas price may result in slower confirmation times or even failed transactions. On the other hand, setting a high gas price can lead to substantial fees.\n\nGas Limit:\n\nEach Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which defines the maximum amount of gas you\u2019re willing to pay. Setting a low gas limit may save costs but could lead to incomplete transactions or even failed minting or transfer attempts for NFTs.\n\nSmart Contract Complexity:\n\nThe more complex the smart contract associated with an NFT, the more gas it consumes. Highly intricate NFTs, such as those with dynamic characteristics or interactive features, can result in higher gas fees.\n\nMitigating the Impact of Gas Fees on NFTs\n\nGiven the influence of gas fees on NFTs, several strategies and solutions are emerging to mitigate their impact:\n\n1. Layer 2 Solutions:\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Optimism are gaining traction in the NFT space. They provide faster and cheaper transactions by offloading some of the computational work from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n2. Gas Optimization:\n\nSmart contract developers are increasingly focused on optimizing their code to reduce gas consumption. This benefits not only NFT creators but the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n3. Gas Price Monitoring:\n\nTools and services exist to monitor gas prices in real-time. Users can wait for periods of lower network activity to perform NFT operations when gas fees are more affordable.\n\n4. Cross-Chain NFTs:\n\nSome projects are exploring cross-chain NFTs that operate on multiple blockchain networks, potentially reducing gas fees and providing more flexibility for users.\n\nEthereum gas fees are intimately linked to the NFT ecosystem. The creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs all involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the costs can vary significantly based on network congestion, gas price settings, and smart contract complexity. While high gas fees can be a challenge for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions, such as Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization, offer hope for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the relationship between gas fees and NFTs will remain a key consideration for users and developers within this vibrant and dynamic space.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees and DeFi\n\nEthereum gas fees and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) are closely intertwined within the Ethereum ecosystem. Gas fees are a fundamental aspect of Ethereum, while DeFi represents a groundbreaking financial ecosystem built on the Ethereum blockchain. In this detailed explanation, we\u2019ll explore the relationship between Ethereum gas fees and DeFi, the impact of gas fees on DeFi users, and potential solutions to address the challenges posed by high gas fees in DeFi.\n\nThe benefit of the low liquidity right now in the #Crypto markets is the fact we have incredibly cheap #Ethereum gas fees That will change once we get liquidity back in the markets, so enjoy it while it lasts \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) October 12, 2023"

        "content": "Fri 13 Oct 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\n\u25aa Blockchain\n\nEthereum Fails to Attract Validators: Recent statistics have shown that Ethereum is no longer a strong magnet for validators, which has surprised many crypto observers.\n\nIs Ethereum Becoming Less and Less Attractive?\n\nLast June, the developers of Ethereum came up with a brilliant idea to revolutionize the blockchain. In their view, capping the MAX_EFFECIVE_BALANCE at 2,048 ETH, at that time set at 32 ETH, would enable instant composition of rewards and reduce the number of validators.\n\n\uf4e2 Ethereum's validator queue is finally clearing out! \uf680 As the demand for staking declines, this opens up exciting opportunities for new validators to join the network. \uf4aa Don't miss your chance to be part of the #Ethereum revolution! \uf525 #CryptoNews #BlockchainTechnology #NFTs\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZwCQnJJ4qs \u2014 \u26a1 Mr. Crypto Giants\ud83d\udc0b (@CryptoGiants_) October 12, 2023 Declining interest from Ethereum validators?\n\nWhile crypto influencer Mr. Crypto Giants thinks so, Coinjournal sees a rather paradoxical situation compared to the track record of this popular blockchain. Yesterday, the Ethereum queue comprised just 377 validators, the crypto media outlet points out.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, however, the list peaked at 96,000 validators.\n\nWhat can we make of this significant drop? It\u2019s akin to a reduction in demand for Ethereum staking. At one time, candidate validators on the same network complained about the slow approval of their applications: 45 days waiting time. In addition, they were confronted with ETH staking application rejections.\n\nNevertheless, Validator Queue data revealed a major improvement in waiting times. Instead of the 45 days mentioned above, the duration has dropped drastically by 4 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s high praise for Ethereum\u2019s spectacularly successful Shapella upgrade in mid-April 2023. Shapella, a contraction of Shanghai and Capella, represents the final stage in the blockchain\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work (PoR) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nETH Staking Rewards Decrease\n\nShapella therefore represents a crucial milestone for Ethereum. Some analysts firmly believe that its advent will coincide with an ETH bull run of up to $5,000. Moreover, a few days after the announcement, CoinShares spoke of an increase in institutional investor interest in the Ethereum blockchain thanks to Shanghai-Capella.\n\n\u201cEthereum saw inflows totaling $17 million last week, suggesting that investors are increasingly confident following the implementation of Shapella,\u201d CoinShares had concluded on April 24.\n\nWhich seems entirely logical, given that The Merge, Ethereum\u2019s successful September 2022 upgrade, opened up several exits for ETH investors.\n\nBut this drop in staking demand is worrying some observers. It has led to a reduction in staking rewards. Whereas at the beginning of the year, the figure was 5-6%, it has now fallen to 3.5%.\n\nIn other words, the Ethereum network\u2019s fee-generating activities have also fallen, and its staker numbers have risen.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market saw a sell-off in the last one week, mainly owing to the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $26,800, down over 3 per cent in the last one week. Ethereum was down 5.2 per cent and was trading at $1,549, according to CoinMarketCap. Most of the crypto tokens like Solana, Cardano and Ripple were trading in the red too.\n\n\"Crypto markets were trending downwards last week as the world witnessed a rise in tensions amidst Israel and Palestine, sending global investors into a risk-off mode,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"Overall the global crypto market cap fell just below the $1.1 trillion mark, as all major crypto assets witnessed a sell-off, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum following over the course of the week, trading below the $27,000 and $1,600 levels, respectively.\"\n\n\"Ethereum's performance is at its weakest since March 2023, with its trading value resting above $1,500,\" said Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Mudrex. Ethereum's price fall was steeper as investors reacted to the Ethereum Foundation's bulk sale of the token for operational use.\n\nAccording to the research team of CoinDCX, higher-than-expected US inflation also resulted in a sell-off pressure in the market. US inflation rose 0.4 per cent month-on-month (M-o-M) in September, higher than the expectation of 0.3 per cent.\n\n\"This decline was due to a cautious market mood, influenced by a slightly higher-than-expected inflation report, which led to increased US Treasury rates and a stronger dollar,\" it said.\n\n\"Bitcoin will now need to breach the $26,900 resistance or potentially discover support near $26,500,\" added Patel.\n\nAnother major development, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) under India's presidency, released a joint communique in Marrakech, Morocco. It adopted the roadmap proposed in the Synthesis Paper as a G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets and to collectively mobilise more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support the low and middle-income countries to meet the global challenges.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, the finance ministry said, \"In the spirit of #OneEarthOneFamilyOneFuture and following full consensus by the #G20 members, the fourth #G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors communique was adopted today in #Marrakech, Morocco.\"\n\nIndustry welcomed the development.\n\n\"The adoption of the G20 Roadmap on crypto assets by the FMCBGs represents a progressive stride in fostering international collaboration for the regulation of crypto assets. This comprehensive roadmap can guide and shape global policy, evolve risk-mitigation strategies, and establish adaptable regulations for the dynamic crypto market. It emphasises addressing the distinct challenges encountered by Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, reflecting a forward-looking approach to a rapidly evolving financial landscape,\" said Patel.\n\n\"Ahead of Financial Action Task Force's India mutual evaluation next month, G20's support to global implementation of FATF standards on crypto-assets is welcome,\" added Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEO of CoinSwitch in a post on X (formerly Twitter)."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility, is currently experiencing a downward trend. For the fourth consecutive day, prices have been on a decline, with Ethereum (ETH) hitting a seven-month low, influenced by a hotter-than-expected inflation report. Ethereum\u2019s price plummeted to a staggering low of $1,523, a price not seen since March. Other notable cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) have also experienced a 2%-3% decline. The decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have been the hardest hit, with nearly a 2% drop. Ripple (XRP), Polkadot (DOT), and Samoyedcoin (SAMO) have also felt the market\u2019s turbulence. Amidst this backdrop, a new player emerges, promising a fresh perspective in the crypto realm: ScapesMania.\n\nBut if you set your sights on a much more profitable 2024, is the path as obvious?

The innovative project is currently in presale which means holders can get paid well for the wait. The presale consists of several rounds and the current one offers a huge discount on purchases, nearing 85%. If there\u2019s ever a time to trust the hype, it is now!\n\n>>> Join the Presale at an 83% Discount <<<\n\nThe tokens are low in price, which means that regardless of your budget you can take advantage of the offer. There\u2019s no downside and plenty of potential gains to joining ScapesMania even if you don\u2019t have much money to make use of.\n\nA closer examination of this coin\u2019s features reveals many attractive aspects. For instance, ScaesMania allows holders to get involved with a multi-billion-dollar industry and has many features in place to keep users engaged and incentivize them to keep on engaging.

Considering all of the above, it\u2019s not surprising that the presale numbers are outstanding \u2013 it can surely be a boon to many in the long run.\n\nScapesMania is at the point where previous buyers can already assume they\u2019ve made a great decision and now the time is right for those who haven\u2019t tried the project yet. Get in now to reach potential ROIs of 400-500% or maybe even higher..\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Titan\u2019s Struggle\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH), once the darling of the crypto world, is currently grappling with challenges. With its price plummeting to a seven-month low, the crypto community is rife with speculations and concerns. Investment advisory firm ByteTree has even suggested investors reconsider Ethereum (ETH) weightage in their portfolios, citing its ongoing struggles.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been on a rollercoaster ride, with its recent dip to $1,523 being the lowest since March. Although it has shown signs of recovery, bouncing back to $1,531, it\u2019s still trailing by 1.9% over the last day.\n\nDespite Ethereum (ETH) commendable long-term vision, it\u2019s currently losing its allure as an investment option. Factors such as reduced network revenues from fees, a dwindling number of tokens being burned, and a steady decline in staking yield are exerting bearish pressure on Ethereum (ETH). Given its continued underperformance, it might be wise for investors to recalibrate their exposure to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nRipple (XRP): Rising from the Ashes\n\nRipple (XRP) had its fair share of challenges, especially leading up to 2020. The primary culprit for its decline was negative publicity, largely attributed to the SEC lawsuit. However, the tides have turned post Ripple (XRP) triumphant win against the SEC, not only bolstering its reputation but also elevating the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe technical prowess of Ripple (XRP) is undeniable. Offering cost-effective and swift transactions, it\u2019s gradually being embraced by leading banks and financial institutions.\n\nGiven its recent victory against the SEC and its technological advantages, Ripple (XRP) is poised for a resurgence. The adoption of its technology by major financial players further cements its potential for a bullish future.\n\nSolana (SOL): A Beacon of Speed and Efficiency\n\nSolana (SOL), with its unique architecture, has carved a niche for itself by processing thousands of transactions per second while maintaining minimal costs. Despite facing a decline in its value during the 2022 bear market, Solana (SOL) ecosystem remains one of the most robust in the crypto sector.\n\nThe recent v1.16 upgrade to the Solana (SOL) mainnet has brought about significant enhancements, including improved zero-knowledge proof capabilities. This allows users to transact Solana-based SPL tokens while keeping crucial transaction details, like the amount, confidential. Additionally, the update has optimized RAM usage for Solana (SOL) validators, marking a significant reduction.\n\nWhile not all features of the v1.16 update are active on the Solana (SOL) mainnet, they will be rolled out in phases, prioritizing the more crucial ones. Given these advancements and its already established reputation, Solana (SOL) is poised for growth, making it a promising choice for future investments.\n\nPolkadot (DOT): The Interconnecting Web of Blockchains\n\nOften dubbed as the \u201cinternet of blockchains,\u201d Polkadot (DOT) primary value proposition lies in its ability to connect and secure a network of specialized blockchains. This facilitates interoperability between different blockchains, enabling cross-chain transfer of data or assets.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) native utility token, plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem. It serves multiple core functions, including facilitating network governance, staking for security and operation, and bonding tokens to connect parachains.\n\nGiven its innovative approach to scalability and cross-chain communication, Polkadot (DOT) stands out among its peers.

        "content": "The gripping saga between Ethereum and Bitcoin has seen its highs and lows, twists and turns. And as the plot thickens in 2023, Ethereum\u2019s native token is at a significant 15-month low in comparison to Bitcoin. So, who exactly is edging out whom in this crypto contest? Let\u2019s dive deep.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Skidding Metrics\n\nIt was eyebrow-raising when Ethereum\u2019s price plummeted to a position where it traded alarmingly low against Bitcoin, especially in a week where the ETH/BTC pair stumbled to a distressing 0.056 BTC.\n\nA detailed scrutiny brings to light an unsettling revelation: Ethereum\u2019s price descended below a pivotal benchmark\u2014the 200-week exponential moving average (often visualized as the blue wave).\n\nAs the duo slips past this critical juncture, storm clouds gather, threatening more turbulence for Ethereum as 2023 progresses. Historically, the 200-week EMA has been Ethereum\u2019s safety net.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the pair saw a surge by a whopping 75% just three months after making contact with the wave support around July 2022.\n\nYet, it wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows; the coin faced a harsh reality check with a 25% dip after severing ties with this same support in October 2020.\n\nPeering ahead into 2023, with Ethereum\u2019s recent detachment from its 200-week EMA, there\u2019s a palpable apprehension in the air.\n\nDoomsayers predict another dip, possibly circling the 0.5 Fib line near 0.051 BTC, a downturn of approximately 9.5% from where it stands.\n\nYet, hope springs eternal, and if Ethereum manages to recapture its position at the 200-week EMA, a rebound to the 50-week EMA, visualized as the red wave, might be on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Rise Casting Shadows\n\nBut while Ethereum struggles with its metrics, Bitcoin has been the darling of institutional capital flow. The numbers spell it out loud and clear.\n\nAs of the first week of October, Bitcoin-centric investment pools have seen a lucrative influx of $246 million for the year. Ethereum, in sharp contrast, seems to be on shaky ground with a loss of $104 million during the same timeframe.\n\nEthereum\u2019s wavering position might very well be attributed to the increasing chatter about the possibility of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product getting a nod of approval stateside.\n\nExperts in the trade are leaning into this buzz, hypothesizing a whopping $600 billion inflow upon the product\u2019s launch. Not just that, Bitcoin is gleefully riding the tailwinds of its impending fourth halving, slated for April 24, 2024.\n\nThis anticipated event will curtail the Bitcoin miners\u2019 rewards, taking it down from 6.25 BTC to a mere 3.125 BTC. Historically, such a reduction has proven bullish for Bitcoin, slashing the new supply by half.\n\nAs we navigate the convoluted alleys of cryptocurrency, it\u2019s evident that Ethereum and Bitcoin are on different paths. Ethereum, with its recent stumbles, faces a mountain to climb, especially with Bitcoin\u2019s unabated march forward bolstered by promising institutional interests and future prospects.\n\nThe question is, will Ethereum rally and prove its mettle, or will Bitcoin continue its dominating stride? Only time will spill the secrets of this cryptic tale."
