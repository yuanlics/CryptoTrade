        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2023? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Whichever way you slice it, Ethereum is a good investment in 2023, and it\u2019s virtually impossible to argue against that. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market in terms of market capitalization, and enjoys a lot of popularity in the community thanks to its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem. In addition, whether you\u2019re interested in swapping tokens, lending crypto, collecting NFTs or using stablecoins, chances are that the most exciting developments are happening on Ethereum first.\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is still going strong, not all ETH investors are happy. After all, ETH is down about 66% from its all-time high after crashing in 2022 alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency market. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange, which were the two major crypto industry disasters of 2022, spared almost no cryptocurrency project.\n\nOn the other hand, the current prices can represent a good opportunity to buy ETH if you believe in the Ethereum project\u2019s long-term potential. In fact, Ethereum has put its price potential prominently on the display, starting the year with a massive +37% upswing.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at Ethereum from multiple angles to help you determine if Ethereum is a good investment in 2023 or not.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll begin by listing a variety of reasons why Ethereum might be a good investment in 2023. Of course, we\u2019ll also consider some of the downsides of investing in ETH.\n\nHere\u2019s why Ethereum is considered a good investment\n\nLast September, pretty much every ETH investor and user held its breath as the network underwent its most significant upgrade ever \u2013 the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm \u2013 dubbed \u201cThe Merge\u201d. While the price of ETH plummeted ahead of the upgrade, with investors fearing that it could have an adverse impact on the network, the price quickly recovered after it became obvious that the transition was a total success.\n\nNow, with the uncertainty of the Merge ever more distant in its rearview, there are several reasons that make Ethereum a good investment in 2023, including:\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is increasing\n\nDeflationary pressures are making ETH more valuable\n\nLayer 2 solutions are successfully mitigating Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues\n\nEthereum is retaining its smart contract dominance\n\nInvest in Ethereum\n\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why Ethereum is a good investment in more detail. We\u2019ll also present a case against Ethereum, so that you can get familiar with some of its drawbacks.\n\nA substantial amount of ETH is staked even before withdrawals are enabled\n\nAt the time of writing, 16.4 million ETH, or about 13.6% of the ETH supply, is locked in the staking deposit contract. This is impressive, given that staked ETH currently cannot be withdrawn from the contract. This will only become possible after a future upgrade called Shanghai, which is tentatively planned for March 2023.\n\nThe fact that $27 billion worth of ETH has been staked even before there\u2019s a mechanism to withdraw the coins indicates that Ethereum investors have a lot of confidence in the project\u2019s ability to execute its roadmap.\n\nThe number of staked ETH. Image source: Nansen\n\nThe fact that you can stake ETH is also one reason that can make Ethereum a good investment. If you\u2019re looking to hold your ETH over the long term, you can currently enjoy an APY of about 5.2% on your staked coins. While these are not earth-shattering gains, it\u2019s better than earning no yield at all if you weren\u2019t planning to sell your ETH anyway.\n\nETH has become a much more attractive asset to hold following the Merge\n\nWhen the Merge was close to happening, much of the discussion in the cryptocurrency community (rightly) revolved around Ethereum moving over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. However, there was one aspect of the Merge that perhaps got less attention than it deserves.\n\nPrior to the Merge, the Ethereum protocol issued about 13,000 ETH every day in order to reward miners. With the new Proof-of-Stake system, the protocol only needs to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to provide sufficient incentives to Proof-of-Stake validators to secure the network.\n\nThis change, combined with the EIP-1559 mechanism introduced in 2021, has actually turned ETH into a slightly deflationary cryptocurrency. According to ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by a total of 7,820 ETH following the Merge.\n\nThis deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH has made it a more attractive hold over the long term, as ETH holders effectively no longer need to consider inflation as a factor that could negatively affect the value of their coins.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s not a certainty that ETH will remain deflationary, as this will depend on how much demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. More demand for transactions equals more burned ETH, as the base transaction fees for each transaction are being burned thanks to EIP-1559. While the deflationary aspect is a nice bonus, Ethereum is one of the best long term cryptos to buy, regardless of whether its tokenomics are slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary.\n\nEthereum layer 2s are making good progress\n\nIt\u2019s not secret that the current iteration of Ethereum has major problems with scalability. In 2021, when the crypto market was in the middle of a raging bull run, transaction fees on the Ethereum network skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. At points, users were paying north of $50 just to make a single transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis is obviously not a sustainable situation if Ethereum is to become a widely adopted network. Thankfully, there are several solutions in sight. The Ethereum protocol itself will receive upgrades in the future, most notably sharding, which will allow it to process more transactions while keeping costs lower.\n\nIn addition to improvements on the protocol base layer, there\u2019s also a number of layer 2 scalability solutions that leverage the security of the Ethereum mainnet while processing transactions off-chain to keep costs low.\n\nThere\u2019s already a number of layer 2 platforms for Ethereum available. The most notable examples are Arbitrum One and Optimism, which are both based on optimistic rollup technology. Moving forward, we\u2019ll also see the launch of layer 2s based on zero-knowledge rollups, which promise to provide even bigger efficiency improvements.\n\nEthereum continues to dominate the smart contracts space\n\nThere\u2019s a slew of Ethereum competitors available on the market. Many alternative layer 1 chains have adopted the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), while others like Solana, Cardano and Aptos have taken completely different approaches.\n\nIn any case, no other blockchain has come even close to challenging Ethereum as the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are the main reasons why it tops the list of best altcoins to buy. According to DeFi Llama, Ethereum has a 59.3% market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, according to the TVL (total value locked) metric. The next closest competitor, TRON, has a market share of about 10.8%.\n\nDeFi TVL market share among all blockchains. Image source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe demand for using the Ethereum network is also evident based on the total fees paid to use it. As of early February 2023, users are paying a total of $4.4 million in fees daily for Ethereum transactions, according to data from cryptofees.info. BNB Chain is in second place with a daily average of $590,000 in total daily fees, and Bitcoin comes in third with about $360,000 in fees collected daily.\n\nETH is still down substantially from its all-time high\n\nEven though ETH kicked off 2023 with a rally, the Ethereum price is still down about 66% from its all-time high. This could make ETH a good investment at the moment, as it has already displayed the ability to reach much higher prices in the past. Still, broader positive momentum in the cryptocurrency market will likely be required if you\u2019re questioning whether Ethereum will recover to its previous highs.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s still unclear if ETH has already reached a bottom, or if there\u2019s still lower price levels to explore. ETH, which peaked at around $4,850 in November of 2021, dropped all the way to $1,100 by July 2022. At the time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $1,660, which is not high enough to comfortably call its current cycle low of $1,100 a bottom.\n\nAs a side note, even if Ethereum were to surpass its previous ATH, there is virtually no chance that it could explode by 100x or post similarly impressive gains \u2013 its current market cap is just too large and the growth required to post triple or four digit gains is just not feasible.\n\nDespite being constrained from benefiting from 100x price increases, the 5-year Ethereum average return rate would still net investors an incredibly handsome sum in the span of 10 years, mostly due to the magic of compounding interest. Here\u2019s how a $5,000 investment in Ethereum with a monthly contribution of $100 would fare over the next 10 years, if we take the growth of ETH in the past 5 years as a basis.\n\nA $5,000 investment in Ethereum (with a $100 monthly contribution) in 2023 will grow to nearly $2,000,000 by 2032 if we assume Ethereum\u2019s average 5-year rate of return. Source: Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhat are the cons of Ethereum as an investment?\n\nHopefully, we have demonstrated that Ethereum has a lot going for it as an investment in early 2023. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that buying ETH is a sure bet.\n\nWhile layer 2 solutions promise to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes, they are still in their relatively early stages, with many taking compromises in terms of decentralization. Meanwhile, the Ethereum mainnet is still very expensive to use.\n\nAt the time of writing, a simple token swap will cost about $4.5 in fees, which makes it very difficult to portray Ethereum as a platform that targets a broad audience and enables financial inclusion. In addition, the fees get substantially higher whenever there is a surge in demand.\n\nIn addition, the macroeconomic situation might also not bode well for cryptocurrencies. After all, many economists are predicting a recession to happen in 2023. If these predictions materialize, the cryptocurrency market will be in uncharted territory, as it has never existed amid a global recession\u2014let\u2019s remember that Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and only became a significant asset a few years later.\n\nDepending on the severity of this expected recession, there could be a sell-off in the crypto markets due to investors getting rid of their risky assets, and ETH would undoubtedly also be impacted in such a scenario.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that even though Ethereum is among the most established crypto projects, ETH is still a highly volatile asset when compared to traditional investments. Before buying any cryptocurrency, make sure to carefully consider your financial situation and never invest more than you are willing to lose.\n\nEthereum price prediction in 2023-2024: A new ATH brewing on the horizon?\n\nOur algorithm forecasts Ethereum price to increase by +260% and reach a new ATH in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum will see sideways movement for the majority of 2023. However, the world\u2019s largest altcoin is expected to start mounting a rally late in the year, culminating in a new all-time high of $5,880 in the first half of February 2024.\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction is based on the snapshot of technical indicators in early 2023, with 19 indicators signaling bullish and 11 bearish signals. Keep in mind that the prediction could change considerably going forward if the underlying indicators change.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014the future of Ethereum looks bright, but the macro environment could spoil the party\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cshould I buy Ethereum?\u201d, the current situation might be a good time to do so. As we can see, there are a lot of positive indications for the future of Ethereum that could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\n\nA large number of ETH is being staked even before the launch of withdrawals, EIP-1559 and the Merge have combined to drastically reduce the issuance of ETH, and Ethereum is continuing to dominate the smart contracts sector. In addition, ETH is trading significantly below its all-time highs, which means the current prices could represent an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nStill, the performance of Ethereum could be negatively impacted by the macroeconomic situation, which is looking rather bleak for 2023. If there will indeed be a global recession, it is difficult to expect cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, to perform well.\n\nFor more information, check out our ultimate guide on cryptocurrency investing for useful tips and ideas on how to approach investing in crypto.\n\nInvest in Ethereum"

        "content": "The STARK Prover software application, which aims to enable the Ethereum blockchain platform to scale, will be made open source, according to an announcement on Sunday at the StarkWare Sessions 2023 event in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe STARK Prover \u2014 to be known as the \u201cStarknet Prover\u201d once it goes open-source \u2014 is an engine that generates cryptographic proofs which very efficiently compresses hundreds of thousands of transactions for submission to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark moment for scaling Ethereum, and in a wider sense for cryptography.\u201d Eli Ben-Sasson\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark moment for scaling Ethereum, and in a wider sense for cryptography,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder at StarkWare, and co-inventor of STARK cryptography. \u201cWe think of the Prover as the magic wand of STARK technology. It wondrously generates the proofs that allow unimaginable scaling. But of course, it\u2019s not actually magic, it\u2019s sturdy cryptography and today we\u2019re saying that everyone who wants should make it their own. They should know exactly how it works, modify the code, edit the code and distribute it further.\u201d\n\nWhat is Zero Knowledge Proof?\n\nThe Starknet Prover utilizes Zero Knowledge Proof technology in order to make Ethereum scaling possible. Zero Knowledge Proof is a concept in cryptography where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know specific information or have a specific attribute, without revealing the actual information or attribute itself.\n\nThis is important because it allows for the verification of sensitive information in a secure and private manner, preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the information being verified. Zero-knowledge proofs have numerous potential applications, including secure passwordless authentication, private transactions and data sharing. Eli Ben-Sasson, President and co-founder at StarkWare, and co-inventor of STARKs. (credit: Oli Freuler)\n\nThe difficulty in scaling\n\nScaling the Ethereum network is difficult because its current design limits the number of transactions that can be processed per second, leading to high levels of congestion and slow transaction speeds.\n\nZero-knowledge proof technology can help scale Ethereum by allowing for more efficient and secure verification of transactions without revealing sensitive information. In a traditional blockchain, every node in the network needs to validate and store every transaction, which can lead to slow speeds and high storage requirements as the network grows.\n\nWith zero-knowledge proofs, transactions can be verified using a proof that provides sufficient evidence of the validity of the transaction without revealing any private data. This means that transactions can be validated more quickly and with less storage, reducing the burden on the network and enabling it to process more transactions per second.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum, zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 such as those provided by Starkware\u2019s Prover \u2014 can be used to verify the validity of smart contract transactions, enabling the network to scale without sacrificing security or privacy. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed, zero-knowledge proofs can help Ethereum to handle a larger number of transactions and support a growing number of decentralized applications. Advertisement\n\n\u201cEvery step we take to provide infrastructure and to make it accessible and decentralized, is a catalyst for devs to build,\u201d said Ben-Sasson. \u201cThe quicker and more broadly they build, the faster we\u2019ll see mass onboarding to solutions that truly enable people to manage their own funds. So there\u2019s a direct line between open-sourcing key tech and popularizing self-custody.\u201d"

The 20-day exponential moving average ($22,436) is also located in this zone, hence the buyers are expected to defend the zone with all their might.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the edge. If the price turns up from the support zone, the bulls will again attempt to catapult the BTC/USDT pair to $25,000. This level should act as a formidable resistance.\n\nOn the downside, a break below the support zone could trigger several stop losses and that may start a deeper pullback. The pair could first drop to $21,480 and if this support also fails to hold up, the next stop may be the 50-day simple moving average ($19,572).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel but the RSI has been forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening. A break and close below the channel could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could then fall toward $21,480.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the support line of the channel, the bulls will again attempt to kick the pair above the channel. If they manage to do that, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nETH/USDT\n\nEther (ETH) has been trading near the $1,680 resistance for the past few days. Usually, a tight consolidation near an overhead resistance resolves to the upside.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile the upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,586) indicates advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls may be losing their grip. If bulls want to assert their dominance, they will have to propel and sustain the price above $1,680.\n\nIf they do that, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $1,800. This level may again act as a resistance but if bulls do not allow the price to dip below $1,680, the rally may stretch to $2,000.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could tumble to $1,500. This is an important support level to monitor because a bounce here could keep the pair range-bound between $1,500 and $1,680. On the other hand, if the $1,500 support cracks, the pair may dive to $1,352.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA. This is the first indication that the bulls may take a step back. There is minor support at the 50-SMA but if it fails to hold, the pair may slide to $1,550 and then to $1,500.\n\nConversely, if the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will again attempt to thrust the pair above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the pair may resume the uptrend.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are well below their all-time high, OKB (OKB) hit a new high on Feb. 5. This suggests that bulls are in command.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSome traders may book profits near the overhead resistance of $44.35 as it may act as a formidable resistance. If the price turns down from the current level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($37), it will suggest that bulls continue to buy the dips.\n\nThat could increase the possibility of a break above $45. The OKB/USDT pair could first skyrocket to $50 and thereafter to $58.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the traders may be rushing to the exit. The pair could then drop to $34 and later to the 50-day SMA ($30).\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to protect the $44.35 level. The pair could turn down and reach the moving averages, which is an important support to keep an eye on. If the price bounces off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to overcome the barrier at $45 and start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nContrarily, if the price breaks below the 50-SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may slump to $36 and then to $34. Such a move could delay the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nRelated: Fantom\u2019s 5-week winning streak is in danger \u2014 Will FTM price lose 35%?\n\nALGO/USDT\n\nAlgorand\u2019s (ALGO) recovery reached the breakdown level of $0.27 on Feb. 3. The bears defended this level but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls expect the relief rally to continue.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.24) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price turns up from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break above $0.27 increases. The ALGO/USDT pair could then travel to $0.31 where the bears may try to offer strong resistance.\n\nIf the price turns down from this level but bounces off $0.27, it will suggest that the downtrend could be over in the short term. The pair could then attempt a rally to $0.38.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the pair turns down from the current level and slides below $0.23. The pair could then dive to the 50-day SMA ($0.21).\n\nALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are guarding the $0.27 level but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to stay below the 50-SMA. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle. If they do that, the pair could pick up momentum and surge toward $0.31.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues and breaks below the moving averages, the pair risks a drop to $0.23. The bears will have to smash this support to gain the upper hand.\n\nTHETA/USDT\n\nTheta Network (THETA) successfully completed a retest of the breakout level on Feb. 1, indicating that bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $1.20. This level may act as a minor hurdle but if bulls do not give up much ground from $1.20, the THETA/USDT pair could extend its up-move to $1.34. This is an important level for the bears to defend because if this resistance crumbles, the pair could soar to $1.65.\n\nIf bears want to stop the bulls, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then fall to $0.97 and later to the 50-day SMA ($0.89).\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off the $0.97 level, which becomes an important level to watch out for on the downside. A breach of this level is likely to tilt the advantage in favor of the bears and open the doors for a possible drop to $0.85.\n\nThe rally is facing resistance near $1.20 but the upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push the price above $1.20, the momentum should pick up for a rally toward $1.34.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Will Ethereum Rivals Survive? Solana Creator Anatoly Yakovenko Details Crypto Outlook for Next 12 to 18 Months - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Solana (SOL) creator Anatoly Yakovenko is laying out a prediction for crypto markets for the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nIn a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Yakovenko says while there may be challenging macroeconomic conditions ahead, it likely won\u2019t stop an unprecedented wave of innovation from hitting the crypto space.\n\nYakovenko warns that if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to draw down inflation it could drive investment away from the less established blockchain projects like Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a big question for probably all of the smart contract platforms except for Ethereum: Are we going to be in a high-interest rate environment for the next five years where all the riskier bets get squeezed down and there\u2019s no traction?\n\nThat means that there\u2019s nothing for Solana to do that\u2019s useful to the world that Ethereum doesn\u2019t cover, even if Solana is 100 times faster. Even if we do more transactions than all the Ethereum [layer-2s] combined. They\u2019re not providing enough value to the world in that environment, if they\u2019re not, that means it\u2019s not going to survive. Now that\u2019s like the big if and that I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019 for crypto. What is crypto doing right now that is so crucial to the world that it can\u2019t live without it?\u201d\n\nHowever, Yakovenko says he is optimistic about Solana\u2019s future. He says that even if there is an economic downturn, Solana\u2019s market share of non-fungible token (NFT) projects would create enough value to sustain the project.\n\n\u201cThis is like if I put on my worst bear hat and everything\u2019s going to sh*t, interest rates are at 10%, is the Web3 NFT business model [going to] survive? I think so. And if that\u2019s true, I think Solana survives.\u201d\n\nYakovenko predicts innovation in the crypto space will surge at a pace never seen before, helping the sector successfully navigate through choppy economic times.\n\n\u201cI feel like way more bullish now than 2018, 2019. There\u2019s so much funding that\u2019s still happening in crypto. There\u2019s so many smart young people that are not joining the big companies and building awesome products.\n\nMy guess is if you looked at all the product launches from the inception of crypto to now to what\u2019s going to happen in the next 12 to 18 months, then the next 12 to 18 months is probably going to be way more than everything else combined up to this point. And if people are launching products, they\u2019re grinding for product market fit, they\u2019re going to get users, it means crypto is going to survive.\u201d\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Polygon NFTs on Opensea Outshine Ethereum Once Again\n\nAccording to data from the Dune Dashboard, the number of unique Polygon NFTs sold on OpenSea has overtaken the number of Ethereum-based collectibles for the past two months in a row.\n\nSince December, when OpenSea handled the sale of 1.3 million NFTs in comparison to the 1 million NFTs that were sold on Ethereum, this pattern has persisted unabated. OpenSea reported the sale of more than 1.5 million NFTs on the Polygon layer 2 chain in the month of January, while the Ethereum mainnet reported sales of more than 1.1 million NFTs through the same market.\n\nThe exponential growth of Defi and NFTs on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in increased transaction volumes, causing network clogging and skyrocketing gas fees during peak usage times. Basically, every transaction on a blockchain network requires paying a certain amount of gas, a unit of measure used to calculate transaction fees. These fees have led to a search for alternative solutions such as Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche, which offer lower transaction costs and provide more efficient chains to host high volume NFT collections.\n\nThanks to its partnerships with well-known companies like Reddit, Polygon\u2019s NFT market is experiencing a surge in adoption. Despite the crypto market downturn, the number of first-time and returning buyers in Polygon\u2019s NFT market hit record highs in December 2022, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.\n\nAlmost 1 billion successful transactions were processed on the @0xPolygon blockchain last year\u26a1\ufe0f Check out this @DuneAnalytics dashboard reviewing Polygon in 2022\ud83d\udcca \ud83d\udccdhttps://t.co/XOPURG8LH4 pic.twitter.com/D3uFQ1uf3b \u2014 James (@JamesT0lan) February 5, 2023\n\nPolygon Rise as a Destination for Gaming NFTs and Affordable Collectibles\n\nAccording to recent analysis, Polygon outperformed Ethereum by a small margin. However, the number of traders on the Ethereum still exceeds that of Polygon, with Ethereum having 319,641 traders and Polygon reporting 224,719.\n\nEven though Polygon has sold more non-fungible tokens than Ethereum since the start of the year, Ethereum still has a much higher traded value overall. On OpenSea, Ethereum trades in January were worth about $446 million, while Polygon NFT sales were only worth $15.4 million. In the last 7 days according to the data from Cryptoslam, Ethereum has had $179 million of sales while Polygon has only $2 million sales.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t the first time that the total number of monthly Polygon NFT sales has surpassed Ethereum. Late 2021 and early 2022 saw a similar rise in sales, but then the number of Polygon sales dropped until just recently. Most of the most popular and expensive NFTs, like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, are still on Ethereum, which has a lot more trading volume than Polygon. However, the sidechain network is gaining traction as a destination for gaming NFTs and low-cost collectibles, which could help drive broader NFT adoption by reaching a larger audience.\n\nWant more?

        "title": "Liquid Staking Derivatives On Ethereum - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum are going strong. Lido Finance started this trend, but others have entered the playing field. Of all staked Ethereum, liquid staking providers stake almost 40%. That is over six million staked ETH out of 16 million.\n\nTherefore, we are showing you four different liquid staking players for Ethereum. Each has a different philosophy, which we will explain. As a basis, we use a Blockwork Research article.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives continue to be at the front of the market as the Shanghai hard fork nears. When ETH withdrawals open, price action for ETH could go either way\u2026 \ud83d\udc40 Here's the full scoop on LSDs \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/uNOwgwofeE \u2014 Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) January 31, 2023\n\nWhat Are Liquid Staking Derivatives?\n\nTo explain liquid staking derivatives (LSD), I will explain two things briefly.\n\nThe first one is liquid staking. This is a simple idea. You stake tokens from project \u201cX.\u201d Generally, a project will lock these staked tokens. In other words, you receive yield, but you can\u2019t do anything else with this token.\n\nHowever, with liquid staking, project \u201cX\u201d will give you a new token after you stake with them. This is the derivative, the liquid staking token. It\u2019s also the second thing I want to explain. A derivative is a financial instrument backed by an underlying asset. In this case, the underlying asset is your staked token. It represents the value of your staked assets.\n\nNow you can use his liquid token in DeFi. You can get more yield by adding it to a pool or staking it again. On the other hand, you can also sell these tokens and get liquid again. To clarify, the owner of the liquid staking tokens can redeem the staked tokens. Thus, we have two tokens. The native token that you stake and the liquid staking token. Or, in other words, the derivative. The picture below shows the four different protocols we will discuss. It shows all the different and important aspects.\n\nLido Finance\n\nThe Lido Finance derivative is stETH. It was the first LSD that saw real adoption. They have a 29% stake (pardon the pun) in all staked ETH. Lido has deep liquidity. Furthermore, you can use their stETH in many DeFi protocols. They are, without a doubt, the leaders of all Ethereum-based LSD providers.\n\nLido takes a 10% commission on all staking yield. This is good and healthy for their DAO. The DAO receives 5% while the node operators share the other 5%.\n\nHowever, on the downside, their staking share is so big, it worries plenty of people. Lido has a fair share of control over the governance with their number of allotted votes. In turn, this can jeopardize Ethereum\u2019s decentralization. The picture below shows Lido\u2019s share of LSDs.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase didn\u2019t launch their LSD until August 2022. One of the reasons for launching was Lido\u2019s dominance. As explained before, Lido may jeopardize the decentralization aspect. In this short time frame, Coinbase managed to get 7% of the total market share. That\u2019s a whopping 1.1 million ETH. Their liquid token is the cbETH.\n\nHowever, they charge the most of all LSD providers, a steep 25%. Nonetheless, through their CEX, they find enough takers. This also puts them on a different playing field compared to DeFi. That\u2019s where all their competitors are active. In the centralized exchange space, they hardly have any competition at all.\n\nThe downside of this is that they have limited on-chain liquidity. Furthermore, their cbETH token doesn\u2019t have a lot of utility in DeFi. They attract non-savvy crypto investors and institutions. Coinbase also keeps custody over their LSD derivatives. On the upside of this, you can argue that they are the most regulated exchange. They\u2019re also based in the United States.\n\nEnterprise-grade liquid staking is coming. Learn how @CoinbaseCloud and @Figment_io are teaming up with @alluvialfinance to build a multi-chain liquid staking solution. pic.twitter.com/IiDWZuKK7J \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@coinbase) May 27, 2022\n\nRocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool already launched their LSD in September 2021. They are the most decentralized option of all the providers we discuss here. To clarify, they use independent node operators to pair their rETH depositors with. As of February 1, 2023, they staked 379,000 ETH, which is 2% of the total staked ETH.\n\nRocket Pool currently uses 2,045 node operators. They use 16 ETH from depositors, and the chosen validator posts the other 16 ETH. As you may know, to become an ETH validator, you need to stake 32 ETH.\n\nFurthermore, validators must add a minimum of 10% of their 16 ETH stake as collateral. This acts as insurance in case they get slashed. The node operators take a 15% commission. The collateral is in RPL, Rocket Pool\u2019s token. That\u2019s where Rocket Pool makes its money.\n\nA new $rETH DeFi integration has just landed \u2013 you can now earn interest on $rETH deposits or borrow $ETH & $XAI against it as collateral up to 80% LTV with @SiloFinance! Check out Silo's risk-isolating bridge asset design: https://t.co/keHb8e5ehr pic.twitter.com/l2ImTKNm21 \u2014 Rocket Pool (@Rocket_Pool) February 1, 2023\n\nFrax\n\nFrax has a dual token design. As a result, they can offer the highest yield, at around 8%. They offer a liquidity pool on Curve with frxETH/ETH or stake frxETH as sfrxETH. However, note that the liquidity pool rewards are in CVX, CRV, or FXS, but not in ETH. You will only earn staking rewards if you stake sfrxETH.\n\nFrax currently has close to 1,900 validators. Three months ago, they started with zero frxETH, and now they already have 81,000 frxETH. The picture below shows their UI for frxETH.\n\nSource: Frax UI\n\nConclusion\n\nThe market for liquid staking is growing fast. Many providers are offering their services. If you\u2019re looking for high yield, frxETH/sfrxETH is the clear winner. On the other hand, Rocket Pool might be your pick if you seek decentralized options. Lido and its stETH token offer the most liquidity and the best DeFi options. However, their dominance among LSD providers can be a potential problem. Coinbase services institutions and non-savvy crypto users. But, be aware of their 25% commission.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Governance tokens of liquid staking derivatives continue to outpace other digital assets as anticipation for Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade grows.\n\nShanghai, expected to launch sometime next month, is set to allow validators to withdraw staked ether from the Beacon Chain \u2014 some of which has been locked up for over three years.\n\nAssociated protocols and assets representing staked ETH are outgunning most other digital assets on the day, as well as on a year-to-date basis.\n\nLiquid staking solution Lido DAO (LDO) clinched a near 9% gain as of 7 pm ET. Frax Share (FXS) \u2014 the governance token of the Frax ecosystem behind frxETH \u2014 and staking pool Rocket Pool (RPL) were up 20% and 6%, respectively.\n\nIn year-to-date terms, LDO, FXS and RPL are up between 100% and 190%. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were down roughly 1% on the day and are each up roughly 35% so far in 2023.\n\nAs a result of the upgrade, tokens representing staked ETH will have the ability to achieve better price parity with ETH, making people more likely to trust them and hold on to them, according to Blockworks Research analyst Ryan West.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the supply of [liquid staking derivatives] already grow 5% since the start of 2023, with some versions growing more than others, such as frxETH growing 74% and rETH (Rocketpool) growing 10%,\u201d he said.\n\nMarket expectations are punting on the basis that the supply of liquid staking derivatives will continue to grow after the upgrade as there is a greater trust in the tokens to stay in line with ETH\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cThe liquid staking protocols sit in a unique position, where they can give their users withdrawals much quicker than the Ethereum protocol processes validator withdrawals,\u201d West said.\n\nThis is because the protocol typically has ETH that is constantly coming in through new deposits and from staking rewards that can satisfy withdrawals in the short term, he added.\n\nLido has revealed its plans for withdrawal processing, estimating a window of 28 to 48 hours for completion, unlike the Ethereum protocol which could take several weeks.\n\nThis is due to a steady influx of ETH from new deposits and staking rewards that enable Lido to fulfill short-term withdrawal requests, West said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Aave CEO: New Security Upgrades 'Silo the Risk Away' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFirst proposed in November 2021, Aave\u2019s latest upgrade is finally here.\n\nLaunched earlier this month, V3 of the DeFi lending protocol has already raked in more than $143 million across the first seven assets listed.\n\nThough the asset list is far shorter than the previous iteration, the project\u2019s founder and CEO Stani Kulechov says this upgrade is all about managing risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe DeFi space itself has been growing significantly, so we\u2019ve seen more and more value at stake,\u201d said the founder. \u201cBecause of that, and especially with the DeFi summer explosion in 2020, what we wanted to do is to create a version of the Aave protocol that basically has different kinds of security features, ensuring that the risk management is as optimized as possible for the community.\u201d\n\nNew features like Isolation Mode, for example, will let the protocol safely onboard what Kulechov calls long-tail assets without putting the entire protocol at risk. These would be tokens that have low liquidity, subjecting them to extreme volatility.\n\nAssets added in Isolation Mode have a specific debt ceiling and can only be used to borrow stablecoins, which are defined by the Aave governance community. A debt ceiling refers to exactly how much money can be borrowed using these kinds of long-tail assets as collateral. With this update, Kulechov says the protocol \u201ccan silo the risk away.\u201d\n\nAfter the security optimization, the latest upgrade is also introducing a new portal feature that will let users move assets across different markets on different blockchains. \"In the portal feature, you can move assets from Ethereum to Polygon, Polygon, to, let's say, Avalanche, pretty much instantly,\" he said.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting feature is one will let Ethereum bulls lever their bets using so-called liquid staking derivatives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHigh-efficiency lending and borrowing\n\nEthereum has emerged as the largest market ($59 million) on Aave\u2019s latest upgrade, but shortly after comes Lido Finance\u2019s Staked Ethereum (stETH) ($54 million).\n\nBy depositing Ethereum into Lido, you can earn a yield (sourced from validators securing the proof-of-stake network) and you also receive that stETH token as a sort of receipt for your deposit. You can then use that stETH elsewhere in the world of DeFi to keep earning your yield.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only version of staked Ethereum, either; in fact, there\u2019s a whole index that\u2019s batched all these assets together. Collectively, the crypto community has called these tokens liquid staking derivatives or LSDs, and they\u2019ve attracted a huge amount of attention since Ethereum executed the merge last September.\n\nNow, thanks to Aave\u2019s latest upgrade, you can take this same bet even further using the protocol\u2019s new High-Efficiency Mode. This mode lets users lend and borrow like-pegged assets such as various stablecoins or staked Ethereum products.\n\n\u201cThat LSD represents the value of what you staked and you can actually rehypothecate the value by using it as collateral,\u201d Kulechov told Decrypt.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Deposit your Ethereum in Lido Finance to receive stETH; use that stETH to borrow more Ethereum on Aave; restake the Ethereum on Lido and repeat the cycle. This kind of crypto-finance voodoo is also referred to as capital efficiency.\n\nThis is especially interesting for users when faced with a bear market. Instead of selling your holdings and incurring a loss, said Kulechov, you can borrow against them.\n\n\u201cWhen the market trend is going upwards, they might actually use to borrow with their collateral more, like stablecoins or ETH, and buy a specific asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey leverage their holdings based on the market cycle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd as this trade emerges, Kulechov suspects that it\u2019s going be quite trendy moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a proposal from the Coinbase team to list the cbETH, which is Coinbase\u2019s staking derivative,\u201d he said. \u201cThat allows you to be more capital efficient with the staking assets that you might have as a user.\u201d\n\nJudging by the current results of the proposal, a whopping 99% approval, users appear eager to onboard the asset as soon as possible."

        "content": "Payment company Visa is seeking to build \u201cmuscle memory\u201d around settlements, with plans to allow customers to convert digital assets to fiat currencies on its platform, according to a presentation from the company\u2019s crypto division head at StarkWare Sessions 2023.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments from issuers in USDC starting on Ethereum and paying out in USDC (USDC) on Ethereum. So, these are large value settlement payments,\u201d Cuy Sheffield said during a fireside chat at the event. Cointelegraph\u2019s team is on the ground in Tel Aviv covering the two-day Ethereum community conference.\n\nAccording to the executive, global settlement with digital assets and fiat currencies is one of the avenues that Visa is investing in. He specifically stated:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been one of the areas where we want to build muscle memory. The same way that we can convert between dollars in euros on a cross-border transaction, we should be able to convert between digital tokenized dollars and traditional dollars.\u201d\n\nThe payment giant has been exploring how to incorporate blockchain technology into its existing network to move money faster, but settlements still take place on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT system, a not-for-profit cooperative society formed by European bankers with the purpose of facilitating secure and standardized transaction communication between its members.\n\n. @cuysheffield and @visa have fell into the rabbit hole of Account Abstraction!\n\n\n\nThis is huge! pic.twitter.com/CFniLLBq5C \u2014 Starknet-Ecosystem.com \u2728 (@StarkNetEco) February 5, 2023\n\n\u201cWe set all over Swift, so we can\u2019t move money as frequently as we\u2019d like because there are a number of limitations that exist in those networks. And so, we\u2019ve been experimenting, we publicly announced. We\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments [with stablecoins],\u201d Sheffield explained.\n\nRecently speaking at Visa\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, former CEO Al Kelly briefly shared the firm\u2019s plans for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins, claiming that \u201cstablecoins and central bank digital currencies have the potential to play a meaningful role in the payments space, and we have a number of initiatives underway.\u201d\n\nSheffield confirmed the company\u2019s view of blockchain technology and digital assets. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking a lot about how to take some of the value that Visa provides on existing bank rails, with existing forms of beyond in a rebuild that on top of blockchain rails, using stable boards. If we think there are huge opportunities in that area, it just kind of stays on emerging.\""

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roofstock , the leading digital real estate platform specializing in single-family rental (SFR) properties, today announced the sale of an Alabama rental property via a non-fungible token (NFT) enabled by Roofstock onChain (ROC), its web3 subsidiary. Unlike commemorative NFTs that are used as a marketing tactic to sell homes, ROC uses the technology to settle real estate transactions via an NFT marketplace on the Ethereum Blockchain built by Origin Protocol , a web3 pioneer bringing real world NFT use cases to the market. Teller Protocol provides flexible, asset-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending options, with real estate lending accessible through USDC.Homes , a real estate financing marketplace powered by the Teller Protocol.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoing from our first sale in South Carolina to our second sale in Alabama in just a few months has proven that the model is scalable across different real estate markets,\u201d said Geoff Thompson, Chief Blockchain Officer at Roofstock onChain. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue innovating in the real estate industry by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. Buyers and sellers can benefit from instantaneous sale and settlement of rental properties, with flexible asset-based DeFi leverage options, all while maintaining transparency and security in the transaction process,\u201d added Sanjay Raghavan, Head of web3 Initiatives at Roofstock onChain.\n\nROC facilitates instantaneous sale and settlement of single-family rental (SFR) properties listed on its NFT marketplace powered by Origin Protocol\u2019s NFT arm Story. Located in Harvest, Alabama, the home is among the first property sales to happen on a blockchain via NFTs. Utilizing blockchain technology enables properties to be purchased more efficiently and transparently, compared to conventional residential real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cNon-fungible tokens are quickly gaining fresh utility while most of the world is no longer watching. As decentralized solutions begin impacting traditional industries to a greater degree, users will begin adopting the technology to reap the benefits of NFTs. In the case of real estate, transactions will become much cheaper, more transparent, and far quicker through the use of blockchain,\u201d said Matthew Liu, co-founder of Origin Protocol.\n\nRoofstock onChain links home ownership to non-fungible tokens by holding each property in a limited liability company. The LLC is then wrapped in an NFT on Ethereum, dubbed a \u201cunique Home onChain.\u201d From financing to title ownership, the entire transaction happened peer-to-peer on Ethereum. Non-fungible token transfers allow for seamless and transparent transactions on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nTeller Protocol has enabled DeFi liquidity providers to provide leverage for this NFT property purchase. Buyers can seek a loan for up to 80% loan-to-value of the sale price of the NFT with USDC Homes , a DeFi lending marketplace built on the Teller Protocol. USDC Homes is not affiliated with Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC). USDC Homes partners with a network of underwriters and data providers to verify identity and provide creditworthiness reviews for lenders.\n\nBorrowers can use Teller to raise a loan request and finance the purchase of a Home onChain through USDC Homes. Once a lender funds the borrower\u2019s request, the USDC Homes protocol permissionlessly uses funds to purchase the LLC NFT. The NFT is then transferred to a smart contract escrow vault until the borrower pays back the entire loan plus interest.\n\nAbout Roofstock onChain\n\nRoofstock onChain is the web3 subsidiary of Roofstock, the leading digital real estate investing platform for the $4 trillion single-family rental home sector. Using blockchain technology, Roofstock onChain provides investors the ability to purchase tokenized single family rental properties with one click, and to transact with crypto, cutting the time and cost incurred by legacy systems.\n\nRoofstock provides extensive resources for investors to actively participate in the SFR space, including data analytics, connections to property management companies and contractors, and other management tools. Founded in 2015, Roofstock has facilitated more than $5 billion in investment transactions to date.\n\nTo learn more or to get started with Roofstock onChain, please visit onchain.roofstock.com.\n\nAbout Origin Protocol\n\nFounded in 2017, Origin Protocol is a web3 pioneer developing innovative products in the crypto industry\u2019s fastest growing verticals of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Origin\u2019s NFT platform, Origin Story , the platform\u2019s NFT product, has powered NFT sales like 3LAU's $11.7M record-breaking music sale, the Charlie Bit My Finger viral video sale that generated global headlines, Paris Hilton\u2019s iconic \u201cPast Lives, New Beginnings\u201d series drop, and many more. Origin has worked with top NFT creators like Trevor Jones and Alotta Money as well as brands like Rolling Stones and Inspiration4/SpaceX, in addition to developing branded marketplaces for beloved NFT collections, including Pudgy Penguins and Karafuru.\n\nAbout Teller Protocol\n\nTeller Protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial lending book that allows users to lend and borrow any crypto asset with no price-based liquidation. Teller brings forth the first use case of on-chain credit in DeFi, which gives liquidity providers insights into wallet repayment probability which then allows yields above money market rates.

        "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies have gained popularity as more investors have turned to them to diversify their portfolios. It\u2019s a great time to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and meme tokens like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) now that the cryptocurrency market is rebounding.\n\nThese coins give investors the chance to earn large profits at comparatively little risk. Additionally, they provide a degree of protection and privacy that conventional investments do not. This is a great time for investors to consider investing in these currencies since the cryptocurrency market is recovering. If you get in at the right time, these cryptocurrencies could make you a crypto millionaire! Let\u2019s take a look at some of these coins.\n\nEthereum: Smart, Scalable, and Secure\n\nEthereum is becoming an increasingly popular investment option (ETH). And with good reason! Ethereum offers a safe, decentralised platform for creating blockchain applications. Ethereum, an open-source, publicly accessible distributed computing platform based on a blockchain, supports smart contracts. It offers a variety of benefits and features that make it a popular option for investors trying to diversify their portfolios.\n\nDue to its inexpensive transactions, short transaction times, and high scalability, Ethereum may become one of the most in-demand assets very soon. Investing in Ethereum can provide investors with several advantages, including improved liquidity, larger returns on investment, and increased security. Ethereum is likely to continue to rank among the top cryptocurrencies in the future.\n\nBitcoin: The Best Store Of Value On The Market\n\nDue to its long-term development potential as a store of value, Bitcoin is growing in popularity as an investment option. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has developed into the most valued cryptocurrency. Investors look at Bitcoin as a viable long-term investment due to the potential for significant financial returns over time.\n\nBitcoin is extremely alluring as it is decentralised, meaning no one entity controls it or has the power to affect its value. This makes it a desirable substitute for conventional investments, which are usually susceptible to factors such as government influence.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: A Big Cat For Big Gains\n\nA brand-new meme token called Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is making waves in the scene right now. It was created on the Ethereum network, and to increase the amount of money flowing into the DeFi ecosystem, it promotes DeFi and strives to increase consumer knowledge of the DeFi market.\n\nThe preservation of the oceans is one of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s main objectives. Big Eyes Coin keeps 5% of all tokens in a transparent charity wallet that will be donated to organisations that support ocean conservation.\n\nUse the coupon code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to receive a 200% bonus on your purchases. However, make sure you act quickly, as the code expires on February 3rd!\n\nGiven that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are quickly emerging from the most recent bear market, now is the time to invest in brand-new meme tokens like Big Eyes Coin (BIG). Getting into these cryptocurrencies now that their value is moving upwards could be a way to make yourself a crypto millionaire. As always, ensure you conduct thorough research before buying into any asset.

        "title": "Arbitrum Airdrop Guide - Benzinga",
        "content": "Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that is taking the crypto community by storm with hints of a potential upcoming Arbitrum token airdrop. With its unique set of off-chain and on-chain executions, Arbitrum strives to provide lightning-fast and cost-effective transactions.\n\nIn recent months, Arbitrum has picked up considerable momentum, with increased liquidity flowing to the network. Rumors are circulating about a potential Arbitrum crypto airdrop in the near future.\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum scaling solution about half the size of Arbitrum, conducted the first stage of its airdrop in mid-2022, airdropping an average airdrop of 777 Optimism tokens per wallet (roughly $500 at the time). Given Arbitrum\u2019s superior size to Optimism, there is no telling how lucrative an Arbitrum airdrop could be. For example, owners of Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were airdropped tens of thousands of dollars worth of $APE.\n\nAlthough there have been no official announcements yet, several key reasons could explain why an Arbitrum airdrop is more than likely. The following article will explore the Arbitrum ecosystem and the likelihood of an airdrop \u2014 discussing strategies that could increase your chances of eligibility.\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Show More\n\nWhat is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 solution that seeks to address the network congestion, poor efficiency and higher transaction fees on Ethereum \u2014 the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the world.\n\nArbitrum improves the capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts through a method called optimistic rollup, a type of data compression technique for blockchain transactions that roll up batches of transactions into a single transaction.\n\nThe benefit of this technique is that blockchains only need to verify one transaction \u2014 the rolled-up transaction \u2014 instead of having to confirm each individual transaction that is part of the rollup. This process improves efficiency, as the blockchain only needs to confirm one transaction, avoiding the need to wait while numerous transactions are validated at once.\n\nAlthough this process takes place on a separate layer to boost speed and scalability, Arbitrum leverages the security provided by the Ethereum mainnet. All validated transactions on Arbitrum are moved back to Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum vs. Other Blockchain Networks\n\nArbitrum is designed to provide a user-friendly platform that developers can work in to launch highly scalable and efficient Ethereum-compatible decentralized applications (dApps). However, it\u2019s not the first platform seeking to overcome Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nNotable competitors include Polygon, Optimism and Metis, among others. The following features separate Arbitrum from the rest.\n\nHigh EVM Compatibility\n\nArbitrum is widely regarded as one of the most EVM-compatible rollups. It\u2019s compatible with the EVM at the bytecode level and any language that can compile to EVM such as Solidity and Vyper.\n\nMarket Leader\n\nIn early February 2023, Arbitrum has the highest total value locked (TVL) out of all Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. Arbitrum takes the slight edge on Polygon with a TVL of $1.76 billion (3.52% of industry TVL) compared to Polygon\u2019s $1.22 billion TVL.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) All Chain - DeFi Llama\n\nSupporting a higher TVL than Polygon is no small feat. Polygon is a top 10 crypto by market capitalization with a market cap of $13 billion. For comparison, the next largest Layer 2, Optimism has a market cap of $650 million.\n\nWell-Developed Ecosystem\n\nArbitrum is already collaborating with a vast range of Ethereum dApps and infrastructure projects, including Uniswap, Sushi, DODO and dozens of others.\n\nWill There Be an Arbitrum Airdrop?\n\nAs of January 2023, no official plans have been announced for an Arbitrum cryptocurrency airdrop. However, here are a few compelling reasons why an Arbitrum airdrop is likely.\n\nAlthough Ethereum Layer 2 networks do not need a native token to operate, many other Layer 2 projects have launched their own tokens to facilitate governance and other use cases. A few notable examples include:\n\nPolygon\n\nOptimism\n\nMetis\n\nLoopring\n\nOn April 20, 2022, the same day that the Optimism airdrop was announced, Steven Goldfeder from Arbitrum tweeted the following message:\n\nAnother key reason why Arbitrum may launch a token airdrop is to reward its early adopters and repeat users. This strategy has been employed by several successful cryptocurrency projects, including Uniswap, a top 20 crypto by market capitalization.\n\nArbitrum AirDrop Guide\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to guarantee that you will be eligible for Arbitrum airdrop \u2014 if there even is one. However, several strategies can improve your chances of eligibility. These strategies focus on maximizing your activity, consistency and reach across the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n1. Purchase Ethereum\n\nThe first step you need to take for your best chance at an airdrop is to acquire ETH \u2014 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. ETH is used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\nEthereum can be purchased through a centralized crypto exchange such as Coinbase, Uphold or KuCoin. After you have acquired ETH, you transfer it to your software wallet of choice.\n\nEnsure that your chosen software wallet supports ETH or runs on the Ethereum mainnet. MetaMask \u2014 an Ethereum-compatible wallet that connects to hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps) \u2014 is a great choice.\n\n2. Connect Arbitrum to MetaMask\n\nTo see ETH in your wallet, add the Arbitrum network to MetaMask (or your other chosen software wallet). This is an extremely easy step.\n\nIn the case of MetaMask, the easiest way to connect to Arbitrum is to use the one-click method. To do so, visit the Arbitrum Bridge website and click on Add/Switch to Arbitrum Network.\n\nYou will receive a pop-up message from MetaMask. Click on Approve, and the Arbitrum Network will be added to your MetaMask wallet.\n\n3. Bridge Funds to Arbitrum\n\nAfter you have purchased ETH, the next step is to bridge your ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum network.\n\nTo bridge ETH, visit the Arbitrum website and connect your personal wallet to the application. From there, follow the instructions provided \u2014 the entire process can take several minutes to complete.\n\n4. Complete Guild On-Chain Quests\n\nOnce your ETH has been bridged to the Arbitrum network, you will be able to complete a few tasks on Arbitrum that will grant you access to the Arbitrum guild.\n\nCurrently, there are no added benefits of joining the guild other than a corresponding role in Arbitrum\u2019s official Discord; however, it is a great starting point for new users. To join the guild, visit the guild\u2019s official website and complete the necessary tasks.\n\n4. Weekly Arbitrum Interactions\n\nInteract with Arbitrum frequently \u2014 either on a daily or weekly basis. This important step ensures that you are an active and consistent user.\n\nThe rationale is to use as many protocols that support Arbitrum as possible as frequently as possible. The developers have released no specifications for how much ETH (or other tokens) you need to move around. It is up to you to determine an appropriate amount of assets you want to keep on the Arbitrum network based on your unique risk tolerance.\n\nPopular protocols that you can use that support Arbitrum and have interesting use cases include:\n\nGMX\n\nHop Protocol\n\nKyber Network\n\n1inch\n\nShell Protocol\n\nConsider making swaps, taking trades and adding liquidity and staking within liquidity pools.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nETH can be traded on major exchanges such as HYCM, Binance (or Binance.US for U.S. investors), Uphold, Crypto.com and KuCoin. Many of these platforms allow you to purchase ETH using your credit card, through swapping features or via trading pairs such as ETH/USDT or ETH/BTC.\n\nHow to Store Ethereum\n\nEthereum can be stored safely using a crypto wallet. Choose from two types of crypto wallets \u2014 software and hardware wallets. Software wallets allow users to easily manage their cryptocurrency, including buying, selling, swapping and lending through the internet. Hardware wallets, which keep private keys offline, are considered the most secure way to store ETH.\n\nIf you plan to actively engage in these tasks, it is recommended that you use a software wallet. Software wallets are superior at connecting to and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Arbitrum network.\n\nBest Software Wallet: Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is an industry-leading software wallet that enables crypto holders to store, buy, exchange and collect cryptocurrencies and NFTs all in one location. Acquired by Binance in 2018, Trust Wallet is trusted by millions of users worldwide. Users can access 250,000+ crypto assets on over 65 blockchains, which makes it a great choice for investors at all ends of the spectrum.\n\nIs Preparing for the Arbitrum Airdrop Worth it?\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that Arbitrum will have an airdrop or launch a utility token, strong evidence suggests that it is likely. To maximize your chances of eligibility, you may consider following a few of these tasks.\n\nWhether or not an airdrop is announced, Arbitrum is still a great Layer 2 solution with a vibrant ecosystem of dApps. Being an active user doesn\u2019t guarantee that you will be rewarded; however, the opportunity to leverage some of Arbitrum\u2019s fascinating dApps and learn more about decentralized finance (DeFi) is a benefit."

        "title": "Ethereum: The price trend and its market cap - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Thanks to the rising price, until a few days ago Ethereum\u2019s market cap was back above $200 billion.\n\nThe price trend of Ethereum and its market cap.\n\nAt the end of December last year, Ethereum price was around $1,200. This was not the 2022 annual low, however, because this was touched in June below $1,000, and it has never fallen below that threshold since.\n\nStarting on January 4, 2023, however, the price of ETH began to rise, although it did not rise above $1,300 until January 9.\n\nOn January 14 it had also already risen above $1,500, and on the 21st it climbed above $1,600.\n\nSo it has now been effectively hovering around this threshold for three weeks, with only one very brief spike above $1,700 on Feb. 2, and a low of $1,530 on Jan. 25.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization\n\nSince market capitalization is a purely theoretical figure obtained by multiplying the price of an ETH by the number of ETHs in circulation, its trend closely replicates that of the price.\n\nIn this case, however, the threshold to watch is precisely that of $200 billion.\n\nThe first time it reached that figure in its entire history was in February 2021, which was two months after the last major bull run began.\n\nIt should be noted that before the bull run began, i.e., in November 2020, Ethereum capitalized about $50 billion, or a quarter of its current capitalization.\n\nHowever, as early as May 2021 it was close to $500 billion, while the all-time high was reached on November 10 of that year at over $570 billion.\n\nEthereum capitalization today\n\nSo today\u2019s market capitalization is two and a half times less than it was in May 2021, and almost three times less than its peak in November of the same year.\n\nIndeed, looking at the curve from December 2020 to the present, it looks as if, outside the bubble, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization has hovered right around the $100 billion mark.\n\nIn other words, the bear market of 2022 has failed to bring it back to pre-bubble levels, and indeed after falling to $120 billion in June, it has returned to the usual levels of the past two-plus years net of the bubble itself.\n\nIt is as if from December 2020 to February 2021 it rose from $50 billion to $200 billion, only to be inflated by the bubble to $570 billion and always back to $200 billion with its burst during the bear market of 2022.\n\nIn short, an ascent to 570 billion followed by a descent to 120 billion, and then always settling back to the usual threshold of recent years net of the bubble.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance\n\nAnalyzing the dominance curve over the same period reveals that Ethereum\u2019s market cap has moved in much the same way as the crypto markets as a whole.\n\nIn November 2020, Ethereum\u2019s dominance was at about 11 percent, while Bitcoin\u2019s was at 64 percent. Ethereum has risen slightly, to 18 percent, while Bitcoin has collapsed to 40 percent.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s rise from 11% to 18% all happened in the early months of 2021, that is, from December 2020 to May 2021, after which it did nothing but hover around 18% for almost two years. Since December 2020 it has never returned to 11%, with a low peak at 14% in June 2022.\n\nBitcoin also fell to 40% in May 2021 and has since peaked at a high of 46% and a low of 35%.\n\nSo the first five months of 2021 saw a repositioning of BTC and ETH within the crypto market, which has subsequently held up to the present.\n\nETH\u2019s rise was not particularly significant, as its dominance had even exceeded 30 percent for a brief moment in the past, while Bitcoin\u2019s descent in dominance was decidedly more significant, due perhaps in part to the significant increase in stablecoin market capitalization.\n\nAlthough BTC\u2019s dominance had also fallen to 33 percent in the past, the fact that it has now seemed to have stabilized around 40 percent for almost two years gives a good idea of the change that has taken place in crypto markets in 2021."

        "content": "Bloomberg recognizes Polygon Blockchain as the outstanding technology that it is.\n\nBloomberg also predicts Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in the long term.\n\nPolygon is a blockchain that has stamped its mark in the industry. Bloomberg, according to its most recent report, is recognizing Polygon for its noteworthy growth and increased adoption so far.\n\nMike McGlone, the Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg, posted a recent report that goes over Polygon\u2019s notable performance in the last few years.\n\nPolygon has been recognized by Bloomberg, for its ability to scale a variety of decentralized applications. Polygon has surpassed its long-standing rival Ethereum, to host most dApps this year. Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf the entire worldwide blockchain economy, Polygon has the third-largest ecosystem for decentralized apps (dApps). Many of the most popular DeFi dApps on Ethereum, including Aave and Uniswap, have migrated over and are being developed on Polygon. Its 359 dApps is more than three times that of its closest L2 rival and half that of Ethereum.\n\nBloomberg also recognizes that the Polygon Network has more developers than other Layer 1 alternative like Avalanche and Fantom.\n\nPolygon is often making headlines, for its many partnerships with some of the most valuable traditional Fintech companies in the world, and Bloomberg is rightfully recognizing this.\n\nIn January, MasterCard tapped Polygon to launch artists into the web3 ecosystem through an artist accelerator program. Polygon has partnered with Starbucks, Nubank, Adobe, Adidas, Prada and many other global brands in recent times.\n\nBased on Polygon\u2019s string of brand-name partnerships in 2H22, this year could be the year of mainstream NFT adoption. The explosion in active users on the network stemmed from several blockbuster corporate partnerships struck by the company behind the network, Polygon Technology..\n\nBloomberg; Ethereum will overthrow Bitcoin\n\nBloomberg is also predicting that there will be higher asset prices and higher volatility. This will then result in cryptocurrencies facing their first real recession.\n\nThe inception of Bitcoin came during the last economic recession in the United States. Bloomberg is of the opinion that a similar milestone will be experienced, as the economy takes another turn. However, there is no telling how much loss would be recorded in the market before gains are sustained in the future.\n\nBloomberg perceives a resting bull market between Ethereum and Bitcoin, which it refers to as digital gold. According to Bloomberg\u2018s galaxy crypto index, there has been a steady Ethereum/Bitcoin rate since the 2021 peak.\n\nThis is suggesting that digital assets are moving towards a mainstream strong audience. Once \u201cthe dust settles from some revision in risk assets\u201c, Bloomberg is certain that Ethereum is going to outperform Bitcoin.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Bearish ALGO traders have a secondary aim of the 0.382 fib level [$0.2182] which would potentially set up bears for a retest of the asset\u2019s 12-month low [$0.159].\n\nAlgorand\u2019s Moving Averages: 5-Day [$0.25], 20-Day [$0.233], 50-Day [$0.215], 100-Day [$0.27], 200-Day [$0.319], Year to Date [$0.233].\n\nAlgorand\u2019s 24 hour price range is $0.25-$0.27 and its 7 day price range is $0.239-$0.27.
