        "title": "Ether supply could be affected by Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, analyst says - The Block",
        "content": "The supply of ether could be impacted by the Ethereum ETH +1.08% network's upcoming Dencun upgrade, according to CoinShares Ethereum research associate Luke Nolan.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will enable Layer 2 transactions to be sent to the Ethereum network through blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism. This could result in reduced gas usage and, consequently, a lower amount of ether being burned.\n\nAll of the ether used to pay gas base fees for transactions is currently burned.\n\n\"Transactional calldata makes up 90% of the costs Layer 2s pay in terms of gas fees. But after the Dencun upgrade, instead of posting their data through calldata, Layer 2s can use the new blobspace mechanism, which has significantly lower gas costs. So, if we expect layer 2s to gradually shift to using this new blobspace mechanism, we could see gas prices settle at lower levels, which means less ether is burned,\" Nolan told The Block.\n\nImpact on the ether burn mechanism\n\nThe possible reduction in ether burned could have an impact on the growth of ether supply.\n\n\"Gas demand on the Ethereum network drives ether's deflation mechanism via gas burn which can reduce the circulating supply of ether. The Dencun upgrade could see gas prices settle at lower levels,\" Nolan added.\n\nHowever, the impact of the Dencun upgrade and the introduction of the blobspace mechanism could be mitigated by other factors. Nolan stressed that Layer 1 demand is what significantly drives deflation, and that \"even very high blob usage has a low impact on circulating supply.\"\n\n\"Even if we see this reduced gas price because layer 2s are using the blobspace, there is no real concern that Ethereum will become significantly inflationary. The point of the Dencun upgrade is to decrease gas fees for users transacting using roll-ups, and bring users back to the network because of lower transaction fees, so more activity means more gas usage overall,\" Nolan said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nNolan added that the end goal of the Dencun upgrade is to solidify Ethereum's market share, \u201cso secondary effects are a net positive over the long run, regardless of short-term gas fluctuation.\u201d\n\nDencun upgrade schedule\n\nThe Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17 and introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Of particular interest is EIP-4844, which enables the blobspace mechanism.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade on the Sepolia testnet is expected to be activated by Jan. 30, while the same upgrade on the Holesky testnet remains scheduled for activation on Feb. 7.\n\nAccording to Nolan, the mainnet activation of the Dencun upgrade could come as soon as March of this year. \"Ethereum core devs expect that at least one month after Holesky the mainnet activation of the Dencun upgrade will go live. So at least March, or likely after. It is hard to give an exact time, as testnet bugs appear and change timeline,\" Nolan said.\n\nThe price of ether has fallen by over 3% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2,377, according to The Block's Prices Page."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Slumped More Than 6% Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Megacap cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH 1.13%) has continued to sell off in today's session, now having given up most of its gains since the sector-driven mania following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum declined 6.1% over the past 24 hours, dropping below the $2,350 level. This move appears to be tied to a number of market-driven forces, but also some token-specific headwinds that investors are pricing in today.\n\nHere's what's behind today's big downside move in Ethereum.\n\nSignificant Ethereum selling pressure impacting this token\n\nWhen certain investors sell a given cryptocurrency or stock, investors pay attention. Accordingly, news that the Ethereum Foundation (the nonprofit doing much of the behind-the-scenes work to keep Ethereum up and running) sold more than $1.6 million worth of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency has sent shockwaves reverberating through the market.\n\nRecent reports show that this large sale, in which 700 Ether were sold, continues a trend of capital-raising from the Ethereum Foundation. A previous sale of 100 Ether tokens on Jan. 16 from the same wallet suggests that the ongoing development work may be more costly than initially thought, providing some downside selling pressure on this token.\n\nEthereum does have another upgrade on the go, with its so-called Dencun upgrade already underway as of last week. Thus, it's possible that these token sales could dry up as development activity slows, but it's a key factor in the supply/demand equation investors are digesting right now.\n\nAdditionally, concerns around capital flight from the crypto sector, evidenced by more than $2 billion of Bitcoin ETF outflows, has some concerned about the secondary impacts on Ethereum. So far, the excitement around these exchange-traded products hasn't stoked the kind of investment many initially thought would come. For future Ethereum ETFs, that's not great, and this sector-wide selling pressure will likely continue to flow through to the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\n\nWhat to make of today's move\n\nOccasionally, it's important to reflect on the cost impacts various development initiatives have on various blockchain networks and their associated tokens. Given Ethereum's aggressive upgrade schedule and top-tier talent in terms of the developers working diligently on ensuring this protocol's stability, these token sales may not be surprising. But it does appear some in the market have been caught off guard by the corresponding selling pressure and sentiment shift caused by these sales.\n\nThat said, it could also be true that these ongoing upgrades provide outsized value relative to their initial up-front costs. Crypto investors and users want to see an Ethereum network that's as low cost and efficient as possible. That's what this Dencun upgrade aims to achieve.\n\nAdditionally, some recent news around MetaMask launching an Ethereum validator staking feature could result in more locked-up Ethereum tokens, potentially offsetting some of the recent selling pressure we've seen from the Ethereum Foundation and others.\n\nThese effects likely won't offset the institutional capital flight we're seeing from the crypto sector. However, it's the longer-term supply-and-demand dynamics investors will need to consider when it comes to this top-tier crypto.\n\nThus, I think the jury remains out with respect to how Ethereum will perform as it continues its ongoing upgrades in the coming months. For now, sentiment has soured, but long-term investors may want to consider this dip as a potential buying opportunity, as traders look elsewhere to take on bullish positions."

If this support holds strong, there seems to be a clear path ahead with minimal resistance, offering the potential for upward movement.\n\n#Ethereum Market Update: $ETH is currently in a key demand zone, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460.

Ali states that if ETH fails to maintain this level, a pullback to the next significant support area of around $2,000 might occur.\n\nA trip to around $2,000 would mean a 17% drop from the current price of $2,408. The next major support below $2,000 is the daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) 200, which is currently at $1,923.\n\nA breach of this level could open the doors for more losses, possibly toward the $1,800 and $1,700 levels. Meanwhile, the daily SMA 50 level at $2,338 might seek to curtail losses in the immediate term.\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH sees a reversal from its current declines and bounces off the $2,388 and $2,460 support zones, it could resume its uptrend and target the $2,614 level again.\n\nA successful break above this level could pave the way for a rally toward the $2,717 and $2,900 levels, where the coin faces the next hurdles. The ultimate target for bulls is to reclaim the $3,000 psychological level last reached in April 2022."

This leads some traders to fear a revisit to the $2,000 level, but what do on-chain and technical analysis data suggest?\n\nETH price falls below a key support zone\n\nThe first interim bearish outlook for Ether ironically is in the demand area, which independent analyst Ali said was a strong support zone for Ether.\n\nAli said Ether enjoyed robust support from \u201ca key demand zone, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460\u201d and that if it \u201cholds strong, there\u2019s a clear path ahead with minimal resistance, offering a potential for upward movement.\n\n#Ethereum Market Update: $ETH is currently in a key demand zone, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460.

The last time the price dropped below this level was in May 2022, when Ether sank 63% and traded below $1,000.\n\nETH/USD daily chart.

The first major line of defense could emerge from the $2,000 level \u2013 embraced by the 200-day exponential moving average.\n\nEthereum network TVL rises while unique active wallets fall\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) is a metric commonly used to examine the health and demand of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem TVL reached a 19-month high on Jan. 11 of $34.7 billion before sharply declining to $32.2 billion on Jan. 22.\n\nEthereum TVL is down 3.1% over the last 7 days, signaling decreasing demand for the blockchain.\n\nEthereum TVL.

Notably, Instadapp and Compound Finance saw a respective 11% and 9.6% decrease in their TVL.\n\nEthereum network DApps by TVL. Source: DefiLlama\n\nTo determine whether the decline in Ethereum\u2019s TVL correlates with a decline in its user base, it is important to monitor the utilization of DApps. Investors should note that certain DApps, such as gaming platforms and marketplaces, do not require substantial deposits.\n\nRelated: BTC price risks $40K breakdown as GBTC ETF steps up Bitcoin outflows\n\nThe number of active addresses using DApps is down, which is a point of concern. In the last 30 days, the main DApps on Ethereum had 22.65% fewer unique active wallets (UAW). This might reflect dissatisfaction with the cost of transacting on the network.\n\nEthereum data \u2013 summary.

While looking at technical price aspects of Ether\u2019s movement, independent analyst Limbo posted a chart showing the price of Ether below $2,400 suggesting that ETH is a short trade.\n\nOn the other hand, crypto blogger Market Profit highlighted the downward potential for Ethereum by pointing to bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nInvestors\u2019 appetite for Ethereum could continue to diminish if the downturn in the broader crypto market continues. The constant GBTC-linked selling of BTC at Coinbase could continue impacting the whole market, bringing crypto prices down.\n\nOn the upside, the eventual increase in the use of Ethereum-based protocols and the potential of a spot Ether ETF may prove to be a long-term catalyst for price growth.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum infrastructure company Nethermind recently resolved a critical bug in multiple versions of its execution client, which had prevented users from processing blocks on the ETH network.\n\nThe problem, primarily affecting Nethermind users, a minority client, has sparked discussions among Ethereum community members about the need for greater diversity in client usage, moving away from the predominantly used client, Geth.\n\nIn a Jan. 21 tweet, Nethermind\u2019s co-CTO, Daniel Cadela, confirmed that the consensus issue was present in versions 1.23 to 1.25 of their client. The hotfix update, version 1.25.2, was released within hours after users reported failure to process blocks.\n\nWe have the fix!\n\nPlease update to 1.25.2\n\nNo resync is needed.https://t.co/fV3MEdipVX\u2026\n\nVersions up to 1.22 don't have that bug, only 1.23-1.25 are affected. \u2014 DanielC (@_D4nie1_) January 21, 2024\n\nThe bug was first brought to light by a GitHub user, \u201cwga22\u201d, who reported their Nethermind execution client was no longer processing blocks. Although the bug impacted a minority of Ethereum nodes, it has reignited debates over the network\u2019s heavy reliance on the Geth client.\n\nYou might also like: MetaMask rolls out Validator Staking, opening path for user-run Ethereum nodes\n\nPresently, Geth is responsible for powering more than 84% of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer. In contrast, Nethermind holds a smaller market share of 8.2%. This disparity has led to concerns about the risks of centralization on a single client, with advocates for decentralization highlighting the importance of client diversity for network resilience.\n\n\u201cClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements,\u201d noted analyst Anthony Sassano in a tweet from last August, a time when the distribution between Geth and Nethermind was more evenly balanced.\n\nClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements pic.twitter.com/x4irTl2pr1 \u2014 sassal.eth/acc \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) August 6, 2023\n\nThe urgency of the hotfix release underscores that any client, regardless of its usage rate, is susceptible to bugs.\n\n\u201cNothing against Geth, but you\u2019re taking on disproportionate risk by running it,\u201d stated advocate \u2018marceaueth\u2019 in a Jan. 21 post on platform X.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/marceaueth/status/1749176026805010475\n\nA similar issue in the majority of Geth clients could pose significant threats to Ethereum. The push for execution client diversity has been particularly pertinent since Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake with the Merge. The Ethereum Foundation had previously urged stakers to switch from the predominant client to ensure a more evenly distributed upgrade process.\n\nThe recent issue with Nethermind\u2019s client illustrates the importance of maintaining a diverse range of clients to avoid systemic vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile decentralization advocates argue that Ethereum\u2019s heavy reliance on a single client like Geth is counter to its foundational principles, some critics believe the current level of client distribution is sufficient, noting that previous outages involving minority clients have been effectively managed.\n\nThe Nethermind episode serves as a reminder of the necessity for fault tolerance and redundancy in blockchain networks, especially those aiming for high-security standards.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The Ethereum community\u2019s concerns about execution client diversity has intensified, as roughly 84% of all validators are running Go Ethereum.\n\nMost Ethereum staking pools use just one execution client: Go Ethereum (Geth). As a result, some Ethereum enthusiasts have publicly encouraged people to avoid using Geth for their validator duties because of the potential risks of over-relying on one client.\n\nMore than four-fifths of all validators, which are in charge of proposing and validating new blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, use execution client Geth, according to data provided by the crypto analytics website clientdiversity.org, which covers about 60% of the entire Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum clients are software implementations people can download to run the Ethereum network. In order to perform its duties, a single validator typically runs two clients simultaneously to address different components of Ethereum \u2014 the consensus side and the execution side.\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client for Ethereum running on about 8% of validators encountered a bug yesterday, Ethereum core developer \u0141ukasz Rozmej said on X. The bug, which has since been resolved, has sparked a conversation about a hypothetical bug impacting Geth.\n\nWhile the consensus side has seen its client diversity improve, execution client diversity on Ethereum is weak. Specifically, the following Ethereum staking pools and service platforms \u2014 per execution-diversity.info \u2014 likely use Geth as their only execution client for their validator duties: Allnodes, Ankr, Blox Staking, Binance, Bitcoin Suisse, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, and Stakefish.\n\nIn addition, Lido, the largest liquid staking platform with more than nine million ETH staked, has connected over three-quarters of its validators to Geth as well.\n\nA \u2018Supermajority Client\u2019\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, designed Ethereum to work on different software clients, not just one, so that a bug affecting a single client would not adversely impact the whole blockchain.\n\nHowever, Geth is considered a \u201csupermajority client.\u201d As such, validators that run Geth have the capability to finalize the Ethereum blockchain without agreement from validators running other software clients, such as Nethermind, Besu, and Erigon. This has the potential for disastrous results such as a network split, loss of funds, and reputational damage to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cShould Go-Ethereum, likely to be the majority execution client after the Merge, produce an invalid block, it could get finalized and thus cause the catastrophic failure described in scenario 3,\u201d wrote Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist in a 2022 blog post. Scenario three entails a hypothetical situation where a client with more than two-thirds of the stake has a bug in its software and includes an invalid block to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nValidators running a minority client would only lose a small amount of rewards for having a bug, while the cost of having a bug for validators running a supermajority client would be massive.\n\n\u201cCounterintuitively: staking with a minority client bears significantly less risk \u2013 those affected by the recent Nethermind bug hardly lost the rewards of one to two days. Being on the wrong side as part of a majority, however, can lead to significant loss of stake,\u201d wrote co-founder of Gnosis Chain Martin K\u00f6ppelmann on X on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Lefteris Karapetsas, the founder of portfolio tracker Rotkiapp, noted on X that \u201cIn case of a supermajority Ethereum client bug that leads to complete loss of the stake of those stakers at the moment this would burn > ~20% of the entire ETH supply.\u201d\n\nLido did not immediately reply to Unchained\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nOn Monday night, Coinbase announced on X its goal of including an additional execution client in its validator infrastructure, after the Ethereum community expressed concerns about Coinbase\u2019s single client staking steup revolving around Geth.\n\nThe largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S. said it relied solely on Geth for validation because it was the only execution client that met the company\u2019s technical requirements. But Coinbase said it is open to change.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve evaluated execution clients since 2020, none have met Coinbase Cloud\u2019s requirements to date,\u201d wrote Coinbase on X. \u201cMany other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is currently assessing alternative execution clients, and said it would share their next steps by the end of February.\n\nUPDATE (January 23, 2:00 pm. ET): Updated with details of Coinbase\u2019s announcement."

        "title": "Here\u2019s How Low Can ETH Go Following Recent 4% Decline: Ethereum Price Analysis - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In the recent market developments, Ethereum showcased a remarkable upswing, surging to a yearly high of $2717.\n\nHowever, this ascent was met with considerable selling pressure, prompting a slight retracement and setting the stage for a potential short-term consolidation correction.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart uncovers a significant recent surge, with the price reaching a yearly peak of $2.7K. Simultaneously, ETH has emerged within an ascending expanding wedge pattern, identifiable by the orange lines. This pattern holds the potential for a bearish reversal, contingent upon the price breaking below the lower boundary.\n\nDespite this, after Ethereum\u2019s notable upward movement, the price encountered a pivotal resistance zone, notably \u2013 the static $2.7K level aligning with the upper boundary of the ascending wedge pattern.\n\nThis led to a slight retracement. Considering recent market sentiment and price action, there is an anticipation of a continuation in the correction leg, possibly resulting in a pullback to the multi-month ascending wedge pattern (green lines), coinciding with the lower boundary of the recent short-term expanding wedge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, the price faced considerable selling pressure following the impulsive surge, initiating a correction phase. Accordingly, Ethereum seems confined within a crucial range, bounded by substantial support at $2.4K and notable resistance at $2.7K, resulting in a mild downward consolidation.\n\nCurrently, the price has approached the lower boundary of this significant range. Notably, the lower boundary aligns with a significant support region, defined by the price range between the 0.5 ($2408) and the 0.618 ($2335) levels of the Fibonacci retracement. Hence, this offers robust support to the price.\n\nGiven the potential presence of buyers within this critical support zone, an expected scenario is for the price to find support, facilitating a renewed upward movement. However, in the event of a bearish breakout, sellers may target the multi-week ascending trendline as their next objective.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe funding rates are critical in the analysis of Ethereum\u2019s futures market sentiment, as illustrated in the accompanying chart. This metric serves as a pivotal gauge to discern whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders with heightened aggression.\n\nThe chart prominently reveals an upward trajectory in the funding rates metric, mirroring the robust surge in price. This alignment signals a pronounced bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that elevated values in funding rates raise concerns about a potential overheated state in the perpetual markets, signaling the possibility of an impending long-squeeze event.\n\nIn the wake of a recent short-term correction, a noteworthy development is the substantial decline in funding rates. This decline signifies that the overall sentiment remains bullish, concurrently indicating a cooling-off in the perpetual markets from their previously overheated state. Consequently, there exists the potential for the price to resume its upward trajectory following the completion of the ongoing correction stage."

The swap was initiated right before the Ethereum price extended below the $2,400 level today.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s ETH swap & other whale transactions\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, a blockchain tracking platform, the Ethereum Foundation sold 700 ETH on Cow Protocol, valued at $1.68 million, considering the price of $2,409 at the time. Subsequently, the organization acquired 1.68 million DAI tokens. The sell-off move comes after the crypto extended massive declines in today\u2019s trading session.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition, major ETH whale activity suggests a massive sell-off, which could push the prices down further. According to Whale Alert, the most recent transaction witnessed a dump of 27,729 ETH worth $66.19 million to Binance via an undisclosed wallet. Moreover, another whale transfer registered a shift of 10,000 ETH, valued at $23.88 million, to Binance.\n\nFurthermore, 13,198 ETH (worth $32.08 million) was offloaded to Coinbase through an unknown wallet. The three recent transactions account for a dump of ETH worth $122.15 million within five hours. Earlier, about 15 hours before the latest transaction, a massive $151.02 million worth of ETH was moved to Bitfinex.\n\nAlso Read: Will ETH Price Hit $2000? Expanding Channel Pattern Sets Dive Below $2400\n\nETH Price falls below $2,400\n\nThe Ethereum price is hitting lower lows lately after it plunged lower than $2,400.

The crypto held a market cap of $285.89 billion, down by 3.77%.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH\u2019s trading volume skyrocketed by 87.08% to $8.71 billion in the past 24 hours. Whilst, the ETH price attained a low of $2,361.66 during the day. Earlier, after the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant upswing and surged to a high of $2,710.42.\n\nOn the other hand, the moving average indicators on TradingView suggest that the ETH holders should opt for a \u2018sell\u2019 move. The ETH price is trading fairly below the 10-day EMA of 2,461.6, indicating a short-term bearish downturn. However, ETH is trading above the 50-day EMA and 100-day EMA of 2,325 and 2,147.3, respectively, indicating a bullish sentiment in the long term.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Remains Within Key Demand, Here\u2019s the Next Support Level"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s market share in stablecoins soared from 1.2% to nearly 32%.\n\nSolana\u2019s network is now challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nSolana is faster, but Ethereum still has the first-mover advantage.\n\nEthereum, the biggest smart contract network, has long dominated the stablecoin market. However, high transaction costs and slow speeds have been constant issues for users. Now, Solana is finally taking advantage of this.\n\nBetween October 2023 and January 2024, Solana experienced an unprecedented surge in market share, leaping from a modest 1.2% to nearly 32%. This dramatic increase signals a potential realignment in the stablecoin market, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nSolana\u2019s Stablecoin Volume Rivals Ethereum\n\nRecent data shows that Solana\u2019s total stablecoin volume reached $322 billion in January after a dramatic surge since October. In that period, Solana\u2019s volume went from a modest $12 billion in the market to within striking distance of Ethereum.\n\nThe USD Coin\u2019s (USDC) and Paxos\u2019 stablecoin USDP\u2019s launch on the Solana blockchain played crucial roles in this growth. These tokens attracted more users and transactions to Solana.\n\nEthereum, which long dominated stablecoin transfers, registered a $335 volume in January, just $13 billion more than Solana. Now, Solana is close to flipping Ethereum in transfers after taking the second spot, overtaking the Tron Network.\n\nCan Solana Overtake Ethereum?\n\nOne of Solana\u2019s most compelling advantages is its high transaction speeds. Boasting a system capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, Solana offers an efficient and scalable solution for stablecoin transfers. This means that users must pay lesser fees when sending money by Solana.\n\nStill, it won\u2019t be easy for Solana to flip Ethereum. As the first mover in the blockchain industry, Ethereum has established a robust ecosystem, a loyal user base, and decentralized applications. This first-mover advantage provides Ethereum with a significant competitive edge.\n\nMoreover, despite challenges, Ethereum continues to innovate. The platform is actively addressing its limitations with upgrades to improve scalability and efficiency, such as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict future market movements in certain, current trends show that Solana has an advantage over Ethereum. However, overtaking Ethereum involves challenges such as building trust with users and ensuring the security and scalability of the network. Solana\u2019s success will depend on that.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSolana\u2019s rise in the stablecoin market came after SOL saw a dramatic rise in 2023. On Monday, January 22, Solana was up 254.79% from last year, having recovered from the FTX crash.\n\nSolana Mobile\u2019s smartphone launch has also boosted the credibility of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSolana\u2019s adoption and its blockchain\u2019s performance are not just about SOL. They also drive the adoption and mainstream acceptance of blockchain technology.\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s surge in the stablecoin market:\n\nSolana Inks Record-High $300B Stablecoin Volume in January\n\n\n\nRead more about the new crypto phone by Solana Mobile:\n\nSolana\u2019s New Phone Bags 30k Preorders Ahead of 2025 Release"

ETH futures ETFs have also had a slow few months of trading.\n\nETH and BTC correlation has sunk to multi-year lows as each asset matures and develops its own narratives. While ETFs were one of the most catalyzing narratives in BTC\u2019s history, it remains to be seen whether ETH will be able to replicate this. However, ETH has many narratives it can lean on; if ETFs don\u2019t spur enthusiasm, perhaps new Layer-2s or the success of EigenLayer and restaking can.\u201d\n\nKaiko says that derivatives data also indicates that recent ETH moves have largely been driven by spot markets rather than by perpetual futures, which the firm says provides evidence that traders are not using leverage in anticipation of an ETH ETF.\n\n\u201cSeptember and October marked a low point in futures markets, with aggregated open interest (in USD) falling more than 20% from its summer levels. At this time, there was little price movement and funding rates were neutral\u2026\n\nPost-BTC approval, funding rates have reset to neutral, while open interest has surged ahead of price, indicative of increased shorting. Even still, we have not yet seen a major build-up in open interest that is typical of a bull market.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,473.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's \"agreement.\"\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n\n\nAccording to this, validators would lose ~.01 Eth for an activity leak lasting 10 hrs.\n\n\n\nObviously wouldn't be great for Ethereum, but not super devastating for any validators who are paying attention.https://t.co/VexfZo2pKF \u2014 MevRefund (@MevRefund) January 22, 2024\n\nIf validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as \"equivocating\" validators.\n\nWhat makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.\n\nFor the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is \"pretty scary,\" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA dormant Ethereum wallet from the Satoshi era has recently come to life. Whale Alert, a popular tracker of large-scale cryptocurrency transactions, reported that a pre-mine address containing 133 Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $329,492, has been activated after lying dormant for 8.5 years. This unexpected activity has stirred considerable interest in the crypto community, given the long inactivity of the wallet.\n\nRevival of ancient Ethereum addresses\n\nThe recent activation of this Satoshi-era Ethereum wallet is not an isolated incident. Over the past few months, several dormant pre-mine Ethereum addresses have been reactivated. For instance, Whale Alert reported on Jan. 14 that a wallet with 200 ETH (worth $506,140) resumed activity after 8.5 years.\n\nSimilar awakenings were noted on Dec. 23, 2023, with a wallet containing 11,640 ETH ($26.5 million) becoming active after 8.4 years, and on Oct. 21, 2023, a wallet with 2,000 ETH ($3.2 million) reactivated after 8.2 years.\n\nThese reactivations have sparked discussions and speculations within the cryptocurrency community, as they represent significant movements within the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPotential reasons\n\nThe activation of these pre-mine Ethereum addresses is particularly noteworthy because Ethereum was obscure during its early years. Pre-mine addresses refer to wallets containing cryptocurrencies that were mined before the public launch of the blockchain.\n\nThe sudden activation of such wallets, dormant for nearly a decade, raises questions about the motives behind these transactions. Speculation ranges from owners regaining access to lost keys, to strategic financial moves influenced by the current market dynamics.\n\nThe re-emergence of these wallets could also be linked to long-term holders (often called \"HODLers\" in the crypto world) deciding to cash in on their investments or diversify their portfolios in response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nHowever, such transactions are usually too small to potentially impact the liquidity and price volatility of ETH."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently on the edge, with increasing concerns that Grayscale might persist in selling its Bitcoin holdings. This fear stems from investors shedding shares of the GBTC ETF, sparking a wider market sell-off. Amid this downturn, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum formed a local top at $2700 and entered a new correction phase.\n\nWithin a fortnight, the ETH price is down 9% to currently trading at $2467. Moreover, a notable development in Ethereum\u2019s Implied volatility and Option writing for coming months projects that future traders are expecting a prolonged correction for this asset.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price Analysis: Expanding Channel Pattern Sets Dive Below $2400\n\nThe formation of an expanding channel pattern reflects increased uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price keeps the overall trend bullish\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.63 Billion, indicating a 39% loss.\n\nThe last two months\u2019 recovery in Ethereum price can be followed using two diverging trendlines of an expanding channel pattern. Amid this rally, the coin price has showcased several rebounds from the two trendlines indicating the traders have taken a strict on the pattern structure.\n\nOn January 12th, the ETH price witnessed its latest reversal from the upper trendline, which initiated a new bear cycle within the channel. By the press time, the ETH price is trading at $2469, trying to hold above local support of $2400.\n\nAs per the recent data from Deribit Insight, Ethereum\u2019s implied volatility (IV), as measured by the Dvol proxy over the past week, experienced a significant decline, dropping from 64% to 47%, largely driven by structured call selling in both markets.\n\nThis indicates a change in strategy, with some investors possibly exiting long positions or engaging in overwriting strategies against their Ethereum holdings. Key transactions include the selling of 45,000 February calls with a strike price of $2,700, and 28,000 March calls at a $2,900 strike price. Additionally, there was a strategic move where 25,000 January $2,600 calls were covered, followed by the selling of April calls at a $2,900 strike.\n\nSuch Heavy Call selling at the aforementioned psychological level indicates the option traders believe the Ethereum coin is less likely to surge higher in coming months but rather remains in a sideways or correction trend.\n\nWill ETH Price Correction Hit $2000?\n\nIf the broader market continues to fuel selling pressure, the Ethereum price is likely to break the immediate support of $2400. The post-breakdown fall would tumble the price another 6.5% to retest the channel\u2019s lower trendline at $2300.\n\nThe rising trendline has acted as dynamic support for over two months and its possible breakdown intensifies the supply pressure. The extended downfall may plunge the ETH price to following support of $2140, and $1920.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover between MACD and the signal line reflects an active correction sentiment in the market.\n\nBollinger Band: The upper boundary of the Bollinger band going flat reflects a weakening in bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is edging closer to significantly lower gas fees and faster transaction speeds for layer-2 rollups as the Dencun upgrade hits the network\u2019s three testnets in early 2024.\n\nThe Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17 and introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Of particular interest is EIP-4844, which enables proto-danksharding, a highly anticipated improvement touted to reduce L2 transaction fees.\n\nPrysm encountered a bug right at Goerli's hard fork. The bug has been identified, and a fix is currently being merged. A hot patch image will be released within the next few hours. Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience!https://t.co/PR9V0lqoCN \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) January 17, 2024\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the deployment of Dencun to Goerli suffered a four-hour delay caused by a bug that prevented the testnet from finalizing the upgrade. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nebojsa Urosevic, co-founder of Ethereum development platform Tenderly, unpacked the details of the bug.\n\n\u201cThe network could not sync with nodes because of a bug in Prysm, Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake client,\" Urosevic said.\n\nThe Tenderly co-founder, who is also the senior vice president of its engineering team, noted that client synchronization delays are common, which allowed for the bug to be identified and rectified quickly:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why there are multiple clients and why testnets exist.\u201d\n\nEthereum Foundation protocol lead Tim Beiko also shared a debrief from the latest All Core Developers Execution Call on Jan. 18, which outlined the historical root issue. Historical roots are a legacy mechanism that Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain uses to manage the computational load of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nAs Beiko sums up, the bug was related to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake client Prysm setting the historical roots value to 0, which prevented the Goerli testnet from finalizing the Dencun upgrade:\n\nIn short, every 256 epochs, CL clients save a specific value, called the Historical Root. A bug in Prysm set this value to 0 instead of copying over the last historical root when Deneb activated. \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 18, 2024\n\nDencun roadmap\n\nAs the official Ethereum blog outlines, Dencun incorporates nine different EIPs. Urosevic highlighted proto-danksharding and blob transactions as the most anticipated of the EIPs:\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding is a major step toward improved Ethereum scalability, thanks to the use of blob-carrying transactions instead of calldata.\u201d\n\nUrosevic explains that data blobs will improve storage efficiency by making transaction data temporarily available in a compressed format. He adds that they are more cost-effective than calldata, with a potential cost reduction of 80%\u201390%.\n\nRelated: Big changes coming to Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction to save on gas\n\nFollowing the successful implementation on Goerli, the Sepolia and Holesky testnets are next in line to undergo the Dencun upgrade. Urosevic notes that successful deployment on all three testnets is required before plans are made to upgrade Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nDencun\u2019s storage improvements\n\nEthereum sidechain Gnosis\u2019 infrastructure director Philippe Schommers highlights that Dencun will provide more block space and lower costs to L2s, while data that was previously stored indefinitely on-chain will be discarded after two weeks:\n\n\u201cThis is scalability in a way that is compatible with our endgame without sacrificing decentralization.\u201d\n\nUrosevic echoes these sentiments, citing storage improvements as one of the major impacts of the Dencun upgrade.\n\n\u201cL2 networks will be able to store data on L1 more efficiently. Blobs will be deleted approximately every two weeks, which is enough for L2s to manage, retrieve and verify the data. This makes blobs cheaper than typical transaction calldata, which is stored indefinitely,\u201d Urosevic explains.\n\nThe result sees Dencun deliver lower gas fees and faster transaction fees, which stands to open opportunities for \u201cnew, more complex applications on L2 solutions\u201d:\n\n\u201cDencun will probably lower rollup transaction costs by up to 10 times, depending on blob space demand.\u201d\n\nRollups stand to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new upgrade, with their economic viability and scalability enhanced by reduced operational costs.\n\nAnurag Arjun, a co-founder of data availability blockchain Avail, adds that the significant growth in demand for block space from rollups in 2023 suggests an expected increase in the demand for block space for data availability from L2s moving forward:\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding will provide some relief, but it\u2019s clear that rollups need a whole lot more block space for data availability, and we need to be thinking about how we can achieve this in a way that still prioritizes decentralization, scalability and security,\u201d Arjun tells Cointelegraph.\n\nWhile the systematic upgrades of the Ethereum network work toward lower fees and faster transactions, protocols like Avail could help address the block space demands of rollups in the interim.\n\nRelated: Ether price jumps 20% vs. Bitcoin as BlackRock boosts Ethereum ETF bets\n\nArjun notes that recent benchmarks of Avail\u2019s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine Validium reduce transaction fees by 90% by posting transaction data to Avail instead of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt still settles to Ethereum and provides data availability guarantees that are decentralized and secure. This is becoming quite an attractive option for blockchains looking to move into the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nUrosevic describes the end game of the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet, commenting that its implementation will be the first time scalability issues are addressed directly on the mainnet. \u201cMultiple EIPs will bring greater storage efficiency, lower gas fees and an overall better experience for developers while making rollups even more cost-efficient,\u201d Urosevic said.\n\nMagazine: Slumdog billionaire 2: \u2018Top 10\u2026 brings no satisfaction\u2019 says Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Remains Within Key Demand, Here\u2019s the Next Support Level - CoinGape",
        "content": "During the wider cryptocurrency market downturn, Ethereum has faced selling pressure, resulting in a 2.02% decrease in its price. It is currently trading at $2,421 with a market capitalization of $291 billion.\n\nEthereum Price Remains In the Key Demand Zone\n\nIn a recent market update, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez sheds light on the current state of Ethereum ($ETH). The second-largest cryptocurrency is positioned within a crucial demand zone, fluctuating between $2,388 and $2,460. According to Martinez, the strength of this support level will determine the trajectory for Ethereum in the near term, with a favorable scenario suggesting a clear path for upward movement due to minimal resistance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Martinez issues a cautionary note, indicating a potential downside if Ethereum fails to maintain the mentioned support. In such a scenario, there\u2019s a likelihood of a pullback to the next significant support area, estimated to be around $2,000. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these key levels as Ethereum navigates the current market conditions.\n\nKey ETH Developments\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade is likely to go live on the Sepolia testnet by January 30, with the corresponding upgrade on the Holesky testnet slated for activation on February 7. A comprehensive update on client releases for both upgrades is set to be consolidated and communicated through a blog post scheduled for January 23, providing stakeholders with detailed insights into the activation process for the respective testnets.\n\nThere is a level of optimism in the market regarding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by May 23 this year, aligning with the SEC deadline for the Ark 21Shares application. However, JPMorgan (JPM) suggests that the likelihood of the SEC granting approval for the ETF by May is estimated to be no more than 50%.\n\nSince the rise of the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF narrative in the market last year, attention has shifted to Ethereum as the next plausible candidate for spot ETF approval in the United States. This sentiment is reflected in the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which, according to JPMorgan, has been contracting since the summer and maintaining around 12% over the past two months.\n\nJPMorgan notes that some argue the SEC\u2019s decision not to reference ETH in its lawsuit against crypto exchanges for securities law violations could imply the regulator is leaning toward classifying the cryptocurrency as a commodity in the coming months\u2014a crucial condition for spot ETF approval. Others contend that the approval of ether futures-based ETFs in September last year inherently suggests that ether is considered a commodity."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Drops Lower and ETH Takes a Hit \u2013 Time to Buy the Dip\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are facing pivotal moments. Bitcoin, the most prominent cryptocurrency, has witnessed a continual downward trajectory, plunging to the $41,000 threshold on Monday.\n\nThe entire global crypto market cap reflects this downturn, showing a 1.65% loss in the last 24 hours, settling at $1.62 trillion. Despite consolidating at $41,000 over the weekend, the market remains in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, creating a state of uncertainty.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is hovering around $2,350, a precarious position given its recent inability to breach the $2,500 level. Amidst these fluctuations, the crypto market is also reacting to recent developments such as Grayscale\u2019s substantial Bitcoin sell-off and the impact of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals.\n\nThese events are significantly influencing market dynamics, adding layers of complexity to the already intricate crypto trading environment.\n\nETF Approval: Impact on Bitcoin & Ethereum Flows\n\n\n\nThe recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has notably triggered selling pressure, leading to modest outflows totaling $21 million in cryptocurrency products.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced the largest outflows, amounting to $24.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, the Bitcoin Short fund, which profits from BTC\u2019s decline, saw an inflow of $12.7 million.\n\n#BTC has actually gone down in price since spot bitcoin ETFs hit the US market. https://t.co/EE2w85bxju You won't believe the 21 million reasons bitcoin ETFs are dumb as heck and super-risky! Oh wait, of course you will \u2014 Amy Castor (@ahcastor) January 21, 2024\n\nIn the meantime, the altcoins faced challenges, with Litecoin losing $1.5 million and Solana experiencing an $8.5 million outflow.\n\nIn terms of regional trends, Canada and Germany had significant outflows, while the USA and Brazil attracted inflows, with the USA leading at $263.2 million. Therefore, the news of outflows in Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the surge in trading volumes, likely contributed to selling pressure.\n\nHowever, the impact on BTC price depends on various factors, including market sentiment and external events.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s $2.14B Bitcoin Sale\n\n\n\nThe recent slowdown in cryptocurrency market momentum can partly be attributed to Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, offloading approximately $2.14 billion worth of Bitcoin, totaling about 52,227 BTC.\n\nThis significant sale occurred in the wake of the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, a pivotal development in the financial integration of cryptocurrencies. Other major players like BlackRock\u2019s iShares, Fidelity, and Bitwise also hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off had a impact on Bitcoin prices, causing a temporary setback. However, the overall market context suggests that the fundamental drivers of the bull market, like growing crypto adoption and institutional interest, remain strong.\n\nBitcoin has a history of bouncing back from corrections, and the market is likely to recover once the immediate impact subsides.\n\nHence, Grayscale\u2019s massive Bitcoin sell-off, totaling $2.14 billion, triggered a swift dip in BTC prices. Despite this setback, the market\u2019s fundamentals, driven by increasing adoption and institutional interest, suggest a potential recovery.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

        "content": "Altcoin Crypto Funds Like Ethereum and Solana See Outflows After Bitcoin ETFs Launch\n\nA new report from digital asset fund manager CoinShares reveals that investors are withdrawing funds from high-profile crypto funds following the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this month. According to CoinShares, investors pulled $21 million out of crypto funds issuers last week.\n\nCoinShares suggests that investors seeking exposure to digital assets are shifting their money into the new Bitcoin ETFs. The report notes that \"incumbent, higher cost issuers suffered in the U.S., seeing $2.9 billion of outflows, while newly issued ETFs have now seen a total of $4.13 billion inflows since launch.\"\n\nIn contrast, short Bitcoin products, which bet on the price of crypto going down, received inflows of around $13 million, as investors bet on further price weakness from Bitcoin. Other altcoin funds providing exposure to Ethereum and Solana also experienced outflows, reaching $14 million and $8.5 million respectively.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10 marked a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. Of the 10 ETFs currently trading, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust is the best performer, with $1.3 billion in assets under management.\n\nHowever, Grayscale, which manages billions of dollars worth of crypto assets, has experienced significant outflows. The Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recently converted to a Bitcoin ETF, and investors have been cashing out rapidly. CoinShares reports that over $2.2 billion has been withdrawn from GBTC since its conversion.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "The crypto industry eagerly anticipates the official mainnet for Dencun\u2019s upgrade that will potentially reduce the outrageous gas fees associated with Ethereum.\n\nIn a significant stride toward reducing gas fees and enhancing transaction speeds, the Ethereum ecosystem is nearing a transformative shift with the introduction of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade, activated on the Goerli testnet on January 17, promises to address key challenges, particularly in the realm of layer-2 (L2) rollups.\n\nDencun to Boast Ethereum\u2019s Efficiency\n\nDencun\u2019s upgrade integrates several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with a spotlight on EIP-4844. The proposal introduces proto-danksharding, a highly anticipated enhancement poised to reduce L2 transaction fees significantly.\n\nIn addition to the EIP-4844, the Dencun upgrade introduces changes to both Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layers, incorporating a total of nine distinct EIPs. Among these, proto-danksharding and blob transactions emerge as particularly awaited improvements.\n\nProto-danksharding transforms transaction handling by employing blob-carrying transactions instead of calldata. This innovation bolsters scalability and promises substantial cost reductions, estimated between 80% and 90%.\n\nOther EIPs expected to come with the Dencun upgrade include Transient storage opcodes (EIP-1153), Beacon block root integration in the EVM (EIP-4788), and the introduction of Shard Blob Transactions (EIP-4844).\n\nThese advancements collectively propel Dencun toward a more efficient and cost-effective Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDencun Timeline Commitment\n\nOn January 17, the Dencun\u2019s upgrade experienced a temporary setback during its deployment of Goerli. Ethereum core developers encountered a four-hour delay during the activation of the testnet due to a bug in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake client Prysm.\n\nHowever, experts believe such challenges are instrumental in refining the system despite the temporary setback.\n\nNebojsa Urosevic, co-founder of the Ethereum development platform Tenderly, shed light on the bug, emphasizing that synchronization delays are common and can be quickly rectified due to the existence of multiple clients and testnets.\n\nDespite the issues during the Goerli testnet, the Ethereum core developers remain committed to the Sepolia and Holesky testnet launch timeline.\n\nThe developers plan to continue with the release scheduled for Sepolia on January 30, 2024, and Holesky on February 7, 2024. According to the official Ethereum blog post, once the three upgrades run effectively without issues on the testnets, mainnet activation will be scheduled for launch.\n\nChristine Kim, vice president of the research team at Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused financial services firm in the United States, said there is a 60% probability of the upgrade\u2019s mainnet activation by the end of March.\n\nThe crypto industry eagerly anticipates the official mainnet for Dencun\u2019s upgrade that will potentially reduce the outrageous gas fees associated with Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Dominates Developer Preferences\n\nMeanwhile, while the Ethereum community awaits the mainnet debut of Dencun\u2019s upgrade, a recent report by Electric Capital found that interest in the blockchain protocol has continued to surge among developers.\n\nAccording to the study, Ethereum is the preferred blockchain for crypto developers, with over 70% of new contract codes debuting on the network. The 2023 Crypto Developer Report discovered that the developers are now living outside North America in countries in Latin America and Western Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the report found that Ethereum\u2019s appeal lies in its distinctive smart contract code, initiating 71% of contracts on the platform.\n\nA noteworthy trend is the surge in multi-chain developers, increasing from 3% in 2015 to an impressive 34% in 2023, reflecting a tenfold rise in eight years. This cross-pollination extends between Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains, encompassing BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and various layer 2 networks.\n\nElectric Capital observed that BNB Chain hosts the largest share of multi-chain developers, followed by Ethereum at 39%, Polygon at 36%, Arbitrum at 24%, and Avalanche at 18%.\n\nInterestingly, the report also disclosed that 40% of developers actively engaged with both the Ethereum and Bitcoin protocols in 2023. Despite Bitcoin experiencing a 25% decline in monthly active developers, Ethereum remained resilient. The drop in Bitcoin\u2019s figures was mainly attributed to part-time developers and those exploring multi-chain solutions."

        "title": "Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Luna Classic (LUNC) - CoinGape",
        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market is experiencing relative stability during the weekend, following a bearish trend earlier in the week. This downturn saw Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fall from a high of $49,000 to $40,300, marking a 17.85% loss.\n\nThis selling pressure is largely attributed to Grayscale beginning to sell its Bitcoin holdings in response to investors offloading shares of the GBTC ETF. The outflow of $2.2 billion from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and concerns about the Bitcoin ETF being a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event have led most major cryptocurrencies into a correction phase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite this, several industry experts view the current downturn as a natural correction, necessary for the major cryptocurrencies to gather strength for future growth.\n\nOn the Bitcoin weekly time frame chart, there\u2019s a notable struggle to sustain above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, around $42,300. This effort to reclaim 50% of the lost value from the recent downtrend reflects a growing conviction among market bulls and a weakening hold by bears on the asset.\n\nWith a positive outlook for the near future, the following cryptocurrencies Ethereum(ETH), Solana(SOL), and Luna Classic (LUNC) can offer suitable pullback opportunities to traders.\n\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) Price Nearing a 22% Breakout Rally\n\nAmid the current downturn in the crypto market, the Ethereum price recently hit a local high of $2700 before starting a correction phase this week. The price now stands at $2487, reflecting a loss of 8.35% over the past two weeks.\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that this correction is contained within two converging trendlines, forming what appears to be a pennant pattern. If this pattern proves accurate, it suggests that the current correction phase could be a consolidation period, allowing buyers to gather strength for a potential upward movement.\n\nAdding to this bullish perspective is a notable observation by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, regarding Ethereum\u2019s staking activity. On January 18th, he highlighted in a tweet that 24% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is now staked, with only 11% available on exchanges. Contrary to expectations of significant unstaking post the Shapella upgrade, the staking rate continues to rise.\n\nGiven these technical and on-chain developments, the ETH price might break through the pennant\u2019s upper trendline, indicating an end to the correction phase. This breakout could potentially spark a rally of around 22%, pushing the price beyond the $3000 mark..\n\nNew Found Support Bolsters Solana (SOL) Price Rally to $125, But There\u2019s More\n\nSolana, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has displayed impressive resilience amid the broader market\u2019s downturn, holding steadily above the crucial $85 mark. This level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, signaling that buyers are maintaining a strong foothold.\n\nAs highlighted in a recent analysis by Coingape, the Solana price correction is shaping the \u2018handle\u2019 of a larger Cup-and-Handle pattern, a bullish chart formation. This suggests that the ongoing retracement could rejuvenate the bullish momentum, potentially driving the SOL price up by 35% to breach the critical neckline resistance at $125.\n\nA successful breakout from this neckline, particularly if backed by a daily candle closing above it, would be a robust indication of a trend reversal. Such a development could set the Solana price on a path towards a significant target of $255.\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC) Price Wavering In a Mark-or-Break Scenario\n\nThe Terra Classic (LUNC) price has been in a corrective phase since December 2023, with its price dropping from a high of $0.00028 to its current value of $0.000118, indicating a substantial 60% loss.\n\nThe coin found crucial support at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level around $0.0000102, changing its course from a downward trend to sideways. The daily chart shows that this consolidation has evolved into a symmetrical triangle pattern, typically a sign of the continuation of the existing trend.\n\nA breakdown below this triangle\u2019s lower support trendline might lead to further price declines for LUNC, potentially towards $0.0000975 and then $0.0000842. Alternatively, a rare upside break from this pattern could signal an attempt by buyers to regain bullish momentum.\n\nIf buyers manage a breakout, they could be looking at an upward rally towards resistance levels at $0.000147, followed by $0.000173, providing a much-needed boost to reverse the bearish sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles:"

Per the report, BTC\u2019s adoption exploded primarily because of institutional interest and the coming of spot BTC ETFs from issuers like BlackRock.\n\nSpot BTC ETFs received the green light on Jan. 10 and saw billions in trading volume in the first week after trading opened.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of inscriptions and ordinals reinforced on-chain activity on crypto\u2019s largest decentralized network. Inscriptions allow users to create assets akin to Ethereum NFTs and ERC-20 tokens on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale CEO: Most spot Bitcoin ETFs will not survive\n\nBRC-20 tokens, as they are called, drew demand and scrutiny alike after debuting in the first half of 2023.

This 39% increase accounted for an estimated 21% of global owners. The Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked staked Ether and allowed withdrawals, is a major factor attributed to this growth.\n\nThe update was pivotal following Ethereum\u2019s transition from its former proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake design in the network\u2019s largest technological overhaul.

        "content": "Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind has fixed a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that reportedly caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum.\n\nWhile the situation affected the users of Nethermind, a minority client, the incident has led some Ethereum community members to reiterate the importance of diversifying away from the majority client, Geth.\n\nThe latest hotfix addresses a consensus issue in Nethermind that had been introduced in version 1.23.0, according to a Jan. 21 post on Nethermind\u2019s GitHub account.\n\nNethermind co-chief technology officer Daniel Cadela confirmed that versions 1.23\u20131.25 were impacted and called on node validators to update to version 1.25.2. In a follow-up post on X (formerly Twitter), Cadela described the bug as critical.\n\nWe have the fix!\n\nPlease update to 1.25.2\n\nNo resync is needed.https://t.co/fV3MEdipVX\u2026\n\nVersions up to 1.22 don't have that bug, only 1.23-1.25 are affected. \u2014 DanielC (@_D4nie1_) January 21, 2024\n\nThe issue was first voiced by GitHub user \u201cwga22,\u201d who reported their Nethermind execution client was no longer processing blocks.\n\nThe new version, 1.25.2, came approximately 2.5 hours after the firm\u2019s technical lead, Lukasz Rozmej, said the firm was investigating the issue.\n\nAt first glance, Ethereum advocate Superphiz referred to the dilemma as \u201cno big deal\u201d so long as the consensus issue only impacted minority clients.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, it\u2019s a very deliberate design decision not to rely on any single point of failure,\u201d Superphiz added.\n\nI just heard about a potential client bug in Nethermind. This is no big deal as long as it only affects minority clients - as a matter of fact, it's a very deliberate design decision not to rely on any single point of failure. https://t.co/HrjtsG4ckw \u2014 superphiz.eth \ufe0f (@superphiz) January 21, 2024\n\nHowever, several members of the Ethereum community argued the situation could\u2019ve been much more damaging had the issue come about in Geth, which currently accounts for 84% of execution clients on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s beacon chain hiccup has once again highlighted the importance of EL client diversity,\u201d explained Ethereum advocate \u201cliam\u201d in a Jan. 21 X post.\n\n\u201cSwitch to a minority client, and help keep Ethereum secure!\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs air concern over Vitalik\u2019s plan to increase gas limit\n\nNethermind currently only accounts for 8.2% of execution clients on Ethereum, data shows.\n\nHowever, in August 2023, Ethereum bull Anthony Sassano shared a screenshot that showed a much healthier execution client diversity, with Geth and Nethermind accounting for 48% and 26% of execution clients, respectively.\n\n\u201cClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements,\u201d Sassano said at the time.\n\nThe increased reliance on Geth now has several members of the Ethereum community worried.\n\n\u201cNothing against Geth (they\u2019re great) but you\u2019re taking on disproportionate risk by running it,\u201d said Ethereum advocate \u201cMarceau\u201d on Jan. 21.\n\nLook y'all\n\n\n\nBesu had an issue earlier this month. It wasn't a big deal cuz they're ~4% of the network\n\n\n\nNethermind has an issue today. It's not a big deal cuz they're ~10% of the network\n\n\n\nClient bugs can happen IN ANY CLIENT.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum traders are on the lookout for signs of a forthcoming rally, as the market digests the latest developments and braces for the week ahead.\n\nX\u2019s New Crypto Payments Account Stirs Market Speculation; Bitcoin Gains Support\n\nUnder Elon Musk\u2019s direction, X (previously Twitter) has opened a special account for its future payments function, causing conjecture in the cryptocurrency world. It is anticipated that cryptocurrencies will be included in the X app, which is anticipated to launch in-app payment services by mid-2024.\n\nAlthough the dedicated account has been validated and linked to X, there has been no indication that it supports cryptocurrency in addition to conventional fiat money.\n\nResearchers Mason Versluis and other cryptocurrency fans are excited about the app\u2019s possible integration of cryptocurrencies like XRP, Stellar, and XDC.\n\nSpeculation regarding its inclusion is fueled by Elon Musk\u2019s previous affiliation with DOGE for Tesla payments.\n\nAs mainstream integration and acceptance of cryptocurrencies continue to expand, this move could have a beneficial impact on Bitcoin values by escalating ongoing speculation about X\u2019s development into a full platform.\n\nDebiex Exchange Hit by $2.3M Loss Amid Romance Scam Claims"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) 11th AMA session discussed plans to increase transaction capacity for scalability.\n\nThere has been optimism around addressing liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum Layer 2 through open cross-L2 transfer protocols.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation recently conducted its 11th Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, delving into the future scalability solutions, liquidity fragmentation on Layer 2 (L2), and other crucial aspects of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap.\n\nThe session, led by prominent figures including Vitalik Buterin, offered in-depth insights into the evolving ETH landscape.\n\nKey figures in Ethereum\u2019s 11th AMA\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s 11th AMA discussed future scalability solutions (more than 2,000 TPS), how to solve liquidity fragmentation on L2, the most undervalued applications, how to view the re-stake risk of EigenLayer, what to do if most L2s no longer choose Ethereum as DA,\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 21, 2024\n\n\n\nA key discussion point was the potential of increasing Ethereum\u2019s transaction capacity beyond the current limit, targeting over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). The limitations of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4,844 in scaling Ethereum were examined.\n\nMoreover, this highlights the need for more efficient data publication methods. In this context, the PeerDAS protocol offered a promising approach, bringing forth a blend of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe AMA also tackled the challenge of liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum L2. Vitalik Buterin expressed optimism about open, permissionless cross-L2 transfer protocols, citing UniswapX as a notable example.\n\nThis approach aims to address the composability challenges on ETH L2, facilitating smoother asset transfers across different layers.\n\nETH\u2019s potential improvement prospects\n\nThe discussion ventured into the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), exploring potential collaborative avenues. The role of privacy in Ethereum\u2019s future was another crucial topic, with an emphasis on balancing privacy features with scalability and other pressing concerns.\n\nA significant part of the AMA was dedicated to discussing the re-stake risk of EigenLayer and its implications for Ethereum\u2019s security model. The conversation also explored the scenario of most L2s choosing alternative data availability (DA) layers over ETH. This further helps in assessing the impact on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe AMA highlighted the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s commitment to enhancing the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and user experience.\n\nWhat does ETH\u2019s future hold?\n\nWith these discussions, the Ethereum community aims to navigate the complexities of blockchain technology. Also, this ensures Ethereum L2 remains at the forefront of innovation and user-centric development.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s AMA represents a vital effort in addressing the community\u2019s concerns and guiding the blockchain\u2019s future trajectory. As ETH continues to evolve, these discussions play a critical role in shaping its path toward a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform."

        "content": "Recent price movements and potential signals point towards a bullish narrative, hinting at an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine Ethereum\u2019s market stature. Ethereum price crashed right after the ETF approval, which was unexpected for most investors. What might be the reason? Is there any hope for Ethereum price to go up?\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price DOWN?\n\nIn the past seven days, Ethereum has experienced a notable price downturn, declining from $2,600 to $2,300. This substantial drop of $300 reflects a significant shift in market sentiment and raises questions about the factors contributing to this downward movement. Metrics such as trading volume, market capitalization, and key technical indicators should be closely examined to better understand the extent of this price crash.\n\nIn fact, most day traders were anticipating this huge event led many speculators to short cryptos, including Ethereum.\n\nWill an Ethereum ETF Approval Help ETH Prices?\n\nThe vigorous market movement is fueled by speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has intensified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. An Ethereum ETF approval could serve as a significant catalyst, attracting a new wave of institutional and retail investment.\n\nShould you Buy Ethereum Today?\n\nInvestors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions haven\u2019t triggered the expected volatility, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to Bitcoin\u2019s investment landscape. It is advised currently to wait for Ethereum to stabilize around a support price before taking any position on ETH.\n\nFrom the looks of it, it seems as if Ethereum is eyeing the next support price of $2,280 and the next support at $2,200.\n\nWhere to Trade Ethereum?\n\nBitget emerges as an excellent choice for cryptocurrency enthusiasts seeking a reliable broker for purchasing digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH). The platform stands out for offering some of the lowest fees in the market, making it a cost-effective option for traders looking to maximize their returns.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH BITGET <\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Ethereum has been significantly down in the past week with a current 17.9% share of the market. Although, it remains bullish on the higher timeframe, looking for a support line to foot a fresh increase.\n\nAfter breaking higher to a multi-month high of $2,717 two weeks ago, Ethereum initiated a drop and quickly lost steam, closing that week slightly bearish.\n\nLast week\u2019s trading started a bit strong but later ended in a red following several drops. From that multi-month high, ETH has seen almost 15% loss and is now trading below the $2,400 level.\n\nWhile it is still within a buying range, the ascending trend line remains a crucial dynamic support to watch for a possible resurge. This setup should come into play if Bitcoin stays a bit calm above its one-month low. But from the look of things, a breakdown is more likely to occur.\n\nFailure to initiate a buy from this dynamic support may result in a further dip, which is capable of slipping the price towards the $2,100 level, held as an important support for the past month.\n\nAs can be seen on the daily chart, the price is trading far above this important level. A monthly close below this level could trigger a crackdown to $2,000 before resuming positive actions.\n\nETH\u2019s Key Level To Watch\n\nNow that the $2,300 level stands as a potential rebound area for Ethereum, a broader correction could plunge the price to the low of $2,222. The support below this level is located at $2,100.\n\nThe recent breakdown level of $2,445 is now serving as an immediate resistance on the daily chart. Above this resistance lies the $2,566 and $2,717. Overcoming these levels could fuel more rally in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $2,445, $2,566, $2,717\n\nKey Support Levels: $2,300, $2,222, $2,142\n\nSpot Price: $2,373\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you're a regular DeFi user on Ethereum, you\u2019ve likely had transactions fail from time to time because you didn\u2019t pony up enough ETH for gas\u20140x aims to solve that.\n\n0x\u2014a prominent developer of web3 infrastructure, including the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) Matcha\u2014today announced the launch of their newest trading API: Tx Relay.\n\nTx Relay facilitates \u201cgasless\u201d swaps, or the ability to swap between cryptocurrencies without spending any ETH on gas fees. Gas fees are the costs a user pays to execute a transaction\u2014whether it\u2019s a swap, a mint, or a token approval, it needs gas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe problem is, on average, 8-10% of DEX transactions fail, and this figure spikes up to 20% during times of network congestion (when Ethereum is experiencing an abnormally high volume of transactions). The Tx Relay API abstracts away the usual process of pre-emptively setting how much gas you want to use on your transaction by covering all the gas needed for the transaction and combining it into the transaction itself.\n\nThe cost of the gas is then added to the swap, and paid by the user in the form of the token they\u2019re swapping. The API is available today on Ethereum and Polygon, but the team plans to launch on Arbitrum shortly after in Q1 of 2024.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Product Manager Claudia Haddad believes that network fees have been a top pain point for the last few years. The simplified trading experience gasless swaps create is a \u201chuge UX unlock,\u201d she told Decrypt.\n\nCrypto users are no strangers to gas fees and the headaches that come with them. Coinbase, which is both an investor in 0x and a beta tester for the new API, claims that 69% of Ethereum swaps encounter a \u201cnot enough gas\u201d error when the user starts the trade. Figuring out gas fees, or getting your transactions to execute at all during times of high congestion, are common pain points for the average crypto trader. They\u2019re also common hurdles for new crypto users.\n\nFor example, gas can typically only be paid in the blockchain\u2019s native token. For example, on Ethereum you pay in ETH. A common mistake many new crypto traders make is not leaving enough Ethereum in their wallet to cover transaction costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a similar vein, crypto wallet Giddy last year announced what it called the \"first-ever Autogas feature for Polygon,\" which allowed users perform transactions on Polygon without holding MATIC in their balance\u2014paying with the USDC stablecoin instead. \u201cWe believe \u2018Autogas\u2019 will become an industry standard in the not so distant future,\u201dsaid Giddy co-founder and CEO Eric Parker at the time.\n\nWith 0x\u2019s new gasless swap, users don\u2019t have to worry about maintaining a balance of whatever their blockchain\u2019s gas token is, the fee is deducted from their trade in the background.\n\nGasless swaps made using the Tx Relay API also benefit from MEV protection. In simple terms, that means protection against bots and other advanced tools. While sophisticated traders often run their trades through private mempools or custom RPCs, most users are either unaware or just plain too lazy to implement the basic protections available. The Tx Relay API aims to abstract this too away from the user.\n\nExample of how a trade using Tx Relay works. Image: 0x\n\nLast year, crypto wallet Giddy announced what it called the \"first-ever Autogas feature for Polygon,\" which allowed users perform transactions on Polygon without holding MATIC in their balance and paying with USDC instead. \u201cWe believe \u2018Autogas\u2019 will become an industry standard in the not so distant future,\u201dsaid Giddy co-founder and CEO Eric Parker at the time.\n\nGasless swaps have been pretty popular with 0x users during their beta. Coinbase reported thousands of users using them in December alone. Matcha has also reported that using the feature reduced failed trades by 85%. When asked how the new API would deal with large spikes in network congestion, 0x co-CEO and co-founder Amir Bandeali said cases of congestion-related failed transactions were rare, but when they occur, the transactions would be automatically resubmitted and executed.\n\nIf everything works as expected, this could create a much better overall user experience for crypto traders, and make the task of conducting on-chain transactions less intimidating to new users.\n\nEditor's note: this article was updated to add mention of the Giddy wallet's gasless approach."

Our analysis revealed that investors were exerting buying pressure on the token. This was evident from the fact that Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges dipped while its supply outside of exchanges went up.\n\nAdditionally, whales were also confident in ETH as its supply held by top addresses increased last week.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nConsidering the high ecosystem activity and buying pressure, the possibility of a price uptick in the coming days can\u2019t be ruled out. Therefore, AMBCrypto then took a look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap to see the upcoming resistance levels.\n\nOur analysis revealed that ETH would face strong resistance near the $2,600 mark. If it managed to climb above that level, it would again face resistance between $2,770 and $2,800."

        "title": "Ethereums Future: Will Ethereum Recover? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In this exploration, we tackle the critical question: Will Ethereum recover? We\u2019ll look at Ethereums future and analyze ETH\u2019s present market status, potential for resurgence, the anticipated impact of the progress on Ethereum 2.0, and share expert price predictions.\n\nWill Ethereum Recover? Analysis\n\nThe question \u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201d depends on numerous factors. As of November 2023, Ethereum has shown signs of rebounding from its 2022 lows, suggesting a potential bottoming out. Key developments like the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the introduction of EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 1559, launched all the way back in August 2021, which brings deflationary pressure on Ethereum\u2019s supply, making it a more attractive investment.\n\nAdditionally, Layer 2 (L2) technologies are enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability, addressing previous challenges of high transaction fees and slow speeds. Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the smart contracts sector and its substantial role in the decentralized finance ecosystem further strengthen its recovery prospects. However, predicting the exact trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s recovery remains complex, with varying forecasts suggesting both potential ups and downs in the near future.\n\nEthereums Future: Top-10 Factors Impacting ETH Price\n\nThese ten factors could be crucial for answering the question \u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201c:\n\n#1 Future Upgrades:\n\nEthereum\u2019s development roadmap includes significant upgrades like Proto-Danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, and Full Danksharding, which could greatly impact its scalability and functionality. The successful implementation of these upgrades can boost confidence in the network and the Ethereums future price.\n\n#2 Regulatory Approvals:\n\nRegulatory decisions, such as the approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), can have a substantial impact on Ethereum\u2019s status as a digital asset. BlackRock filed for a spot ETH ETF in mid-November 2023.\n\n#3 Overall Crypto Market Trends:\n\nEthereum\u2019s performance is closely tied to the broader cryptocurrency market. A general uptrend in the crypto market, catalyzed by events like the Bitcoin halving, can positively influence Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\n#4 ETH Burn Rate:\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism includes a mechanism called EIP-1559, which introduces a fee-burning mechanism. The more ETH is burned in transactions, the scarcer it becomes, potentially increasing its value.\n\n#5 Layer-2 Solutions:\n\nThe adoption and success of Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, can significantly improve the network\u2019s scalability and reduce transaction fees. This could attract more users and developers.\n\n#6 DeFi And NFT Activity:\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem heavily relies on DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) applications. Increased adoption and activity in these sectors can drive demand for ETH and positively impact its price.\n\n#7 Competition:\n\nEthereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms like Solana and Cardano. The success or failure of these competitors can affect Ethereum\u2019s market position.\n\n#8 Macroeconomic Factors:\n\nEconomic events, such as inflation, monetary policy decisions, and global financial crises, can influence investors\u2019 choices. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are sometimes seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability.\n\n#9 Network Security:\n\nThe security of the Ethereum network is crucial. High-profile hacks or vulnerabilities can undermine trust in the platform and lead to price declines.\n\n#10 Ecosystem Development:\n\nThe growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, including the number of dApps, users, and developers, can affect its adoption and value.\n\nEIP-1559: Understanding The Ethereum Burn Rate\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn rate is a key aspect of its economics, influencing both its supply dynamics and long-term valuation. To grasp the Ethereum burn introduced with EIP-1559, examining the latest data and understanding how this mechanism operates within the Ethereum ecosystem is crucial.\n\nEthereum Is \u201cUltra Sound Money\u201d\n\nEIP-1559 was a proposal that fundamentally restructured Ethereum\u2019s fee market. Before this proposal, miners received the entire transaction fee. With activation on August 5, 2021, EIP-1559 introduced a base fee for transactions, which is burned (permanently removed from circulation), and only an optional tip is given to miners. This mechanism aims to make transaction fees more predictable and the network more efficient.\n\nThe \u201cultra sound money\u201d meme emerged from the community in response to EIP-1559. It plays on the concept of \u201csound money,\u201d a term traditionally used to describe money that is not prone to depreciation and is a reliable store of value, like gold.\n\nWith EIP-1559, Ethereum\u2019s supply becomes more predictable and potentially deflationary\u2014if the amount of ETH burned exceeds the new ETH issued, the total supply will decrease over time, hence the term \u201cultra sound money.\u201d This is seen as an enhancement over \u201csound money,\u201d with Ethereum not just maintaining its value but potentially increasing it due to the decreasing supply.\n\nEthereum Burn Rate Projections\n\nThe attached chart underscores the impact of these changes on Ethereum\u2019s supply, especially post-EIP-1559, where the supply curve starts to flatten, suggesting a reduction in the growth of Ethereum\u2019s total supply. This aligns with the concept of Ethereum becoming a deflationary asset post-EIP-1559, contributing to the narrative that Ethereum\u2019s future could be as an \u201cultra sound\u201d form of money.\n\nOn November 17, 2023, the Ethereum supply stood at 88 million ETH in accounts, 3.7 million ETH in contracts, and 28.5 million ETH in validators, totaling 120.3 million ETH. The dotted line indicates Ethereums future decrease in total supply due to the burning of ETH and the issuance changes post-Merge. The chart projects that the ETH supply will shrink to 117.7 million ETH in November 2025.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future: Will Ethereum Go Back Up?\n\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency, technical analysis serves as a navigational tool to gauge market sentiment and potential price movements. Examining the 1-week ETH/USD chart provides insight into Ethereum\u2019s price action and helps address the burning question: \u201cwill Ethereum recover?\u201d\n\nFibonacci Levels And Price Targets\n\nThe chart showcases several Fibonacci retracement levels, which are crucial in identifying potential support and resistance zones based on previous price movements. Here are the key Fibonacci retracement levels highlighted:\n\n0.236: At $1,847, this level acts as a potential support zone.\n\nAt $1,847, this level acts as a potential support zone. 0.382: $2,441 is the next key Fib level, displaying the next resistance.\n\n$2,441 is the next key Fib level, displaying the next resistance. 0.5: The $2,922 level represents a psychological midpoint.\n\nThe $2,922 level represents a psychological midpoint. 0.618: At $3,402, this level is often considered the \u2018golden ratio,\u2019 a significant reversal point.\n\nAt $3,402, this level is often considered the \u2018golden ratio,\u2019 a significant reversal point. 0.786: $4,085 is a deeper retracement level that can signal strength in the prevailing trend.\n\n$4,085 is a deeper retracement level that can signal strength in the prevailing trend. 1: The full retracement level at $4,956 marks a complete return to all-time high.\n\nThe full retracement level at $4,956 marks a complete return to all-time high. 1.618 : At $7,471, this extended Fib level could be the first long-term bullish target.\n\n: At $7,471, this extended Fib level could be the first long-term bullish target. 2.618: $11,540 represents an optimistic projection in a strong Ethereum bull run.\n\n$11,540 represents an optimistic projection in a strong Ethereum bull run. 3.618: This level at $15,609 would be an extraordinary target for a sustained bull run.\n\nThis level at $15,609 would be an extraordinary target for a sustained bull run. 4.236: The $18,123 Fib level is the highest projected target on the chart, indicating an extreme bull case scenario.\n\nTrend Lines, Resistance Zones And RSI\n\nThe chart shows a black ascending trend line, tracing the lows and signifying a potential area of support that Ethereum\u2019s price could respect. If the price maintains above this line, it may indicate continued bullish sentiment.\n\nThe red box, or resistance zone, around the Year-To-Date (YTD) high at $2,137 underscores a region where sellers have previously entered the market. Overcoming this zone is critical for Ethereum to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), sitting at 48.07, shows Ethereum is neither in the overbought nor oversold territory. This indicates a neutral momentum, which could precede a move in either direction.\n\nConclusion: Will Ethereum Recover?\n\nWhile the chart presents strong arguments for an Ethereum bull run, with ETH price sustaining above critical support levels and challenging notable resistance zones, the future price action will depend on how the market interacts with these technical indicators. If Ethereum can break through the resistance encapsulated by the YTD high, we could see an affirmative answer to \u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201d However, it is imperative for investors to monitor these levels closely, as they serve as a roadmap, not a crystal ball.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction By NewsBTC\u2019s Head Of Research\n\nTony \u201cThe Bull\u201d Severino, NewsBTC\u2019s Head of Research, has provided an in-depth analysis of Ethereum\u2019s market behavior in his latest edition of Coin Chartist. He observes, \u201cEthereum has yet to begin trending with a reading above 20 on the ADX, nor has it broken above the upper Bollinger Band. But these signals are likely coming soon.\u201d This suggests Ethereum\u2019s significant uptrend might be on the horizon.\n\nComparing Ethereum with Bitcoin, Severino notes, \u201cETHUSD is much lower within the Ichimoku Cloud than BTCUSD,\u201d indicating Ethereum is currently lagging behind Bitcoin. However, he anticipates Ethereum will soon \u201cswitch to over-performance.\u201d\n\nHighlighting a positive development, Severino states, \u201cETHUSD 1W was finally able to crack above its TDST downtrend resistance.\u201d Yet, Ethereum needs to form a perfected TD9 series for further bullish confirmation. On the monthly chart, Ethereum\u2019s overbought status on the Stochastic indicator suggests a strong trend, as Severino points out, \u201cEach time the Stochastic has confirmed a 1M above 80 on the Stock, there was a massive push higher.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Severino underscores the importance of Ethereum\u2019s performance against Bitcoin, \u201cBut if ETHBTC can push back above 20 this will generate a buy signal on the 1M Stochastic and kickstart Ether\u2019s over-performance above Bitcoin.\u201d This analysis provides a detailed perspective on Ethereum\u2019s potential future trajectory in the crypto market.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Price Prediction\n\nThe continuous evolution of Ethereum through its 2.0 upgrades sets the stage for an optimistic price prediction. As the network becomes more scalable, secure, and sustainable, the intrinsic value of Ethereum is likely to increase.\n\nThe successful completion of the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, which introduced staking, is already a significant milestone that demonstrates the network\u2019s commitment to its roadmap. Such advancements are expected to reinforce investor confidence and could catalyze a bullish outlook for Ethereums future price.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Roadmap\n\nEthereum 2.0 represents a series of upgrades aimed at improving the network\u2019s scalability, security, and sustainability. Contrary to the previous term \u2018ETH2\u2019, the roadmap is now defined by more specific upgrade milestones:\n\nPast and Completed Upgrades\n\nThe Merge: This critical upgrade on September 15, 2022 marked Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) and was a foundational step in the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, eliminating the need for energy-intensive mining.\n\nAnother key feature, staking withdrawals has already been enabled with the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, which went live on April 12, 2023\u200b\n\nFuture Ethereum Upgrades\n\nThe Surge: The next phase involves scalability improvements through rollups and data sharding. Danksharding, a key component, aims to make layer 2 rollups cheaper by incorporating \u201cblobs\u201d of data into Ethereum blocks\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe next phase involves scalability improvements through rollups and data sharding. Danksharding, a key component, aims to make layer 2 rollups cheaper by incorporating \u201cblobs\u201d of data into Ethereum blocks\u200b\u200b. The Scourge: This phase focuses on ensuring censorship resistance, decentralization, and addressing protocol risks, such as those arising from miner extractable value (MEV).\n\nThis phase focuses on ensuring censorship resistance, decentralization, and addressing protocol risks, such as those arising from miner extractable value (MEV). The Verge: It is designed to make verifying blocks easier.\n\nIt is designed to make verifying blocks easier. The Purge: This stage aims to reduce computational costs and simplify the protocol, making running nodes more efficient.\n\nThis stage aims to reduce computational costs and simplify the protocol, making running nodes more efficient. The Splurge: This includes miscellaneous upgrades that do not fit into the other categories but are essential for the network\u2019s growth and enhancement\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Ethereum community has replaced the term \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d with more specific names for each upgrade, providing clearer insight into the network\u2019s transition and improvements. These upgrades aim to turn Ethereum into a fully scaled, resilient platform, capable of supporting a global decentralized application system. As implementation of these phases progresses, Ethereum\u2019s growing appeal as an investment could positively influence its price predictions.\n\nProto-Danksharding: EIP-4844\n\nEIP-4844 introduces \u201cshard blob transactions\u201d to enhance Ethereum\u2019s data availability in a way that aligns with future full sharding plans. This proposal creates a new transaction format containing \u201cblobs\u201d \u2013 large data segments essential for rollups, a Layer 2 solution, but inaccessible for EVM execution. It serves as a temporary scaling solution, bridging the gap until full sharding implementation.\n\nNotably, rollups have become increasingly important for scaling Ethereum, as they offer a way to execute transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) and then post the data back to Layer 1. EIP-4844\u2019s format is expected to greatly reduce transaction fees for rollups by offering a cheaper data storage mechanism compared to current methods\u200b\u200b.\n\nFull Danksharding\n\nFull Danksharding, which advances from Proto-Danksharding, will likely further reduce costs for Layer 2 rollups. It introduces \u201cblobs\u201d in a format slated for use in the final sharding design. This includes a new transaction type and an independent fee market for these blobs.\n\nFull Danksharding will build on Proto-Danksharding and aims to further cut Layer 2 rollups\u2019 costs. It will comprehensively implement data availability sampling and essential components for a fully sharded Ethereum network, including proposer-builder separation and proof of custody. This approach aims to assign only a portion of the data to validators, reducing the network\u2019s load and enhancing scalability.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Price Predictions: Will Ethereum Recover?\n\nAs Ethereum continues to progress with its 2.0 upgrades, the financial community has been actively speculating on its future value. Here are some Ethereum price predictions from renowned institutions and analysts, answering the question \u201cwill Ethereum recover\u201d:\n\nVanEck: The investment management firm predicts that Ethereum\u2019s price could reach as high as $11.8k by 2030. This projection is based on their assessment that Ethereum\u2019s network revenues could rise from $2.6 billion to $51 billion in 2030, assuming Ethereum captures a 70% market share among smart contract platforms.\n\nStandard Chartered: Analysts at Standard Chartered are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential. They forecast that the price of ETH could hit $4,000 by the end of 2024 and double to $8,000 by the end of 2026. Their Ethereum bull run prediction is based on Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms and the potential for emerging uses in areas like gaming and tokenization. Moreover, they suggest that the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024 could positively impact the broader crypto market, especially Ethereum\u200b.\n\nAlso, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the US could significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s price. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in mid-November 2023. The approval of this ETF would mark a major milestone for Ethereum, potentially attracting more institutional and retail investments and substantially boosting Ethereum\u2019s market price.\n\nFAQ: Ethereums Future\n\nWill Ethereum recover?\n\nEthereum\u2019s recovery depends on various factors including market trends, technological advancements, and broader economic conditions.

        "title": "Ethereum Drops After the SEC Delays Fidelity ETF, XRP, RON, SOL, Jan. 22 - Bitrates",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s expected ETF launch was delayed leading to sharp losses. XRP and SOL unwind speculative gains. RON leads the pack after an upgrade.\n\nETH\n\nEthereum lost over 5% this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed an exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering from Fidelity.\n\nAfter approving eleven bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC decided to delay a decision on Fidelity's Ethereum ETF application until at least March.\n\nAccording to a filing, the regulator wants more time to deliberate on the decision.\n\n\u201cThe SEC finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nThe move was expected by many after asset manager Fidelity filed its application last November, a month after ETFs for ether futures were approved. The Boston-based firm was making a similar move as rival asset manager BlackRock which also filed a spot ether ETF application. Stuart Barton at Volatility Shares said:\n\nThe fact that they allowed listing of the futures-based ETFs is enough to say they are thinking about ether the same way they are thinking about bitcoin and you can infer from that they're probably thinking it's not a security and not going to regulate it that way.\n\nBitcoin ETFs went live earlier this month and have already gained $1 billion from investors. The price action in Bitcoin, which has fallen 4% over the last week, has disappointed many investors who were buying into Bitcoin expecting a surge after the ETF launch.\n\nETH starts the week looking for buyer support with the $2,200 level as a possible target.\n\nXRP\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token had a rough week with losses of over 7.5% as court issues loom.\n\nThe SEC vs Ripple case continues to drag on and the regulator may have asked for post-complaint documents to argue a more punitive penalty for XRP sales to U.S. investors and entities. In July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple breached Section 5 of the 1933 Securities Act when selling XRP tokens. If the Judge orders Ripple to provide the new documents, further breaches of Section 5 could hurt XRP.\n\nRipple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty posted more views about the hearing, saying,\n\n\u201cLast week (in Coinbase), the SEC told the Court that the question is \u201cwhether investors are \u201cpooling [their] capital with the promoter\u2019s efforts.\u201d That\u2019s wrong. Howey demands more than investing in efforts. You have to invest in a common enterprise. Revak (2d Cir. 1984).\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to bring it back to Howey compels us to look at the economic reality of whether investors are giving up their capital and pooling that capital with the promotor\u2019s efforts. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s being done here.\u201d\n\nThe SEC case has been a headwind for the XRP price since it was announced in December 2021. After some recent price gains following the speculative moves of Bitcoin, XRP has given up its advance and now heads for the $0.50 price again.\n\nRON\n\nRonin (RON) gained 35% this week after additional support was announced for crypto tokens.\n\nSky Mavis, the creator of the play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, has announced an upgrade to the Ronin blockchain's crypto wallet. The new features include multichain support, an in-app web browser, a new design, and support for multi-party computation (MPC).\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance\u2019s BNB Chain. The latest upgrade allows users to manage and transfer assets across different blockchain networks from a single wallet. The new version of the Ronin wallet includes an in-app web browser that enables users to access decentralized applications (dApps) and interact with blockchain-based services directly from the wallet.\n\nThe wallet's design has been updated to show more information on token activities and NFT information. The Ronin wallet now supports MPC, which requires two or more pieces of login information instead of a single private key. The wallet can also be used across different games such as Axie Infinity and Pixels without creating separate wallets for each game.\n\nThe Ronin wallet upgrade is a significant step forward for the Ronin ecosystem, providing users with a more versatile and secure platform for managing their digital assets. The addition of multichain support and other features is likely to attract new users and further drive the adoption of the Ronin blockchain.\n\nRON trades at $2.35 and has jumped into the top 100 coins at number 90.\n\nSOL\n\nSolana was one of the big losers in the top ten cryptos with a drop of over 7% for the week.\n\nThe project\u2019s BONK meme token also suffered with a 6.70% loss over the last seven days. Solana is still ranked at number five in the list of crypto tokens with a valuation of over $48 billion.\n\nCoinShares stated in its weekly crypto report that there were outflows of $21 million in cryptocurrency products last week. The majority of the outflows were said to be in Bitcoin and likely due to profit-taking.\n\nBTC experienced an outflow of $24.7 million last week, while Ethereum also saw an outflow of $13.6 million. The Bitcoin Short fund saw an inflow of $12.7 million this week. In the altcoin space, Litecoin experienced an outflow of $ 1.5 million, while Solana experienced an outflow of $ 8.5 million.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency investment products saw small outflows last week, totaling $21 million, but this top-line figure masks very high trading volumes in Bitcoin last week, which totaled $11.8 billion, 7 times the usual weekly trading volume in 2023, the report said.\n\nSOL Price Index\n\nSOL trades at $89 and needs to hold that support level or a swift move to the $60-70 range could happen."

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation heaps pressure on market with $1.68 million in ETH sales - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the blockchain network\u2019s ecosystem, liquidated $1.6 million worth of ETH, according to crypto analytical firm Arkham Intelligence.\n\nData from the platform reveals that the foundation utilized the CoW Protocol to sell 700 ETH, acquiring $1.6 million in DAI stablecoin. Subsequently, the funds were transferred to an address \u201c0x9ee\u2026313D,\u201d identified as the Grant Provider by Etherscan.\n\nThis transaction, which may have occurred when ETH was valued around $2,400, closely mirrors a previous one on Jan. 16. During that instance, the foundation exchanged 100 ETH for $253,000, with the funds also directed to the Grant Provider wallet.\n\nDespite these recent sales, the Ethereum Foundation retains a substantial crypto portfolio. It currently holds 312.894K ETH, valued at approximately $747.40 million, and 31.2K WETH, valued at $74.65 million. Additional assets in its possession include $1.96 million DAI, $113.61K USDC, and $72.97K BUSD.\n\nGiven the considerable volume of ETH held by the foundation, its trading activities often influence the asset\u2019s price movements. Consequently, market observers often monitor its transactions for potential insights into the organization\u2019s plans.\n\nAs such, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s recent selling activities have contributed to a 4.3% decline in Ethereum\u2019s price, which currently trades at $2,386 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade\n\nInterestingly, these fund movements coincide with the recent launch of the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network\u2019s testnet, Goerli, on Jan. 17. This upgrade aims to alleviate gas fees and enhance transaction speed through improvements to the network\u2019s layer-2 rollups.\n\nThe upgrade is the most technical advancement the blockchain network has seen since the Shapella hard fork that allowed the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH).\n\nHowever, a bug delayed the network\u2019s launch for around four hours before the problem was fixed through a patch, allowing the network to run smoothly.\n\nPer Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, the next phase of its development will happen soon, with a planned upgrade to the Sepolia testnet and the Holesky testnet in the offing."

        "content": "Why Ethereum Price is Crashing and What Can Arrest its Fall\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nDespite the announcement of the Ethereum merge, the price of the largest altcoin in the world is crashing. However, an Ethereum increase in price following the new network upgrade? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nEthereum Price Correction\n\nEthereum and the broader cryptocurrency markets have been descending since 2022 \u2013 amidst the economic crisis following the pandemic, increasing inflationary data and interest hikes. In November 2021, Ethereum (ETH) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4,900.\n\nIn the chart above, Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed a significant price correction since 13th September 2022. From $1,748 on the 13th, the largest altcoin plummeted to under $1,300 on September 18th \u2013 equating to a 25% price correction in under a week. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $1,350 \u2013 72% below its November highs.\n\nSurprisingly, the sudden fall in the price of Ethereum has corresponded with the network\u2019s new merge update \u2013 which will see Ethereum shift from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. But why has the token corrected despite the announcement of the merge?\n\nWhat Has Ethereum Corrected?\n\nOn September 15th 2022, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, tweeted announcing the successful launch of the Ethereum verge. Earlier, Ethereum\u2019s network was facing trouble relating to scalability and slow transaction processing times. The new merge is expected to make the network a faster, cheaper and more scalable solution.\n\nDespite the launch, Ethereum has corrected right after the announcement. One of the reasons for this is the \u2018buy the rumour, sell the news\u2019 phenomenon. In trading, this means that a cryptocurrency\u2019s price tends to go up after positive announcements relating to a cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum, the token has recently delivered returns right before the merge news announcement. Between Mid-July to August 14th 2022, Ethereum rose from $1,000 to nearly $2,000 \u2013 a 2x price increase. This was the first sign of a solid upwards movement in the price of Ethereum since April 2022.\n\nMany analysts believe that the recent price correction is due to Ethereum\u2019s already inflated price tag caused by people buying the rumoured way ahead of the actual announcement.\n\nMoreover, the SEC (U.S securities and exchange commission) recently announced that staked cryptocurrencies might be subject to federal securities regulation. This announcement was made by Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, on 15th September 2022 \u2013 just a few hours after the Ethereum merge was finalised.\n\nSince the Ethereum merge will make the token a Proof of Stake cryptocurrency, many correlated the timing of the SEC announcement with Ethereum\u2019s new development. However, the SEC clearly stated that the announcement does not revolve around any particular cryptocurrency.\n\nThese factors may have led to a short-term bearish sentiment in the market, but can Ethereum become one of the best altcoins to invest in the future?\n\nCan Ethereum Go Up?\n\nAs stated above, the \u2018buy the rumour\u2019 sell the news\u2019 phenomenon may have resulted in the instant price decrease of Ethereum. However, the confirmation of the Ethereum news has the potential to make Ethereum one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to watch.\n\nBefore the merge, Ethereum was still the biggest cryptocurrency for developers to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) and NFT-based protocols. The merge aims to make the Ethereum network more sustainable \u2013 since the platform will rely on crypto staking, which is far more sustainable than the Proof of Work concept.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s historical price shows the token\u2019s strength to rebound in the long term. While past performance does not indicate future success, Ethereum\u2019s new upgrade may invite many investors to purchase the token at a lower price.\n\nBuy ETH on eToro\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency analysts are currently divided on the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to Ethereum (ETH), its closest counterpart in market capitalization ranking.\n\nOne prominent analyst, known by the handle @hedge__x on X has predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s price will experience an upward trajectory in the current market cycle.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the forecast comes with a caution \u2013 the analyst suggests that despite the optimism, many investors might find themselves disappointed if the peak only reaches $100,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Ascent Signals Potential\n\nAmidst the varied sentiments surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s projected peak, there is a prevailing belief in the crypto space that Ethereum (ETH) holds significant upside potential.\n\nThe analyst highlighted Ethereum as a potentially more lucrative investment compared to Bitcoin. Similar predictions were made at the start of January that Ethereum would reach $10,000 which prompted a series of debates and analysis.\n\nThis perspective is anchored in the anticipation of several catalysts, prominently the potential introduction of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) product for Ethereum. The sentiment echoes through the crypto community, suggesting that while Bitcoin may experience a peak at $100,000, Ethereum is poised for more substantial gains.\n\nThe ongoing discussion around Bitcoin\u2019s peak performance and Ethereum\u2019s potential rise highlights the complex dynamics that shape the perceptions of analysts and investors in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nFor instance, Samson Mow recently made a big claim on the X platform in his Silver comparison as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold.\u201d In the post, he also took a jab at Ethereum, comparing it to the link between silver and gold. He even made a direct claim that Ethereum is the \u201cstupid man\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBrighter Upsides for ETH\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of the cryptocurrency market, analysts and investors diligently scrutinize multiple factors to make informed predictions and investment decisions. According to some market analysts, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to overtake Bitcoin as the dominant player in the market in 2024.\n\nRegulatory developments, technological advancements, and market trends are among the critical aspects under constant observation. The overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is alluded to by the analyst @hedge__x\u2019s reference of \u201cTotal2\u201d in his analysis.\n\nAs debates rages on in the crypto community, attention will be on Ethereum (ETH), especially as the protocol is undergoing one of its most important upgrades thus far \u2013 the Dencun Upgrade."

However, it raises the question of whether this has influenced the overall transaction volume on these networks.\n\nSui and Solana take in the Ethereum flow\n\nWormhole data showed that around $370 million in liquidity shifted away from Ethereum in the last month. Sui and Solana accounted for about 90% of this outflow.\n\nPresently, these two networks continue to dominate, with an Ethereum outflow totaling over $106.2 million. Sui received around $68 million, while Solana received approximately $27 million, making up a combined 89% of the outflow from Ethereum.\n\nAnalyzing the Sui and Solana volume\n\nA recent analysis of Sui\u2019s volume on DefiLlama showed a significant uptick in the past few days. Examining the chart reveals that the volume witnessed in January surpassed that of the preceding three months.\n\nThe upward trend peaked on 13th January, reaching over 76 million, marking the highest point in months. As of this writing, the volume was around 44 million.\n\nNotably, Sui\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL), despite a recent dip from around $344 million to $322 million, remained at its historically highest level.\n\nConversely, Solana has experienced a shift in volume trends. While the network\u2019s volume increased towards the end of the year, it has witnessed a recent decline. Presently, the volume is over $740 million, reflecting a decrease but still outpacing Sui\u2019s volume.\n\nSOL and SUI post different price trends\n\nAnalyzing the daily price trend of Sui showed an uptrend that peaked around 15th January, reaching around $1.3 with a notable 9% increase.\n\nDuring this rise, the price entered the overbought zone, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). After this peak, the price experienced declines, causing the RSI to dip below 60.\n\nAt present, the price has decreased by nearly 5%, trading at around $1.1.\n\nRead Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIn contrast, Solana has dipped below the neutral line on its RSI, reflecting a decline in the price over the past three days.\n\nAs of this writing, SOL was trading at around $92, marking a decrease of over 1% in its price."

        "content": "ETH\u2019s reserves on exchanges have been on a multi-year downtrend.\n\nIncrease in staking could also result in less volatility for ETH.\n\nUsers have shown heightened interest in Ethereum [ETH] staking since the Shapella Upgrade went live last year in April.\n\nThe freedom to withdraw their holdings at any given point of time restored the credibility in the process, resulting in more number of ETH getting staked into the network.\n\nStaked supply nearing 25%\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant data, the amount of ETH staked as a percentage of the total circulating supply jumped from 15% at the time of the upgrade to 24.5% as of this writing.\n\nInterestingly, the demand for staking lifted despite a marked drop in staking yields, in pursuit of which users participated in the activity in the first place.\n\nThe annualized financial return per validator was 3.64% at press time, down from 5.2% in June 2023.\n\nLiquid supply continues to plummet\n\nIn total contrast, ETH\u2019s reserves on exchanges have been on a multi-year downtrend, with a liquid supply of just around 11% as of this writing.\n\nTo put it simply, the number of ETH coins available for active buying and selling has dipped significantly, creating a scarcity in the market.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIn line with economic fundamentals, an asset\u2019s scarcity boosts its demand in the long-term, provided the demand stays consistent.\n\nThis has been particularly evident in the case of Gold, and much closer home, in Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nHowever, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s supply isn\u2019t hard-capped. Hence, the continued uptick in staking deposits acted as a major catalyst towards making ETH elusive for trading.\n\nMoreover, with more ETH getting locked up, the volatility was bound to drop eventually. This could pave way for steadier prices in the future, akin to a store of value.\n\nOn-chain analyst Leon Waidmann observed these developments and said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing an ETH scarcity like never before, eclipsing all past Bullrun! Eventually, this supply squeeze will lead to a massive price explosion.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green?

The whale now holds 733.2 billion SHIB (approximately $6.79 million) and has largely focused on acquiring SHIB, with minimal selling in the past two years.\n\nAlthough there is no clear way to identify the entity behind the address, further investigation reveals some interesting data. The wallet regularly moves a portion of SHIB to another address that now holds over 1 trillion SHIB tokens ($9.2 million).\n\nAdditionally, the address may be tied to a retail investor or a high-profile fund that invests in SHIB. During its early interactions with Shiba Inu, the address received 36 billion tokens from a prominent crypto exchange, Coinbase.\n\nSHIB Whale Activity On The Rise\n\nThe recent large Shiba Inu accumulation follows a trend of increased whale activity. Data tracker IntoTheBlock shows that whales have moved over $158 million worth of SHIB tokens in the past seven days.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAn increase in whale activity dominated by large buys typically indicates that prices have dropped to a region where large investors consider it necessary to increase their exposure to an asset.\n\nAs previously reported by The Crypto Basic, whale activity on SHIB surged after the cryptocurrency dropped below the $0.000010 support level, which it held for a considerable period.\n\nShiba Inu is trading at $0.00000927, representing a 4% decline in the past week.

        "content": "Before the BTC spot ETF approval, the active validator count on Ethereum fell.\n\nThe network\u2019s participation rate, which dropped before the ETF approval, has climbed.\n\nThe number of active validators on the Ethereum [ETH] Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network has seen a sharp uptick in the past week.\n\nThis is after a period of decline before the approval of the Bitcoin [BTC] spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to data from Glassnode.\n\nInformation retrieved from the on-chain data provider showed between the 4th to the 12th of January, the active validator count on the Ethereum Network fell from 906,470 to 895,784.\n\nThe decline began a day after crypto investment services provider Matrixpot published a report predicting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would reject all Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAs many feared that the prediction might be accurate, leading asset prices plunged, causing over $500 million in liquidations.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, voluntary validator exit climbed to an all-time high of 17,821, and the count of validators that participated in verifying transactions on the chain fell.\n\nHowever, this decline has stopped since the 12th of January. As of the 20th of January, 904,754 validators were active on the Ethereum network, marking a 1% uptick from the former low.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nThe missed block count touched a year-to-date high of 115 blocks on the 6th of January.\n\nThis was because of the hike in validator exit and because some validators took their nodes offline as the market awaited the SEC\u2019s decision on the BTC ETF applications.\n\nA block is said to be missed when the validator charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot is unavailable. Since the hike on the 6th of January, it has trended downward and fallen by 76%.\n\nAs of the 20th of January, only 27 blocks were missed.\n\nDue to the unavailability of a sizable number of validators on the Ethereum chain on the 6th of January, the network\u2019s participation rate plummeted to a four-month low of 98.94%.\n\nAs validators returned online, this rallied and was spotted at 99.59% at press time.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior blockspace efficiency.\n\nAs of this writing, the total number of validators on the Ethereum PoS network was 1.17 million. This year alone, the validator count on the chain has increased by 4%."

Details were scarce, but the hush-hush retreat has now inspired a new initiative\u2014spinoff \u201cZu-villages\u201d funded by Ethereum grants.\n\nEthereum Funds New \u2018Zu-Villages\u2019 Inspired by Invite-Only Gathering\n\n\n\nA recent post on the blockchain crowdfunding platform Gitcoin announced quarterly matching pools totaling 250 ETH, around $590,000 at current prices. This has fueled speculation that Zuzalu may reconvene this year.\n\nThis past weekend I was fortunate enough to join the Zuzalu camp put on by @VitalikButerin and others. @afropolitan welcome me with opened arms and gave us all a sense of being and direction. A short thread on my experience \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/rvL19e4ies \u2014 jordan (@cryptosmiff) May 4, 2023\n\nThe stated goals are advancing \u201cpop-up city\u201d events and supporting technology-driven projects. Recipients can tap into two pools\u2014166.5 ETH for events and 83.5 ETH for tech projects.\n\nTo qualify for the matched funds, at least one team member must have been invited to Zuzalu last year and participated for a minimum of one week. The blog post does not state if Zuzalu is happening again this year or provide details on timing or location.\n\nButerin is supposedly contributing a big portion of the ETH grants, although a representative later backtracked, telling CoinDesk there is no record of Buterin committing funds. His precise involvement is unclear as of now.\n\nZuzalu Retreat Shrouded in Mystery\n\n\n\nThe Zuzalu retreat itself is shrouded in some secrecy. It was never announced beforehand and details trickled out after the fact via social media posts. Some paint it as a glorified camp discussing esoteric topics, while others reference a Silicon Valley exclusivity.\n\nBut it seemingly made an impression on Buterin and other creators who hope to replicate the temporary community under the Zu-village banner. The requirement of at least one core member who attended Zuzalu 2023 hints at an air of exclusivity around the new pop-ups as well."

        "content": "The TDR Three Takeaways:\n\nCrypto User Growth: The global cryptocurrency user base grew by 34% in 2023, increasing from 432 million to 580 million, despite economic and geopolitical headwinds. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead: Bitcoin\u2019s user base expanded by 33% to 296 million, and Ethereum\u2019s grew by 39% to 124 million, signifying their dominance in the digital currency market. Factors and Diversification: Growth was driven by Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, and Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade. There\u2019s notable overlap in Bitcoin and Ethereum ownership, indicating diversification in cryptocurrency investments.\n\nIn 2023, cryptocurrency underwent significant expansion, with global user numbers reaching new heights. Crypto.com\u2019s comprehensive report provides a detailed account of this growth, highlighting a surge in the global cryptocurrency user base by 34%, from 432 million at the beginning of the year to 580 million by its end. This increase occurred despite various macroeconomic challenges, including monetary tightening by Western central banks, geopolitical conflicts, and ongoing pandemic consequences.\n\nThe report reveals that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remained the primary drivers of this growth. The number of Bitcoin owners increased by 33%, rising from 222 million to 296 million, while Ethereum saw a 39% increase in its user base, growing from 89 million to 124 million. These figures suggest a growing acceptance and diversification within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this growth. For Bitcoin, the development of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the introduction of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, which enabled the minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network, played crucial roles. The Ethereum network, on the other hand, benefited from its Shanghai Upgrade, which introduced liquid staking and allowed for the withdrawal of staked ETH, further driving its adoption.\n\nThe report also touches on the overlap in ownership between Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that 40.9% of Bitcoin owners also own Ethereum, while 42% of cryptocurrency users do not hold either BTC or ETH. This indicates a diversification in cryptocurrency investments among users.\n\nIn terms of methodology, Crypto.com\u2019s report combines on-chain data with a blend of parameters to estimate global cryptocurrency ownership. This approach, while comprehensive, acknowledges certain limitations, such as potential inaccuracies in capturing over-the-counter (OTC) trading and users who have never made on-chain transactions. Despite these limitations, the report provides a valuable snapshot of the cryptocurrency landscape in 2023.\n\nIn summary, 2023 marked a year of robust growth in the cryptocurrency sector. The surge in global cryptocurrency users, driven by increased adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlights the expanding reach and evolving nature of digital currencies. This growth, achieved in the face of economic and geopolitical challenges, underscores the resilience and growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "What Are Parallelized EVMs? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, allowing multiple transactions to be executed at the same time rather than sequentially.\n\nThe blockchain landscape is constantly evolving to overcome limitations and unlock new possibilities. One of the latest innovations to address scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem is Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs).\n\nRead on to learn about parallelized EVMs and the potential impact of parallelization on Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nWhat Are Parallelized EVMs?\n\nTo understand parallelized EVMs, let\u2019s first grasp the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe EVM allows for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. It provides the infrastructure vital to all transactions happening on the blockchain. The growing adoption of Ether and other Ethereum-based tokens strains the EVM, leading to calls for its scaling.\n\nOne intervention that\u2019s gaining traction is parallelized EVMs.\n\nParallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency by allowing multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\nImagine them as supercharged versions of their predecessor capable of handling multiple transactions together. This approach is crucial in tackling the blockchain trilemma as it significantly reduces latency, boosting transaction throughput.\n\nSome of the front runners in the PEVM adoption are the Sei network, Neon, and Monad. The Sei Network went live in August 2023, attracting roughly 29,000 active users. Neon is also active and working on integrating Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) into the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, Monard is yet to launch despite being production-ready.\n\nHow Do Parallelized EVMs Work?\n\nPEVMs leverage the power of parallel processing to achieve timely and scalable transactions.\n\nUnlike the typical EVMs that handle transactions back-to-back, PEVMs split transactions into smaller, independent tasks that can be tackled simultaneously. This means setting up different points for the concurrent handling of multiple trades.\n\nThere are many approaches to parallel processing, but two popular ones stand out:\n\nSharding : Imagine dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, self-contained shards, each with its own EVM. Transactions are then distributed across these shards, allowing for independent and simultaneous processing.\n\nRollups: These batch transactions off the main Ethereum chain, processing them on a separate layer, and then re-submitting them to the mainnet for verification. This significantly reduces the burden on the main Ethereum network, leading to faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Potential Impact of Parallelized EVMs on Ethereum\n\nPEVMs can significantly reduce transaction times and fees by removing network bottlenecks, making Ethereum more user-friendly and accessible to developers and users alike.\n\nWith PEVMs paving the way for faster and cheaper transactions, Ethereum can potentially handle a much larger volume of activity. This opens the door to widespread adoption of dApps and DeFi, bringing the power of blockchain to a broader audience.\n\nThe increased processing power of PEVMs could unleash a wave of more complex and resource-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on Ethereum. Applications that might have previously been impractical on the blockchain could become feasible.\n\nAdditionally, making improvements on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet could significantly impact other Ethereum layers. L2 scaling solutions could gain more attention, leading to further development and adoption among users.\n\nPEVMs, however, also present a possible downside. The technical complexity required to implement parallelized EVMs might lead to centralization if only a few big players can implement it. They could also present backward compatibility and transition challenges to existing smart contracts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Parallelized EVMs\n\nPEVMs could hold so much promise for crypto enthusiasts. But like any technology, it could have its drawbacks too.\n\nPros\n\nReduced transaction latency: Devolving transaction handling to many units hastens their confirmation. Users will no longer have to endure lengthy completion times due to network clogging.\n\nLower transaction fees: PEVMs streamline transactions, eliminating the need to pay more for prioritized exchanges, which makes transaction fees more affordable.\n\nEnhanced Interoperability: PEVM projects such as Neon are working on bringing Ethereum dApps to Solana. Such initiatives will make it easy for users to interact with their peers on different networks without migrating to their platforms.\n\nCons\n\nIncreased complexity: Implementing and maintaining robust PEVMs can be technically demanding. As such, developers and users may face a steep learning curve.\n\nPotential security risks: Parallel processing introduces new synchronization and coordination challenges, increasing the likelihood of bugs and errors with improper implementation\n\nFinal Word\n\nParallelized EVMs are the latest attempt at achieving Ethereum scalability. By introducing parallel processing capabilities, PEVMs open the doors to various applications, from real-time financial transactions to seamless cross-chain exchanges. However, these novel projects require meticulous development and rigorous security edits to ensure stability."

        "content": "Ethereum continues to be the number one blockchain among crypto developers, with more than 70% of new contract codes first deployed on the network, according to the latest report by Electric Capital.\n\nAlso, there has been a spread in the distribution of developers globally, with more crypto devs living outside North America, as opposed to steady growth recorded in regions such as Latin America and Western Africa.\n\nMore Devs Involved in Multi-Chains\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s 2023 Crypto Developer Report revealed that most of the smart contract code launched on the Ethereum network is unique, while 71% of contracts are first deployed on Ethereum, making it the top blockchain choice for developers.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of multi-chain developers expanded in 2023. Based on the report, multi-chain developers grew from three percent in 2015 to 34% in 2023, signaling a growth of over 10x in eight years.\n\nIt is also no surprise to see the cross-pollination of developers across Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. Such blockchains include BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and several layer 2 networks. These chains all use the same smart contract logic as Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital, cross-pollination occurs between BNB Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum, with all three chains sharing \u201cat least 30% of their multi-chain deployers with each other.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, BNB shares the largest number of multi-chain devs, with Ethereum at 39%, followed by Polygon at 36% and Arbitrum at 24%, while Avalanche is the lowest at 18%.\n\n40% of Developers Worked on Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2023\n\nIn all, a fourth of all blockchain developers deploy either on Ethereum or Bitcoin, with the latter accounting for a larger number of monthly active developers at 7,864 as of December 2023, which was, however, a 25% drop from over 10,400 the previous year,\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, recorded 1,071 monthly active developers, declining 19% from 1,322 in December 2022. Most of the decline came from part-time developers and those working on multi-chains, with the report noting that developers who focused solely on Bitcoin were likely to continue working on the network.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1000 developers have supported Bitcoin since 2017. The highest number of new developers joined the network in 2022, at over 2,700.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin transaction volumes skyrocketed in 2023 following the resurgence of Ordinals, only three percent of all Bitcoin developers worked on the project, while 40% were dedicated to Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling solutions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, there were also over 9,300 monthly active developers working on the top 200 crypto ecosystems by market capitalization as of December 2023. The figure, however, is a 31% reduction from 2022 records.\n\nTotal Number of Blockchain Devs Fell By Almost a Quarter in 2023\n\nAs noted on Electric Capital\u2019s report, monthly active developers dropped 24% to 22,411 in 2023, from 29,611 the previous year, with newcomers less than one year in crypto contributing to a majority of the losses.\n\nMost of these developers with the least tenured experience came into the industry during the bull market and tended to leave during the bear market. The number of newcomers peaked in 2022 at over 90,000 after Bitcoin\u2019s value rose to more than $69,000 and the total market capitalization at nearly $3 trillion in November 2021\n\n\u201cNewcomers who joined in 2022 are the ones who churned and are driving the overall -24% developer loss.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, those who have been in crypto for at least over a year continue to grow and contribute to the ecosystem, with 75% of codes by such developers.\n\nBlockchain developers with more than one year of experience in the industry grew 16% in 2023, while their established colleagues \u2014 people over two years in crypto \u2014 grew 52% in the last five years, reaching an all-time high.\n\nThe report also touched on developer distribution globally, stating that 74% are located outside of North America, while the US lost 14% of its developer share since 2018, controlling only 26% in 2023.\n\nBlockchain developers, however, are growing in Latin America, Western Africa, South Asia, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe, increasing by 20% since 2018."

        "content": "For a lot of people, the idea of running a validator node can be nerve-wracking and intimidating. But MetaMask has emphasized that there is no need for technical know-how.\n\nWhen it comes to earning money from cryptocurrency, staking is popular among users for various reasons. These include being relatively low-risk, convenient, and so on. For Ethereum users who are interested in staking, a new option has emerged within the market from popular wallet provider MetaMask.\n\nThe provider announced on January 18, 2024, that users can now earn interest on their ETH tokens through validator staking. This will involve them depositing at least 32 ETH and managing their activities directly from their MetaMask portfolio.\n\nDetails About the Development\n\nOne of the things that MetaMask noted in its announcement is that users do not need to manage the hardware or software for staking by themselves. Instead, this will be done through Consensys Staking, which has notably run 33,000+ validators with zero slashed so far. Other accolades it boasts of include 99.99% validator uptime and up to 7% higher rewards rate than the network average.\n\nThose who choose to engage in validator staking using MetaMask also get to enjoy self-custody as they do so. While MetaMask handles the backend of the operation, the customer does not have to surrender their tokens. There is also a lot of emphasis on the removal of technical barriers.\n\nFor a lot of people, the idea of running a validator node can be nerve-wracking and intimidating. But MetaMask has emphasized that there is no need for technical know-how. This new program, \u201cunlocks simplicity and accessibility, removes the technical barriers needed to secure the network, democratizes participation in Ethereum staking for those unable or unwilling to solo stake,\u201d while also making withdrawals and deposits simpler.\n\nMetaMask users were instructed to navigate to their wallets and simply select the \u2018stake\u2019 option. Once done, they will have to select how much they want to stake (in multiples of 32 ETH) and can start earning rewards from there.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum switched from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022. When the Ethereum Foundation announced this change, it was touted as a way to make the network more environmentally friendly. Not only has it reduced the energy use of the network by over 95% but it also offers users the chance to stake and earn rewards from doing so.\n\nClearly, there has been a high demand for ETH staking as MetaMask notes $40 billion that has been staked thus far. And by making the process of validator staking more accessible to everyone, we can expect even more investors to get on board. Should Ethereum witness the bull run, ETF approval, and major other milestones that analysts are predicting, the ecosystem as a whole should enjoy a very successful year."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nCardano\u2019s whale transaction volumes and NFT sales have been notable lately.\n\nADA\u2019s price has recently underperformed compared to ETH, but experts anticipate a potential rally influenced by upcoming events and developments in the crypto industry.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, Cardano whales have settled an average of $13 billion in large daily transactions for the past week. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s figure stood at $5 billion.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum\u2019s $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nCardano has also made progress on the non-fungible token field, with an NFT sales volume of over $7.6 million for the last 30 days. Ethereum might be a leader with approximately $341 million, but this actually represents a 23% decline on a monthly basis.\n\nDespite the aforementioned developments, Cardano\u2019s ADA has performed worse than ETH as of late. The former currently trades at $0.50 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), or a 14% plunge on a weekly scale. ETH is hovering around $2,470 and is down 5% for the same period.\n\nHowever, some experts think ADA could be on the verge of a rally, taking into account the importance of several upcoming events.\n\nDan Gambardello (Founder of Crypto Capital Venture) outlined the Coinbase v. SEC lawsuit as a major catalyst, suggesting that a victory for the company might trigger a \u201cmega altcoin run.\u201d\n\nRecall that the regulator sued the exchange last summer, accusing it of breaching several laws and offering trading services with alleged unregistered securities such as ADA, SOL, MATIC, and more.\n\nThose curious to check other Cardano price predictions can take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "content": "The Uranium Finance attacker has transferred 2.5 million BUSD from the BNB chain to Ethereum (ETH) using Li.fi.\n\nOn Jan. 22, On-chain analytics platform PeckShield Alert reported the transfer of 2.5 million BUSD from the BNB Chain to Ethereum, leveraging the Li.fi protocol, a DEX aggregator. This movement involved the conversion of assets to 812 ETH and approximately $500,000 in stablecoins.\n\nOriginating from the notorious Uranium Finance hack in April 2021, the primary address associated with the incident transferred a total of $3.1 million in BUSD to Ethereum. Peck Shield\u2019s initial report indicated the movement of $10,000 BUSD via Stargate, a cross-chain bridging protocol. Further tracking revealed additional transfers totaling 3.1 million BUSD.\n\nThe attacker\u2019s strategy involved distributing 500,000 BUSD across six transactions and 100,000 BUSD in another. The batch of transactions, executed within an hour, sparked discussions in the crypto community.\n\nThe exploiter\u2019s BNB Chain address held over $15 million in assets, comprising BUSD and Wrapped BNB (WBNB). At the time of writing, the wallet was completely drained.\n\nYou might also like: North Korean crypto hackers raided $600m in 2023\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum address of the exploiter boasted holdings of 824 Ether, valued at $1.3 million at the time, along with smaller amounts of USDC and USDT. Notably, soon after the BUSD transfer to Ethereum, 1,200 ETH (valued at $1.89 million) were moved to Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer. This was executed through 12 transactions of 100 ETH each.\n\nThese activities aligned with a pattern observed throughout the year, including several transfers to Tornado Cash in the preceding months. The first of these occurred in March, involving a different address to move 2,250 ETH to the mixer. In total, the exploiter extracted $50 million in crypto assets by exploiting a flaw in the pair contracts of the protocol.\n\nOn a related note, 2024 has witnessed increased illicit cryptocurrency activities. A notable phishing attack, reported by Scam Sniffer, resulted in a $4.20 million loss for the victim. The scam exploited ERC20 Permit signatures, allowing scammers access to the victim\u2019s assets.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "The article covers recent developments around BNB and ETC, as memecoin Rebel Satoshi continues to hit new milestones.\n\nTLDR\n\n2.14 million BNB have been removed from circulation in the token's 26th quarterly burn event.\n\nEthereum surged and dropped by 22% in value despite recent Bitcoin ETF approval and ETF speculation for Ethereum.\n\nParticipants for the new meme coin Rebel Satoshi are poised for incredible growth as the project's presale comes to a close.\n\nBNB (BNB) has undergone a significant milestone through a quarterly burn process, showing Binance's commitment to have the token remain in the top 10 altcoins. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has surged amid ETF (exchange-traded fund) discussions.\n\nYet, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) is the talk of the town with its distinctive rebellious meme coin. Participants look forward to the project's imminent launch next month.\n\nLet's first cover the latest developments for BNB and Ethereum Classic before diving deeper into Rebel Satoshi.\n\nBNB Undergoes 26th Quarterly Burn Event\n\nThe BNB Foundation has initiated the 26th quarterly burn event for BNB. It 'burned' or removed about 2.14 million tokens from circulation, equivalent to roughly $636 million. The event occurred using Binance's Auto-Burn mechanism, offering transparency and an objective process.\n\nBinance is no stranger to 'burning' tokens to foster long-term value appreciation for BNB. The BNB Chain also has a Real-Time Burn mechanism, which reduces BNB's supply by burning a portion of gas fees in real time. Binance has burned over 52.4 million BNB since launching in 2017. The next quarterly Auto-Burn will happen in the Q2 of 2024.\n\nBNB is up 7% from $289 to $310 over the past few days, not far from the yearly high of $335. What's more, bullish forecasts generally expect BNB to surpass $400 by the end of 2024.\n\nEthereum Classic Dips 22% Amid ETF Speculation\n\nEthereum Classic is somewhat of a 'sleeping giant' when considering top crypto coins. It springs to life the most with any major developments connected to its counterpart, Ethereum. Amid the recent approval of several Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), ETC surged an unexpected 79% from $18.18 to $32.52.\n\nEthereum enthusiasts have long wondered when their project will also have SEC-approved ETFs. Yet, the Chair Gary Gensler has clarified that green-lighting BItcoin ETFs doesn't mean they'll give Ethereum the same treatment.\n\nDespite Ethereum ETF speculation, ETC has dropped 22% to $25.25. The value will likely pick up with the upcoming 'Spiral' hard fork on January 31, 2024. Long-term forecasts imply that ETC could exceed $75 by the end of this year.\n\nFinally, let's learn more about Rebel Satoshi.\n\nRebel Satoshi Participants Are in Prime Position for Impressive Gains\n\nRebel Satoshi has raised over $1.5 million in its fast-moving presale. With the objective to hit a $100 million market cap, early participants stand to gain returns multiple times over their initial investments.\n\nRebel Satoshi is an unconventional meme coin that will advocate for decentralized finance and rebel against the oppressive monetary status quo. It channels the defiant spirits of Satoshi Nakamoto, Guy Fawkes, and other rebellious figures.\n\nRebel Satoshi is also a community-building initiative, galvanizing fellow rebels through playful engagement and offering structures to foster a norm-challenging attitude. Despite having unrealized revolutionary ambitions, Rebel Satoshi is also a celebration of rebelliousness.\n\nOne way is with the Rebel Artefacts Vault, with 9,999 of the coolest NFTs in the form of collectibles and digital art characters like Recusants, Warriors, and Citizens. The medium of exchange for this marketplace is the $RBLZ token, which also offers excellent returns through staking.\n\nIt's an Ethereum-based token with a capped supply of 250 million. Like BNB, it's deflationary as any unsold tokens following the presale will be burnt (also a symbolic nod to Fawkes). Speaking of which, the presale will conclude next month.\n\n$RBLZ has witnessed a 120% uptick since the first round, from $0.010 to $0.22 in the last round. It will increase 13.6% to $0.025 once the presale concludes, with the potential to rise more once Rebel Satoshi goes live!\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

        "content": "Ethereum alternative that can be as massive as ETH and is priced at $0.08 just got Certik Audited\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies has evolved dramatically since the inception of Bitcoin. Ethereum emerged as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralised applications, offering a new paradigm for blockchain technology. However, the cryptocurrency space is ever-evolving, and investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing. Enter Retik Finance (RETIK), an Ethereum alternative that has been making waves in the crypto world. What sets Retik Finance apart is its commitment to stability, security, and real-life integration. Notably, it has recently received a CertiK audit, adding credibility and trustworthiness to the project.\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s Impressive Journey\n\n\n\nRetik Finance has been turning heads since the start of its presale. Early investors have been rushing to bag this token, and for good reason. The project aims to bridge the gap between the fiat and crypto worlds, making cryptocurrency more practical and accessible for everyday use.While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were initially envisioned to challenge fiat systems, the adoption of cryptocurrency for payments has been slow due to various challenges, including the inertia of the existing fiat payment ecosystem.Retik Finance acknowledges these challenges and offers a different approach. Instead of trying to replace fiat currency, it seeks to create an interface that seamlessly connects the fiat and crypto realms. Leveraging its extensive experience in fiat currency payment processing and its early entry into blockchain technology, Retik Finance divides its bridging agenda into three key categories:\n\nPayment Functions for Commercial Applications: Retik Finance facilitates large-scale commercial applications by providing essential functions such as SwiftPay, which initiates automatic RETIK transfers and authorizes payees to complete payment steps. It also considers multilevel accounts for coordinating multiple authorities in organisational structures. Support Functions for Commercial Applications: Recognizing the need for ongoing adjustments in these systems, Retik Finance emphasises efficient and knowledgeable operational support. Performance Issues with Cryptocurrency Itself: To address liquidity, cross-chain payments, volatility, and transparency in the cryptocurrency realm, Retik Finance takes steps to optimise non-custodial processes and implement well-designed solutions.\n\nCertik Audit: Elevating Trust and Credibility\n\n\n\nThe recent CertiK audit of Retik Finance is a significant milestone that sets the project on a path to success. CertiK is a leading blockchain security firm known for its rigorous auditing processes. When a project receives a CertiK audit, it means that it has undergone a thorough examination of its smart contracts and code to ensure security and reliability. This certification instils confidence in investors, as it signifies that the project is committed to transparency and best practices.\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s Road to Success\n\n\n\nAs of writing, Retik Finance is in its Presale Stage 6, with 1 RETIK priced at $0.080. Impressively, it is on the verge of selling out this stage, with 84.29% of the tokens already sold. The project has raised $10,398,835 out of its $13,150,000 target, with 185,428,147 tokens sold out of a total supply of 220,000,000 tokens.Moreover, Retik Finance has gained visibility on popular cryptocurrency data platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, further validating its presence in the crypto space.\n\nThe Vision of Retik Finance\n\n\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s vision extends far beyond the current financial landscape. It envisions a future characterised by heightened financial empowerment, dependability, and transparency for individuals, enterprises, institutions, and governments worldwide. At its core, Retik\u2019s vision is built on cutting-edge technologies designed to serve as bridges, connecting the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional fiat payment systems.Retik\u2019s vision centers on breaking down barriers, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their location or financial standing, can participate in a global financial ecosystem that is inclusive and empowering. By leveraging innovative technologies, Retik aims to revolutionise financial transactions, introducing a paradigm shift that transcends the limitations of existing systems.In Retik\u2019s envisioned future, financial transactions are no longer constrained by conventional limits but are facilitated by the seamless integration of crypto and fiat payment systems. This integration promises to redefine the dynamics of financial interactions, offering individuals greater control over their financial destinies. Enterprises, institutions, and governments stand to benefit from increased efficiency, reduced complexities, and heightened transparency, departing from the conventional norms that have often hindered progress.In essence, Retik Finance\u2019s vision paints a future where technology acts as an enabler, erasing the lines that traditionally separated crypto and fiat systems.

        "title": "Blockchain Specialization \u2013 Which Platforms Lead in Different Areas? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFollowing a model established by Ethereum, modern blockchains can run a variety of applications.\n\nHowever, various user groups have developed preferences for different blockchains, based on their relative merits.\n\nBlockchain specialization runs counter to the generalized logic first proposed by Ethereum.\n\nInspired by Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized design, yet frustrated with its lack of programmability, Vitalik Buterin designed Ethereum as a general-purpose smart contract platform that could support complex software applications. Later generations of blockchain have largely followed Ethereum\u2019s model. In theory, each of these Turing-complete platforms can execute any computation a user requires, as long as they have sufficient gas money. Nevertheless, the universe of blockchains that exist today can be differentiated by their strengths.\n\nOf course, Ethereum remains a powerful force in Web3. But a countercurrent to its generalist logic can also be observed in the distinct specialization of various crypto tribes: communities of Solana, Tron, BNB and Polygon users who have each carved out a niche for their favored blockchain.\n\nThe Rise of DeFi on Solana\n\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap protocol is usually credited with ushering in the revolution in Decentralized Finance, these days, most DeFi trading activity has migrated away from the Layer 1 Ethereum network to more efficient platforms with lower gas fees.\n\nFor example, since Uniswap V3 branched out to sidechains and Layer 2s, the protocol\u2019s Arbitrum and Polygon deployments have typically generated 3 to 5 times higher trading volumes than its Layer 1 instance. Meanwhile, alternative ecosystems now host an array of new DeFi platforms that have forged ahead on their own.\n\nAs we go deep into Jupuary, we would like to acknowledge everyone who's making it possible. Additional shoutout to @jito_sol for the excellent airdrop lib we are building on top of and @Austin_Federa for being super proactive and pulling together everyone needed from labs! https://t.co/Ktrsz4VKJf \u2014 Jupiter \ud83e\ude90 (@JupiterExchange) January 17, 2024\n\nWhile BNB was the first independent blockchain to challenge Ethereum\u2019s status as the most popular DeFi venue, the breakout success of 2023 was Solana. In the last 30 days, the platform\u2019s top 3 DeFi services \u2013 Jupiter, Raydium and marginfin \u2013 attracted a combined total of 1.5 million users, surpassing the most popular BNB and Ethereum DeXs.\n\nSince mid-December, Solana\u2019s burgeoning DeFi ecosystem has been boosted by surging interest in SPL meme coins like Bonk.\n\nTron Takes the Stablecoin Crown\n\nMirroring the trend set by DeFi users, stablecoin activity has also relocated in recent times, with Tron being the most notable beneficiary of the flight from Ethereum.\n\nIn the last 3 years, Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin transaction count has fallen by around 20%, while Tron\u2019s surged by 600% in the same period.\n\nMoreover, where a strong lead in trading volume balances Ethereum\u2019s dwindling DeFi user base, the same can\u2019t be said for stablecoin activity. Not only does Tron beat Ethereum\u2019s transfer count, but it also comes close to matching its overall transaction volume.\n\nCongratulations on USDT on #TRON 's circulation exceeding $50 billion for the first time. Everyone in the TRON community has made a huge contribution to this achievement. The goal of issuing $100 billion on TRON stablecoins will be achieved soon! @paoloardoino @Tether_to pic.twitter.com/X7d3zm4EAE \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) January 13, 2024\n\nThe majority of Tron\u2019s stablecoin volumes stem from USDT transactions, which accounted for over 98% of the $366 billion sent over the network in the last year. On January 15, USDT circulating on Tron exceeded $50 billion for the first time, representing over half of the stablecoin\u2019s total supply.\n\nWAX: The Chain of Choice for Low-Cost NFTs\n\nWhen judged by purely financial metrics, Ethereum is by far the most dominant NFT chain, accounting for over 80% of the total market. But just as Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have driven DeFi and stablecoin users elsewhere, they have also limited its viability for many NFT use cases.\n\nLaunched in 2017, WAX was specifically designed to make NFTs more affordable. Unlike many blockchains, minting new tokens on WAX costs just a few cents, and transferring NFTs between wallets doesn\u2019t incur transaction fees.\n\n\ud83c\udf7bHappy Friday, #WAXFAM ! Let's celebrate incredible #WAXNFT creators, from talented #artists to innovative #game developers & inspiring community leaders. Who inspires you on WAX? Tag your favorite creator & share your $WAXP wallet address below \u23ec pic.twitter.com/iux0iwZlQh \u2014 WAX (@WAX_io) January 12, 2024\n\nThanks to its fee-free transactions, when ranked by total cumulative sales, WAX hosts 8 of the 20 most popular NFT collections, more than any other blockchain.\n\nThe platform is especially prominent in the blockchain gaming space. After Axie Infinity, which runs on the Ethereum sidechain Ronin, WAX-based Alien Worlds is the most popular NFT game. Since its launch in 2020, around 920,000 Alien Worlds users have generated over 7 million sales.\n\nThe Diverse Ecosystem of BNB DApps\n\nAs the first blockchain built for decentralized applications (DApps), Ethereum\u2019s enduring popularity is maintained by a sizable network effect. According to DAppRadar , there are now more than 4,000 Ethereum-based DApps, but the platform has been knocked from the top spot by BNB chain, which hosts over 5,000\n\nBecause it was created to provide an Ethereum-like development experience, BNB\u2019s DApp ecosystem can draw from a well-established pool of Solidity developers and is home to an array of applications.\n\nOriginally created by Binance to facilitate cryptocurrency trading, the first generation of BNB DApps skewed toward DeFi, but the ecosystem has since evolved into one of the most diverse.\n\nOften incubated by Binance Launchpad, BNB DApps are a hotbed of Web3 innovation. For example, in recent weeks the AI-powered relationship simulator SleeplessAI has emerged as the most popular BNB-based application, amassing over 3 million users since its launch earlier this month.\n\nJoining SleeplessAI at the intersection of blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the crypto-focused knowledge-sharing platform QnA3 has also gained significant traction since its launch in December 2023."

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: ETH has been on a remarkable upward trajectory within an ascending parallel channel since October 2023. The Ethereum price has recently achieved a significant milestone, touching a value of $2,467. This marks a subtle yet noteworthy 2.78% increase in just 24 hours, reflecting a market sentiment. The trading volume has also surged, reaching $6.7 million in the same period. With a robust market capitalization of $295 billion, ranked as the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe digital currency experienced a peak at $2,717 on January 12. Over the past week, it has consistently traded above the $2,400 resistance level, indicating a strong positive trend. Ethereum\u2019s value has shown fluctuations within a specific range, depicting a balance of strength and uncertainty. Observing these trends, Crypto analysts suggest a bullish short-term outlook, fostering a sense of optimism about Ethereum\u2019s prospects.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Cryptocurrency has recently been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400, with bears and bulls exerting influence over the past week. Ethereum has witnessed a significant 54% increase over the past year, demonstrating resilience and an enduring bullish sentiment despite occasional dips. Moreover, in the last month alone, Ethereum has seen an impressive rally, surging by over 10%.\n\nTechnical Indicators Bolstering ETH Bullish Outlook\n\nCrypto analyst Tony highlights the critical $2,400 level for Ethereum, suggesting its breach could signal further growth. He predicts a potential rise above $2,500 soon. Despite market fluctuations, Ethereum shows remarkable on-chart resilience. Currently approaching the key resistance zone, this movement might lead to a significant breakout, continuing its upward trend.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update Important level to hold here at $2,400 legends. Keep an eye on this and make a note of it pic.twitter.com/TK750wv4Up \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 19, 2024\n\nIf Ethereum breaks out of its current range, the next target could be the channel\u2019s upper resistance trend line at around $2,700. If the bullish momentum continues, there\u2019s a possibility that Ethereum could reach as high as $3,000 in the short term. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that a fall below the wedge\u2019s support line, particularly at $2,410, could lead to a decline toward the channel\u2019s lower support trend line, currently at $2,300.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near the 53 level, indicating a relatively balanced market momentum. Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory on a daily chart shows an upward trend, especially after breaking above its 200 Moving Average (MA) and exiting a key descending channel. This bullish trend is further evidenced by three consecutive four-hour green candlesticks, showcasing positive market sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crossing above the signal line further supports a bullish outlook. A rising histogram complements this. The upward trajectory of the 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA crossing above the 200-day SMA reinforces the bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, currently at 0.10, is in positive territory, suggesting a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.\n\nRelated Articles"

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights With a channel breakout rally struggling to cross $2500, sellers are laying the groundwork for a reversal.\n\nThe evening star pattern forming in the weekly chart warns of a deeper pullback.\n\nIn case of a breakdown under the $2400 mark, the sellers can retest at $3000.\n\nFollowing the bearish end of last week, the selling pressure rolls on this week with a 1.26% intraday fall in ETH Price. Setting a bearish tone to this week, the sellers are preparing a market-wide takeover with a significant drop back in altcoins.\n\nFurther, despite the recent DeFi TVL amount reaching the $57 Billion mark, Decentralized Finance is reviving.\n\nDespite such recovery in the DeFi world, the technical chart for Ethereum signals a serious pullback warning. In such times, looking at long-term predictions like our ETH price prediction could help avoid short-term waves in the market.\n\nSellers Undermine The Ethereum Channel Breakout\n\nSource \u2013 TradingView\n\nCrossing the overhead trendline with an 11% growth in the second week of 2024, the ETH price reached the peak of $2717. However, the overhead supply with the market pullback led to a quick fall in Ethereum prices.\n\nMoreover, with the sellers taking over the market amidst GBTC outflows, the altcoins are facing a dire threat. Hence, the weakening in the bullish trend warns of a negative cycle restarting in the rising channel.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price trades at $2423 and teases a strong reversal possibility, threatening the $2000 breakdown.\n\nHence, the buyers can find the $2400 breakdown as a selling opportunity, as the negative cycle can result in a 17% drop to $2000. On the flip side, if buyers can prevent the evening star, upside continuation can result in the $2500 breakout. Optimistically, the breakout run can reach the $3000 mark.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD indicator: The weekly MACD and signal lines are continuing the bullish trend amidst the pullback warning by the candlestick pattern.\n\nETH Price Under Short-Selling Pressure\n\nAs per Coinglass, most of the Ethereum traders are shorting at the current market price and the trend is growing over days. Following the dip on 12th January, the Long/Short Ratio shows growing pressure from sellers.\n\nCurrently, the LSR ratio at 0.9346 shows 51.69% short positions in Ethereum on a 24-hour chart."

Despite this relatively stable price outlook, the conversations around potential price bottom settling are invalidated by Deribit Options data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Insights from the platform, the GBTC-ETF wargames triggered a massive spike in Implied Volatility (IV) of Ethereum which dropped from 64% to 47% for the week using the Deribit Volatility (DVOL) proxy. Bitcoin also recorded a shrunken volatility featuring a drop from 55% to 47%, a trend powered by Call selling.\n\nThe implications of the IV for both Bitcoin and Ethereum differ slightly. Notably, the steep drop in Ethereum came with massive selling trades recorded for the coin as some traders not only gave up on Longs with other traders but also overwriting ETH Spot AUM.\n\nPer the data presented, a total of 2,700 Calls sold about 45,000 ETH, and in March 2,900 Calls sold 28,000 ETH. This sustained selloff underscores the likelihood of a further drop in Ethereum shortly. Bitcoin on the other hand is witnessing intense accumulation as traders are leveraging the slump in prices to stack up the coin.\n\n2) The most impactful IV selling trades originated on ETH, predominantly Call selling, some giving up on Longs, and some overwriting ETH Spot AUM.\n\nFeb 2.7k Calls sold 45k\n\nMar 2.9k Calls sold 28k\n\nJan 2.6k covered to sell Apr 2.9k Calls 25k\n\nSignificant other Call 2way in Feb Calls. pic.twitter.com/8XU3djFRVV \u2014 Deribit Insights (@DeribitInsights) January 20, 2024\n\nWith this outlook, Ethereum\u2019s bottom might be far from being set while Bitcoin\u2019s drawdown might be clearing with the current accumulations.\n\nGrayscale Shaping Market Sentiment\n\nWith the approval and launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF being the most important update from the US stock market, the dumping of Grayscale\u2019s GBTC has shifted the longevity of Bitcoin in investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\nData from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock pegged the average time held of coins transacted to 9 months. For this timeframe, a total of 371,930 BTC was transacted with the average price pegged at $42,663.24.\n\nWhile Grayscale\u2019s influence is still dominant as one of the largest Bitcoin holders among the spot ETF issuers, the BTC holding timeline may shrink further as the firm\u2019s 1.5% fee might serve as a discouragement for its existing holders to move their coins to other funds. If this selloff trend continues to play out, the spot and Options market volatility may continue for the rest of the month and price will also reflect this trend."

Using Santiment\u2019s data, AMBCrypto spotted a dramatic fall in large ETH transactions over the past 10 days.\n\nNote how the surge in transactions from the period between the 7th to the 10th of January caused a spike in ETH\u2019s price, indicating that whales were accumulating.\n\nHowever, the ascent was halted as the whales withdrew. Since then, ETH has been range-bound.\n\nETH\u2019s reserves on exchanges dropped over the past week as well. This was a sign that whales were in a HODLing mood.\n\nDerivatives traders are bearish on ETH, but\u2026\n\nA look at ETH\u2019s derivatives market highlighted that bearish leveraged traders were dominant at press time.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, ETH\u2019s Longs/Shorts Ratio has been below 1 since the 12th of January, implying that positions betting on price declines were more than those gunning for price increases.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nInterestingly, the market\u2019s sentiment shifted from neutral to greed, as per AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Hyblock data.\n\nThis could make way for an increase in ETH buying in the days ahead, thus resurrecting its price."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction as QQQ and SPY ETFs Hits Record - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Ethereum price has pulled back in the past few days as sentiment in the crypto industry has waned a bit. After peaking at $2,717 on January 12th, the coin has moved into a correction, falling by over 10%. It has dropped to its lowest point since January 10th.\n\nRisk-on sentiment\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrency prices have plunged in the past few days as investors sell the spot Bitcoin ETF news. This is a common occurrence where an asset rallies ahead of a major event and then pulls back after it happens. It happens because the news event, in this ETF approval, was already baked in the market.\n\nStill, there are a few potential catalysts that could push Ethereum price higher soon. First, investors are embracing a risk-on sentiment as evidenced by the performance of the stock market. Last Friday, Invesco QQQ (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and the SPDR S&P 500 index (SPY) jumped to a record high.\n\nThese indices jumped as the earnings season continued last week. Some of the notable companies that released their results last week were Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and some regional banks. The earnings season will continue this week as companies like P&G, Tesla, and Netflix publish their results.\n\nThe surge in America\u2019s equities is a sign that investors have embraced a risk-on sentiment, which is a positive thing for stocks and cryptocurrencies. In most periods, these coins tend to rally when there is this sentiment as we saw during the 2021 rally.\n\nThe other catalyst for Ethereum is that some companies like Blackrock have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF. That ETF will track the price of Ethereum and make it easier for institutional investors to invest.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether the SEC will approve the ETF because of Ethereum\u2019s staking features, which it introduced in 2022. Staking allows people to earn a return by just holding the tokens, something the SEC sees as problematic since Ethereum is not regulated.\n\nEthereum price forecast\n\nThe daily chart shows that the ETH price has pulled back sharply in the past few days, pushing it into a correction. It has retested the key support at $2,450, the highest swing on December 28th. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have retreated to their neutral point.\n\nEthereum remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a bullish sign. Therefore, the outlook for ETH price is mildly bullish, with the next point to watch being at $2,700. This price is about 12% above the current level."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Spot ETF Speculation Sparks, When Will ETH Hit $4,800? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction indicates a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Currently priced at $2,281, Ethereum has experienced a slight dip of 0.41% in the past day. Despite this minor decrease, the currency has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining a value above $2,200 in recent months. This pattern demonstrates a strong bullish inclination among investors.\n\nEthereum price has witnessed a significant rise of over 46% in the past year, an indicator of increasing investor interest. The last 24 hours have been particularly optimistic for Ethereum, with its trading volume soaring to $9.29 billion. This surge points to a heightened bullish sentiment, suggesting potential for further growth in its value.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Resilient Amidst Market Volatility\n\nOver the previous week, Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,300 and $2,400. Despite this 6% weekly decline, the current market momentum leans towards optimism. Ethereum continues to hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now valued at $285 billion. This stability in the market underscores Ethereum\u2019s growing prominence in the cryptocurrency sphere.\n\nEthereum price dynamics have recently been the focus of Crypto Busy, renowned crypto educators, and market analysts. They shared insights on Twitter, noting Ethereum\u2019s market behavior post-speculation around an Ethereum-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). After the initial surge attributed to the ETF buzz, Ethereum is now experiencing a consolidation phase. This period is characterized by the market stabilizing after the notable increase in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\n#EthereumNameService $ENS chart update: \ud83d\udc47 Currently consolidating after getting a huge pump from the $ETH ETF speculation. We can see a double resistance as it approach the diagonal and horizontal trendline. Watch out! pic.twitter.com/5TD9IDUvEB \u2014 CryptoBusy (@CryptoBusy) January 22, 2024\n\nCrypto Busy\u2019s analysis highlights Ethereum\u2019s critical juncture, highlighting a double resistance scenario. This resistance is encountered as Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory intersects with a diagonal and a horizontal trendline. In the wake of the ETF speculation, Ethereum\u2019s value soared, reaching above $2,600. This peak signifies a substantial milestone and signals the potential for additional market gains.\n\nIf Ethereum successfully breaks through the critical $3,000 resistance level, it could be on the verge of a significant price increase. The next major barrier it faces is at around $3,500. Surpassing this could lead to a bullish trend, pushing Ethereum\u2019s value towards the $4,000 mark. Should this upward momentum continue beyond $4,000, Ethereum might see its value rise as high as the $4,800 resistance level.\n\nDaily Technical Indicators: Will ETH Continue to Soar?\n\nConversely, a failure to overcome the $3,000 threshold could result in a downturn for Ethereum. The first level of support in such a scenario is nearly $2,000. A further decline, especially a close below the $1,900 mark, could intensify the drop, leading to a more pronounced decrease in Ethereum\u2019s value. This makes the $3,000 and $1,900 levels crucial for determining Ethereum\u2019s short-term market trajectory.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showcases a bullish trend on the daily chart. This is evident as the MACD line currently hovers above its signal line. Contrasting this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), also on a daily chart basis, signals a bearish market environment. Its readings linger below the 50 mark. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is also positive at $0.11, indicating a bullish pressure in the near term.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Weekly Recap: Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana... the crypto news you shouldn't have missed! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 22 Jan 2024 \u25aa 11 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nEvery week, the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies offers us new perspectives and boldly redraws the boundaries of digital finance and blockchain technology. This week was no exception. In this post, we will explore the recent events and trends that have marked the crypto ecosystem. From the European Union\u2019s initiative for greater transparency in cryptocurrency transactions over 1,000 euros, to the impact of massive Bitcoin sales by miners, the flow of European capital towards American Bitcoin ETFs, Robinhood\u2019s strategic accumulation of Shiba Inu, Binance\u2019s insightful predictions for 2024, the UN\u2019s revelations about USDT as a favored tool by scammers, to the exciting announcement of a new version of the Solana Saga smartphone.\n\nEnhanced Transparency for Crypto Transactions Over \u20ac1000 in EU\n\nThe European Union has recently taken steps to increase transparency in cryptocurrency transactions. An agreement between the European Council and the European Parliament aims to strengthen the due diligence measures required of crypto businesses for transactions exceeding 1,000 euros (approx. 1,090 dollars). This initiative is part of the fight against money laundering and aims to mitigate the financial risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. In particular, the agreement emphasizes improving transparency and security, especially concerning transactions involving self-hosted wallets, often used for illicit activities.\n\nThese new rules, however, are not yet in force. Their implementation depends on the formal approval of the European Parliament, which must agree on the texts with the Council before their adoption and publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. This regulatory development is part of a broader effort by regulators to address vulnerabilities and illicit activities in the crypto ecosystem. Recently, the European Banking Authority also extended its guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing risk factors to the crypto industry, highlighting a collective effort to align regulatory practices with the evolving nature of these financial technologies.\n\nMassive Sales by Bitcoin Miners: A Prelude to a Crash?\n\nThe Bitcoin market is currently under strain due to a significant increase in sales by Bitcoin miners. The Miner Position Index (MPI), which measures miner outflows against their annual moving average, has recently reached alarming levels, the highest since January 2021. This spike in MPI indicates that miners are selling their bitcoins at a more sustained pace than usual. Traditionally, miners sell some of their bitcoins to cover operational costs, such as electricity bills. However, an increase in the speed of these sales can raise concerns in the market, as it could signal a bearish trend for the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe flagship crypto market, extremely sensitive to the actions of miners, responds sharply to these changes. The recent spike in the MPI is not just another figure but a potentially powerful indicator of upcoming changes in the market. This situation highlights the delicate balance between supply and demand in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Indeed, every movement by miners can have a significant impact on the markets and potentially trigger bearish or bullish trends.\n\nExodus of European Capital towards American Bitcoin ETFs\n\nEurope is witnessing a massive reallocation of capital from its own crypto funds to the new Bitcoin-backed ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) launched in the United States. According to Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, outflows of capital from European Bitcoin ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) have significantly increased since the introduction of American spot Bitcoin ETFs. This trend reflects a significant shift by American institutional investors, who now prefer to invest in financial products based in the United States, deemed more profitable and convenient. Previously, these investors used European ETPs for low-risk arbitrage, but with the arrival of American ETFs, they find it more advantageous to carry out these transactions on their domestic market.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has had a considerable impact on the crypto market, leading to an exodus of capital not only from European ETPs but also from Canadian ones. The four largest European Bitcoin ETPs have experienced significant capital outflows since the launch of American Bitcoin ETFs. This massive reallocation is just a reflection of a growing preference for financial products based in the United States, potentially offering more security and profitability to institutional investors.\n\nRobinhood Discreetly Accumulates Billions of Shiba Inu\n\nRobinhood, the well-known trading platform, has significantly increased its reserves of Shiba Inu (SHIB), the memecoin inspired by Dogecoin. According to blockchain analyses by Arkham Intelligence, Robinhood has acquired about 230 billion SHIB tokens, worth a total of 350 million dollars, in the last 24 hours. This massive accumulation comes as SHIB is going through a rough patch, having lost more than 50% of its value since its all-time high in October 2021. Despite this decline, technical signals indicate a growing interest from the \u201cwhales\u201d, or large SHIB holders, suggesting discreet accumulation ahead of a potential bullish rally.\n\nThis accumulation strategy by Robinhood is not new, as the platform had already massively stored Dogecoins before allowing its users to trade this crypto. Robinhood\u2019s sudden interest in Shiba Inu testifies to the growing adoption of this virtual currency, long criticized for its lack of concrete utility. With a market cap close to 5 billion dollars, SHIB ranks among the top global cryptocurrencies according to CoinMarketCap. The highly engaged Shiba Inu community continues to develop new features, such as the Shiba Inu metaverse, which could potentially energize the currency\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nCrypto Trends 2024: Binance Predictions\n\nBinance Research, the research branch of the crypto exchange Binance, has published a report detailing the key trends that it believes will mark the year 2024 in the world of cryptocurrencies. The report highlights Bitcoin (BTC) as a central element and emphasizes developments such as NFT Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and the imminent halving event. Binance considers Bitcoin as a \u201clegitimate asset\u201d that has gained considerable recognition in 2023, and expects this momentum to continue in 2024, spurred in particular by the recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, Binance Research\u2019s report identifies several other crypto market segments that are expected to see significant growth. Among them, the institutional adoption of crypto is highlighted, with the entry of traditional financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity into the crypto space. Other areas such as the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in crypto, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), and the on-chain liquidity segment are also seen as having strong growth potential in 2024. The report also mentions decentralized physical network infrastructure (DePin) and decentralized social media, as well as account abstraction, as promising areas for the coming year.\n\nUSDT, the Favored Tool of Scammers According to the UN\n\nAccording to a United Nations report, the stablecoin USDT (Tether) has become a favored tool for scammers, especially in money laundering operations. The report underlines that USDT offers a discreet and difficult to trace method for quickly recycling large sums of dirty money. This situation is particularly concerning in Southeast Asia, where USDT is used in large-scale scams, including \u201cpig butchering\u201d type frauds. These scams involve seducing a victim on social media before extracting significant amounts of money. The scammers then use USDT to conceal the fraudulent origin of the funds, taking advantage of the speed of transfers and the difficulty of tracking transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThe report also points out the features of USDT that make it attractive for criminal activities. As the world\u2019s largest stablecoin by market cap, with high liquidity and widespread adoption, this crypto is easily exchangeable and transferable in large quantities without leaving a clear trace. Moreover, the governance of USDT is criticized for its lack of transparency, which benefits criminals.\n\nSolana Prepares a New Version of the Saga Smartphone\n\nSolana Mobile plans to launch a new version of its Saga smartphone. This decision follows the first generation phone\u2019s dismal sales performance, with only 2,200 units sold, far below the expected 25,000. The Saga smartphone, designed for Web3 and running on Android, failed to meet expectations despite its initial price tag of 1,000 dollars. In response to this disappointing performance, Solana Mobile is considering launching a second smartphone with similar core features to the first generation but at a lower price and with different hardware.\n\nThe new Solana smartphone will differentiate from its predecessor with several advantages, including an integrated crypto wallet, custom Android software, and a dApp store featuring crypto applications. The first version of the Saga has seen its price reduced to boost sales, and despite this, the phone has enjoyed some popularity on platforms like eBay, where it has been traded for up to 5,400 dollars. Solana Mobile hopes that this new version, with its improvements and more affordable price, will attract more users and strengthen Solana\u2019s presence in the blockchain-oriented smartphone ecosystem.\n\nThat\u2019s the essential to remember for this week.

        "content": "A bug in Ethereum's Nethermind, a piece of software that validators use to interact with the Ethereum Mainnet, took down 8% of those. The incident revived the debate on \"client diversity,\" which CoinDesk reported on.\n\nConcern around single point of failure\n\nExperts pointed out that if Geth had gone down \u2013 Geth is the Mainnet\u2019s most popular executor \u2013 things could have been really bad. Geth can be a single point of failure, meaning that Ethereum would stop operating if Geth went down.\n\nThe whole Nethermind software was taken down, which supports around 8% of the validators that run Ethereum. Sunday\u2019s incident was critical enough to justify a decision to take the affected validators offline. The Mainnet remained up and running despite the issue, and the worst impact was small financial penalties for some validators on Nethermind.\n\nBack-to-back incidents\n\nOf more concern is the fact that an almost identical incident preceded the Nethermind one. In January, a bug took out Besu, a piece of software powering around 5% of Ethereum's validators. The incidents sparked a fierce discussion on X of the problem with client diversity. The fact that Ethereum relies on little client software makes it less resilient.\n\nHow secure is the main software?\n\nCurrently, Geth powers around 85% of Ethereum's validators. Its dominance could have severe consequences if issues with its programming arise.\n\nGeth has never suffered from a bug like the ones that hit Besu and Nethermind, but it\u2019s not immune to such. A glitch could halt the Mainnet completely, making it impossible for validators to add new blocks.\n\nEthereum is programmed to punish validators that break the blockchain\u2019s rules or go offline, which means it could hold Geth-based validators financially liable if an incident occurs. If the issue is hard to patch, the penalties could get enormous."

        "content": "Ethereum, Scorpion Casino and SUI have taught crypto investors a lot over the last year. So what are the lessons learned?\n\nEveryone wants to make money and everyone wants to make a lot of it. Cryptocurrency has emerged as an option to reap significant rewards, as well as an opportunity to take part in a different type of financial world. One of the most commonly Googled phrases is \u2018How to Make Money With Crypto\u2019. So we compiled a few of the most important lessons learnt on how to do this safely and effectively. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nLesson 1: Ethereum & The Importance of Multifaceted Uses\n\nEthereum\u2019s success in the cryptocurrency market teaches the importance of investing in platforms with multifaceted uses beyond just currency. Its combination of digital currency, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps) creates a dynamic ecosystem that drives demand and increases its value. Investors in Ethereum benefit not only from its rising value but also from the ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake model introduces opportunities for earning passive income through staking. This highlights that cryptocurrencies with innovative technologies and multiple applications can offer varied and potentially more stable investment opportunities.\n\n$SCORP Presale In Its Final Stage!\n\nLesson 2: Scorpion Casino & The Importance Of Innovation Alongside Tangible Rewards\n\nScorpion Casino\u2019s Presale has illustrated a key lesson in cryptocurrency investment: the value of innovation and tangible rewards. Unique to their presale model is a system that allows investors to earn and withdraw rewards even before the official launch, a feature not commonly seen in other presales. Typically, investors must wait until after a launch date to realize any returns.\n\nThis pioneering approach by Scorpion Casino not only enhances the appeal of their offering but also demonstrates a commitment to providing immediate, tangible benefits to early investors. This strategy showcases how integrating innovative reward systems in a presale phase can attract investors looking for immediate returns, setting a new standard in the crypto presale market.\n\nLesson 3: SUI & The Importance Of Timing\n\nSUI hit its highest value at $1.83 on May 3, 2023, and is now stabilizing around a value of $1.24. However, its initial value was much lower and was available at $0.1. SUI\u2019s rise in the cryptocurrency market teaches a vital lesson about the significance of timing.\n\nInvestors who adeptly timed their involvement with SUI capitalized on its potential, underlining how crucial it is to understand market trends in the fast-evolving crypto world. SUI\u2019s story emphasizes that in cryptocurrency, making well-timed decisions is key to maximizing returns.\n\nEssential Lessons On How To Make Money With Crypto\n\nEthereum demonstrates the value of a diverse platform, blending currency, contracts, and applications to drive growth. Its shift to proof-of-stake suggests lucrative, stable opportunities through innovative tech.\n\nScorpion Casino\u2019s presale model, offering early withdrawal rewards, underscores the effectiveness of innovation in attracting investors. SUI\u2019s rise highlights the critical role of timing in crypto investment, where understanding market trends is key to maximizing returns.\n\nThese cases collectively teach that success in crypto investing relies on leveraging unique platform features, whether through technology, timing, or novel models.\n\nFor more information, check out the links below.\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Ethereum is trading at $2,372 on Monday. This puts the altcoin in a key demand zone. In the event that Ethereum price drops below the demand zone, the altcoin is likely to suffer a setback to $2,000.\n\nXAI (XAI) price has been consolidating within an ascending parallel channel for the past two weeks. The odds are inclined toward breaking this bullish technical formation as profit-booking intensifies. It comes despite the metaverse and gaming themes steadily gaining ground in the crypto space. The market is also reeling from the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) narrative and speculation on similar investment products for Ethereum ( ETH ).\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price broke below the ascending parallel channel during the January 12 crash that saw upwards of $130 million in total liquidations . Despite multiple technical indicators hinting at a possible extension south, one analyst and crypto executive has provided a different outlook centered on Grayscale spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sales.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Ethereum Fork PulseChain Records TVL Surge - CoinGape",
        "content": "PulseChain, an Ethereum fork, has surpassed the Total Value Locked (TVL) of $403 million. The growth has positioned it as the 11th largest in terms of TVL, according to DefiLlama.\n\nPulseChain houses 34 protocols and has seen a TVL increase of 110% over the past week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPulseX is the largest protocol on PulseChain. It is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that contributes a TVL of $234.45 million to the chain. As an Ethereum competitor that was born to solve the scalability issue on the OG blockchain, it is still behind.\n\nPulseChain is 0.71% of total TVL\n\nIn terms of total dollars locked, PulseChain accounts for only 0.71% of the market, while Ethereum dominates at over 57%.\n\nHowever, its recent rise is noteworthy. This surge in TVL began post-January 8, when it was just over $128 million. At the same time, the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF was just around the corner. The US SEC approved the much-awaited ETP on January 10, pushing liquidity into the market.\n\nThis contributed to the rise in the chain as well, with the TVL hitting $209 million by January 14 and soaring to $496.5 million by January 19. In the process, the conversation around Ethereum ETFs has also been adding optimism to the chain. In December, GoPulse said in a statement that it has unleashed interoperability by allowing trading between Pulse and Ethereum.\n\nPulseChain launched in May last year and has been operational for eight months. Meanwhile, PulseX enables users to exchange tokens on the blockchain in a decentralized setup. It is somewhat akin to Uniswap on Ethereum.\n\nPulseChain comes wrapped in controversies\n\nRichard Heart, the founder of HEX and developer of PulseChain and PulseX, said in a recent post on X that there are benefits of integrating major stablecoins like $DAI, $USDC, and $USDT directly on PulseChain. According to him, this could enhance security and reduce costs.\n\nIf you got $DAI, $USDC & $USDT to have their stable coins directly on PulseChain, as they do on other networks, it would increase security and reduce costs. PulseChain is nearly the most decentralized and secure L1 in the world. PulseChain has operated flawlessly since launch\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xVWRuWkfjn \u2014 Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) January 20, 2024\n\nDeFi analyst @goldk3y_ underlined the growth of PulseChain, citing over 700,000 active wallets. He is betting on PulseChain\u2019s growth, stating, \u201cThere is currently $112M bridged to PulseChain. Up +$42M in the past 7 days.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that PulseChain boasts 100% uptime, low transaction costs, a growing developer community, and over 52,000 validators, making it a strong competitor in the space.\n\nThe Pulse Wallet noted on Saturday that DAI is increasingly moving from Ethereum to PulseChain. It has reportedly surpassed its previous high, which was achieved in June 2023. Although confidence in the chain is on the rise, it\u2019s not without setbacks.\n\nIn July last year, the SEC sued Heart for conducting an unregistered securities offering, targeting HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX.\n\nMeanwhile, the founder also has a reputation for boosting his project with massive claims. He was pulled up by not only the regulators but also the community for misrepresentation and making potentially fraudulent claims."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum infrastructure provider Nethermind has released a hotfix addressing a critical consensus bug introduced in recent versions of its minority execution client.\n\nThe bug prevented node operators from validating blocks, leading to calls for greater client diversity on Ethereum.\n\nVersions 1.23 through 1.25 of Nethermind\u2019s client contained the consensus issue, confirmed Nethermind\u2019s co-CTO Daniel Cadela in a January 21st tweet. The hotfix update, version 1.25.2, was released within hours after users reported failure to process blocks.\n\nThe bug was initially reported by a GitHub user named \u201cwga22,\u201d who stated that their Nethermind execution client had stopped processing blocks. While the incident itself impacted a minority of Ethereum nodes, it has sparked renewed discussion regarding the network\u2019s reliance on the majority of Geth clients.\n\nCurrently, Geth powers over 84% of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, while Nethermind claims just 8.2% market share. This level of centralization on a single client introduces systemic risk, argue decentralization proponents.\n\n\u201cClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements,\u201d said analyst Anthony Sassano in a tweet last August, which was when distribution was more balanced between Geth and Nethermind.\n\nThe recent need to push an emergency hotfix shows that bugs can occur in any client.\n\n\u201cNothing against Geth, but you\u2019re taking on disproportionate risk by running it,\u201d said advocate \u2018marceaueth\u2019 in a January 21st post on X.\n\nA similar bug in the majority of Geth clients could have had far greater implications for Ethereum. Execution client diversity has been an ongoing concern highlighted recently as the Ethereum ecosystem switched to proof-of-stake with the Merge. The Ethereum Foundation previously called for stakers to migrate away from the dominant client to ensure a distributed upgrade.\n\nNow, attention has returned to diversifying sequencers and execution layers to mitigate systemic vulnerabilities.\n\nDecentralization maximalists argue Ethereum cannot realize its core value proposition while relying so heavily on a single client like Geth. Critics argue that adequate distribution has already been achieved, with all minority client outages handled smoothly thus far.\n\nNonetheless, the latest Nethermind incident exemplifies the significance of fault tolerance and redundancy measures in blockchain networks aspiring for maximal security guarantees."

ETH is trending alongside Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ondo Finance (ONDO), according to Santiment data.\n\nThe dog-themed meme coin\u2019s holders believe Dogecoin is likely to be accepted as a payment method, as social media platform X reveals its official payments account @xpayments on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin price sustains above $41,000 as whales moves signal further downside\n\nETH, DOGE and ONDO trend among market participants\n\nIn the recent Ethereum All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) call, the timeline for the Dencun upgrade was determined and the upgrade was finalized despite the issues that arose in the testing on the Goerli testnet. The Dencun upgrade is key to the Ethereum network since it is likely to reduce the transaction cost for Layer 2 chains.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s most anticipated upgrade, EIP-4844 is set to debut in the Dencun upgrade, boosting Ethereum\u2019s scalability and reducing transaction costs. This makes the Dencun upgrade and its arrival on mainnet key to ETH holders.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,407 on Binance. The altcoin is likely to march towards its 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level of ETH price decline between April and June 2022, at $2,551.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOne of the key reasons why Dogecoin is trending among market participants is DOGE holders anticipate that the meme coin will find use as a payment method among X users. This anticipation was fueled by X\u2019s official handle for payment, @xpayments arrival.\n\nONDO price rallied 751% in the past week. Despite the massive spike in the asset\u2019s price, instead of profit-taking, large wallet investors are scooping up ONDO, according to data from on-chain intelligence providers.\n\nLookonchain revealed that a whale spent 540 Ether worth $1.33 million, and 319,505 MUBI tokens worth $50,000 to acquire 5.02 million ONDO worth $1.38 million. This is one of the many transactions by large wallet investors in the past 24 hours.\n\nTrending altcoins are likely to observe a shift in the price trend as market participants make moves in these assets."
