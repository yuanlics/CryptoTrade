Though their respective prices are down big, as is the rest of crypto, these are good signs for a better 2023.\u201d\n\nQNT is trading for $105.46 at time of writing while MANA and ENJ are valued at $0.292 and $0.241, respectively.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), Santiment says it suffered a \u201csputtering\u201d end to the year as whales and sharks aggressively sold the king crypto asset throughout 2022.

        "content": "2022 proved to be a fruitful year for Ethereum Name Service, with the platform recording 2.2 million registered domains despite unfavorable market conditions for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAccording to the service, over 80% of the total ENS domains created since the project\u2019s inception were registered in 2022. Data from Dune Analytics shows that ENS has around 2.82 million names registered as of Jan. 2, with 630,340 owners of ENS domains.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!\n\n\n\n2022 was an incredible year for ENS!\n\n\n\nOver 2.2m ENS names were registered in 2022 (that's 80% of ALL names created)\n\n\n\nIf you're ready for 2023, drop your ENS below \u2728 \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) January 1, 2023\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously explored in an exclusive interview with founder Nick Johnson, ENS allows users to map human-readable names like \u201cnick.eth\u201d to machine-readable information like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs.\n\nThe service has been driven by users adopting ENS names for decentralized profiles that work across decentralized applications and platforms. ENS domains serve as Ethereum wallet addresses, cryptographic hashes or website URLs and are effectively nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nRelated: Ethereum co-founder\u2019s poll shows people want $100 lifetime .eth domains\n\nThe growing popularity of the service saw a number of partnerships with major exchange operators like Coinbase come to the fore. The American exchange announced the integration of ENS in September 2022, giving users the ability to replace traditional Coinbase cryptocurrency wallet addresses with language-based usernames.\n\nWhile default ENS domains end with .eth, Coinbase\u2019s integration of the service allows users to claim \u201cname.cb.id\u201d usernames using the Coinbase Wallet browser extension. Coinbase\u2019s adoption of the ENS service was driven by the utility of human-readable names in making Web3 more user-friendly.\n\nData shows that September saw the largest number of ENS registrations created in 2022, with 437,000 domains registered. The data suggests that the exchange\u2019s ENS integration significantly impacted new sign-ups in 2022. May 2022 was also a bumper month for the service, with low gas fees on the Ethereum network playing a role in a surge of .eth domain registrations."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a distributed domain name service based on the Ethereum blockchain, announced that it saw over 2.2 million new registrations in 2022.\n\nThe service celebrated its most successful year yet as it became the most widely integrated blockchain naming standard on the market.\n\nThe 2.2 million new ENS names registered in 2022 also represent around 80% of all of the domains ever created. Data from Dune Analytics showed that the fastest registration rate was recorded in September 2022, with over 400,000 new names registered. As the year came to an end, the registration pace slowed down and December closed with only around 50,000 new names added.\n\nThis brings the total number of ENS names created so far to 2.8 million according to Dune Analytics. Data from the platform itself puts this number at around 2.76 million.\n\nThe 2.8 million names belong to around 600,000 unique participants in the ENS naming service, showing that owning multiple names has become a standard in the community.\n\nThe fast registration rate recorded in September could have been a result of Coinbase\u2019s ENS integration. The exchange enabled users to change their wallet usernames to an ENS subdomain of Coinbase IDs in late August. Coinbase said that the ENS address can be used to send, receive, and trade coins and that it will be available both to regular and pro users.\n\nAt the time, the platform\u2019s native token ENS also reached its all-time high of $20.05. The token dropped significantly since its September peak, bottoming during the FTX collapse, and has now consolidated at around $11.10.\n\nGraph showing the price of ENS from July 2022 to December 2022 (Source: CryptoSlate)\n\nAlmost a year ago, ENS announced that it was working on adopting Ethereum Layer-2 support. At the end of January 2022, the service had the first version of its off-chain resolution implemented and was ready to be tested by developers. While it\u2019s still unclear when Layer-2 support will be launched, the implementation could result in a new wave of name registrations for ENS.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "First-time NFT creators and collectors often start their journey with a simple Google search.\n\nBut the hunt to find the best place to buy an NFT \u2014 which hinges heavily upon unique digital collectible needs \u2014 now, more than ever, needs the right context and due diligence. Many holders who snapped up their NFTs via FTX were hit with a rude awakening by the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy. Their elaborate and creative expressions of digital art are now, at least for the moment, worth not much more than a 404 error.\n\nNo guide can eliminate entirely the downsides of investing in NFTs, or any other cryptoasset, but this one is designed to break down how and why each exchange can or cannot meet your own NFT wants and needs.\n\nRead more: NFT Investing Explained\n\nBreaking down NFT auctions\n\nDifferent NFT marketplaces come with different standards for the auctions that govern their transactions.\n\nA Dutch auction, for one, uses a declining price format \u2014 unlike the more familiar English model. The seller kicks things off with a relatively high ask price and gradually lowers it until a bidder decides to lock it in. The first bidder to accept the current price wins. Dutch auctions are intended to sell NFTs with enough demand quickly.\n\nAn English NFT auction employs the crypto version of the eBay model. The seller sets a low floor, and bidders compete by placing increasingly higher offers until the auction ends at a pre-determined time \u2014 when the highest roller wins out. English auctions help lesser-known artists sell NFTs at a fair price. But sellers can also use the format to bid and manipulate the price anonymously.\n\nBest NFT Marketplaces\n\nOpenSea\n\nBlockchains Arbitrum, Ethereum, Klatyn, Optimism, Polygon, Solana Focus Art, collectibles, domain names, music, photography, sport, trading cards, utility, virtual worlds Fees 2.5% per sale Auction English, Dutch Royalties 10% maximum per sale Best for Art collectors, NFT flippers Pros Easy onboarding, support for multiple wallets\n\nHigh liquidity\n\nWide variety of listed NFTs, collections\n\nAdvanced tools for creators\n\nEducational guides for beginners\n\nMulti-chain support\n\nAndroid, iOS apps Cons Marketplace can be somewhat cluttered\n\nRecord of security breaches resulting in losses\n\nPast allegations of insider trading Launched in December 2017, OpenSea became the first Ethereum-based NFT trading platform. The marketplace rose in prominence as the industry grew and now handles more than 50% of all NFT trading volume \u2014 good for the largest marketplace, with more than a million registered users.\n\nBut, since OpenSea is the most popular, sellers are especially forced to compete to get their NFTs noticed by buyers. The setup makes it difficult for new sellers to stand out and may result in lower sales.\n\nOpenSea provides a wide suite of tools for creators to mint and list new collections. It also comes with a minimalistic interface to browse and purchase NFTs \u2014 using a range of payment options. From the platform\u2019s Ethereum roots, OpenSea has recently expanded to support NFTs on five additional chains, notably Solana and Polygon.\n\nExample of an OpenSea NFT\n\nSpace Daddie #001\n\nOwned by CASHRULEZ\n\nRead more: As OpenSea Flexes Marketplace Influence, Some Users Are Worried\n\nMagic Eden\n\nBlockchains Ethereum, Solana Focus Collectibles, art, gaming Fees 2% per sale Auction Timed auction Royalties Defined by creator Best for NFT collectors, flippers Pros User-friendly interface\n\nDecent volumes\n\nSlightly lower fees compared to OpenSea, in parts thanks to Solana-nativity\n\nDrop calendar to track upcoming mints\n\nSupports multiple wallets across listed networks\n\niOS app Cons Supports only Ethereum, Solana\n\nLimited options compared to OpenSea\n\nOnly supports verified creators and collections, limiting opportunities for up-and-coming artists\n\nDespite launching in September 2021, Magic Eden is already the most popular NFT marketplace on the Solana (native token, SOL) network. It has the highest number of users among SOL NFT markets, and is the second-largest NFT platform in terms of trading volume, trailing only OpenSea.\n\nMagic Eden is especially sought-after by collectors hunting for fresh, up-and-coming items. The Magic Eden Launchpad hosts regular NFT mints to connect creators with collectors. While the platform started off as Solana-native, it has expanded to enable support for Ethereum-based NFTs \u2014 and has additional networks in the pipeline.\n\nExample of a Magic Eden NFT\n\nRead More: Solana Marketplace Magic Eden To Offer Ethereum NFTs\n\nRarible\n\nBlockchains Ethereum, Flow, ImmutableX, Polygon, Solana, Tezos Focus Collectibles, art, gaming, virtual worlds Fees 1% fee from buyer, 1% fee from seller Auction English auction Royalties 10% maximum per sale Best for Collectors, gamers Pros Multi-chain support\n\nNFT aggregator for seamless purchases across supported marketplaces\n\nEnables creators to launch individual marketplaces\n\nAndroid and iOS apps available\n\nTrading fees distributed between buyer and seller Cons Limited NFT options compared to competitors\n\nRelatively difficult for new creators to break through (platform dominated by influencers)\n\nRarible launched in early 2020 and grabbed a significant portion of overall market share as the NFT industry saw increased adoption later that year. Rarible is one of few NFT marketplaces with a native token, releasing its RARI token roughly one year after launch. The token allows users to influence platform upgrades and access certain unique features.\n\nRARI token holders can submit or vote on proposals regarding trading fees, new features and related governance proposals. Such votes are advisory, not binding, so the Rarible team still has the final call.\n\nToken holders also decide which NFTs to showcase and feature. NFTs listed first are more likely to attract sales than those buried at the bottom of a long list.\n\nRarible has a unique appeal for creators. It provides a filter for buyers to explore top influencers and artists. This feature allows creators to build a closer relationship with their respective collector communities. The platform also offers an aggregator, allowing users to buy NFTs listed on competitors.\n\nExample of a Rarible NFT\n\nRead more: Web3 Watch: Rarible Revamps Marketplace, ApeCoin DAO Adds Bug Bounty\n\nNifty Gateway\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, collectibles, gaming, music, social, style Fees 15% Auction style English auction Royalties Defined by creator \u2014 Nifty Gateway takes 5% royalty fee, plus 30 cents per transaction Best suited for Power NFT collectors Pros Exclusive appeal, rigorous vetting approach attract high-profile buyers\n\nMajority of listed items are top collectibles\n\nSupports fiat payments\n\nAndroid, iOS apps\n\nLive customer service via chat Cons Only supports Ethereum network, Metamask wallet\n\nSupports few NFT categories compared to competitors\n\nNifty Gateway ranks high on the NFT marketplace list for influencers, celebrities and brands to create limited-edition items. Since launching in 2018, Nifty Gateway has hosted exclusive drops for celebrities and artists such as Carl Cox, Kenny Scharf, Lil Yatchy and Trevor Jones.\n\nNifty Gateway famously hosted a $6.6 million sale for a work by the popular net artist, Beeple.

Users need to register and verify their identities with Binance to access the platform. Creators and collectors transact in three main cryptocurrencies: BNB, BUSD and ETH.\n\nUsers can purchase individual items or mystery boxes containing various curated collections. There is also a \u201cpremium\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d collection listing. Premium collections are exclusive drops from popular influencers, while the standard collection features items minted by typical users.\n\nSince launching, the Binance NFT marketplace has organized NFT drops for popular celebrities and entities, including Russell Simmons, Paulo Del Valle, the Uganda National Museum, Franck Muller and Parimatch. The highest recorded sale on the Binance NFT marketplace for newbies is $2.8 million.\n\nExample of a Binance NFT\n\nBBC Gas\n\nBullBTCCLUB\n\n\n\nRead more: Binance to Debut NFT Marketplace with Warhol, Dali Thursday\n\nCoinbase NFT\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, collectibles, virtual worlds Fees None (could change in future) Auction style Timed auctions Royalties Defined by creator Best suited for Art and collectibles collectors Pros Beginner-friendly\n\nDecent liquidity\n\nAggregate listing option supports direct purchase of NFTs listed on other marketplaces (OpenSea and LooksRare)\n\nNFT drops calendar to track upcoming mints\n\nCurated list of popular creators simplifies decision-making for buyers Cons Supports only Ethereum-based NFTs\n\nLists fewer assets than competitors\n\nCoinbase is another centralized cryptocurrency exchange that recently ventured into the NFT industry. In May 2022, the exchange company began offering a place where you can buy NFT art using Ether (ETH) as the primary accepted cryptocurrency. Notably, users require a self-custodial wallet \u2014 Coinbase Wallet \u2014 to access the marketplace.\n\nRead more: What Are Seed Phrases and Are They Needed?

The platform carved a niche for itself and is widely considered as the best NFT marketplace for buying exclusive artwork from verified creators.\n\nSuperRare, too, has a native asset: its RARE token. RARE holders form the RareDAO and have the chance to curate the marketplace, define listing parameters and influence platform upgrades. Since launching in 2018, artists on SuperRare have earned over $760 million, with secondary sales topping $100 million over the same period.\n\nExample of a SuperRare NFT\n\nTower 01 \u2013 Hydrology\n\nArtistschmooze\n\nRead more: Netgear Joins SuperRare DAO to Develop NFT Art Licensing Model\n\nMakersPlace\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, music, photography Fees 15% Auction style Time-based Royalties 10% paid to creator, 2.5% to MakersPlace Best suited for Digital art collectors Pros User-friendly experience\n\nAdvanced tools for creators to launch digital art storefronts\n\nSupport fiat deposits\n\nBoth live chat and email support for creators Cons: Exorbitant fees\n\nSupports only Ethereum NFTs\n\nLimited access for new creators\n\nMakersPlace launched in 2018 and primarily offers a platform where you can buy NFT art. Collectors can find exclusive artworks from famous artists such as David Loblaw, Mr. Longshanks, FidJay and many more.

Advanced search filters and support for fiat payment also sets the platform apart as one of the best NFT trading platforms.\n\nExample of a MakersPlace NFT\n\nSpace Club\n\nArtchizest\n\nRead more: How NFT Royalties Work \u2013 and Sometimes Don\u2019t\n\nNext steps after choosing an NFT trading platform\n\nEvaluate what NFT you want to buy\n\nThere are millions of NFT collections. The best NFTs to invest in, however, are generally those with a strong community or artwork that personally appeals to you. It could also be the work of an upcoming artist that has the potential to increase in value as the artist rises in prominence. As a rule of thumb, buying an NFT simply because an influencer promotes it may turn out to be a poor investment.\n\nBuy it\n\nOnce you have your mind made up, the next step is to make the purchase. The steps on how to buy an NFT differ from one platform to the next. It typically involves setting up a Web3 wallet, or registering on the NFT marketplace website and completing their KYC process. Next, fund your wallet with the purchase amount, or make the purchase using your credit card if it\u2019s supported by the platform.\n\nStore your NFT in a wallet\n\nLike cryptocurrencies, you can store NFTs in a self-custodied wallet. While it is common practice to use mobile or browser-native wallets for NFT storage, a hardware wallet offers the most secure experience. These devices typically store your assets offline and remove a common attack vector for hackers. Ideally, a hardware wallet is a compulsory option for investors putting huge sums into the NFT market.\n\nSell NFTs later to book profit\n\nWhile most NFTs offer an art appeal, they are also investment assets. If you\u2019re inclined to sell your NFT, we recommend reading a guide on how to sell an NFT on your chosen NFT trading platform. That way, you can avoid potential losses often associated with listing NFTs for the wrong prices or other potential mishaps. It also allows you to use the best withdrawal method to save on fees and get full value for each sale.\n\nThe NFT marketplace as a whole\n\nThis article provides an exhaustive NFT marketplace list, reviewing the likes of features and pros and cons, as well as fees. OpenSea and Magic Eden are the most popular to buy from, with a wide range of collections and support for a number of blockchains.\n\nRarible, SuperRare, MakersPlace and Nifty Gateway specialize in artwork and exclusive drops from influencers and popular artists. Binance and Coinbase\u2019s NFT platforms, meanwhile, have grown in prominence \u2014 providing centralized trading venues for investors.\n\nThe best NFT marketplace is ultimately the one that meets your profile and specific needs as a creator or collector. Each platform has its own pluses and minuses and could come in handy at different stages of your digital collectibles journey."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of embattled cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) has shot up by over 11% over the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko. The New Year price bump has seen the cryptocurrency reclaim $11 after several days trading below double-digits.\n\nThe news follows a show of support from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who tweeted last week that \u201csmart people\u201d have told him there is an \u201cearnest smart developer community in Solana,\u201d and that the chain has \u201ca bright future\u201d now that \u201cthe awful opportunistic money people have been washed out.\u201d Buterin added that he hopes the Solana community \u201cgets its fair chance to thrive.\u201d\n\nHowever, Solana\u2019s New Year pump hasn\u2019t canceled out the battering the would-be \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has taken over recent months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive\ud83e\uddbe\ud83e\uddbe \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 29, 2022\n\nThe cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% in the past month and has lost over 95% of its value since reaching an all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021.\n\nSOL slid from fifth place on the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market cap in November 2022 to 19th at the time of writing; earlier this month it briefly slipped out of the top 20.\n\nSolana\u2019s slump\n\nContagion from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX likely accounts for a large part of Solana\u2019s recent price woes; in November the Solana Foundation shared details of its financial entanglement with the now-bankrupt exchange and its sister firm Alameda Research.\n\nFTX\u2019s sister hedge fund Alameda Research was invested in 17 total Solana projects, worth about $3.26 billion in total, per data from DeFi Llama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, several large-scale projects have announced plans to abandon the Solana ecosystem in recent months.\n\nDeGods, a popular NFTs collection that utilizes the Solana network, is set to migrate to the Ethereum ecosystem in the first quarter of this year.\n\nIn addition, another popular NFT project, yOOts, is set to move to Polygon, an Ethereum-based Layer-1 network."

        "content": "Loopring suffered a decline in TVL in 2022.\n\nLRC continues to record increased token sell-offs.\n\nAs the ongoing crypto winter lingers in the new year, LRC, the native token that powers leading layer 2 zkRollup protocol Loopring, was among the top ten cryptocurrency assets by trading volume among the top 500 Ethereum whales in the last 24 hours.\n\nDubbed the first zkRollup Layer 2 network, Loopring is a protocol for building non-custodial, orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAre your LRC holdings flashing greens? Check the Profit Calculator\n\nIn 2022, more people started using layer 2s on Ethereum as distinct communities and ecosystems formed around them. In addition, these layer 2s also offered significantly lower transaction fees than the Ethereum main chain, which further contributed to their adoption.\n\nIncreased inflation and the surge in liquidity exit from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols led to a decline in DeFi total value locked (TVL) in 2022. Primarily built to house DEXes, Loopring did not escape the decline as its TVL fell by 86% during the year, per data from DefiLlama.\n\nWith a 1.89% market share of the L2 ecosystem, Looopring was spotted at number five on L2Beat\u2019s list of L2 protocols, with the largest TVL.\n\nNot an impressive start\n\nDespite being on the list of the top ten cryptocurrency assets by trading volume among the top 500 Ethereum whales in the last 24 hours, LRC\u2019s performance was woeful within the same period.\n\nAt press time, the altcoin exchanged hands at $0.1878, per data from CoinMarketCap. However, indications from an assessment of its performance on the daily chart showed that LRC was severely oversold at press time.\n\nStruggling to wade off the bears, the buyers cowered, thereby leaving coin distributors in control of the LRC market.\n\nRead Loopring\u2019s [LRC] Price Prediction 2022-2023\n\nThis was confirmed by the position of LRC\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI). At press time, the sellers\u2019 strength (red) at 34.33 lay solidly above the buyers\u2019 (green) at 10.39. Moreso, the Average Directional Index (yellow) was spotted in an uptrend indicating that the token distribution trend intensified.\n\nDepicting clearly the oversold nature of LRC at press time, key momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned far from their neutral spots. For example, the RSI was spotted in a downtrend at 24.64. Likewise, the MFI was 31.30, at press time."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto trader is flipping bullish on one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) competitors as markets enter a new year.\n\nThe pseudonymous trader known as Credible tells his 335,000 Twitter followers that he\u2019s looking to dollar cost average (DCA) into Hedera (HBAR), which is currently over 93% down from all-time highs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve retraced back to the origin of the last move from which we ran 12x after a near 12 month consolidation. If you\u2019re bullish on HBAR it\u2019s a great time to be DCA\u2019ing in my opinion.\u201d\n\nHBAR is the native token of the Hedera Hashgraph system, which aims to be a faster, more efficient and more secure version of standard blockchain technology. It uses what\u2019s known as its Gossip protocol and incorporates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as the backbone of its system.\n\nHBAR currently has a market cap of just under $1 billion and a max supply of 50 billion tokens, with 25 billion currently in circulation.\n\nWhile Hedera has a large max supply compared to circulating supply, Credible says it won\u2019t be an issue once a bull market comes around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really an issue IMO [in my opinion]. People just want to rationalize the bearish PA [price action] and because they can\u2019t argue against its fundamentals \u2018bad tokenomics\u2019 is an easy alternative to shift the blame to. When we begin pumping again that argument won\u2019t stand either.\u201d\n\nLooking at Ethereum, Credible has a short-term price target near the $1,400 level, about a 16% rally away from current prices.\n\n\u201cWe got that last push down and took our local lows, now looking for continuation up to the 1st target. Note the two sets of equal lows we have left behind- I expect we come back down for those later.

Upgrades are allowed at this stage but must have a delay of more than 30 days.\n\nRelated: Vitalik reveals a new section in the Ethereum roadmap: The Scourge\n\nIn a separate Twitter post one day earlier on Dec. 30, Buterin also made some comments on what he believes a \u201cGood Crypto Future\u201d might look like.\n\nButerin outlined several areas of crypto that would need to be fixed, including scaling, privacy, user experience and making user accounts more secure for average users than centralized services.\n\nHe also sees payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) being part of this future, and new organizational paradigms powered by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)."

Bitcoin is currently being traded at the $16,584 level, with $16,500 serving as a support level. The price is attempting to move above the resistance level at $16,600. If buyers are able to sustain their efforts, it is possible that the price of Bitcoin will rise above $16,700 by this week.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cSolana saw a rebound from its recent low value of $8.19 and returned to the $9.50 price range. However, having experienced a drop of 96 percent, in order to recover, SOL may need to distance itself from Bankman-Fried, who invested significantly in the cryptocurrency and provided support to Solana projects through venture deals with FTX and market-making from Alameda Research. Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading around $16,500$ & $1,200, respectively, with no major change.\u201d\n\nweTrade founder Prashant Kumar offered his take on the market scenario as well, \"The global cryptocurrency market started the new year largely flat with the global market cap under $800 billion. The two key currencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 have seen some gains in the past day and are in the green. Cardano, Polkadot saw gains of approximately 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, XRP saw a decline of 3.3 percent over the last 24 hours. 2022 saw lots of downward movement in cryptocurrency prices, investors are hoping for good news from the market this year.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin entered 2023 on a positive note as it witnessed a jump of 0.39 percent in its value. The largest altcoin Ether also registered a jump of 0.29 percent to start the new year in green. It will be interesting to see the moves of the central banks around the globe to tackle inflation which will chart the course for financial markets. Markets will remain on the edge due to the evolving covid situation in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Liquid staking protocol Lido Finance appears to have benefited most from the Ethereum merge in September, with its total value locked (TVL) now sitting at the top position among other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Lido\u2019s liquid staking protocol now commands $5.9 billion in TVL, overtaking MakerDAO\u2019s $5.89 billion and AAVE\u2019s $3.7 billion.\n\nHowever, these rankings have since been disputed by MakerGrowth, which claims that DefiLlama \"does not include a number of different collateral options that account for more than $1 billion of TVL.\"\n\nIn a statement to Cointelegraph on Jan. 4, MakerGrowth explained the missing figures include its GUNI USDC/DAI LP tokens which account for $446 million in TVL, Monetalis Clydesdale short-term bond ETFs which make up $500 million in TVL as well as the participation in loans originated by Huntingdon Valley Bank, which accounts for another $100 million in TVL.\n\n\"MakerDAO is in contact with DeFiLlama to update this information,\" it added.\n\nLido now has the highest TVL of any DeFi protocol. pic.twitter.com/2xsM3lVGVl \u2014 Patrick | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) January 1, 2023\n\nAccording to Lido Finance\u2019s website, as of Jan. 2, had $5.8 billion Ether (ETH) staked. Meanwhile, there was around $23.2 million staked in Solana (SOL), $43.9 million in Polygon (MATIC), $11 million in Polkadot (DOT) and $2.2 million in Kusama (KSM).\n\nLido\u2019s model allows users access to liquid Ether staking without committing to the traditional 32 ETH minimum.\n\nBlockchain data analytics from Nansen in December noted that staking solutions such as these had been in high demand since Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nIt\u2019s report highlighted the impact of the Merge in introducing staked ETH as an out-and-out cryptocurrency-native yield-bearing instrument that has quickly outstripped other collateralized yield-bearing services.\n\nLido appears to have benefitted from this, as its fee revenue has been directly proportional to Ethereum PoS earnings since Lido sends received Ether to the staking protocol.\n\nIn Nov. 2022 that Lido said it has been collecting $1 million in fees every day since Oct. 2022.\n\nRelated: 5 altcoin projects that made a real difference in 2022\n\nMeanwhile, the governing body of the Maker protocol MakerDAO saw its revenue decline to just over $4 million in Q3, an 86% plunge from the previous quarter, according to a Messari statement in Sept. 2022, citing few liquidations and weak loan demand as the reasons for the decline.\n\nIn that same month, Lido held the most amount of staked ETH among DeFi, with 31% according to Nansen in September, which is a significant amount compared to major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, holding 15% and 8.5%, respectively.\n\nUpdate Jan. 5, 8:25 am UTC: Added a statement from MakerGrowth sent to Cointelegraph regarding DefiLlama's TVL data."

        "content": "Attorney John Deaton has also labeled Bitcoin as security and warned that SEC could soon turn on the digital asset.\n\nEvan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist, tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently in court with Ripple Labs over the security status of XRP. As the case is edging closer to its final ruling, Attorney John Deaton has labeled Bitcoin as security and warned that SEC could soon turn on the digital asset. Evan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities.\n\nMAJORITY OF #Bitcoin BLOCK PRODUCTION CURRENTLY CONTROLLED BY TWO ENTITIES Out of the last 1000 $BTC blocks, 501 have been built by Antpool and FoundryUSA Two pools control more than 50% of block production!\n\nIn response, former SEC enforcement attorney John Reed Stark questioned why the asset is then not regarded as security that requires SEC registration. Stark has suggested that Bitcoin is an unregistered security due to its mining centralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaton also responded that the security status of Bitcoin has been a topic of discussion in the past with some SEC officials regarding it as an unregistered security.\n\nThere are others at the SEC who believe the same thing. In 2015, some at the SEC argued BTC was an unregistered security. This is why it\u2019s absurd for Maxi\u2019s like @saylor and @maxkeiser to encourage/celebrate the SEC\u2019s actions \ud83c\udd9a XRP and other tokens. SEC overreach is bad for the USA.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum maximalists\u2019 support for SEC could backfire\n\nDeaton has in the past warned that SEC could turn on Ethereum for switching to Proof of Stake. His mention of Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum proponents comes as a result of their lack of support in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Michael Saylor and Max Keiser have both shown support for SEC with Saylor claiming Ethereum and Ripple are committing security fraud.\n\nAccording to him, ETH and XRP are unregistered securities and should be shut down. In the past, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also labeled XRP as centralized. Buterin\u2019s position is due to Ripple\u2019s comment in a court filing two years ago that Ethereum was China controlled. In August, Buterin said XRP has lost its protection from the Ethereum community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaton, however, believes that the support by the anti-Ripple community and the so-called Bitcoin maximalists could come back to bite them.\n\nPerfect picture summarizes the danger of supporting government overreach just because the current overreach doesn\u2019t involve the asset of your choice.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs CEO, has called on the entire crypto community to support them, as a victory for the SEC could affect the rest of the digital assets.\n\nU.S. Congress candidate January Walker also made a similar claim.\n\nThe world follows the actions of the USA, and how the government handles one of us, sets precedence for how they handle all of us. Instead of battling against each other claiming one group is better than another we need to work together for the right legislation.\n\nPresident of the Texas Blockchain Council, Lee Bratcher, however, thinks otherwise. According to him, the XRP model fits the Howey test and should be categorized under security.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Don\u2019t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nJoin Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage\n\nFrom the LUNA crash to the shift to Proof-of-stake to the event FTX debacle, the ETH price was put through the gauntlet in 2022. However, developments of ETH-based projects are still in full swing, and the crown still remains bullish about the world\u2019s leading altcoin. So what ETH price prediction can we make for the next year?\n\nWhat Makes Ethereum Special?\n\nEthereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network that was one of the first to bring this consensus mechanism to the mainstream. The network can be used for peer-to-peer transactions, similar to Bitcoin, but with greater efficiency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain also enables the creation of decentralized applications or dApps. In addition, it introduced a new method of automation through the use of smart contracts, which allow for tasks to be completed automatically based on predetermined parameters without requiring manual input from a person. This technology is expected to revolutionize the way we handle contracts and agreements in the future.\n\nETH is the official token of the Ethereum blockchain that grants holders governance rights and helps shape the future direction of the blockchain. This token can be traded independently or staked for an annual interest. In fact, staking ETH is crucial for maintaining the network\u2019s functionality. It\u2019s worth noting that ETH is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, currently trading at slightly over $1.2k.\n\nEthereum is also the foundation for many notable platforms and tokens that follow the ERC-20 standard, which applies to tokens created on the ethereum blockchain. Some examples of these coins include Tether, Shiba Inu, Binance coin, and many more. Ethereum is a good choice for investors who want to invest in established market players and relatively safer investments.\n\nETH Price History\n\nEthereum has followed a price performance parallel to Bitcoin, which pretty much dictates or represents the trends in the overall crypto market. While altcoins are restricted to a set of utilities, Ethereum has been constantly expanding its use cases, meanwhile giving rise to an ecosystem that acts as infrastructure for many coins that follow the ERC-20 standard.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain was conceptualized in 2013 and released in 2015 after a successful round of crowdfunding in 2014. Although the token debuted at around $3, the token price was pretty much under a dollar until a spike at the beginning of 2016 sent the token to cross the $15 level for the first time. ETH managed to rise above that level later that year. However, it closed 2016 at a little above $8.\n\n2017 witnessed a big spike for ETH, where the token reached $53 in April and continued to rise throughout the year, and the token registered a then-all-time high of $1,430 at the start of 2018. After the glory faded off, ETH continued on a bearish cycle supplemented by conservative investments due to the lockdown. With this, the token traced a bottom of $97. This dip soon recovered as the token reached close to $500 by the end of September 2020.\n\nAt its all-time high in 2021, the token price stood at $4,300 in May. Which was overruled by a new all-time high in November of that year when the token price got as high as $4,840. Since then, the token price of ETH and almost every other major cryptocurrency has been on a decline. Currently, ETH is trading at $1,203 with a market cap of $147 billion.\n\nETH Price Prediction For 2023, 2025 and 2030\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2023\n\nA bunch of factors holds the power to decide where ETH lands next year. For starters, there could be instances of market scandals, such as those of 2022, that lead to a crash throughout the market. Ethereum, by itself, has the trust of its users and likely, won\u2019t be a project to undergo any serious mishaps. Plus, the network has had a lot of competitors lately, which means it won\u2019t be the focus of the use cases it has to offer. Most likely, the token price for these reasons could be under $2,000. The price could reach a minimum of $1,021 while maintaining an average of $1,673.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2025\n\n2025 could be the year for Ethereum to challenge its previous all-time high for a multitude of factors. For one, the crypto bull run expected to occur during 2024 could push the token price on a bullish trend, along with the advancement in the project operation, such as the \u201cmerger\u201d that reduced the network\u2019s energy consumption by 99.5%. Investors can expect the token to cross $5k levels in such a time frame, although the token could maintain an average of $3,437 if it doesn\u2019t mention much momentum.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2030\n\nEthereum supporters have been looking forward to the token hitting $10k, and 2030 might be the year for this dream to become a reality. Although projections over such a long time frame are too uncertain, considering the historical price performance of the token, if the token is to cross the $10k mark, it should be by 2030. After all, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency and should preferably have a market cap of a couple of trillions in the next 8 years.\n\nAll predictions are based on historical price performance and market trends. Investors should conduct their due diligence before investing in any token. Ethereum, for one, is one of the safest investment choices in crypto, considering the volatility in the space.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNew Crypto Mining Platform - Bitcoin Minetrix Rating Audited By Coinsult\n\nDecentralized, Secure Cloud Mining\n\nEarn Free Bitcoin Daily\n\nNative Token On Presale Now - BTCMTX\n\nStaking Rewards - Over 50% APY Learn More"

Considering that Ethereum mining is dead and mining for money is a thing of the past, we\u2019ll have a quick look at the numbers:\n\nThe GeForce RTX 4080 was paired with the Intel Core i9-13900KF and 16GB of DDR4 memory for the Ethereum mining test, and the results were pretty disappointing. The high-end Ada Lovelace card nets a mere 0.00004349 BTC daily, which translates to $0.72 daily. Every month, we\u2019re looking at a paltry $21.60, which is far from enough to make up for the electricity costs in developed countries."
