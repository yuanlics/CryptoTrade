        "title": "Ethereum's 2023 Bull Run: Why the Best Is Yet to Come - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Through the first 30 days of the year, Ethereum (ETH 0.34%) is up a surprising 37.53%, and now trades close to $1,700. Heading into the year, though, many traders expected Ethereum to consolidate its gains after The Merge and trade sideways in early 2023. Some even thought Ethereum might drop below $1,000. As a result, many investors are now asking: Is Ethereum's 2023 bull run sustainable?\n\nThe answer to that question can be found using one single metric: total value locked (TVL). This metric is useful as a shorthand way of tracking how much activity is happening on a blockchain. Generally speaking, the higher the number, the better it is for a blockchain. Let's take a deep dive into this metric and see what it tells us about Ethereum's future prospects.\n\nWhat is TVL and why should I care?\n\nTotal value locked, as might be guessed by its name, refers to how much of a cryptocurrency is \"locked\" on a blockchain. There are various ways of \"locking\" your cryptocurrency, such as by choosing to participate in a crypto staking program. With staking, you agree to \"lock up\" your crypto to earn rewards for a certain amount of time, during which you can not trade it. Thus, blockchains that have successful staking programs also typically rank very high when it comes to total value locked.\n\nFrom a long-term investment perspective, you can think of TVL as a way of measuring trust in the future potential of a particular blockchain. At the very least, you need to trust that the blockchain is going to return your crypto funds after the \"lock up\" period is over.\n\nHow to use TVL to value Ethereum\n\nBy simply examining a table of blockchains ranked by TVL, you can immediately see which blockchains are having success in getting investors to \"lock up\" their crypto funds. According to this metric, Ethereum ranks No. 1 in the world, with $29.39 billion in TVL. And it's not even close. The No. 2 blockchain is Tron, with $5.35 billion in TVL. Taking a big-picture view, Ethereum is responsible for close to 60% of all blockchain TVL. That's a very compelling argument in Ethereum's favor, since it means Ethereum is having a lot of success in encouraging investors to \"lock up\" their funds and trust the blockchain.\n\nBut that's just the start. You can also use TVL with another popular metric -- total market capitalization -- to arrive at a much more nuanced view of which cryptocurrencies are overvalued and which cryptocurrencies are undervalued. For example, many investors like to divide total market capitalization by TVL to arrive at the crypto market's version of the price-to-book ratio. This ratio should be familiar to stock market investors, since it is often used to spot stocks that are trading very low compared to their overall intrinsic value.\n\nSo, for example, you can divide Ethereum's total market capitalization ($204.837 billion) by its TVL ($29.39 billion), to arrive at a very rough approximation of a price-to-book ratio for Ethereum. When you compare Ethereum's price-to-book ratio to that of its direct peers, you can see immediately how Ethereum is doing on a relative basis. For example, Ethereum has a 6.97 price-to-book ratio, compared to 34.36 for Solana, which is up more than 100% in 2023. Again, this is a very encouraging number for Ethereum, since it lets investors know that Ethereum may still have some room to run as part of its bull market rally, while the market might be getting too frothy and speculative for Solana.\n\nDeveloping an investment thesis for Ethereum\n\nThe final step in using TVL to evaluate Ethereum is to come up with an investment thesis based on where funds are moving on the Ethereum blockchain. Using a website like DeFi Llama, it's possible to see exactly which decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are attracting the most action. For example, the top DeFi protocol for Ethereum involves staking. This makes sense, since Ethereum instituted staking as part of The Merge last year.\n\nYou can also see one of the top staking protocols involves Coinbase Global. This, too, makes sense. It appears that Coinbase is having relative success at getting its clients to stake Ethereum directly on its platform. Taken as a whole, Ethereum's success with staking should be a net positive for its long-term growth potential.\n\nAs a long-term investor in Ethereum, you might decide to track TVL over an extended period of time, to see which areas are growing. This can alert you to developments that are still under the radar for many investors.\n\nTVL is useful, but not perfect\n\nTVL can be a very useful metric. It can help you spot when a cryptocurrency is undervalued, and can let you see how a particular blockchain compares to its peers. And, finally, it can let you put actual numbers to some of the hype and speculation you might see in the media. For example, before The Merge, many analysts were hyping the importance of staking for Ethereum. Well, several months later, it looks like they were right. Looking at TVL, it appears staking is very important to Ethereum.\n\nAdmittedly, TVL is not a perfect metric, and there are plenty of analysts who claim the number really needs to be cleaned and scrubbed before it can be used with any accuracy. However, based on my own analysis of TVL, I remain bullish on Ethereum long-term."

        "content": "The STARK Prover software application, which aims to enable the Ethereum blockchain platform to scale, will be made open source, according to an announcement on Sunday at the StarkWare Sessions 2023 event in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe STARK Prover \u2014 to be known as the \u201cStarknet Prover\u201d once it goes open-source \u2014 is an engine that generates cryptographic proofs which very efficiently compresses hundreds of thousands of transactions for submission to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark moment for scaling Ethereum, and in a wider sense for cryptography.\u201d Eli Ben-Sasson\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark moment for scaling Ethereum, and in a wider sense for cryptography,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder at StarkWare, and co-inventor of STARK cryptography. \u201cWe think of the Prover as the magic wand of STARK technology. It wondrously generates the proofs that allow unimaginable scaling. But of course, it\u2019s not actually magic, it\u2019s sturdy cryptography and today we\u2019re saying that everyone who wants should make it their own. They should know exactly how it works, modify the code, edit the code and distribute it further.\u201d\n\nWhat is Zero Knowledge Proof?\n\nThe Starknet Prover utilizes Zero Knowledge Proof technology in order to make Ethereum scaling possible. Zero Knowledge Proof is a concept in cryptography where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know specific information or have a specific attribute, without revealing the actual information or attribute itself.\n\nThis is important because it allows for the verification of sensitive information in a secure and private manner, preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the information being verified. Zero-knowledge proofs have numerous potential applications, including secure passwordless authentication, private transactions and data sharing. Eli Ben-Sasson, President and co-founder at StarkWare, and co-inventor of STARKs. (credit: Oli Freuler)\n\nThe difficulty in scaling\n\nScaling the Ethereum network is difficult because its current design limits the number of transactions that can be processed per second, leading to high levels of congestion and slow transaction speeds.\n\nZero-knowledge proof technology can help scale Ethereum by allowing for more efficient and secure verification of transactions without revealing sensitive information. In a traditional blockchain, every node in the network needs to validate and store every transaction, which can lead to slow speeds and high storage requirements as the network grows.\n\nWith zero-knowledge proofs, transactions can be verified using a proof that provides sufficient evidence of the validity of the transaction without revealing any private data. This means that transactions can be validated more quickly and with less storage, reducing the burden on the network and enabling it to process more transactions per second.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum, zero-knowledge proofs \u2014 such as those provided by Starkware\u2019s Prover \u2014 can be used to verify the validity of smart contract transactions, enabling the network to scale without sacrificing security or privacy. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed, zero-knowledge proofs can help Ethereum to handle a larger number of transactions and support a growing number of decentralized applications. Advertisement\n\n\u201cEvery step we take to provide infrastructure and to make it accessible and decentralized, is a catalyst for devs to build,\u201d said Ben-Sasson. \u201cThe quicker and more broadly they build, the faster we\u2019ll see mass onboarding to solutions that truly enable people to manage their own funds. So there\u2019s a direct line between open-sourcing key tech and popularizing self-custody.\u201d"

In this capacity, it has processed 327 million transactions, minted 95 million NFTs, and settled approximately $824 billion, according to the company.\n\nStarkWare also said that making the Starknet Prover open-source will boost its accessibility to developers and promote collaboration within the community.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and select altcoins set to resume rally despite February slump - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After the impressive rally in January, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be taking a breather in February. This is a positive sign because vertical rallies are rarely sustainable. A minor dip could shake out the nervous longs and provide an opportunity for long-term investors to add to their positions.\n\nHas Bitcoin price bottomed?\n\nThe opinion remains divided, however, on whether Bitcoin has bottomed out or not. Some analysts expect the rally to reverse direction and nosedive below the November low while others believe the markets will continue to move up and frustrate the traders who are waiting to buy at lower levels.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko said \u201cthe crypto summer\u201d could begin as early as the second quarter of this year.\n\nHe expects risk assets to turn bullish if the United States Federal Reserve signals that it will slow down or pause interest rate hikes. Another potential bullish catalyst for Bitcoin is the block reward halving in 2024.\n\nCould the altcoins continue their up-move while Bitcoin consolidates in the near term? Let\u2019s study the charts of Bitcoin and select altcoins that may outperform in the next few days.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin has been gradually correcting since hitting $24,255 on Feb. 2. This indicates profit booking by short-term traders. The price is nearing the strong support zone between $22,800 and $22,292. The 20-day exponential moving average ($22,436) is also located in this zone, hence the buyers are expected to defend the zone with all their might.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the edge. If the price turns up from the support zone, the bulls will again attempt to catapult the BTC/USDT pair to $25,000. This level should act as a formidable resistance.\n\nOn the downside, a break below the support zone could trigger several stop losses and that may start a deeper pullback. The pair could first drop to $21,480 and if this support also fails to hold up, the next stop may be the 50-day simple moving average ($19,572).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel but the RSI has been forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening. A break and close below the channel could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could then fall toward $21,480.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the support line of the channel, the bulls will again attempt to kick the pair above the channel. If they manage to do that, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nETH/USDT\n\nEther (ETH) has been trading near the $1,680 resistance for the past few days. Usually, a tight consolidation near an overhead resistance resolves to the upside.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile the upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,586) indicates advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls may be losing their grip. If bulls want to assert their dominance, they will have to propel and sustain the price above $1,680.\n\nIf they do that, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $1,800. This level may again act as a resistance but if bulls do not allow the price to dip below $1,680, the rally may stretch to $2,000.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could tumble to $1,500. This is an important support level to monitor because a bounce here could keep the pair range-bound between $1,500 and $1,680. On the other hand, if the $1,500 support cracks, the pair may dive to $1,352.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA. This is the first indication that the bulls may take a step back. There is minor support at the 50-SMA but if it fails to hold, the pair may slide to $1,550 and then to $1,500.\n\nConversely, if the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will again attempt to thrust the pair above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the pair may resume the uptrend.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are well below their all-time high, OKB (OKB) hit a new high on Feb. 5. This suggests that bulls are in command.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSome traders may book profits near the overhead resistance of $44.35 as it may act as a formidable resistance. If the price turns down from the current level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($37), it will suggest that bulls continue to buy the dips.\n\nThat could increase the possibility of a break above $45. The OKB/USDT pair could first skyrocket to $50 and thereafter to $58.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the traders may be rushing to the exit. The pair could then drop to $34 and later to the 50-day SMA ($30).\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to protect the $44.35 level. The pair could turn down and reach the moving averages, which is an important support to keep an eye on. If the price bounces off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to overcome the barrier at $45 and start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nContrarily, if the price breaks below the 50-SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may slump to $36 and then to $34. Such a move could delay the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nRelated: Fantom\u2019s 5-week winning streak is in danger \u2014 Will FTM price lose 35%?\n\nALGO/USDT\n\nAlgorand\u2019s (ALGO) recovery reached the breakdown level of $0.27 on Feb. 3. The bears defended this level but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls expect the relief rally to continue.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.24) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price turns up from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break above $0.27 increases. The ALGO/USDT pair could then travel to $0.31 where the bears may try to offer strong resistance.\n\nIf the price turns down from this level but bounces off $0.27, it will suggest that the downtrend could be over in the short term. The pair could then attempt a rally to $0.38.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the pair turns down from the current level and slides below $0.23. The pair could then dive to the 50-day SMA ($0.21).\n\nALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are guarding the $0.27 level but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to stay below the 50-SMA. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle. If they do that, the pair could pick up momentum and surge toward $0.31.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues and breaks below the moving averages, the pair risks a drop to $0.23. The bears will have to smash this support to gain the upper hand.\n\nTHETA/USDT\n\nTheta Network (THETA) successfully completed a retest of the breakout level on Feb. 1, indicating that bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $1.20. This level may act as a minor hurdle but if bulls do not give up much ground from $1.20, the THETA/USDT pair could extend its up-move to $1.34. This is an important level for the bears to defend because if this resistance crumbles, the pair could soar to $1.65.\n\nIf bears want to stop the bulls, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then fall to $0.97 and later to the 50-day SMA ($0.89).\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off the $0.97 level, which becomes an important level to watch out for on the downside. A breach of this level is likely to tilt the advantage in favor of the bears and open the doors for a possible drop to $0.85.\n\nThe rally is facing resistance near $1.20 but the upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push the price above $1.20, the momentum should pick up for a rally toward $1.34.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum are going strong. Lido Finance started this trend, but others have entered the playing field. Of all staked Ethereum, liquid staking providers stake almost 40%. That is over six million staked ETH out of 16 million.\n\nTherefore, we are showing you four different liquid staking players for Ethereum. Each has a different philosophy, which we will explain. As a basis, we use a Blockwork Research article.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives continue to be at the front of the market as the Shanghai hard fork nears. When ETH withdrawals open, price action for ETH could go either way\u2026 \ud83d\udc40 Here's the full scoop on LSDs \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/uNOwgwofeE \u2014 Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) January 31, 2023\n\nWhat Are Liquid Staking Derivatives?\n\nTo explain liquid staking derivatives (LSD), I will explain two things briefly.\n\nThe first one is liquid staking. This is a simple idea. You stake tokens from project \u201cX.\u201d Generally, a project will lock these staked tokens. In other words, you receive yield, but you can\u2019t do anything else with this token.\n\nHowever, with liquid staking, project \u201cX\u201d will give you a new token after you stake with them. This is the derivative, the liquid staking token. It\u2019s also the second thing I want to explain. A derivative is a financial instrument backed by an underlying asset. In this case, the underlying asset is your staked token. It represents the value of your staked assets.\n\nNow you can use his liquid token in DeFi. You can get more yield by adding it to a pool or staking it again. On the other hand, you can also sell these tokens and get liquid again. To clarify, the owner of the liquid staking tokens can redeem the staked tokens. Thus, we have two tokens. The native token that you stake and the liquid staking token. Or, in other words, the derivative. The picture below shows the four different protocols we will discuss. It shows all the different and important aspects.\n\nLido Finance\n\nThe Lido Finance derivative is stETH. It was the first LSD that saw real adoption. They have a 29% stake (pardon the pun) in all staked ETH. Lido has deep liquidity. Furthermore, you can use their stETH in many DeFi protocols. They are, without a doubt, the leaders of all Ethereum-based LSD providers.\n\nLido takes a 10% commission on all staking yield. This is good and healthy for their DAO. The DAO receives 5% while the node operators share the other 5%.\n\nHowever, on the downside, their staking share is so big, it worries plenty of people. Lido has a fair share of control over the governance with their number of allotted votes. In turn, this can jeopardize Ethereum\u2019s decentralization. The picture below shows Lido\u2019s share of LSDs.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase didn\u2019t launch their LSD until August 2022. One of the reasons for launching was Lido\u2019s dominance. As explained before, Lido may jeopardize the decentralization aspect. In this short time frame, Coinbase managed to get 7% of the total market share. That\u2019s a whopping 1.1 million ETH. Their liquid token is the cbETH.\n\nHowever, they charge the most of all LSD providers, a steep 25%. Nonetheless, through their CEX, they find enough takers. This also puts them on a different playing field compared to DeFi. That\u2019s where all their competitors are active. In the centralized exchange space, they hardly have any competition at all.\n\nThe downside of this is that they have limited on-chain liquidity. Furthermore, their cbETH token doesn\u2019t have a lot of utility in DeFi. They attract non-savvy crypto investors and institutions. Coinbase also keeps custody over their LSD derivatives. On the upside of this, you can argue that they are the most regulated exchange. They\u2019re also based in the United States.\n\nEnterprise-grade liquid staking is coming.

They are the most decentralized option of all the providers we discuss here. To clarify, they use independent node operators to pair their rETH depositors with. As of February 1, 2023, they staked 379,000 ETH, which is 2% of the total staked ETH.\n\nRocket Pool currently uses 2,045 node operators. They use 16 ETH from depositors, and the chosen validator posts the other 16 ETH. As you may know, to become an ETH validator, you need to stake 32 ETH.\n\nFurthermore, validators must add a minimum of 10% of their 16 ETH stake as collateral. This acts as insurance in case they get slashed. The node operators take a 15% commission. The collateral is in RPL, Rocket Pool\u2019s token. That\u2019s where Rocket Pool makes its money.\n\nA new $rETH DeFi integration has just landed \u2013 you can now earn interest on $rETH deposits or borrow $ETH & $XAI against it as collateral up to 80% LTV with @SiloFinance! Check out Silo's risk-isolating bridge asset design: https://t.co/keHb8e5ehr pic.twitter.com/l2ImTKNm21 \u2014 Rocket Pool (@Rocket_Pool) February 1, 2023\n\nFrax\n\nFrax has a dual token design. As a result, they can offer the highest yield, at around 8%. They offer a liquidity pool on Curve with frxETH/ETH or stake frxETH as sfrxETH. However, note that the liquidity pool rewards are in CVX, CRV, or FXS, but not in ETH. You will only earn staking rewards if you stake sfrxETH.\n\nFrax currently has close to 1,900 validators. Three months ago, they started with zero frxETH, and now they already have 81,000 frxETH. The picture below shows their UI for frxETH.\n\nSource: Frax UI\n\nConclusion\n\nThe market for liquid staking is growing fast. Many providers are offering their services. If you\u2019re looking for high yield, frxETH/sfrxETH is the clear winner. On the other hand, Rocket Pool might be your pick if you seek decentralized options. Lido and its stETH token offer the most liquidity and the best DeFi options. However, their dominance among LSD providers can be a potential problem. Coinbase services institutions and non-savvy crypto users. But, be aware of their 25% commission.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "2 February saw ETH hit $1,713 for the first time in four months.\n\nThe inflow of ETH into exchanges exceeds the outflow signifying sell pressure.\n\nEthereum [ETH] experienced a price increase before the close of the trading session on 2 February, bringing it to its highest level in more than four months. How did traders respond to it, and how might their responses impact the future price of ETH?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBreaking resistance briefly\n\nThe daily timeframe price chart for Ethereum [ETH] may not have indicated any significant price movement on 2 February. When that timeframe is examined more closely, it could be observed that ETH broke the $1,700 barrier and briefly traded at $1,713.\n\nFor the first time in more than four months, the price exceeded $1,500, which prompted traders\u2019 reactions.\n\nThe asset was trading at roughly $1,640 as of the time of this writing, and it appeared to have lost a small value. The price was still trading above the support line that was established near $1,500 despite the modest value drop.\n\nAdditionally, according to the Relative Strength Index, Ethereum was still moving in a bullish direction. As of the time of writing, the RSI was above 60 on a daily timeframe.\n\nScramble for profit\n\nThe Netflow measure may be a more accurate reflection of how investors reacted to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) modest gain on 2 February. The observed Netflow data shows that on 2 February, more Ethereum (ETH) flowed into exchanges than leaving them.\n\nSellers were ready to cash in since the inflow was over 29,000. The observed influx, however, was consistent; there was no noticeable surge.\n\nThe lack of a spike could indicate that the inflow is insufficient to affect the price of ETH significantly. At the time of this writing, the trend line had turned, and outflow exceeded inflow.\n\nExchanges see 11% of the total supply as supply in profit rise\n\nCoinMarketCap estimates that there is currently more than 122 million Ether in circulation. The amount now available on exchanges represents about 11% of the overall supply.\n\nEven though there was a scramble to cash in when the price of ETH spiked, this suggests that only a tiny fraction of the overall supply made its way to trading platforms.\n\nLooking at Glassnode\u2019s Percent Supply in Profit also revealed that a sizable portion of the ETH supply is currently earning interest. Over 64% of the supply, as seen in the observed graph, was profitable as of this writing.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nShort-term investors may be tempted to cash out their ETH holdings now that the price is at its highest point in months. Observed indicators suggest that more ETH are being held than sold, so this development should not have a profound effect on the price of ETH."

        "title": "How to Choose the Best Ethereum Trading Bot? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "When it comes to trading with cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s important to choose a trading platform that suits your needs. While some platforms are designed for more advanced traders, others are user-friendly and can help beginners make the most of their investments. The year 2022 has brought the crypto market to a halt and is now paving the way for a bull run in 2023.\n\nCrypto predictions for 2023 suggest that the prices of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, will pick up by Q3 as the market has bottomed out and has a tendency to rebound. It becomes important to prepare your portfolio for upcoming bullish trends. Therefore, this article will help you choose the best Ethereum trading bot, which you can also consider when selecting a bot to trade any cryptocurrency.\n\nBefore we get into how to choose the best Ethereum trading bot, let\u2019s understand what a crypto trading bot is.\n\nWhat is a Crypto Trading Bot?\n\nA crypto trading bot is automated software with special algorithms that analyze the data of crypto exchanges and offers additional tools to make it simpler for you to execute trades. Simply put, crypto trading bots automatically execute orders based on your trading strategy without manual intervention.\n\nAs such, automated trading saves time as you don\u2019t need to gawk at your screen 24/7, and crypto bots in a way give you an edge over manual traders. You can also check out these top 10 crypto trading bots for 2023 to step up your trading game. Moving on, let\u2019s learn what factors you should tick off to choose the best Ethereum trading bot to maximize your returns.\n\nFeatures to Consider when choosing an Ethereum trading bot\n\nWhen choosing an Ethereum trading bot, it\u2019s important to look for options that can handle a variety of markets. Traders should be able to find a bot that can trade across several Ethereum exchanges, including Huobi, Binance, Kraken, and HitBTC. And since Ethereum is a volatile currency, you may want to pick a trading bot that uses Trailing Stop orders. These orders ride strong market moves and capture more upside than a simple holding.\n\nWell, there are several factors for choosing an Ethereum trading bot, and here we will discuss specific parameters that you must consider before signing up for any crypto bot.\n\nBefore choosing an Ethereum trading bot, you must check the parameters it is offering for technical indicators and market information.\n\nTrading bot should have a user-friendly interface.\n\nBacktesting is essential for traders. Using historical data, you can create a trading strategy that works well. If you have an established trading strategy, you can then use bots to automate the process. Bots are better than humans at detecting opportunities, placing orders, and executing trades in a timely manner. Moreover, they allow you to analyze more than one cryptocurrency.\n\nThe trading bot should be reputed and to check authenticity, you must see how many years the platform has been on the market and what are the reviews of users.\n\nBefore using a trading bot, pay attention if the bot is compatible with well-known crypto exchanges. This is important to check the authenticity of the platform.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTrading bots are not meant to be money-making machines. They are designed to save you time and stress. There are various types of bots to choose from. Some bots are cloud-based, while others are server-based. It is important to test a trading bot before signing up. You can get an idea of how the bot will work by using a demo account.\n\nA trading bot can be useful when you don\u2019t have the time or energy to analyze the market yourself. The best ones are easy to set up, run, and monitor. Once you have a good bot, you can start putting your crypto portfolio to work."

        "content": "In 2011, Wood read about Bitcoin but was largely uninterested in it. In his own words, he was \u201cfocusing too much on the currency aspect\u201d rather than the technology behind it. However, he revisited the idea of the blockchain in 2013 and began to see real potential in it. He saw that possibilities were opening up between the field of ICT and game theory, and he wanted to be an active player.\n\nThat same year, a mutual friend introduced Wood to Vitalik Buterin. At the time, Buterin had only recently published the Ethereum whitepaper, and Ethereum was still a theory. Immediately after Wood got his hands on the Ethereum whitepaper, he started building its codebase.\n\nBy early January 2014, Wood had already built the first Ethereum client. It was a proof of concept of sorts and was the first sign that Ethereum could be built. And Wood had built everything all alone. He also wrote the Ethereum Yellow paper, which specified the Ethereum virtual machine. It was the first formal specification of a blockchain\u2019s state machine to be published.\n\nWhen the Ethereum team disbanded over questions surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future, Wood sided with the winning faction. Over the next two years, he focused mainly on Ethereum and built much of the architecture supporting it. This includes the general platform, the initial solidity design (Ethereum\u2019s smart contract programming language), and most of the C++ client."

        "content": "Ethereum News: In the context of recovery in the macro environment and the recent crypto price rally, Ethereum (ETH) is among the top cryptocurrencies that stand to benefit the most from the ongoing momentum. This is because the timing of crypto rally bodes well for speculation around the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. Interestingly, historical data on ETH price points to similar patterns between the bear run of 2020 and the current scenario. However, it remains to be seen how the crypto market would react in the short term.\n\nAlso Read: Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) To Rank In Top 100?: SHIB Community Bullish\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH To The Moon?\n\nAccording to Bitcoinsensus, ETH\u2019s price action is replicating the pattern that formed basis for last bull run. Essentially, the support strength is accumulated for the next Ethereum bullish breakout in the long term. Between 2019 and 2020, ETH price went through a triangular movement in fluctuation before following an upward curve going into the 2021 bull run. Hence, a similar price momentum can\u2019t be ruled out given the current macro scenario and the Ethereum development scene.\n\n\u201cEthereum is forming similar price action as it formed in the last bear market. Are we in the final months of bearishness?\u201d\n\nShort term projections for the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) are also in favor of the crypto market, as the dollar finds resistance way below the current level of 102 at 90. The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is scheduled for March 2023. This will be the biggest upgrade on the network after The Merge was completed in September 2022. Against the run of market expectations, The Merge failed to spur a price growth in not just Ethereum but other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin News: DOGE To Get Forked By This Ethereum Competitor?\n\nAs of writing, ETH price stands at $1,678, up 0.61% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGape price tracker."

        "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies have gained popularity as more investors have turned to them to diversify their portfolios. It\u2019s a great time to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and meme tokens like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) now that the cryptocurrency market is rebounding.\n\nThese coins give investors the chance to earn large profits at comparatively little risk. Additionally, they provide a degree of protection and privacy that conventional investments do not. This is a great time for investors to consider investing in these currencies since the cryptocurrency market is recovering. If you get in at the right time, these cryptocurrencies could make you a crypto millionaire! Let\u2019s take a look at some of these coins.\n\nEthereum: Smart, Scalable, and Secure\n\nEthereum is becoming an increasingly popular investment option (ETH). And with good reason! Ethereum offers a safe, decentralised platform for creating blockchain applications. Ethereum, an open-source, publicly accessible distributed computing platform based on a blockchain, supports smart contracts. It offers a variety of benefits and features that make it a popular option for investors trying to diversify their portfolios.\n\nDue to its inexpensive transactions, short transaction times, and high scalability, Ethereum may become one of the most in-demand assets very soon. Investing in Ethereum can provide investors with several advantages, including improved liquidity, larger returns on investment, and increased security. Ethereum is likely to continue to rank among the top cryptocurrencies in the future.\n\nBitcoin: The Best Store Of Value On The Market\n\nDue to its long-term development potential as a store of value, Bitcoin is growing in popularity as an investment option. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has developed into the most valued cryptocurrency. Investors look at Bitcoin as a viable long-term investment due to the potential for significant financial returns over time.\n\nBitcoin is extremely alluring as it is decentralised, meaning no one entity controls it or has the power to affect its value. This makes it a desirable substitute for conventional investments, which are usually susceptible to factors such as government influence.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: A Big Cat For Big Gains\n\nA brand-new meme token called Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is making waves in the scene right now. It was created on the Ethereum network, and to increase the amount of money flowing into the DeFi ecosystem, it promotes DeFi and strives to increase consumer knowledge of the DeFi market.\n\nThe preservation of the oceans is one of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s main objectives. Big Eyes Coin keeps 5% of all tokens in a transparent charity wallet that will be donated to organisations that support ocean conservation.\n\nUse the coupon code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 to receive a 200% bonus on your purchases. However, make sure you act quickly, as the code expires on February 3rd!\n\nGiven that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are quickly emerging from the most recent bear market, now is the time to invest in brand-new meme tokens like Big Eyes Coin (BIG). Getting into these cryptocurrencies now that their value is moving upwards could be a way to make yourself a crypto millionaire. As always, ensure you conduct thorough research before buying into any asset.

Thus, market cap is always less or equal to FDV.\n\nBy printing time, Optimism (OP) has only 5% of its tokens released into the circulating supply: as such, its market cap is sitting at $664 million, while the FDV targets $13.3 billion.\n\nSolana (SOL) sees its FDV at $13.2 billion, while its market capitalization is over $9.1 billion; SOL, therefore, is the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Optimism's OP holds the 76th position in this ranking.\n\nAlso, Evan van Ness noticed that another \"Ethereum killer\" Avalanche (AVAX) is well beyond both Solana (SOL) and Optimism (OP) with its FDV over $15.3 billion.\n\nIs Optimism (OP) more centralized than Solana (SOL)?\n\nHe slammed Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) as an \"ill-performant Web2 database\" and a \"Go Ethereum (geth) fork (...) with big blocks and sidechains,\" respectively.\n\nPseudonymous DeFi and NFT expert Foobar (@0xfoobar on Twitter) opined that Optimism (OP) is more centralized than Solana (SOL) so far. Evan van Ness responded that Optimism (OP) is only attempting to retain Ethereum's (ETH) level of security while Solana (SOL) is centralized by design.\n\nAs covered by U.Today yesterday, Optimism (OP) is getting closer to Bedrock, an upgrade that, if passed, might advance its throughput and interoperability with Ethereum (ETH).\n\nOptimism (OP) continues to increase its share in net TVL of all Ethereum's L2 ecosystems: today, Feb. 4, it surpassed 33%, L2Beat data says."

Dogecoin retains its Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, and the mining algorithm will be separated from Wright to use the Ethereum graphics card mining machine.\n\nA larger consensus group will be generated; Dogecoin will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a trend, and the DAO will ensure the decentralization of the project.\n\nThe team announced that the Dogecoin fork will still retain the 1:1 ledger, but there will be some detailed adjustments from the Bitcoin series algorithm to the Ethereum series algorithm.\n\nDogecoin popularity takes off: Top traded token by Binance Smart Chain whales\n\nDogecoin ranks in the top 10 tokens by trade volume for the hundred largest wallet investors on the Binance Smart Chain. The meme coin ranks among favorites for BSC whales and enjoys high trade volume from whale activity.\n\nJUST IN: $DOGE @dogecoin is back in top 10 by trading volume among 100 biggest #BSC whales in the last 24hrs\n\n\n\nCheck the top 100 whales here: https://t.co/0SYnjw0xQs\n\n\n\n(and hodl $BBW to see data for the top 4000!)#DOGE #whalestats #babywhale #BBW pic.twitter.com/xkYwMnUh1n \u2014 WhaleStats - the top 1000 BSC rich list (@WhaleStatsBSC) February 4, 2023\n\nThe news of the fork that retains DOGE\u2019s consensus mechanism and its popularity among whales could act as bullish catalysts for the meme coin. While competitor Shiba Inu bucks the large crypto market downtrend and yields double-digit gains, Dogecoin is gearing up to make a comeback with interest from whales and the Ethereum fork\u2019s community."

        "content": "Payment company Visa is seeking to build \u201cmuscle memory\u201d around settlements, with plans to allow customers to convert digital assets to fiat currencies on its platform, according to a presentation from the company\u2019s crypto division head at StarkWare Sessions 2023.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments from issuers in USDC starting on Ethereum and paying out in USDC (USDC) on Ethereum. So, these are large value settlement payments,\u201d Cuy Sheffield said during a fireside chat at the event. Cointelegraph\u2019s team is on the ground in Tel Aviv covering the two-day Ethereum community conference.\n\nAccording to the executive, global settlement with digital assets and fiat currencies is one of the avenues that Visa is investing in. He specifically stated:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been one of the areas where we want to build muscle memory. The same way that we can convert between dollars in euros on a cross-border transaction, we should be able to convert between digital tokenized dollars and traditional dollars.\u201d\n\nThe payment giant has been exploring how to incorporate blockchain technology into its existing network to move money faster, but settlements still take place on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT system, a not-for-profit cooperative society formed by European bankers with the purpose of facilitating secure and standardized transaction communication between its members.\n\n. @cuysheffield and @visa have fell into the rabbit hole of Account Abstraction!\n\n\n\nThis is huge! pic.twitter.com/CFniLLBq5C \u2014 Starknet-Ecosystem.com \u2728 (@StarkNetEco) February 5, 2023\n\n\u201cWe set all over Swift, so we can\u2019t move money as frequently as we\u2019d like because there are a number of limitations that exist in those networks. And so, we\u2019ve been experimenting, we publicly announced. We\u2019ve been testing how to actually accept settlement payments [with stablecoins],\u201d Sheffield explained.\n\nRecently speaking at Visa\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, former CEO Al Kelly briefly shared the firm\u2019s plans for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins, claiming that \u201cstablecoins and central bank digital currencies have the potential to play a meaningful role in the payments space, and we have a number of initiatives underway.\u201d\n\nSheffield confirmed the company\u2019s view of blockchain technology and digital assets. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking a lot about how to take some of the value that Visa provides on existing bank rails, with existing forms of beyond in a rebuild that on top of blockchain rails, using stable boards. If we think there are huge opportunities in that area, it just kind of stays on emerging.\""

        "content": "EigenLayer funding\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u201cre-staking\u201d protocol EigenLayer is in the process of raising 6.5 billion yen ($50 million) in funding, it was learned on the 3rd.\n\nPre-launch EigenLayer is one of the high-profile projects related to ETH staking. EigenLayer\u2019s investment round began in early November last year, and appears to have successfully attracted investors amid the market turmoil caused by the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nAccording to reports by The Block, based on an anonymous source, the ongoing Series A round will put EigenLayer at a corporate value of $250 million (\u00a532.7 billion) after the new investment, with all pre-circulation tokens The recorded token value (FDV) is said to be $500 million (65 billion yen).\n\nAfter completing the Series A, which will be closed soon, the company\u2019s total funding will be $65 million (approximately \u00a58.5 billion). EigenLayer raised $14.4 million last August, according to PitchBook data. Early investors include major cryptocurrency VCs Blockchain Capital, Figment Capital, and Ambush Capital.\n\nconnection:Lido ETH withdrawal method to be voted for Shanghai\n\nETH restaking market\n\nEigenLayer is a service that allows you to use ETH derivatives locked up for Ethereum staking purposes and re-stake them into other protocols.\n\nFor Ethereum network validators (verifiers), it is expected to be a means of increasing capital efficiency, as staking rewards can be obtained twice.\n\nA mechanism that provides staking ETH security to dApps (decentralized apps), rollups (e.g. Optimism), oracles (Chainlink), bridges, etc. integrated into the EigenLayer ecosystem to earn additional rewards.\n\nconnection: Ethereum L2 \u201cOptimism\u201d, first upgrade \u201cBedrock\u201d proposed to be implemented in March\n\nAccording to the data site DUNE, there are 515,806 validators on Ethereum, and the total amount of ETH staked is 16.5 million ETH (equivalent to approximately 3.18 trillion yen).\n\nThe potential user scale of EigenLayer is huge, and the middleware used as a destination for restaking also has the advantage of enhanced security.\n\nValidators using EigenLayer bear the risk of their holdings being reduced based on the requirements of their security supplier.\n\nEigenLayer plans to launch EigenLayer\u2019s first middleware \u201cEigenDA (Data Availability)\u201d in 2023. EigenDA specializes in Optimistic and ZK rollups for Ethereum L2 and provides distributed rollup sequencers (nodes that verify proofs).
