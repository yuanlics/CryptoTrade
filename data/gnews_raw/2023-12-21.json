        "title": "Ethereum loses its shine as Bitcoin dominates, Solana climbs - Fortune",
        "content": "The rising crypto tide of 2023 has lifted all boats, but some of those vessels are floating higher than others. Bitcoin, riding a wave of ETF optimism, is worth far more than all of the other digital assets combined and is up a handsome 132% on the year. Ethereum rival Solana appears to have shaken off its Sam Bankman-Fried association once and for all and this week eclipsed XRP to become the fifth-biggest token in the market while climbing over 400% in 2023. And Ethereum? It\u2019s up a relatively modest 66%.\n\nPrice movements are hardly the only way to judge a currency of course. Meme coins like Doge or BONK or whatever regularly pop up by crazy amounts on the heels of social media hype but still lack any logical value proposition. Still, price reflects sentiment\u2014vibes if you prefer\u2014and right now the vibe around Ethereum feels decidedly stale.\n\nAs we embark on what looks like a new crypto bull market, Ethereum is facing familiar problems of absurdly high gas fees that make simple transactions unviable. Meanwhile, its vaunted layer-2 solutions do make the blockchain affordable but also introduce an unwelcome layer of complexity for casual crypto users. It\u2019s the same old story and there are no signs it\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\n\nMessari founder and crypto wiseman Ryan Selkis makes this case in his annual industry prognosis, writing that Ethereum is losing some of its luster:\n\n\u201cETH is straddled. BTC outperforms ETH as digital money thanks to institutional allocators\u2019 interest in the digital gold \u2018pure play\u2019 while broad availability of Ethereum substitutes (L0s, L1s, L2s) will likely lead to those substitutes\u2019 outperformance as they sop up onchain volumes relative to the Ethereum main chain. I don\u2019t see a scenario where ETH outperforms bitcoin AND its up-and-coming, higher-beta peers.\u201d\n\nSelkis, however, also points out that Ethereum losing a step was likely inevitable as competition increased in the smart contract industry that it pioneered:\n\n\u201cIf anything, being bearish on ETH relative to the field is not an indictment of Ethereum, but rather a clear-eyed realization that ETH as an asset has been incredibly dominant so far, and has set the bar impossibly high to maintain over a 60% market share in its network token peer group. When I think of Ethereum vs. Solana, I think of Visa vs. Mastercard, not Google vs. Bing in terms of relative strength.\u201d\n\nThat sounds about right. Ethereum has many strengths, including its inclusive developer ecosystem and the pedigree of integrity that its creator Vitalik Buterin bequeathed, but there was no way it was going to remain the only game in town. And for now, its role as the second-most-important blockchain remains unchallenged but, if the blockchain doesn\u2019t increase its vibe game in 2024, that could change.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCrypto scammers are using a flaw in Twitter to create tweets containing URLs that look like they come from Binance, Ethereum, and other real sites.

Regions including the EU, Singapore and the UAE could all attract new investors as a result of new customer and investor protections and new licensing regimes for digital assets. The U.S., meanwhile, will likely continue to use regulatory enforcement actions to establish legal precedent within the digital asset marketplace, as development of a digital asset framework in the U.S. remains a more distant goal."

        "title": "Inscriptions craze proves stark contrast between Ethereum rollups - Blockworks",
        "content": "The advent of zero-knowledge proof-based Ethereum rollups represents a significant advance in blockchain scalability and efficiency.\n\nOver the past week, their ability to handle a spike in transaction volumes was put to the test with the fad-like phenomenon of inscriptions hitting various EVM-based networks in sequence.\n\nOne aspect unique to zk-rollups, such as zkSync, StarkNet and Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, is their ability to amortize the cost of generating validity proofs across many transactions. Therefore, unlike many blockchains, they actually get cheaper to use as they scale.\n\nRead more: Zero-knowledge rollups get cheaper with scale\n\nInscriptions refer to various forms of data, typically metadata of tokens or NFTs, written to blockchains in a way which can be more cost-effective than smart contracts, as they require less gas.\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been a surge in the use of inscriptions on a variety of networks \u2014 not just Ethereum layer-2s but also Avalanche and Solana \u2014 mainly for speculative trading of low-value assets. This trend has led to network congestion and operational disruptions that have kept protocol developers busy finding ways to mitigate their impact.\n\nIn some cases, those disruptions have been severe \u2014 Avalanche\u2019s EVM-compatible C-chain, for instance, saw the cost of transactions spike tenfold, as inscriptions were briefly responsible for over 30% of all gas consumed.\n\nPercentage of gas attributable to inscriptions, Avalanche in red. Source: Hildobby | Dune analytics\n\nZK magic\n\nTo understand why proving costs on zk-rollups decrease with rising transaction volumes, it\u2019s crucial to delve into the mechanics of zero-knowledge proofs and the architecture of these rollups.\n\nZk-rollups utilize cryptographic methods, such ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), to validate transactions off-chain before submitting them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis batching reduces the number of transactions that need to be processed on-chain, significantly lowering gas fees. As the number of transactions in a batch increases, the cost per transaction decreases, showcasing economies of scale.\n\nZkSync Era, currently the largest rollup by total-value locked (TVL), upgraded its original SNARK-based prover to one based on STARK proofs, called Boojum, on Dec. 4. It can theoretically handle 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) \u2014 though in practice has yet to see a tenth of that. For reference, Ethereum mainnet averages around 15 TPS.\n\nOptimistic rollup Arbitrum, whose 2021 mainnet launch gave it a first-mover advantage, has by far the most TVL at $2.4 billion.\n\nBoth networks were impacted by booming inscriptions activity within a couple days of each other \u2014 which accounted for about 60% of all transactions over the past week on the pair.\n\nThe phenomenon provided a real-world experiment in Ethereum rollup scaling.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nBoth suffered downtime, but transaction fees on Arbitrum spiked, while zkSync\u2019s went down.\n\nTransaction fee comparison between zkSync and optimistic rollups. Source: growthepie.xyz\n\nThe cost of using zkSync has been in a clear downtrend since the Boojum upgrade was completed earlier this month. The network currently has the lowest transactions costs among all layer-2s, competitive with the fees users pay on optimistic rollups.\n\nBut the response to a surge in demand underscores the efficacy of zero-knowledge rollups in upscaling Ethereum\u2019s throughput.\n\nBy compressing data and processing transactions in batches, many more transactions can fit in a single proof to be verified on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA researcher at venture firm 1kx, known as 0xtaetaehoho, noted on X that the network posted 5,566 proofs on Dec. 17, more than double the total pre-Boojum, and did so at a lower cost to the network.\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe traffic did cause problems for zkSync\u2019s RPC services and block explorer, however, prompting Matter Labs to post an extensive thread of lessons learned.\n\n\u201cThis weekend served as an important stress-test and a big milestone on the way of bringing Ethereum to the next billion people,\u201d the developers said.\n\n\u201cFor nearly 14 hours straight, the network handled ~150 TPS \u2014 peaking at 187 TPS \u2014 with an average [transaction] cost of ~$0.12.\u201d\n\nOther Ethereum scaling solutions, such as Polygon\u2019s POS chain, also handled the extra traffic well, even with much higher volumes.\n\nAccording to Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal, the network notched 18 million transactions per day, while gas fees maxed out at the MATIC equivalent of $0.10, which he called \u201cthe result of months of effort on EVM parallelisation (BlockSTM) and multiple other hardforks which resulted in reduced reorgs and better performance.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s zkEVM has yet to see a significant surge in inscriptions-related traffic, but technical lead Jordi Baylina told Blockworks the reduction in proving costs seen in recent months means it\u2019s \u201cnot the limiting factor for transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you compare the [proof] cost with data availability cost, for example, or even the cumulative fee for the inclusion of the transaction, it is much, much lower,\u201d he said.\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 head of business development, Marco Cora, sees a future of \u201ca little bit of chaos and disintegration, a lot of experimentation, but one in which the best technical solutions will emerge.\n\n\u201cEverybody is doing fantastic work \u2014 all our \u2018competitors,\u2019 they are actually super commendable,\u201d Cora told Blockworks. \u201cEventually we will all figure out what\u2019s the best, and we will all converge there.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Cora says is not in doubt is that zero-knowledge tech is the future.\n\n\u201cPretty much everybody seems to have agreed\u2026Optimism has said it very explicitly, and Arbitrum I think has said it implicitly now that they are looking at it,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What Crypto Users Need to Know: The ERC20 Standard - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is ERC20?\n\nEthereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC20) is a standard for the Ethereum blockchain that requires nine scripting functions and two events that must be used when creating a fungible token within a smart contract. It is perhaps easiest to think of ERC20 as a set of instructions that a smart contract on the Ethereum network must include.\n\nKey Takeaways An ERC20 token is a standard for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nERC stands for \"Ethereum Request for Comment,\" and the ERC20 standard was implemented in 2015.\n\nPlenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC-20 standard, including Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), and OMG Network (OMG).\n\nHistory of ERC20\n\nERC20 was created by Ethereum developers on behalf of the broader Ethereum community in 2015 and was officially adopted in September 2017. In previous years, to create a standard of this type for Ethereum, a developer or group of developers submitted what was known as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), describing the new functionality along with its specific protocols and standards. A committee then reviewed, approved, amended and finalized that EIP\u2014at that point, it became an ERC.\n\nIn October 2023, Ethereum split ERCs and EIPs in two, creating two tracks for improvements. ERCs are standardization proposals for the application layer (how applications on Ethereum interact), and EIPs are blockchain improvement proposals for networking, interfaces, the consensus protocol, or other blockchain-specific improvements.\n\nSmart contracts and certain tokens within Ethereum are obligated to conform to one of the approved standards. While ERC20 is perhaps the most important and best-known of these ERC standards, it is not the only one in existence.\n\nERC20 Importance\n\nThe ERC20 standard has been a dominant pathway for creating new tokens in the cryptocurrency space for some time. There are tens of thousands of tokens that are ERC20 compliant.\n\nPer official documentation, the ERC20 standard \"...allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within Smart Contracts.\" In plain language, this means that a token (the alphanumeric sequence assigned to an asset) is created with the smart contract, making it only transferable if the conditions in the smart contract are met. An application programming interface (API) allows different applications that need access to the tokens the ability to do so.\n\nThis smart contract prevents parties from acting in bad faith because asset transfers are completed automatically, outside the control of the transactions, once they agree to the transaction.\n\nFor example, if Bob agreed to pay Alice 1 ETH for a new token she had created, it might be possible not to pay Alice once it was transferred. By keeping ownership locked to a smart contract, neither party needs to trust that the other would hold up their end of the bargain because the actions both need to take are completed for them.\n\nERC20 standardizes the way these smart contracts and tokens are created, letting them be reusable in other applications. This not only allows them to be easily inspected by interested parties, increasing transparency and trust in the system, but it also allows developers to use tokens and contracts that have already been created.\n\nContents of the ERC20 Standard\n\nERC20 contains nine functions that a compliant token must have:\n\nName : The token's unique name\n\n: The token's unique name Symbol : An abbreviation used as a ticker or for other identification purposes\n\n: An abbreviation used as a ticker or for other identification purposes Decimals : How many decimal places the token will use, signifying how small an amount can be transferred or owned\n\n: How many decimal places the token will use, signifying how small an amount can be transferred or owned TotalSupply : Provides information about the total token supply\n\n: Provides information about the total token supply BalanceOf : Provides account balance of the owner's account\n\n: Provides account balance of the owner's account Transfer : Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens to a specified address\n\n: Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens to a specified address TransferFrom : Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens from a specified address\n\n: Executes transfers of a specified number of tokens from a specified address Approve : Allows a spender to withdraw a set number of tokens from a specified account\n\n: Allows a spender to withdraw a set number of tokens from a specified account Allowance: Returns a set number of tokens from a spender to the owner\n\nAdditionally, these functions will trigger up to two events:\n\nThe Transfer Even t: Takes place whenever tokens are transferred\n\nt: Takes place whenever tokens are transferred The Approval Event: Activated whenever approval is required\n\nOther ERCs\n\nWhile ERC20 has seen widespread support in the form of new tokens and token-based products conforming to its standards, there are many other token standards proposed.\n\nThere are more than 80 total ERCs implemented, and many more are submitted and waiting for approval or rejection. Some notable approved proposals include ERC223, which aims to address a concern with the approval and transfer elements of ERC20; ERC721, the standard for non-fungible tokens; and ERC3156, a standardization of flash loans.\n\nIs ERC20 the Same As ETH Network? The blockchain Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). The Ethereum Request for Comment number 20 (ERC20) is an implemented standardization proposal for smart contracts. So, while they are all related, they are not the same thing.\n\nIs Coinbase an ERC20 Wallet? Coinbase is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. Its wallet accepts ECR20 tokens.\n\nWhich Wallets Support ERC20? Many of the popular wallets support ERC20. MetaMask, Trezor, Ledger Nano X, Binance, and Exodus all have ERC20 support.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nERC20 is a community-proposed standard for smart contracts and tokens associated with them. The standard allows users to transfer tokens and be re-used by any other Ethereum application. It also makes it easier for them to be approved because the standardized elements must all be present.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "The latest assessment of public Ethereum's readiness for enterprise usage - Ledger Insights - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "In the middle of last year, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) assessed the readiness of the public Ethereum mainnet for enterprise use cases. It concluded it was ready but with a few caveats. Today the EEA published its latest assessment, reducing its caveats.\n\nLike the previous report, the paper doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the challenges. But it does come across as pretty bullish.\n\nThat said, it surprisingly undersells itself in one important area. It describes the advantages to business as the \u201cstrong ecosystem, security, and decentralization.\u201d The reference to the strong ecosystem is a bit of an understatement. The consumer reach of public blockchain, and Ethereum in particular, is like a magnet for financial services firms seeking global distribution. Private blockchains do fine for institutional usage.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why so many institutions are exploring public blockchain, including SWIFT, Standard Chartered, HSBC, Citi, UBS and and JP Morgan. Asset managers are leading the way with Franklin Templeton\u2019s high profile blockchain money market fund \u2013 although the biggest chunk of that is on Stellar.\n\nOne massive Ethereum accomplishment since the previous assessment was \u201cThe Merge\u201d, Ethereum\u2019s move to Proof of Stake (PoS) which addressed the environmental concerns.\n\nNonetheless, the EEA acknowledges that PoS comes with downsides. Businesses are probably a little less concerned about the possibility of greater centralization. But the potential to exclude or reorder transactions (frontrunning) to achieve Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is recognized as a challenge for business.\n\nPrivacy and scalability\n\nPrivacy and scalability are two of the biggest issues. The takeup of Layer 2 solutions has grown enormously in the past 18 months, which addresses scalability and costs. However, that also comes with some tradeoffs. One of the biggest criticisms of private blockchains is fragmentation, which is happening because of numerous layer 2 solutions. They also add complexity but, at the same time, provide more choice.\n\nThe one upside is bridges that enable interoperability for layer 2 solutions can be more secure than cross chain bridges, but are still a risk. In 2022 the value lost in hacks was $3.8 billion, according to Chainalysis, with bridges making up the majority.\n\nBeyond layer 2 solutions, scalability will be addressed at the mainnet level with Ethereum\u2019s plans for sharding.\n\n\u201cPrivacy remains a paramount concern, particularly in the context of Ethereum\u2019s application in business and financial systems,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs a result, many opt for private chains, which pose their own set of challenges, including the complexities of maintaining nodes and establishing trust among participants.\u201d However, increasingly privacy is addressed with zero knowledge proofs and other privacy enhancing technologies. Over time their scalability is being addressed.\n\nEY\u2019s Paul Brody did a good job of managing expectations. \u201cThe most consistent thing missing from every analysis is a reasonable sense of timeline,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe blockchain industry is far too big to go back to the days of 100-200% annual growth. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThis is a multi-decade project, and if we want to sustain our enthusiasm and our energy to complete this transformational and valuable task, we need to calibrate our expectations accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe author holds nominal amounts of Ethereum for experimentation."

According to DefiLlama, DEX volume on Solana soared to $10.1 billion over the last seven days, while Ethereum recorded $8.8 billion in volume during the same period.\n\nSolana's recent surge in DEX activity can be attributed to its lower gas fees compared to Ethereum, and rise of memecoin trading. The chain\u2019s leading memecoin, BONK, dominated headlines after its meteoric rise to over a billion-dollar market capitalization, following Binance and Coinbase listings. Another Solana memecoin, Dogwifhat (WIF), has also captured attention, skyrocketing from obscurity to reach $322 million in market cap. BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens on Solana DEXs over the past week, excluding stablecoins.\n\nThe success of these memecoins and heightened activity, coupled with major airdrops from protocols like Jito (JTO), have contributed to SOL's impressive rally, with the token flipping XRP and reaching a new 2023 high of $99, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nHowever, despite recent gains, SOL's market cap currently sits just above $41 billion, while Ethereum remains has a market cap of $268 billion, more than seven times larger than Solana.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, BitMex founder Arthur Hayes took to social media to reveal a bold prediction regarding the future price of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes, known for his insightful market analyses, confessed to having received a divine message during meditation, leading him to make significant changes in his cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\nIn a cryptic post, Hayes humorously claimed to have received guidance from a higher power, jokingly attributing it to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. The message allegedly urged him to divest from Solana (SOL) and express his admiration for Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFam ... I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nTaking heed of this celestial advice, Hayes reportedly sold his Solana holdings and doubled down on Ethereum, predicting a surge that would propel the cryptocurrency to an impressive $5,000. This announcement follows Hayes' earlier call predicting Solana's price to reach $100, a forecast that has proven accurate, with SOL recently peaking at $99.6.\n\nRotation\n\nHayes' decision to pivot from Solana to Ethereum may be rooted in his assessment of the market dynamics. While Solana has outperformed Ethereum in recent weeks, with a staggering 350% surge since mid-December, Hayes seems to believe that ETH has more room for growth.\n\nComparing the two cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's performance appears lackluster in the short term, showing nearly 10 times less growth than Solana during the same period. Despite trading at yearly highs, the percentage increase in ETH's value pales in comparison to the meteoric rise of SOL."

        "content": "Ethereum developers have tentatively decided on Jan. 17, 2024, for the upcoming \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade\u2019s first testnet deployment during the latest bi-weekly dev meeting on Dec. 21.\n\nOriginally slated for the last quarter of 2023, the \u2018Dencun upgrade was pushed to 2024 due to the engineering complexities involved.\n\nTim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, noted that the date is not set in stone and could change if major issues arise. The team aims to release a blog post detailing the fork during the week of Jan. 8, 2024 \u2014 giving stakeholders a week to prepare for the update.\n\nDencun upgrade timeline\n\nThe meeting set out a draft timeline for the testing phase of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nFollowing the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, 2024, developers plan to run tests on other networks \u2014 Sepolia on Jan. 31, 2024, and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nThe developers aim to deploy the changes on the mainnet by the end of February 2024 if everything goes smoothly. However, these dates are subject to change based on the results of the testnet forks.\n\nDencun will be Ethereum\u2019s first major upgrade since \u2018Shapella\u2019 earlier this year, which was a significant milestone in itself, enabling staked ether (ETH) withdrawals from the blockchain.\n\nSimilarly, a major aspect of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This new process is designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s capacity for data storage, a move that is expected to reduce fees for Layer 2 rollups and scale the blockchain by increasing space for \u201cblobs\u201d of data.\n\nBy improving data handling capabilities and efficiency, it aims to enhance the performance of rollups and, consequently, the overall throughput and affordability of the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cLayer 3 app-chains\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dencun upgrade, the meeting also highlighted a collaboration between Avail and StarkWare. The partnership aims to augment data availability for appchains within the Starknet Layer 2 network. Leveraging Madara, a customizable sequencer, this initiative seeks to develop app-chains that will function as Layer 3 solutions within the Starknet ecosystem.\n\nThese Layer 3 app-chains, powered by the combined efforts of Avail and StarkWare, aim to revolutionize data availability modes, including validium and sovereign rollups. This, in turn, will help optimize transaction processing efficiency and finality, which is crucial for blockchain scalability.\n\nThe developers also touched upon Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader context of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. They reiterated their commitment to maintaining Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in the space, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation and adaptation to meet the ever-evolving demands of the market.\n\nThe meeting also provided a platform for developers to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Ethereum. From addressing network congestion issues to enhancing user experience, the developers explored a range of topics that are critical to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap and its users\u2019 needs."

        "content": "WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has today announced the release of the EEA Ethereum Business Readiness Report 2023 available as a free, downloadable document.\n\nThe over 100-page report contains what the EEA believes to be the most thorough and in-depth look at the business adoption of Ethereum available today. Continuing the work of the inaugural edition released in June, 2022, the report is a systematic assessment of the capabilities and potential of Ethereum as a business platform.\n\nPaul Brody, Member of the Board of the EEA and Global Blockchain Lead at EY, said: \u201cAlthough overall blockchain adoption in the enterprise may have slowed, the share taken by Ethereum has gained significantly. This by itself is a huge milestone because it starts to reduce the complexity firms experience when they enter the blockchain space. More and more, the default choice tends towards Ethereum.\u201d\n\nKaren Scarbrough, Member of the Board of the EEA and Senior Technical Program Manager at Microsoft, said: \u201c2023 was another year of the Ethereum ecosystem further addressing scalability and privacy in an accelerated manner compared to that of private blockchain implementations. In the future, we will assuredly look back on this year as one of the strongest foundational building years in Ethereum\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe report is based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative analysis has been based on EEA\u2019s unique, proprietary database of 260 \u201creal world\u201d, business-oriented projects outside the well-known worlds of consumer DeFi and NFTs. Qualitative data comes from an extensive series of interviews and case studies, many of which are printed in full in the Appendix of the report.\n\nWhat readers will find\n\nThe report is broken up into 5 main sections and an extensive Appendix, as follows:\n\nSection 1: The Year in Business Ethereum\n\nSection 2: A Snapshot of the Use of Ethereum & EVM in Business Today\n\nSection 3: Observations and Trends\n\nSection 4: Assessing the Business Readiness of the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\n\nCase Studies: Roxpay, XEROF, Shell Avelia, Rubey.be, Tokenchampions, Tokeny, Sage, Blocksquare, Fnality, BR\u00d8K, Opera Minipay Wallet, Circularise\n\nInterviews: Dan Heyman, Palm; Alex Tapscott, Author; Vikram Seth, Shell; Joe Lubin, Consensys; Rene Reinsdorf, Celo; Steven Goldfeder, Offchain Labs; Markus Schorn and Jens Herrmann, Deutsche Telekom\n\nThe report is available as a free download on the EEA website.\n\nAbout the EEA\n\nThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) enables organizations to adopt and use Ethereum technology in their daily business operations.

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation Developers set tentative dates for a major upgrade to scale crypto\u2019s biggest altcoin blockchain.\n\nDuring a biweekly call, developers disclosed that Jan. 17 is a possible date for testing the Dencun upgrade on Goerli\u2019s testnet. Dencun was delayed past Q4 2023 due to technical difficulties building its code.\n\nThe upgrade, known as EIP-4844, aims to increase blockchain space for data blobs and slash layer-2 rollup fees by activating proto-danksharding. This data storage expansion should scale Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, enabling more transaction capacity without hiking gas fees.\n\nBarring any disruption and assuming Dencun successfully tests on Goerli, devs plan to upgrade Sepolia\u2019s testnet by Jan. 31 and Holesky\u2019s network by Feb. 7. These forks represent the largest test chains on Ethereum.\n\nThe final soft target for shipping Dencun to the mainnet was set for February\u2019s end, however, this timeline is subject to change depending on developments. Dencun marks the first major technological upgrade since developers added withdrawal support for staked Ether (ETH) through Shapella\u2019s update.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1737898818488926282\n\nIn related news, the EthereumPoW network has moved toward complete autonomy by disbanding its core development team. This initiative was formed in 2022, shortly before ETH\u2019s blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work model to proof-of-stake.\n\nRegarding ETH market performance for 2024, JPMorgan analysts believe the asset will reclaim market share from Bitcoin (BTC) and likely outclass most large-cap native blockchain tokens. An approved spot ETH ETF could also signal billions of dollars into defi\u2019s leading chain.\n\nEthereum price on Dec. 21 | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price surged in December due to potential ETF approval and BlackRock's entry into the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nAnalysts predict Ethereum's continued growth in 2024, potentially reaching $5,000, driven by factors.\n\nTechnical indicators like RSI and MACD support a positive outlook for Ethereum's future growth.\n\nIn December, Ethereum surged past the $2,100 mark, driven largely by the growing expectation of the SEC\u2019s potential approval of the Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This awaited ETF decision stirred optimism throughout the crypto market.\n\nFurther accelerating Ethereum\u2019s growth, BlackRock, a major asset management firm, declared its intent to enter the Ethereum ETF space. Interestingly, in November, Ethereum\u2019s growth rate outpaced that of Bitcoin, with a 13% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 8%.\n\nHere are the exciting predictions for ETH in the year 2024.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2024: Predictions for Ethereum\n\nMany analysts and experts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s prospects in 2024. Notably, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has shifted his focus from the rising Solana (SOL) to Ethereum, despite Solana\u2019s recent 350% surge. This move underscores Hayes\u2019 confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for sustained growth and innovation in the crypto sector.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s trading value stands at $2,275.86, reflecting a daily increase of 2.84% and a monthly rise of 14.45%. Such consistent growth has led to predictions that Ethereum could potentially reach $5,000.\n\nFam \u2026 I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating.

His analysis points to Ethereum\u2019s ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake model and the promising ETF opportunities as key drivers for its anticipated growth. These factors highlight Ethereum\u2019s resilience and potential to play a significant role in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nRead More: Ethereum (ETH) Price Set To Hit $3500: Analyst Maps Buy Levels\n\nIn summary, Hayes\u2019 recent actions emphasize Ethereum\u2019s increasing importance and its potential to influence the crypto market in the upcoming years. If Ethereum continues its positive performance from 2023 into 2024, reaching the $5,000 mark could be a realistic possibility. Technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), further support a positive outlook for Ethereum\u2019s future growth.\n\nReady to ditch your SOL for ETH?

        "content": "In a recent post on X, Sassal, an independent Ethereum educator, is doubling down on Ethereum (ETH). The angel investor said that based on current market sentiment, there are signals that the \u201cdeath of ETH\u201d narrative is losing steam.\n\nThis is a reason, in Sassal\u2019s view, to buy even more ETH ahead of the expected bull run.\n\nEthereum Bulls Confident, ETH Resistance At $2,400\n\nWith the bullish stance, the independent Ethereum educator appears to be convinced that Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are strong. More importantly, the analyst is confident that the network is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for protocols, including those offering decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible token minting services.\n\nThus far, Ethereum, despite the relatively sluggish performance compared to meme coins like BONK or PEPE, remains the second most valuable network only behind Bitcoin.\n\nFrom the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the coin is within a bullish formation.\n\nThe coin rallied by nearly 60%, topping at December 2023 at around $2,400 before pulling back to spot rates. Even with the cool-off, buyers still have the upper hand.\n\nWhen writing on December 12, ETH prices found support at the dynamic reaction line, the 20-day moving average. It is also trading above the $2,100 support line, marking July 2023 highs. Accordingly, it means the bullish breakout formation of early December 2023 is valid.\n\nThis move could anchor optimistic buyers targeting $3,000 and even 2021 highs of around $5,000 in the days ahead.\n\nNetwork Is Upgrading: Will This Drive Prices Even Higher In January 2024?\n\nThe likelihood of trend continuation in 2024 also stems from plans by the platform\u2019s developers to enhance performance and scalability. With Ethereum 2.0 on, developers have been working on layer-2 scaling options like Arbitrum and Optimism to relieve the mainnet.\n\nHowever, going forward, on-chain scaling solutions like Sharding, where the network will be fragmented into units called \u201cshards\u201d that are interconnected, will be rolled out.\n\nEchoing Sassal\u2019s sentiment, another commentator on the X post noted that December and January have historically been \u201cmonster months\u201d for Ethereum in previous bull markets.\n\nThis suggests that even if Ethereum prices have not rallied by triple digits like some meme coins or even outperformed Solana (SOL), the coin could be poised for a significant price rally in the coming months.\n\nStill, how ETH prices will evolve in the upcoming sessions remains to be seen. As it is, $2,500 remains to be a key reaction point that if broken could trigger more demand.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff urges XRP holders to be concerned about ETHGate, emphasizing how the infamous theory affects XRP price.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, an early adviser to the Ethereum Foundation, has pointed out reasons why XRP community members should care about ETHGate.\n\nThe popular crypto adviser made this known yesterday during an exchange with an XRP holder who goes by the pseudonym XRP_Krnboy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNerayoff Sues StormX Co-Founder\n\nIn his latest tweet, Nerayoff disclosed that he had sued StormX CEO Simon Yu and co-founder of U.S. Blockchain Coalition Arry Yu for colluding with the government in fabricating charges that led to his indictment in 2019.\n\nNerayoff, who has been commenting on ETHGate for months, alleged that Simon and Arry stole his tokens worth millions of dollars when they leveled extortion charges against him.\n\nThe crypto advisor revealed that he has enough evidence, including voice recordings, to show that Simon and Arry offered him more tokens in order to silence him.\n\nWhy XRP Holders Should Care About ETHGate\n\nCommenting on the development, XRP_Krnboy said XRP community members do not care about ETHGate. The X user stated that Ripple needs to settle its lawsuit with the SEC to set the stage for a potential XRP rally.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFurthermore, XRP_Krnboy expressed concern about XRP\u2019s current price, suggesting that it seems stuck around the $0.60 level.\n\nResponding, Nerayoff highlighted two major reasons why XRP enthusiasts should care about ETHGate. According to Nerayoff, the so-called ETHGate theory is the major reason why XRP is still stuck around $0.60.\n\nIn addition, the former Ethereum advisor stated that XRP holders should be concerned about the corruption happening beyond their tokens if they care about living in a free society.\n\nInvestors in XRP don\u2019t give a shit about #ethgate? You should care because that why $XRP is as you say \u201c$0.6 omg\u201d. More importantly you should care about this level of corruption beyond your tokens if you care about living in a free society. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) December 21, 2023\n\nETHGate Scandal and Debate\n\nFor context, ETHGate is a theory that has gone viral in the crypto space for years. Proponents of the theory alleged that the team behind Ethereum fostered relationships with prominent SEC officials to create a favorable regulatory environment for ETH to the detriment of other crypto assets.\n\nThis relationship, according to critics, prompted former SEC director William Hinman to declare ETH alongside Bitcoin as non-securities in 2018. In his remark, Hinman stated that ETH has become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over the years and should no longer be classified as a security.\n\nOn the contrary, several crypto proponents, including Nerayoff, argued that Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO displayed less decentralization than initial sales of other digital assets.\n\nTo corroborate this claim, former Ethereum core developer Lane Rettig alleged that 70% of ETH supply was distributed during the pre-mine stage.\n\nHe added that only a few individuals purchased a huge percentage of the pre-mine ETH because they participated pseudonymously during the sales. To this day, no one knows the identity of the whales that scooped the huge amounts of pre-mined ETH."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is well-positioned for gains versus Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming weeks, based on favorable ETH/BTC technicals and bullish divergences.\n\nETH/BTC nears falling wedge breakout\n\nOne of the main reasons behind a potential ETH/BTC rally is its prevailing falling wedge pattern.\n\nA falling wedge is a classic bullish reversal pattern that forms when the price creates lower highs and higher lows with two converging trendlines. It\u2019s resolved after the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises to a level at a length equal to the maximum distance between the upper and lower trendlines.\n\nAs of Dec. 22, ETH/BTC is trending inside a similar pattern, eyeing a break above its upper trendline. Depending on the breakout point, the pair could rise toward the 0.056\u20130.059 BTC area by New Year\u2019s, up 6\u201313% from current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, veteran trader Peter Brandt disagrees, arguing that the aforementioned falling wedge pattern could be a descending triangle, a bearish indicator. Descending triangles are considered bearish continuation patterns in downtrends, which ETH/BTC has been in for the past 15 months.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart.

This discrepancy suggests that the downward momentum is weakening, and a potential reversal to the upside may be imminent.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart.

        "content": "The PBS Foundation is opening applications for an initial $1 million in grants for research and development on Ethereum proposer-builder separation.\n\nThe non-profit\u2019s pilot phase drew support from Coinbase, Consensys, Fenbushi Capital, Flashbots, Paradigm, the Uniswap Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.\n\nGrants will be disbursed by a council. The council includes representatives from Blocknative, Consensys, the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots, among others. The foundation\u2019s grant lead is Eugene Leventhal from the research group Metagov.\n\nRead more: For Ethereum rollups, dealing with data remains a bottleneck\n\nFirst proposed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, proposer-builder separation (PBS) is the concept of separating proposers \u2014 which submit transaction bundles to validators on a blockchain \u2014 and builders, which organize the transactions in a specific order.\n\nPBS represents an attempt at decentralization, as the combination of proposing and building gives well-heeled centralized mining pools a competitive advantage.\n\nPBS first went into effect after Ethereum\u2019s Merge to proof-of-stake. Now, the PBS Foundation aims to promote research and infrastructure to address some of the challenges the concept currently faces.\n\nNotably, MEV-boost relays have become centralized since the Merge. Relayers operate between block builders and validators on maximal extractable value (MEV) boosted transactions, selecting blocks with the highest possible fees. Roughly 90% of transactions in the last 500 epochs, or roughly two days, made use of MEV-boost. Of MEV-boost transactions in the past 24 hours, roughly 97% have been handled by five relayers, according to relayscan.\n\nBlocknative, once among those top relayers, discontinued its service in September, citing economic viability concerns. Relayers do not currently collect fees. Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute, which runs a large relayer, has advocated fee structures outside of public goods funding to incentivize more relayers to join the fray.\n\nA spokesperson for the PBS Foundation said the grant funding could be used to fund relayers, with a particular emphasis on those who introduce novel designs for relaying.\n\nThe funding will also be focused on community and educational materials, data transparency on Ethereum\u2019s mempool and blocks, and research on how PBS can be improved \u2014 or even enshrined \u2014 on both the primary network and on layer-2 networks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin \u2014 the co-founder of the blockchain that unleashed smart contracts on the world \u2014 has seen tens of millions worth of holdings evaporate from his portfolio in mere days.\n\nAccording to data provided by blockchain analytics service Arkham Intelligence, Buterin\u2019s publicly-known crypto wallets became about $29 million lighter in the six days from Dec. 15 to Dec. 21. This means that the wallets cumulatively lost about 5% of their total value as the price of the assets they held fell from $572 million down to $543 million.\n\nButerin puts his money where his mouth is\n\nOut of the current $543 million held in the wallets, the near totality is Ethereum (ETH). The two top assets other than ETH are Kyber Network (KNC) with $623,000 and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) with $431,000.\n\nAs a result of this portfolio nearly completely comprised of Ethereum, Buterin is very exposed to the fluctuation in the price of the cryptocurrency that he helped create. On Dec. 15, ETH reached a high of just under $2,300 \u2014 which accounts for much of its fall of over 4% towards its current price of just over $2,200.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin NFT collection triggers surge in Ethereum gas fees\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer known primarily for his contribution to the creation of Ethereum. He co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, a widely known Bitcoin-focused online publication that started publishing in 2012.\n\nAfter observing some of what he perceived as limitations of the Bitcoin network, Buterin published a white paper in 2014 proposing Ethereum \u2014 a blockchain-based distributed computing platform that could support smart contract functionality. Ethereum launched in 2015, with Buterin playing a key role as the project\u2019s co-founder.\n\nSince then, Ethereum has become the second-largest cryptocurrency platform, second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization.

At the start of 2023, the ratio sat around 0.072 but has also fallen since then.\n\nETH/BTC price chart over the last 12 months. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nCritics on social media appear to be pointing the finger at Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees, which they say have made it more enticing for crypto users to try competitor chains with lower fees.\n\n\u201cEthereum is broken. You don\u2019t have to pay those fees anymore. You have options,\u201d said Bitcoin proponent Jason A. Williams on Dec. 20.\n\nData from BitInfoCharts shows that fees on Ethereum averaged out at around $11 on Dec. 19, though Bitcoin fees are still pricier at approximately $32. On the other hand, Solana\u2019s fees are consistently under $0.01, according to CoinCodex.\n\nEven Vitalik Buterin, one of the creators of Ethereum, recently said Ethereum will ultimately \u201cfail\u201d unless transaction fees become cheaper, particularly during bull markets.\n\nBut other Ethereum bulls have been quick to come to its defense.\n\nAnthony Sassano, host of the Ethereum show The Daily Gwei was adamant Ethereum is undervalued in the current market, while Bankless co-host Ryan Sean Adams said he\u2019s \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at the negative sentiment he\u2019s seen on Ethereum:\n\n\u201cI never anticipated ETH would be viewed as non-consensus underdog again, yet here we are. Long ETH 2024.\"\n\nRelated: Solana price technicals hint at 40% crash by New Year\u2019s\n\nMeanwhile, Solana (SOL) bulls have also been quick to note that the price of SOL has been performing well against other cryptocurrencies including Ether, particularly over the last three months. SOL is up 12% to $83 over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSOL/ ETH price chart over the last month. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nOther pundits have pointed to Solana overtaking Ethereum in decentralized exchange (DEX), stablecoin and nonfungible token (NFT) trading volumes over both 24-hour and seven-day intervals this week, with the recent price action prompting others to even suggest that Solana will \u201cflip\u201d Ethereum one day.\n\nSolana absolutely ripping.

Mcap/TVL is a commonly used metric to measure a blockchain\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s value is lower, it could suggest it is undervalued (relative to Solana).\n\nI'm honestly in disbelief with how undervalued ETH is right now and how it's somehow become a non-consensus bet.\n\n\n\nNo matter - I can keep buying ETH longer than the market can stay retarded. \u2014 sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) December 19, 2023\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto \u2014 Substance abuse grows among crypto traders"

        "title": "Exclusive: NY financial regulator approves Paxos expansion to Solana, allowing for its first stablecoin issuance beyond Ethereum - Fortune",
        "content": "The leading stablecoin issuer Paxos has received regulatory approval to expand its products to the Solana blockchain, which it plans to launch on Jan. 17, 2024.\n\nWith peers including Circle and Tether vying for critical market share, the expansion is a major step for Paxos, which touts its relationship with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS).\n\n\u201cPaxos is the most regulated stablecoin issuer in the world,\u201d Walter Hessert, head of strategy at the firm, told Fortune in an interview. \u201cWe are the only company that has been issuing regulated stablecoins at scale\u2014period.\u201d\n\nStablecoin wars\n\nCofounded by financial veteran Charles Cascarilla, Paxos became the first crypto firm to receive a trust charter under the new digital asset regulatory regime implemented by DFS in 2015. To this day, DFS remains the sole U.S. financial regulator to implement a comprehensive framework for crypto, which has attracted a number of leading companies, including Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nPaxos received DFS approval to issue its first stablecoin in 2018, which it called Paxos Standard, rebranding the token to USDP in 2021. Stablecoins are a type of crypto token pegged to an underlying asset\u2014in this case, the U.S. dollar. Unlike the other leading USD-pegged stablecoins Tether and Circle\u2019s USD Coin, Paxos only issues USDP on Ethereum owing to restrictions from DFS.\n\nPaxos has argued that its commitment to working directly with DFS on issuance, rather than operating outside the framework of a financial regulator, sets it apart from competitors. While Tether is often critiqued for its offshore, opaque operations, Circle also presents itself as following U.S. regulatory standards, although it does not issue USDC under DFS supervision. As a result, Circle offers USDC across more than a dozen blockchains, including Tron, which has come under fire in recent months for facilitating illicit finance.\n\n\u201cFrom a growth perspective, you\u2019d like to issue across every single chain,\u201d Hessert said. \u201cCircle and other players can issue on to other protocols, but no one knows who\u2019s overseeing it\u2014or what their process is.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Paxos\u2019s approach helps gain trust with its partners, including major financial players like MercadoLibre, PayPal, and Mastercard, that customer protections are in place.\n\nEven so, Paxos has had its missteps. One of its first stablecoins, BUSD, was issued in partnership with leading crypto exchange Binance. After reports surfaced that Binance was creating a synthetic version of the stablecoin with questionable reserves, DFS ordered Paxos to stop issuing the token. As Fortune later reported, over 95% of Paxos\u2019s revenue came from that partnership.\n\nHello, Solana\n\nPaxos received a \u201cnon-objection\u201d from DFS to expand USDP from Ethereum to Solana, after what a spokesperson described as an \u201cextensive and exhaustive review,\u201d although the firm declined to specify how long the process took.\n\nWhile Hessert declined to say what type of information DFS required for the Solana expansion, citing the confidential supervisory process, he said it involved an internal risk framework built by Paxos to assess the blockchain and its processes, including its compliance protocols.\n\nFirst launched in early 2020 with the promise of increasing transaction speeds and reducing costs compared with Ethereum, Solana became one of the most popular blockchains before taking a major hit last year owing to its association with Sam Bankman-Fried. While its native token, SOL, is still far off from its all-time high of about $260, it has gained substantial traction over the past month.\n\nHessert said Solana\u2019s speed and cost relative to Ethereum will make it an attractive option for Paxos\u2019s partners, who aim to implement stablecoin in use cases from cross-border remittances to payments for goods and services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually going to start to see this new wave of adoption be enabled in ways that we haven\u2019t seen in stablecoins yet,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nFor now, Paxos\u2019s highest-profile project is its new stablecoin PYUSD, issued in partnership with PayPal. Hessert said he imagines that firms like PayPal will want to expand to Solana. Paxos\u2019s first Solana-based offering will be USDP, which has a market cap of just $370 million, compared with nearly $25 billion for USDC and nearly $94 billion for Tether.\n\nA spokesperson for PayPal declined to comment.\n\nHessert said Paxos hopes to gain approval to issue stablecoins across other layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains, although he declined to provide specific examples."

I received a message from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik. So I dumped SOL and bought more ETH.\n\nETH = $5,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,332 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHayes makes it clear he is rooting for Solana to continue to dip against Ethereum (SOL/ETH).\n\n\u201cGet Down!!!!\n\nETH = $5,000.\u201d\n\nSOL/ETH is trading for 0.04100 ETH ($95.63) at time of writing.\n\nHayes also shares his thoughts on the possible approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the differences between a so-called cash redemption model versus an \u201cin-kind\u201d model.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETFs cash or in-kind creation what\u2019s important?\n\nIn-kind is simpler and cleaner for the fund, as the fund doesn\u2019t have to direct the trading of BTC, but it means BTC can be sourced from anywhere. Cash is more complicated, but it hands big power to the fund. The fund trading desk will have bigly power to direct what should be large trading flows of BTC.\n\nGiven the \u2018made in America\u2019 political zeitgeist, you can bet only politically connected brokers and exchanges will be used as counter-parties to buy and BTC for the fund. It will be interesting to observe how the market microstructure changes if at all.\n\nWill price discovery move from East to West? Will the most important time to trade be Monday-Friday at 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when the creation/redemption window closes?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s forthcoming upgrade, \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d (also known as \u201cDencun\u201d), will begin testing on Jan. 17, according to a note published on the official Ethereum GitHub repository. The upgrade will first be applied to the Goerli testnet, then added to Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7. The Ethereum team has yet to announce when Dencun will be implemented on the mainnet.\n\nThe new upgrade includes several tools intended to reduce fees, allow for new features of bridges and staking pools, and limit the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.\n\nAccording to its developer documents, Dencun will contain Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This will allow layer-2 rollup networks such as Arbitrum, Base, Polygon zkEVM and others to store certain transaction data temporarily, using a new format called \u201cblobs.\u201d Blobs can be deleted after 18 days, whereas the current practice is to include the data in the \u201cCALLDATA\u201d field and keep it on the blockchain forever. Ethereum developers believe that proto-danksharding will significantly reduce transaction fees on layer 2s.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper \u2014 Consensys\n\nThe upgrade also contains several other proposals, including EIP-1153, which introduces a \u201ctransient storage\u201d system to further reduce fees, as well as EIP-4788, which increases transparency by storing the root of each Beacon Chain block in a smart contract that can be queried by applications. Developers expect the data provided by EIP-4788 to be used in new features for bridges and staking pools.\n\nIn addition, Dencun contains EIP-6780, a proposal to limit the use of the self-destruct keyword. If embedded within a contract before deployment, self-destructs can currently be used to erase the code for a smart contract and send all of its funds to the account that deployed it. After Dencun, this keyword will not erase the code unless it is called within the same transaction in which it was deployed. However, the keyword will still transfer all funds to the deployer, even if it is called in a future transaction.\n\nEthereum upgrades usually undergo testing for a few months before being deployed to the mainnet. The previous deployment, codenamed \u201cShapella,\u201d began testing on Feb. 7. It was launched to mainnet on April 12."

        "content": "Veteran trader Peter Brandt foresees Ethereum (ETH) falling to a level last reached in early November.\n\nBrandt tells his 709,400 followers on the X social media platform that Ethereum is possibly forming a descending triangle, a pattern that is typically considered bearish.\n\nAccording to Brandt, if Ethereum forms a \u201cdecisive close below the lower boundary\u201d of the descending triangle, the second-largest crypto asset could plummet to at least $1,893.\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,267 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is Bitcoin (BTC). The veteran trader says that the flagship crypto asset is forming a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. Bull flag patterns occur when the price of an asset is in a strong uptrend and they typically signal the continuation of the upward movement.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $44,101 at time of writing.\n\nEarlier, the widely followed veteran trader had pointed out the formation of a triple divergence between the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and price on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart over the October-to-December period.\n\nThe RSI/price divergences occur when the price moves in the opposite direction of the indicator readings. Based on Brandt\u2019s chart, it appears that the price of Bitcoin made three higher highs on the daily chart while the RSI indicator made three corresponding lower highs in the third quarter.\n\nOn the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair, Brandt says that the ETH/BTC pair is showing signs of a downward trend persisting amid the formation of a descending triangle on the daily chart. Descending triangles are typically considered bearish patterns.\n\nAccording to Brandt, Ethereum has depreciated approximately 36% against Bitcoin year-to-date.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum reclaims a crucial resistance that suggests the bulls continue to hold a tight grip over the rally\n\nThe bulls who appear to be in control are believed to trigger a fine upswing that could lead the price a step closer to its ATH\n\nThe bulls appear to have slowly conquered the crypto markets as the prices of the popular tokens have been rising consistently. As the Bitcoin price maintains a sideways trend, the altcoins gain traction as the Ethereum price regains bullish momentum. With a rebound from the interim lows at $2,100, the second-largest token validated a bullish divergence, and by surpassing the crucial resistance, it invalidated a bearish scenario for a while.\n\nThe bears had frozen the levels at $2257 as the price constantly failed to clear these levels. Although the price marked the daily highs above $2330, it is facing some bearish heat, which is preventing it from rising above the average bands of the rising parallel channel. As the price trades above the support, the possibility of a bullish breakout emerges. Moreover, the technicals also support the bullish claim that a rally towards $2500 could be imminent.\n\nAs seen in the chart, the ETH price is testing the immediate upper resistance zone between $2312 and $2337. If the price closes the day\u2019s trade within or above the price zone, then the price could reach the neckline of the double-bottom pattern. With this, a bullish breakout may be followed as the RSI is bullish and the TSI is closer to flashing a buy signal. Moreover, the buying pressure has coiled up, which suggests the token will maintain an ascending trend for a long time.\n\nThis trade indicates a rise beyond the pivotal resistance level of $2386.82, which has to be held firmly by the bulls. This could lead to an extended bullish upswing beyond the crucial resistance at $2529.78, which may invalidate a bearish trend. Now that the markets are approaching the end of the year, volatility is expected to rise. This may result in a bullish start for the year 2024, which may transform into a bull run to reach $3500 during the first quarter."

While Bitcoin enjoys a favorable position, buoyed by speculative optimism over an imminent SEC decision on a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies lag in performance and mainstream appeal.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ambitious network, the bedrock for myriad DeFi projects and NFTs, continues to push boundaries but struggles to maintain its historically strong position. Ether\u2019s underperformance is notable against Bitcoin\u2019s gains and the meteoric rises of newer players like Solana and Cardano. Despite its pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem, Ethereum\u2019s influence wanes as the market evolves and new technologies emerge.\n\nThe previous year\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d was a significant milestone for Ethereum, aimed at drastically reducing its environmental impact and courting ESG-conscious investors. However, the initiative\u2019s aftermath hasn\u2019t lived up to the high expectations set for mainstream adoption and investment surge. Ether\u2019s price has seen fluctuations post-Merge, and the anticipated influx of ESG-minded capital remains largely unrealized.\n\nMeanwhile, the broader crypto market is seeing a shift towards AI-driven tokens, which have become a standout theme. These tokens represent a burgeoning intersection of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, promising new possibilities and attracting significant investment. As the crypto landscape diversifies, these AI-related tokens outperform traditional offerings, capturing investor interest and signaling a shift in market dynamics.\n\nvia ft\n\nAs the year concludes, the crypto market reflects a complex interplay of technological innovation, regulatory scrutiny, and shifting investor sentiments. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance expands, Ethereum grapples with its strategic direction and market share, and emerging trends like AI integration redefine what\u2019s possible. The narrative of cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, setting the stage for an unpredictable and dynamic 2024."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price rallied by over 85% in 2023 \u2013 a similar increase in 2024 places the target above $4,000.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF approval will be a key catalyst for a price rally and also set a precedent for ETH ETF approvals in Q2 and Q3 2024.\n\nEthereum mainnet is expected to undergo the sharding upgrades, starting with Dencun, which will introduce proto-danksharding.\n\nInvestors and traders alike are anticipating ETH price to rise in order to book profits before Q2 2024.\n\nEthereum price increased considerably in 2023, recovering about a third of the crash from December 2021 to May 2022. However, the remaining two-thirds of this crash is expected to be recovered in 2024 owing to multiple factors.\n\nETH investors have a lot to look forward to throughout the year as events such as spot Bitcoin ETF approval, Dencun (sharding) update, and spot Ethereum ETF decision will be taking place, which are expected to be bullish catalysts. However, the lack of institutional investors' interest might act as a barrier to this growth and keep ETH from reaching $4,000.\n\n2024 Fundamental outlook: Ethereum price to witness growth from spot Bitcoin ETF approval\n\n2024 is expected to kick off the bull run that the crypto market has been waiting for since June 2022. Ethereum price, along with the rest of the market, is set to witness bullishness owing to one single factor \u2013 the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOver a dozen investment fund managers, including the likes of BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, have applied for ETFs. The initial outcome was not positive as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exhibited skepticism, but following Grayscale's win, sentiment changed.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the asset manager in the lawsuit filed against the SEC for rejecting the request to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. This imbued confidence in the market, and the deadline for the final decision is expected to arrive by January 10, 2024.\n\nBitcoin spot ETF update\n\nAs Bitcoin price rallies, Ethereum will fulfill its role as the \"Silver to BTC's Gold\" and likely push other altcoins to rally as well.\n\nFurthermore, this approval will also set a precedent for Ethereum spot ETFs, which asset managers are already eyeing. VanEck, ARK Invest, and BlackRock, among three others, have already applied for a spot ETH ETF. Grayscale, too, filed to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these applications have strong odds of approval, too, since they would be similar in design and structure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, their final deadline is between May and August 2024, giving investors time before they can get their hands on the investment products.\n\nEthereum spot ETF filings\n\nThat said, following the spot BTC ETF approval, ETH ETFs will see much less friction in acquiring a green light from the SEC. This will be the driving factor for the continuation of the Ethereum price rise in Q2 2024.\n\nThe Surge after the Merge\n\nDuring a recent Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the future of the blockchain. Referencing the Merge, Buterin stated that the chain is only 55% complete and has a long way to go.\n\nThe next four stages, as noted by Buterin, will be The Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The first of these four \u2013 The Surge \u2013 will introduce sharding on Ethereum.\n\nSharding is a key scalability solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network's capacity to process transactions and execute smart contracts. This is done by splitting the network into smaller, more manageable chains called shards.\n\nEthereum Sharding structure\n\nThese shards are individual components of the Ethereum network itself. Each shard operates as an independent blockchain with its own set of smart contracts. These chains can process transactions and execute smart contracts independently, reducing congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe main goals of Ethereum developers with the sharding update are as follows:\n\nScalability: As the Ethereum network continues to grow, it faces significant limitations in transaction throughput and processing capacity. Sharding introduces a parallel processing approach, allowing multiple transactions and smart contracts to be processed simultaneously across different shards. Crosslinking: Shards communicate with each other through crosslinks, which are references to the state of one shard included in another shard's block. Crosslinking helps maintain consistency and integrity across the entire Ethereum network. Increased opportunities for validators: Validators participate in the consensus process by proposing and validating blocks on individual shards. Validators are chosen to propose blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they lock up as collateral in the Ethereum 2.0 Proof-of-Stake system.\n\nIn the sharding update, the beacon chain will play a crucial role as well. The beacon chain was the first Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which acts as a separate blockchain that coordinates the overall network and manages the consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Stake). This chain will be used to coordinate communication between the shards.\n\nThe process of implementing sharding will begin with the Dencun upgrade. Set to be executed in Q1 2024, the upgrade will bring proto-danksharding to the network. Proto-danksharding will act as the scaffolding for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding, which is a crucial part of the Surge.\n\nDencun upgrade will also optimize the Ethereum gas fees, which has been a prevailing issue for users. Throughout 2023, Ethereum layer-2 chain\u2019s fee per transaction has averaged $0.02 to $0.21, whereas Ethereum mainnet transaction fees have averaged $4.86.\n\nEthereum and layer-2 chains\u2019 gas fees\n\nAs these updates are set to arrive in Q1 and Q2, with many of them expected to be deployed by May-June, they will likely act as the bullish catalyst of the second half of 2024.\n\n2024 Technical Outlook: Ethereum price could see $4,000\n\nEthereum price over the past year had a good run, rising by more than 85%. While Q1 proved to be a good quarter for the altcoin, the growth halted, and ETH largely consolidated throughout Q2 and Q3, struggling to breach the $2,000 mark.\n\nHowever, in Q4, Ethereum price began rallying again, mostly owing to expectations surrounding the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which also led to many investment funds filing for spot ETH ETFs. During this duration, ETH shot up by 51% to end the year at around $2,200, which is the present trading price.\n\nThus, if throughout 2023 ETH rose by over 85% despite the bearish market conditions, a similar rally or even a larger one can be expected out of a bullish year in which ETF approvals are expected, network developments are implemented, and Bitcoin halving will take place.\n\nETH/USD 1-week chart\n\nIf ETH repeats 2023\u2019s performance in 2024, the target for next year will be at over $4,000. The price indicators also suggest a bullish outcome despite the slight correction in the past few weeks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just exited overbought, coinciding with the pullback witnessed over the last week, whilst the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is rising above the zero line, showing the uptrend is accompanied by strong bullish momentum.\n\nAlthough the receding green bars do suggest that the bullishness is waning at the moment, some pullback before bullish momentum regains strength is common in longer timeframes, and this can be observed during the past bull runs as well.\n\nFurthermore, ETH has observed the 50, 100 and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) as support, which is a bullish indication since the last time this happened was in July 2020. At that time, ETH ended up scoring a 1,577% rally from $288 to $3,928, a feat that will not be replicated in 2024.\n\nNevertheless, despite the bullish indications, one should remember that the recent rally has caused the Ethereum price to be overbought on RSI, and investors might attempt to book profits in the first half of 2024 again. This falls in line with historical movement where ETH lived in the overbought zone (RSI above 70.0) for about six months before initiating short-term corrections in June 2021.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nThe prospect of investors selling their holdings to realize profits is also evident from the on-chain metrics, which suggest investors may book profits if the Ethereum price shoots up. Nevertheless, ETH would still be expected to remain above the $2,500 mark until Q2, after the corrections, the ETF hype subsides, and the market moves on to the Ethereum network upgrades.\n\nProfit-taking will bring corrections, but traders remain bullish\n\nOn-chain metrics can be used to analyze investors' behavior and make predictions about future price activity. One of the most important on-chain metrics is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric is an indicator used to assess the average profit/loss of investors who purchase an asset. It can provide clues as to when investors might begin taking profits and selling their holdings, leading to pullbacks in price.\n\nThe quarterly and yearly MVRV ratios are the most useful for long-term analysis. The 90-day MVRV ratio measures the average profit/loss of investors who purchased an asset in the past three months, and the 365-day MVRV ratio measures the same over the last year.\n\nFor Ethereum, the 90-day MVRV sits at 15.25%, which indicates that investors who purchased ETH in Q4 2023 are sitting at 15.25% profit. Similarly, the 365-day MVRV ratio is presently at 24.18%, suggesting that those who purchased throughout 2023 are, on average, witnessing 24.18% profits.\n\nInterestingly, considering both the timeframes, it is evident that these investors are likely to be tempted to sell their holdings soon to realize profits. This could most certainly trigger a sell-off. As seen in the chart, when MVRV hits 9% to 34% on the yearly time frame and 7.8% to 31% on the quarterly time frame, ETH has undergone considerable corrections. Hence, this area is termed a danger zone.\n\nEthereum MVRV ratio\n\nApart from investors, the traders are also seemingly bullish. This inference is derived from the funding rates, which show an increasing trend. Such a trend suggests that long positions are gaining dominance, indicating a prevailing bullish market sentiment.\n\nAs can be observed on the chart below, the last time funding rates plunged into negative, i.e., short traders gained dominance, was back in March 2023. Since then, the rates have largely been positive, which means people are betting on a rise. This is solely being done with the intention of selling for profits.\n\nEthereum funding rate\n\nSo, considering these conditions, the bull run that starts due to spot Bitcoin ETF hype, followed by the sharding update, will likely urge investors to sell and realize profits. However, long-term holders will refrain and wait until the bull run flips and ETH begins witnessing a downtrend.\n\nWatch out for institutions\n\nOne key factor that might act as a headwind to Ethereum price reaching the target of $4,000 is the lack of institutional interest ETH has been witnessing. Year to date, the crypto asset only managed to rake in $19 million, which is far lower than Solana's $146 million worth of inflows and astronomically less than Bitcoin's $1.7 billion.\n\nEthereum's year-to-date institutional flows\n\nIf this trend continues in 2024 as well, ETH might struggle to capitalize on the rest of the bullish cues since institutions are expected to drive the next bull run, and lack of interest from them may not play in Ethereum's favor.\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarize the outlook for Ethereum in 2024, the best advice is to sit on holdings, wait and gain. A bullish year for the broader crypto market and a bullish year for ETH investors is the forecast. But that does not mean the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold is completely immune to bearish outcomes.\n\nWhile an increase to $4,000 is possible, it is not a certainty since regulatory changes and unprecedented crashes plague the crypto market. Furthermore, considering the performance in 2023, ETH has not necessarily been the favorite asset of institutional investors. This lack of interest, if noted in 2024 as well, could act as an opposing force on ETH's potential growth.\n\nThus, it is advised always to do your own research and make the most ETH-ducated decision."

        "title": "Solana Flips BNB To Become 4th-Largest Crypto, Is Ethereum Next - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Solana has had one of the best price journeys this year, increasing an outstanding 665% since January. The cryptocurrency has particularly done well in the last quarter of the year, registering price gains that were practically absent for the majority of the year.\n\nThis week, SOL flipped BNB to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency and second-largest altcoin by market cap. At this rate, Ethereum\u2019s spot may be next.\n\nSolana\u2019s Impressive Growth\n\nSolana\u2019s price movement this year has been nothing but surprising, and it has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. At the same time, Solana\u2019s blockchain has grown in different metrics. The growth can also be simultaneously linked to various airdrops in Solana-based projects and the Solana Saga Phone which gave out 30 million BONK tokens, a Solana meme coin, for each new owner of the phone. As a result, Solana overtook XRP in market cap rankings for the first time ever, with the latter having a 1.82% price decrease in a 7-day timeframe.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token, SOL, recently reached a yearly high of $99, helping the network to also briefly overtake BNB in terms of market cap. According to data from Coinmarketcap, SOL\u2019s 24-hour trading volume increased by over 33% to over $5.86 billion.\n\nHowever, Solana has since undergone a price correction and is now trading at $91. On the other hand, BNB\u2019s price growth has been slow this year, with the crypto only registering a 9% gain in the past 365 days.\n\nAt the time of writing, BNB is trading at $269, a 22.7% decrease from its yearly high of $348. Solana is now at loggerheads with BNB and it is only a matter of time until it fully overtakes and claims the position of the 2nd largest altcoin.\n\nSOL price recovers above $93 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCan Solana Catch Up With Ethereum?\n\nThe question now is whether Solana can catch up to Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network. While Ethereum still dominates in the DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts space, Solana is continuing to acquire a growing share of the industry.\n\nIn particular, activity on Solana has been on par with Ethereum in the past few weeks, with the chains now rivaling in terms of DEX volume, NFT volumes, active addresses, transaction count, and stablecoin transfers. According to on-chain analytics platform Artemis, total SOL trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $1.5 billion in the past 24 hours, its highest so far this year.\n\nSource: Artemis\n\nSolana is currently trading at $91, up by 17% in the past seven days, and is on its way to breaking the $100 price level again. If the current pace of price growth continues, we could see Solana revisiting its current all-time high of $259 in the first half of 2024.\n\nHowever, Solana still has a long way to go to match Ethereum\u2019s network effects and price. Ethereum\u2019s total market cap currently stands at $278.3 billion, $244 billion more than Solana\u2019s $39.4 billion market cap.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A prophetic message prompted Hayes to dump SOL for ETH .\n\nHayes predicts huge Ethereum price appreciation .\n\nSolana\u2019s price and DEX volume have strong momentum.\n\nSolana\u2019s ties to FTX and its disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried led many to believe the project was finished. However, 2023 has been Solana\u2019s year of redemption, particularly from late Q3 onwards, as SOL spiked higher to post an 830% year-to-date gain. Yet BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has waded in to \u201cforetell\u201d that now is the time to ditch Solana in favor of Ethereum.\n\nDump Solana Sayeth the Lord\n\nHayes announced dumping Solana in favor of Ethereum, citing a message from God as the basis for this call. The humorous tweet poked fun at Solana\u2019s history with FTX while glorifying \u201cArchangel Vitalik\u201d as the bringer of an imminent $5,000 ETH price.\n\nFam \u2026 I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nMany of the replies mimicked Hayes\u2019 humorous style, conferring religious connotations back, including one X user who took a dig at Ethereum\u2019s unaffordable network costs by commenting, \u201cThe Lord does not support such gas fees. Blasphemy I say.\u201d Similarly, Pepe maximalist \u201cz\ud83d\udc38\u201d implied that Hayes had misinterpreted God\u2019s 5,000 figure as the incoming ETH gas price, not a future ETH price.\n\nthis is the gwei \u2014 z\ud83d\udc38 (@degenharambe) December 22, 2023\n\nCommon themes throughout were the interpretation of Hayes\u2019 tweet as a sign to stack more SOL and to trade the token long, as well as accusations that Hayes is attempting to manipulate the market.\n\nAlthough Hayes conveyed a tongue-in-cheek message to dump Solana for Ethereum, looking at the data suggests the momentum is with Solana.\n\nEthereum Killer?\n\nData posted by SOL data aggregator platform Step Finance showed that Solana\u2019s 24-hour DEX volume had exceeded Ethereum\u2019s, plus all of its layer 2s combined, indicating strong momentum within the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, as noted by \u201cThe Crypto Cat,\u201d the SOLETH trading pair saw a massive uptick from around 0.011 to as high as 0.041 during this quarter. The Crypto Cat commented that this marks a remarkable turnaround from the recent past when his feed was filled with commentary that Solana \u201cwas the worst trash in existence.\u201d\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nHayes has a history of making bold price predictions and attention-grabbing statements on crypto X .\n\nEthereum \u2019s market cap valuation is seven times greater than Solana \u2019s.\n\nSolana has been criticized for frequent outages, but the network has had 100% uptime since late February.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile cloaked in humor, Hayes\u2019 tweet underscores the monumental difficulty crypto projects face when trying to unseat Ethereum\u2019s dominant network effect, particularly its vast developer ecosystem. Nonetheless, Solana appears to have shaken off its negative image, demonstrating that investors can forgive when prices increase.\n\nRead about Solana\u2019s remarkable rise in market cap valuation here:\n\nSolana Overthrows XRP, Adding $5B Market Cap in a Single Day\n\n\n\nFind out about PancakeSwap\u2019s plan for \u201cultrasound\u201d CAKE here:\n\nPancakeSwap Proposes Hefty Cut to CAKE Token Supply"

        "content": "BitMex founder Arthur Hayes has revealed that he is diverting his interest toward Ethereum (ETH) while disclosing a bold prediction for the crypto asset.\n\nArthur Hayes Doubling Down On Ethereum\n\nArthur Hayes recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his optimism and prediction about the future of Ethereum, and the post has since caused quite a stir in the entire cryptocurrency community.\n\nRenowned for his perceptive market analysis, Hayes claimed to have had a revelation on ETH during one of his meditations, and this prompted him to significantly alter his cryptocurrency holdings. He sarcastically asserted in the X post to have gotten the direction from the Lord.\n\nFollowing this supposed heavenly direction, Hayes allegedly sold his Solana holdings and increased his stake in Ethereum. In addition, he has predicted a spike that would take the price of the cryptocurrency asset to an astounding $5,000.\n\nHe further conveyed his love and appreciation for Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Hayes called Vitalik an Archangel while doing so.\n\nHayes\u2019 evaluation of the market dynamics might have played a role in his choice to divert from Solana to Ethereum. In another X post, Arthur Hayes shared a chart of Ethereum to back up his predictions. The crypto exchange founder has urged the crypto community to \u201cget down\u201d on the digital asset.\n\nThe BitMex founder\u2019s projections come after his previous call, in which he predicted that Solana\u2019s price would hit $100. Hayes\u2019 prediction has appeared to be almost accurate, as the digital asset\u2019s price has recently reached a peak of $99.\n\nSince mid-December SOL has been demonstrating a rally, increasing by an astounding 350%. Despite the fact that Solana is displaying an upward trajectory, Hayes seems to think that Ethereum still has the potential to outperform SOL.\n\nGlassnode Co-Founders Give Next Target For The Crypto Asset\n\nJan Happel and Yann Allemann, cofounders of Glassnode and collectively known on X as Negentropic, have highlighted the next target for Ethereum. According to the cofounders, the next target for ETH is $2,500 and has urged the community to keep an eye on this level.\n\nNegentropic asserted that the asset reaching the $2,500 target will be triggered by market enthusiasm. Another target identified by the founders is $2,700, which ETH will attain by continuous ambitious push.\n\nThe co-founders also highlighted a support level at $2,100, which was once a resistance level but now a key zone. However, Negentropic pointed out that the level has now turned out to be critical for short-term rebounds. In addition, they asserted that if ETH ends up breaching the support level, it might activate the 50-Day EMA.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,307, indicating a 1.30% increase in the past 24 hours. Its trading volume has increased by 19% to $16,690,793,321, its market capitalization has increased by 1.31% to $277,454,559,883.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Sentiment over Ethereum has waned in recent weeks as Bitcoin took the limelight with a push to a new 2023 high.\n\nMoreover, rival blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche are gaining traction, with token price gains outpacing ETH.\n\nOn Dec. 21, Glassnode analyst \u201cCheckmatey\u201d opined that the decline in the market cap ratio between ETH and BTC might only be halfway.\n\nHe made the case that Bitcoin is likely to continue increasing its dominance relative to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Sentiment Weakens\n\nMoreover, across derivatives markets, Bitcoin dominance continues to grow relative to Ethereum, he noted, adding that it is now in 70% territory.\n\nA monthly change in realized market capitalization shows much larger capital inflows for Bitcoin at $13.8 billion per month compared to just $6 billion for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThis suggests Bitcoin is seeing stronger buyer demand,\u201d he said.\n\nIf history is any guide, the decline in market cap ratio between $ETH and $BTC may only be half-way\u2026 Below is a \ud83e\uddf5 covering a few different measures of market dominance between #Bitcoin and #Ethereum, which paints a case for continuation, not reversal.https://t.co/RiPVkb7zoF pic.twitter.com/x0Wa1tldmm \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udd11\u26a1\u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 20, 2023\n\nHe also noted that Ethereum\u2019s realized market cap remains overvalued compared to Bitcoin. As ETH holders capitulate and sell at a loss, locking in lower prices, Ethereum\u2019s realized cap will drop further.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin tends to recover faster than Ethereum after drawdowns in realized market cap. Exchange flow metrics also show Bitcoin commands over 75% dominance in transfer activity.\n\nIt is not all doom and gloom for the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset, however, and these sentiment lulls happen every cycle. On Dec. 21, Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano commented on this:\n\n\u201cSeems like we\u2019ve finally reached the \u201cdeath of ETH party\u201d phase of the cycle. Just bought more ETH to celebrate.\u201d\n\nFellow Etherean Ryan Sean Adams said he was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by all the negativity for ETH.\n\n\u201cI never anticipated ETH would be viewed as a non-consensus underdog again, yet here we are,\u201d he said.\n\nFundamentally, Ethereum is as strong as ever, as detailed by Sassano earlier this week.\n\nETH Prices Remain Flat\n\nEthereum prices have been flat for most of the past week, seesawing between $2,150 and $2,250. It has gained 83% since the beginning of this year, however, which is not bad for a dead coin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was changing hands for around $2,200, having gained 9% over the past 30 days."

        "content": "ETH accumulation has been increasing, suggesting a move toward $2,500.\n\nMarket participants are not convinced that the coin is about to jump.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Santiment, active addresses on the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain have been rising. As of 18th December, the 24-hour active addresses was 395,000.\n\nBut at press time, the metric has climbed to 512,000. Active addresses measure daily interaction and speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the increase suggests that there are more market participants involved in ETH transfers. Like the active addresses, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain volume also increased.\n\nAt the time of writing, the volume was 13.02 billion. The rise in active users and volume implies a surge in network activity on the blockchain\n\nETH\u2019 season to switch states\n\nAlso, this could be a bullish sign for ETH\u2019s price. For a while, ETH has come under intense criticism for its inability to replicate Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] form. Likewise, ETH has also been unable to outperform many other altcoins.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that ETH will not have its season.\n\nOne reason for this assertion is the number of new ETH wallets created. Based on Glassnode\u2019s data, new addresses on Ethereum have been growing.\n\nThis indicates a surge in traction which could translate to a positive move for the price action. On a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis, ETH\u2019s value has increased by 84.11%.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency has been stuck between the $2,000 and $2,300 levels for some time. A look at the ETH/USD daily chart showed that a bullish thesis could soon be validated.\n\nThis was because of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). At press time, the 20-day EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50-day EMA (yellow).\n\nThis position is bullish and could be termed a buy/long trend. So, traders may need to desist from opening short positions.\n\nBut the Awesome Oscillator (AO) revealed that ETH\u2019s bullish season may not happen in a few days. At the same time, it may not be far away.\n\n$2,500 or nothing\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO had formed red bars. However, the red bars were decreasing in height, suggesting a weak bearish momentum.\n\nAlso, the increase in the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator means a move to $2,500 could be possible in the short to mid-term.\n\nIn the meantime, market participants are not all bullish on ETH. This was indicated by the Weighted Sentiment.\n\nAt press time, the Weighted Sentiment was -1.736. This negative reading is a confirmation of the bearish bias most market players have.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nConsidering ETH\u2019s circulation, on-chain data showed that it decreased to 242,000. This decrease implies that the number of ETH engaged in transactions has reduced compared to the hike on the 20th of December.\n\nPrice-wise, the drop in circulation suggests low selling pressure for ETH. So, it may be unlikely to see a nosedive in ETH\u2019s value soon."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH) has continued its steady climb of the last couple days, jumping 4% in 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency is now trading for $2,324, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmong the latest news: Ethereum core developers yesterday solidified plans to roll out DenCun\u2014the next upgrade for the network\u2014on testnets beginning in January. This next round of updates will introduce proto-danksharding and so-called data \"blobs.\"\n\nIn really simple terms, they new features are meant to significantly reduce high gas fees and improve the network's capacity. ETH's newly buoyant price was enough to convince crypto trader Peter Brandt to reverse his prediction that Ethereum was barreling towards an \"immediate price collapse.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrong opinions, weakly held\n\nWhen circumstances change, my opinion changes\n\nMy recent appraisal of $ETH called for immediate price collapse - that has not happened\n\nI have withdrawn my bearish outlook based on chart structure. @CointelegraphMT pic.twitter.com/Pb2fUsuiAn \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 22, 2023\n\nThe positive sentiment extended to Ethereum scaling solutions, as well.\n\nOptimism (OP) has jumped by 27% in the past day. The token behind the Ethereum scaling solution is currently the best-performing cryptocurrency, priced in at $3.06. And Arbitrum (ARB), the token behind the protocol which aims to speed up transaction times and cut fees on Ethereum, is up 19% in 24 hours, and is now trading hands for $1.35.\n\nOf the major coins and tokens, Polygon's MATIC is doing well, surging by more than 8% in the past day. It is now priced at $0.84.\n\nMeanwhile Solana (SOL) is still surging, albeit at a slightly less blistering pace than it has been.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been flirting with a $100 per coin price, having jumped 2% in the past day. In fact, it was briefly the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap when it inched past Binance's BNB exchange token. As of this writing, BNB has a market cap of $41.7 billion and is holding onto its edge over SOL's $40.6 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThere's been a big DeFi shift happening, as NFT and meme coin traders have flocked to Solana to chase BONK and Dogwifhat. In fact, BONK last week got a listing on Coinbase\u2014an honorific that sets it apart from a lot of other meme coins.\n\nAnd just two weeks ago, NFT trading volume on Solana edged past Ethereum. But as of this writing, Ethereum had reclaimed its spot with $11.7 million worth of NFT trades in the past day compared to Solana's $10.6 million. The biggest contributors to NFT volume on the Ethereum network in the past 24 hours have been the Pudgy Penguins, Moonbirds, and Azuki collections.\n\nEven so, SOL has been on a persistent climb over the last two months, as big money investors eye-up the asset. This time last year, it was expected to take a nosedive due to its proximity to collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its now-convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nOver the past week, it has been the winner out of the top digital assets by market cap\u2014and has jumped by 28%.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) may be lying flat\u2014it hasn't budged in the past day\u2014it has climbed 4% in seven days and over 20% in the past month.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Discover SCENE\n\nAfter accelerating for weeks, momentum in the Solana ecosystem has finally accomplished the improbable: Transaction volume for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the blockchain has finally eclipsed that of exchanges on rival Ethereum, at least in the last week.\n\nDEX volume on Solana has soared to $9.03 billion over the last seven days, according to data from Defi Llama. In that same period, decentralized exchanges on Ethereum have seen $8.836 billion worth of transactions.\n\nThat victory may end up short-lived, as Ethereum is already edging out Solana in DEX volume over the last 24 hours, but it is nonetheless significant. Decentralized exchanges\u2014such as Uniswap on Ethereum and Orca on Solana\u2014facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of all sorts of cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins that aren\u2019t listed on centralized exchanges. Historically, the lion\u2019s share of that trading has always been concentrated on Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut recently, DEX activity on Solana has surged, in large part thanks to the network\u2019s lower gas fees. Solana meme coin BONK dominated crypto discourse for weeks after soaring from humble origins to a staggering billion-dollar market capitalization.\n\nThen, earlier this week, the ecosystem found another gem in Dogwifhat (WIF), another dog-themed Solana coin that\u2019s skyrocketed an astounding 376,000% since launching a month ago. On Thursday, the coin briefly pushed past a $250 million market capitalization, before settling back down to $204 million, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBlockchain data aggregated by Dune from some of the top Solana decentralized exchanges shows that BONK and WIF are among the top traded tokens over the past week, outside of stablecoins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the meantime, SOL has continued to surge off the network\u2019s good fortunes, flipping XRP on Wednesday and breaking another record for 2023 by topping $80. At writing, SOL is up higher still: above $89, according to CoinGecko.\n\nSolana users hailed these developments, along with other promising signs from the Solana NFT ecosystem, as evidence that the blockchain\u2019s time had finally come.\n\nSolana in the last 24 hours: - Flipped ETH in DEX Volume (First Time Ever)\n\n- Has 5% of TVL, proves it is a worthless metric\n\n- Jupiter flips Uniswap by Volume\n\n- 4 out of 10 Top DEX are from Solana\n\n- Solana doing 100% more NFT Volume than Ethereum\n\n- Tensor flips Blur It's over. \u2014 Gumshoe (@0xGumshoe) December 16, 2023\n\nETH influencers turning into SOL influencers right now: pic.twitter.com/1faz9h86qj \u2014 MinisterOfNFTs \ud83d\udd2e (@MinisterOfNFTs) December 20, 2023\n\nBut by other metrics, the chain still has a long way to go. Even with recent gains, SOL's market capitalization sits just above $37 billion. Ethereum is over seven times larger, at its current market cap of $268 billion.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has surged by over 85% since January 2023. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s price increase is significantly overshadowed by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) almost 160% growth and Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 650% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, ETH may see a spike in its price very soon.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Here is How to Be a Millionaire When ETH Hits $3,000\n\nAccording to cryptocurrency analyst Altcoin Daily, Ethereum (ETH) can \u201ceasily\u201d hit $10,000, a rise of about 354% from current levels. The analyst took to X and shared eleven reasons why the second-largest cryptocurrency could hit $10k.\n\nEthereum price can EASILY hit 10k! \ud83d\udef8 \ud83c\udf15\n\n\n\n\u2013 deflationary\n\n\u2013 high yields\n\n\u2013 massive dev activity\n\n\u2013 P/E ratio of 98 (better than Amazon)\n\n\u2013 staking ratio keeps increasing\n\n\u2013 no sell pressure from miners anymore\n\n\u2013 99% more energy efficient (than last cycle)\n\n\u2013 thriving L2 scene\n\n\u2013 EIP4844\u2026 pic.twitter.com/M5gDN15cg2 \u2014 Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) December 19, 2023\n\nAccording to Altcoin Daily, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) deflationary status is one reason the token\u2019s price may surge. The analyst also highlights the project\u2019s high yields, which may attract new buyers. Moreover, ETH has very high developmental activity. Altcoin Daily also points to ETH\u2019s price-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) being 98, which is higher than Amazon\u2019s.\n\nFurthermore, after moving to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, sell pressure from miners has evaporated. The network has also become 99% more energy efficient after the transition.\n\nHowever, one of the biggest drivers for Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price could be BlackRock\u2019s spot ETH ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) application. Analysts point to BlackRock\u2019s spot BTC ETF as a significant reason for a possible bull run in 2024. Hence, a spot ETH ETF could prove lucrative for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nWhen will Ethereum (ETH) hit $10,000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAccording to Changelly, ETH could reach a price of $10,000 sometime in 2027, almost three years from now. Furthermore, the platform anticipates ETH to surpass $33,000 by the end of this decade.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Standard Chartered Predicts ETH May Hit $35,000\n\nGlobal financial giant Standard Chartered predicts ETH to reach a price of $8,000 by 2026.

Additionally, BitMEX founder forecasts ETH to hit $5,000 per coin, which would be a new all-time high. In the last bull cycle, ETH touched an all-time high of $4,868 but failed to reach this round psychological level. But considering the current bullish outlook and the chances of an ETF approval for Bitcoin, the chances Ethereum price rises to $5,000 is high.\n\nHayes is not alone in his support for Ethereum; reports from JP Morgan analysts also have a similar view on Ether and indicate that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the long run. Raoul Paul agrees with this outlook. He states in his recent tweet,\n\nI think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024\n\nRead more: Ethereum price likely to outperform BTC says JP Mor gan report, but short-outlook remains flat despite ETF hype\n\nEthereum price to reach new yearly highs soon\n\nEthereum price is currently showing strength on the 4-hour chart as it has breached a short-term downtrend and signals a potential run-up. This recent breakout has strength, considering that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) have both flipped above their respective mean levels.\n\nThis development indicates that the bullish momentum is on the rise, which further supports the bullish thesis.\n\nAdditionally, the month of December is quite well-known for the Santa Rally, which is a historical tendency for stock markets to experience a rise in prices during the last trading week of December and the first few trading days of January. It is often observed as a period of increased buying activity fueled by factors like holiday cheer, investor optimism and so on.\n\nAll in all, investors can expect Ethereum to overcome the $2,160 to $2,403 range and tag the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $2,552. This move would constitute a near 11% gain from the current level of $2,295.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price breaches the range low of $2,160, it would invalidate the bullish thesis by producing a lower low. In such a case, ETH could revisit the $2,100 support level.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Annual Forecast: Spot ETF and sharding to drive ETH beyond $4,000 in 2024"

        "content": "Ethereum Will Continue Losing Ground To Bitcoin: Glassnode\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has continuously lost ground to that of its older brother, Bitcoin (BTC), throughout the year \u2013 and on-chain data suggests it will continue to do so.\n\nAs of Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance stood at 53.3%, versus Ethereum\u2019s 16.7%. A day prior, the ETH/BTC price ratio briefly fell below 0.05, its lowest value since April 2021.\n\nAccording to lead on-chain Glassnode analyst James Check, various other measures of market dominance between both top cryptocurrencies paint \u201ca case for continuation, not reversal\u201d of Ethereum\u2019s waning relative interest.\n\n\u201cAcross both futures and options derivatives markets, Bitcoin dominance continues to grow relative to Ethereum, pushing well above 60% and now into 70% territory,\u201d he explained in an X thread on Wednesday.\n\nIf history is any guide, the decline in market cap ratio between $ETH and $BTC may only be half-way\u2026 Below is a \ud83e\uddf5 covering a few different measures of market dominance between #Bitcoin and #Ethereum, which paints a case for continuation, not reversal.https://t.co/RiPVkb7zoF pic.twitter.com/x0Wa1tldmm \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \ud83d\udd11\u26a1\ud83c\udf0b\u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 20, 2023\n\nWhile volume in perpetual futures contracts for each asset reached parity 12 months ago, volume has since diverged into a 70/30 split in Bitcoin\u2019s favor.\n\nMuch the same can be said of both options volume and open interest, which have slowly moved towards Bitcoin since the start of the year.\n\nCheck also noted that ETH still appears \u201cquite overvalued\u201d next to BTC by realized cap \u2013 the market cap of ETH based on the price at which all coins were last moved.\n\nFor this to change, long-term ETH holders will need to sell their coins at a loss, and Bitcoin capital inflows will need to exceed Ethereum. \u201cThe capital rotation by this metric appears to be early in the trend,\u201d said Check.\n\nOver the past month, the 30-day change in realized cap shows less capital flowing into Ethereum ($6 billion) versus Bitcoin ($13.8 billion) or even stablecoins, which are viewed as a proxy for the broader altcoin market.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin is dominant when it comes to spot trading volume, dominating 75% of exchange flows between the two assets.\n\n\u201cBitcoin trading activity always moves first, often dominating beyond new market ATHs before ETH sees much of an activity pickup,\u201d concluded Check. \u201cThe king remains the king.\u201d\n\nBTC is now up 162% year to date, while ETH is up 82%. Even rival altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are dwarfing gains made by crypto\u2019s number 2 this year, both rising 77% and 69% respectively over the past month alone, versus ETH\u2019s 13%.\n\nEven Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, was found moving $1 million of his ETH holdings to an exchange earlier this month."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) is extending its breakthrough for the year as its record-breaking transaction volume exceeds that of Ethereum (ETH) on key trading platforms.\n\nThe intriguing performance of Solana has placed the cryptocurrency on the radar of most traders. At press time, the digital currency soared as high as 12.23% in the past 24 hours to $87.18. In tandem, Solana\u2019s market capitalization has jumped by more than 12% to $37,245,046,339, as the 24-hour trading volume recorded a 100% jump to $4,455,508,322.\n\nWith the current outlook, Solana has now surpassed XRP in market capitalization, as the latter is now worth just $33,431,974,071.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSolana Outranking Ethereum\n\nAccording to insights from Kaiko Researcher Riyad Carey, Solana\u2019s trading volume on Upbit has surpassed that of Ethereum for 55 consecutive days. The same trend surfaced on MEXC, where Ethereum\u2019s volume has lagged behind Solana\u2019s for 15 days straight.\n\nKraken and Coinbase Global Inc are not left behind, with Solana outpacing Ethereum for 9 days out of the past 14 on the former and 3 of the past 13 days on the latter. This impressive performance has also rubbed off on the differentials in the price of the two assets,\n\nSOL has done more volume than ETH: 9 out of the last 14 days on Kraken\n\n3 out of the last 13 days on Coinbase\n\nThe last 15 days straight on MEXC\n\nThe last 55 days straight on Upbit The @blknoiz06 Effect pic.twitter.com/c4LLsX24ya \u2014 Riyad Carey (@riyad_carey) December 20, 2023\n\nWhile Solana has jumped by 345% in the past 3 months, Ethereum has only managed to grow by 40% within the same period. With the growing debate about Ethereum and Solana, by all metrics, the latter is winning as a high-performance outfit, however, its market capitalization is a fraction of the $270,614,040,135 that Ethereum boasts of.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Solana Advantage\n\nAs blockchain networks with established developer ecosystems, it is worth noting that both Ethereum and Solana have robust developmental activity at this time. The shift in embrace, however, is based on sentiments that most traders are nursing at times.\n\nWhile Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other Ethereum-based memecoins have helped elevate the status of the blockchain in times past, investors are now more gravitating to BONK, the sensational memecoin built on Solana. The debut of an airdrop for BONK and Solana Mobile phone owners has also driven sentiment through the roof in recent times.\n\nBesides the influence of BONK, the fact that all fears related to the liquidation of SOL as a major asset owned by bankrupt FTX Exchange have been allayed is further giving investors the confidence to go all out on the coin. For its ecosystem potential, top firms like VanEck have tipped Solana to hit a high price target of $3,211 before the end of this decade."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum developers have agreed on a tentative date for the first testnet phase of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nConsolidating the testnet in three phases, Ethereum developers marked January 17, 2024, for Dencun\u2019s deployment on the Goerli testnet. The Sepolia and Holesky testnet launches are scheduled for January 31 and February 7, 2024.\n\nSo, if no major issues arise, we're looking at the following schedule: \u2013 Goerli: Jan 17, 6:32:00 UTC\n\n\u2013 Sepolia: Jan 30, 22:51:12 UTC\n\n\u2013 Holesky: Feb 7, 11:34:24 UTC \u2026 and then, mainnet \ud83e\udee1 pic.twitter.com/JFRt0ZHAi8 \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 21, 2023\n\nAccording to Ethereum protocol support lead Tim Beiko, the dates for the three testnet phases are not yet final. They are thus subject to change if developers encounter major issues during the testnet.\n\nBeiko added that a blog post covering details of the fork will be released within the second week of January 2024 to provide stakeholders with ample time to adjust to the updates.\n\nThe meeting discussed pending issues with the Dencun upgrade. In particular, the developers discussed requirements for implementing \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d a process that would enhance Ethereums data storage capacity by using \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nBlobs are a new type of transaction with extra space for data designed to lower Ethereum gas fees by moving rollup data from the expensive EVM layer to the consensus layer.\n\nProto-danksharding limits the number of blobs in each block (16 per block, limited to 128 KB each). This adds about 2 MB of space to each processed block. The proposal for proto-danksharding was first forwarded through EIP-4844.\n\nDevelopers also discussed recent developments for Layer 3 app-chains, particularly the recent partnership between Avail and StarkWare. Avail has partnered with StarkWare to integrate their data-availability solutions for app-chains within the latter\u2019s Layer 2 network. The integration will use StarkWare\u2019s Madara sequencer to build app-chains that can function as Layer 3 solutions.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade represents Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade after the Shapella hard fork earlier in April, which introduced staked ether withdrawals."

It looks like it's actually accelerating. pic.twitter.com/fgNbNCY0UE \u2014 Emperor Osmo\ud83e\uddea (@Flowslikeosmo) December 20, 2023\n\nSolana makes history\n\nAs of this writing though, Ethereum reclaimed the numero uno rank while Solana slid to the second position, AMBCrypto spotted using DeFiLlama\u2019s data. However, the bigger picture was still in favor of the purported \u2018Ethereum-Killer\u2019.\n\nOver the last week, Solana-based DEXes logged trades worth more than $9 billion, as compared to Ethereum\u2019s $8.836 billion. This was the first time in history that Solana surpassed Ethereum in 7-day DEX volumes.\n\nIn fact, Solana\u2019s weekly growth rate of 33.75% stood out in a sea of red. Nearly all chains below Solana in the top 10 list suffered double-digit weekly losses.\n\nCoinciding with SOL\u2019s bullish action on the price charts, the sentiment around Solana\u2019s DEX activity has also got a boost.\n\nUntil September, Solana made up barely 2% of total DEX volumes across all chains. However, it has ballooned to 17.84% as of this writing, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis revealed.\n\nSolana\u2019s TVL increases manifold\n\nAside from the frenzy on its DEXes, the network saw a significant increase in the USD value of cryptos locked on its DeFi projects.\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) exploded from around $600 million in mid-October to more than $2 billion at press time. Here again, Solana outperformed other chains in monthly growth.\n\nSOL\u2019s rally continues\n\nMeanwhile, SOL\u2019s late-year surge continued, with the crypto breaking into the top 5 cryptos by market cap list.\n\nThe token led the altcoin surge in the last 24 hours, recording double-digit gains of 13.67%, as per CoinMarketCap. Year-to-date (YTD) the coin multiplied the gains of its holders by a factor of more than 9.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nThe price surge attracted traders\u2019 attention, according to on-chain analytics firm Santiment. SOL became one of the top trending coins in the market with 13% uptick in social volumes.\n\nHowever, there was a word of advice from Santiment for SOL holders."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s liquidation increased when its price reached the $2,270 mark.\n\nMost market indicators and on-chain metrics looked bearish.\n\nEthereum [ETH] is witnessing a massive surge in network activity of late. This happened at a time when the king of altcoins\u2019 liquidation levels increased.\n\nWill Ethereum\u2019s high network activity be enough to help paint the coin\u2019s chart green?\n\nEthereum\u2019s user activity is high\n\nUsers have shown immense interest in Ethereum in the recent past, as shown by its spiking network activity.\n\nAMBCrypto also looked at Glassnode\u2019s data, which revealed that Ethereum\u2019s Active Addresses had gained upward momentum since the 16th of December.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s Number of New Addresses metric followed a similar increasing trend.\n\nHowever, while the blockchain\u2019s network activity was on the rise, the token witnessed a sell-off. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Hyblock Capital\u2019s data pointed out that ETH\u2019s liquidation increased substantially near the $2,270 mark.\n\nThe hike in liquidation resulted in a price correction as the token\u2019s price sank.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 3% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, it was trading at $2,193.67 with a market capitalization of over $259 billion.\n\nA bearish signal was ETH\u2019s hike in volume, which legitimized the token\u2019s price downtick.\n\nEthereum has concerns to address\n\nAs ETH\u2019s price dropped, several on-chain metrics turned bearish on the token. For example, AMBCrypto found that selling pressure on Ethereum was high, evidenced by its rising Exchange Reserve at press time.\n\nMoreover, investors in the US and Korea seemed to have been selling their holdings. This was apparent from CryptoQuant\u2019s data, which revealed that both the Coinbase Premium and Korea Premium were red.\n\nThings on the derivatives side of the market also remained negative. Notably, ETH\u2019s Taker Buy Sell Ratio was red, meaning that selling sentiment was dominant in the Futures market.\n\nApart from metrics, several market indicators, like the MACD, looked bearish on the king of altcoins at press time. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also went southward and was headed below the neutral mark.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAnother bearish indicator was ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which waned slightly.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned datasets, it seemed likely that investors might have to wait longer to witness ETH\u2019s bull rally, despite a rise in network activity."

Discover SCENE\n\nIn the day and change since the historic debut of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street, one clear crypto winner has emerged: Ethereum.\n\nThough BTC has seen many ups and downs since Bitcoin ETFs were approved Wednesday, the coin\u2019s rival, ETH, appears to have reaped most of the benefits of the event, rocketing steadily upwards. ETH hit $2,698 on Friday, approaching $2,700 for the first time since the crypto bear market kicked off in April 2022.\n\nThe token has since leveled to $2,645 at writing\u2014still up 18.5% in the last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuch of that sprint can be attributed to growing optimism that a spot Ethereum ETF might become a reality in mere months, thanks to Bitcoin paving the way.\n\nOn Friday, for instance, Larry Fink, CEO of Wall Street goliath BlackRock, told a CNBC interviewer that he\u2019s all in on an Ethereum ETF.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is just the beginning,\u201d Fink said this morning. \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nIn November, BlackRock filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a spot ETH ETF. Analysts have predicted that the application will be successful, as the legal realities that compelled the SEC to begrudgingly approve a spot Bitcoin ETF likely also apply to Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFink\u2019s enthusiasm for an Ethereum ETF appears to be tied to his broader goal of onboarding blockchain technology into traditional finance.\n\n\u201cETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets,\u201d he said. \u201cStep two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.\u201d\n\nThe BlackRock CEO also voiced his enthusiasm at the great success Bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed in their first day on the market, saying he was \u201cvery happy with the flows.\u201d In their first day alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs cleared a whopping $4.5 billion worth of trading volume.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs allow traditional financial institutions and investors to gain exposure to BTC without holding any cryptocurrency themselves. A spot ETH ETF would do the same for Ethereum.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that spot Bitcoin ETFs have now exposed the cryptocurrency to $14 trillion worth of traditional American financial assets.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) holders have been observed rushing to invest in a promising new altcoin \u2013 Pullix (PLX). Experts say this Stage 2 presale is poised for a projected 100x surge in 2024. Let\u2019s dive into these developments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Rally Among Correction\n\nBitcoin (BTC) recently experienced a correction period that saw its value decline. However, the resilient nature of this top 5 cryptocurrency showed as it staged a recovery, rallying back to the $44,000 mark. The recent 7RCC Spot Bitcoin ETF filing also helped this price increase.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the Bitcoin price will continue rising as its value now sits comfortably above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Its Fear & Greed index rating is 73 (Greed) \u2013 great bullish signs.\n\nDue to these reasons, experts in the field have made a bullish Bitcoin price prediction. They foresee its value rising to $46,139.00 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has also had some ETF news, as James Seyffart reports that the SEC has delayed two Ethereum ETFs. According to him, the final date for these ETFs will be in late May. In terms of the Ethereum price movement, it increased from $2,172 on December 18 to $2,245 on December 19.\n\nThe technical analysis for Ethereum also paints a bullish picture, with the altcoin now recording 19/30 (63%) green trading days over the last month alone. Moreover, its price is above its 100 and 200-day EMAs.\n\nMarket analysts have taken note of all these factors as they foresee the Ethereum price reaching $2,457.89 when 2024 starts.\n\nPullix (PLX): The Best Crypto To Buy\n\nPositioned as a potential standout in 2024, Pullix (PLX) has captured the interest of global investors, including Ethereum holders. This innovative DeFi project will be the first trading platform to combine the best features of CEX and DEX. As a result, you will experience deep liquidity, high leverage at 1000:1, and access to all asset classes (including cryptos) on one account.\n\nThe hype for this crypto ICO is sky-high as over 2.9M PLX native tokens have been sold, and Pullix has raised $859,400 so far. PLX is a crucial component of the Pullix ecosystem \u2013 bringing exclusive access to certain assets, up to 60% trading fee discounts, and more. Most importantly, if you stake the PLX token, you will receive a percentage of Pullix\u2019s daily revenue. This is an outstanding opportunity for passive income.\n\nThe PLX token is currently in Stage 3 of its presale and is worth just $0.044. Those who bought it early on are enjoying a 10% ROI. But, this percentage will increase the presale advances. Experts forecast a potential 580% growth before the presale ends. Some analysts even claim a 100x pump is in store after PLX hits exchanges after its launch in Q1 of 2024.\n\nThis price prediction may seem ambitious, but remember that Pullix will tap into multiple resilient financial markets \u2013 like the Forex one. Baby Pips reports that this is the world\u2019s biggest and most popular financial market. With Pullix\u2019s innovative features and hybrid nature, it has the potential to become a fan favorite. Because of this, its long-term growth potential is outstanding.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe dynamic nature of the crypto sector is shown by Bitcoin\u2019s shifting performance and Ethereum holders rushing to the Pullix crypto ICO event. While all three of these tokens may surge, Pullix has the upper hand thanks to its low market cap.\n\nIt has a market cap of $8.8M, drastically lower than Bitcoin\u2019s ($843B) and Ethereum\u2019s ($270B). In other words, PLX will experience growth much faster as fewer new funds are needed, which makes it the best crypto investment right now.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In the end, Ethereum's recent rally is a testament to its resilience and the positive sentiment prevailing in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum's recent performance has been nothing short of impressive, with a notable rally during the Wednesday trading session.\n\nThe crypto market has been witnessing a consistent upward momentum, stemming from the depths of a major consolidation period.\n\nThis has led traders to view Ethereum as a \"buy on the dips\" market, underlining its resilience and potential for growth. Additionally, Ethereum's value is intricately tied to interest rates, boasting a negative correlation.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has been on a significant upward trajectory, and it's no surprise that Ethereum is following suit. The $2100 level, nestled beneath the current Ethereum price, is a crucial support zone that traders are likely to defend vehemently. This level serves as a solid foundation for Ethereum's upward aspirations.\n\nA Potential Pullback as An Opportunity\n\nShould a pullback occur, it's expected to offer an enticing buying opportunity, attracting numerous investors eager to capitalize on Ethereum's potential. In the near term, the cryptocurrency may aim to break above the $2400 mark, with an eye on the $2500 level as the next target. However, market participants should exercise caution during the holiday season, as liquidity can be limited, potentially leading to volatile and erratic price movements.\n\nOne of the driving factors behind Ethereum's bullish outlook is the Federal Reserve's ongoing monetary policy, which continues to favor loose financial conditions. This policy stance enhances the appeal of Ethereum as an investment option, setting the stage for a promising 2024.\n\nDespite the short-term optimism, a lingering question looms over Ethereum's future: Will it find a compelling and widespread use case? The cryptocurrency market has yet to witness a \"must-have application\" that captures mainstream attention and adoption. Instead, it often appears that cryptocurrencies are solutions in search of problems to solve.\n\nEthereum's role as the backbone of numerous other digital currencies and ecosystems positions it as a prime candidate for betting on the success of these applications. However, the elusive killer application that catapults Ethereum into widespread use has yet to materialize.\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's recent rally is a testament to its resilience and the positive sentiment prevailing in the cryptocurrency market. Investors may find value in buying Ethereum during price dips, but the long-term success of Ethereum hinges on the emergence of a compelling use case that captures the imagination of the masses. Until then, the crypto market remains in search of its breakthrough moment, with Ethereum at the forefront of this ongoing quest.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Thu 21 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe Solana crypto platform is making waves. Its remarkable performance across key indicators, in comparison to Ethereum, is drawing attention. It\u2019s surely a sign of some dynamism. However, this comes with certain operational cost limitations. We\u2019ll explain everything.\n\nSolana outperforms Ethereum according to major crypto indicators\n\nRecent data indicates that the Solana blockchain protocol is quickly gaining ground and surpassing Ethereum in key metrics. This trend highlights a notable shift in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nData brought to light by Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, showcases Solana\u2019s impressive performance in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), active addresses, number of transactions, and stablecoin transfers.\n\nThis bullish momentum of Solana coincides with a significant rise in the price of SOL, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency. It has reached new heights, breaking through immediate resistance levels in recent months of trading.\n\nThe bullish trend in the crypto market has propelled SOL prices. This has revitalized activities on this blockchain. It is evidenced by the increase in the number of transactions and the rise in its total value locked (TVL) in the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment.\n\nThe drivers of this momentum are due to Solana\u2019s scalability. A feature that allows deployed protocols to execute transactions and launch smart contracts at a lower cost. All this is supported by a blockchain infrastructure based on independent nodes rewarded for their commitment, which promotes decentralization and security. But there is a catch.\n\nChange happens fast. Solana now rivals or surpasses Ethereum across:\n\n\n\n\u2013 DEX Volumes\n\n\u2013 NFT Volumes\n\n\u2013 Active Addresses\n\n\u2013 Transaction Count\n\n\u2013 Stablecoin Transfers\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Solana isn\u2019t decentralized \ud83d\ude24\u201d\n\n\n\nReality: Solana has ~40% the amount of nodes as Ethereum, they\u2019re only ~5x more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZBuLiTcXmf \u2014 Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) December 19, 2023 Solana outpaces Ethereum in many areas, but the operational costs of nodes remain a major issue\n\nThe costly operation of nodes in Solana\n\nBeyond this remarkable performance, the analysis also highlights a crucial aspect concerning the operational cost of running Solana nodes. It turns out that operating a Solana node is about five times more expensive than running an Ethereum node.\n\nThe data provided by Syncrancy clearly puts this cost difference into perspective. Operating an Ethereum node costs about 550 dollars, whereas running a high-end Solana node on Firedancer costs 5,100 dollars.\n\nThis is paradoxical given that Solana boasts about having approximately 40 % of the number of nodes compared to Ethereum. Even though the platform seems to be addressing this weakness with its relevance in terms of decentralization. In this regard, the Nakamoto coefficient, a decentralization indicator, shows a higher figure for Solana, at 21 compared to only 2 for Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, Solana is committed to maximizing its lead in terms of decentralization. To this end, the crypto platform plans to launch the Firedancer validation tool, which aims to diversify and strengthen its network.\n\nThis is expected to enable it to accelerate block production. While allowing the mainnet to evolve towards processing more crypto transactions on the blockchain, without relying on external alternatives.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Ethereum Price About To Bloom As ETHE Discount Rapidly Close: ETH To $3,500? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) prices have been languishing below the $2,500 mark despite the strong performance of other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nTaking to X on December 22, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, Ram Ahluwalia, has offered a theory on why ETH prices are likely to recover and reverse losses, possibly outperforming the world\u2019s most liquid coin, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETHE Discount Rapidly Closing\n\nTo illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount.\n\nBased on the CEO\u2019s analysis, this development suggests that institutional investors, most of whom chose to buy the regulated ETHE product by Grayscale to gain exposure in a regulated manner to ETH, are now opting to buy ETH on the spot market, not through a derivatives product.\n\nThis shift from ETHE to ETH spot, Ahluwalia added, could be explained by the \u201ccheapest-to-deliver\u201d contract theory. In the derivatives market, this theory states that a derivatives product like ETHE is the cheapest way for institutional investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset, in this case, ETH.\n\nThis is because the derivative in question, ETHE, is a futures contract that tracks the price of ETH via a regulated exchange, in this case CME.\n\nWill Capital Flow To Spot Ethereum And Lift ETH To $3,500?\n\nTherefore, based on this theory, the CEO continued that it is likely that as the ETHE discount closes, marginal flows will go to the ETH spot to capture the staking yield. For this reason, institutions are not likely to pour more funds into ETHE since \u201cbig gains\u201d are done.\n\nAs a proof-of-stake (POS) project, users can stake ETH, helping secure the network, and as compensation, Ethereum distributes a yield of around 4.3% to validators. These operators must lock at least 32 ETH to validate a block of transactions and earn block fees. Since they have to stake, they also earn a yield.\n\nAs of December 22, there were over 28.6 million ETH staked, with the reward rate or yield at 4.32%, according to Staking Rewards. Considering how staked amount and yield are correlated, the more users choose to stake physical ETH, the lower the reward rate, or yield, is.\n\nThis dynamic will now come into play as ETHE discounts close and institutions or big players rotate funds into ETH via the spot market, possibly lifting prices.\n\nLooking at the ETH price action in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand. However, a comprehensive close above $2,400 could lift ETH to $2,500 and later to $2,500 in a buy trend continuation pattern.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

This allows for liquidity while staking Ethereum; Easy to use: the reference interface is easy to use, intuitive, and allows effortless monitoring.\n\nAmong the other features of the regulated fund of Hashnote that invests in liquid Ethereum staking supported by Lido, we see the possibility of a T+0 refund, made possible by the breadth of the portfolio managed by the provider and a redemption with zero slippage in the unstaking process.\n\nIn addition, stETH Fund does not have any financial leverage, making it a less risky product compared to other similar derivatives.\n\nFinally, we must mention the minimal risk of the DeFi protocol Lido, the automation of compounding rewards, the diversification of node operators staking on Ethereum, and a smooth and efficient operation.\n\nThe state of the crypto LSD market on Ethereum: increasingly innovative investment options\n\nSince the \u201cShapella\u201d update went live on Ethereum, opening up the possibility for chain users to unstake previously locked ETH, liquid staking platforms like Lido have started to see increasingly growing numbers.\n\nCurrently, all LSD applications hold a total of over 12.03 million ETH locked on the beacon chain, corresponding to approximately 26.827 billion dollars.\n\nThis data corresponds to almost 42% of all Ether staked in Ethereum 2.0 contracts.\n\nLido in particular is the undisputed leader in liquid staking and accounts for about 76% of this market niche, in addition to holding the record for the DeFi protocol with the highest TVL of 20.37 billion dollars.\n\nFollowing are names that boast a significant percentage of ETH in this context, such as, for example, RocketPool (8.77%), Binance Staked ETH (6.46%), Frax Ether (2.56%), Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (1.62%), Mantle Staked ETH (1.26%), and StakeWise (0.79%).\n\nThe success of this type of platforms is due to several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, liquid staking offers a convenient solution for those who intend to hold ETH but also want to simultaneously earn a yield and use parallel liquidity for crypto exchanges.\n\nSecondly, the ways in which the liquid tokens of these protocols, such as stETH, wstETH, frxETH, and many others, are integrating with other DeFi dapps offer significant advantages to stakers who can sometimes benefit from double yield.\n\nFinally, there is also a \u201cconvenience\u201d speech since many LSD projects have announced or hinted that they will reward their users who have used Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking with an airdrop.\n\nIn this regard, a few weeks ago the layer-2 Blast, which integrates the \u201cnative yield\u201d formula and relies on Lido and MakerDAO, reached a TVL of over 920 million dollars, demonstrating all the interest in this sector.\n\nThere are also many other smaller platforms that have still managed to cover a good percentage of all the ether locked in LSDs: among these we find EigenLayer, Swell, Kelp, Morpho, Diva Staking, EtherFi, Mev Staking and many others.\n\nThe Twitter user \u201cOlimpio Crypto\u201d has created a collection of all these dapps that still do not have a native token and will probably launch it through an airdrop."
