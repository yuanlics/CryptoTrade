At the same time, Ethereum can support more complex financial software.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have plenty in common. They are both cryptocurrencies, and together, they make up a large chunk of the overall crypto market.\n\nAs such, they rely on similar \u201cblockchain\u201d technology, and they appeal to many of the same investors. They are widely available on cryptocurrency exchanges, and many people still buy both for their perceived investment value rather than their current utility.\n\nBut within the world of digital assets, the comparison of Bitcoin versus Ethereum reveals some fundamental differences:\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Rolled out in 2009 by mysterious developer Satoshi Nakamoto [0] View all sources Bitcoin.org . Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System . Accessed Mar 17, 2022.\n\nThough it has not achieved broad adoption as a form of payment, Bitcoin has become a popular \u2014 and volatile \u2014 investment that is now even offered in some retirement plans.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to buy Bitcoin\n\nEthereum went live in 2015, the product of an attempt by developer Vitalik Buterin to expand on the central promise of cryptocurrency to decentralize larger swaths of the economy [0] View all sources Wired . The Uncanny Mind That Built Ethereum . Accessed May 11, 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, also known as Ether, can be used to pay for services or transaction fees on the network. Though its adoption in mainstream finance trails Bitcoin, many people have also used it as a speculative investment.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to buy Ethereum\n\nValue of Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Today\n\nThe table below shows the real-time price, 1-year return and market capitalization of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin trade heavily on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and market forces determine their values.\n\nEthereum has been taking a larger share of the market from Bitcoin over the past several years, though Bitcoin retains the industry\u2019s largest market value.\n\nOverall, a long-term investment in either represents the hope that their underlying technology will achieve worldwide use, increasing the demand for the limited supply of their cryptocurrency. Whether to buy either \u2014 or both \u2014 depends on your market analysis.\n\n\u00bb Ready to invest? Here are our picks for best Ethereum and cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWhat can you buy with Bitcoin vs. Ethereum?\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both cryptocurrencies, so either could work for any transaction in which both buyer and seller are comfortable using it.\n\nBut overall, Bitcoin is intended as more of a general-purpose currency for everyday life.\n\nEthereum is designed explicitly for payments on the Ethereum network. That means Ethereum cryptocurrency would be better suited than Bitcoin for carrying out a transaction that relies on an Ethereum smart contract, such as funding a loan that will be automatically paid back on a specific date.\n\nAnother thing you\u2019ll do with Ethereum and Bitcoin is to pay network fees. Any time you carry out a transaction with either cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll be charged an amount that helps pay for the network's technology. These fees can sometimes come on top of whatever fee you might be paying to the crypto platform or payment provider you\u2019re using.\n\nEthereum fees have tended to be higher than those for Bitcoin. But before you complete a trade or transaction for either, it can be good to look at the network fees to see if they\u2019re running higher than usual. If it\u2019s not a time-sensitive transaction, you can sometimes save money by waiting for fees to go down.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place. Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet. Sign Up\n\nMining and environmental impact of Bitcoin vs. Ethereum\n\nBitcoin is known as a \u201cproof-of-work\u201d blockchain project. That means users can run programs on their computers that help verify the integrity of transactions and prevent fraud. The process is known as \u201cmining,\u201d and it makes it possible for participants to receive cryptocurrency rewards in exchange. Mining uses a huge amount of energy, which has led to significant criticism of cryptocurrency in general.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains do not require mining; instead, they use a process called staking, which incentivizes people to put cryptocurrency at stake to vouch for the accuracy of transactions. Participating users get rewards akin to interest in a bank account when the system works normally.\n\nOver time, this shift could mean that Ethereum becomes more energy efficient than Bitcoin. On the other hand, some supporters of Bitcoin argue that the process does not have to be environmentally damaging if miners use renewable energy [0] View all sources The New York Times .

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s price shows signs of recovery, currently trading near $2,230.\n\nIncreased whale transactions indicate potential investor interest in buying amid market dip.\n\nOn-chain data points to minimal resistance until Ethereum reaches $2,800.\n\nTurning the $2,145 mark into a resistance level could undermine the current positive outlook.\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of a recovery bounce, potentially setting the stage for a surge to new highs for the year.\n\nBoth on-chain data and technical analyses lend support to this optimistic perspective for ETH.\n\nEthereum Is Ready to Grow\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a dip to as low as $2,100 on January 3, influenced by Matrixport\u2019s ETF-rejection announcement . However, similar to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a swift recovery. Currently (January 8 2024) trading at $2,229, Ethereum is indicating a potential for a significant upward movement.\n\nThe optimistic forecast for Ethereum\u2019s price is bolstered by a significant increase in Whale Transaction Count and Volume observed on January 3. This data, provided by Santiment , reveals the surge in transactions coincided with a substantial sell-off in the market, which is typically interpreted as investors purchasing during a price dip.\n\nGiven that the whale transaction count specifically monitors transfers valued at $100,000 or more, this increase is likely indicative of institutional investors engaging in a buy-the-dip strategy. The fact that this uptick in transactions aligns with a rise in trading volume further strengthens the argument for a bullish trend in Ethereum\u2019s market.\n\nTwo Whales Snap Up BTC and ETH Amid Price Dips\n\nOn January 5, the blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain highlighted the activity of a significant Ethereum whale , identified as \u20180x9314\u2019. This whale invested a substantial $48 million to purchase 21,192 ETH, at an average price of $2,265 per coin. This individual has been actively accumulating Ethereum since last January, amassing nearly 80,000 ETH.\n\nThe purchases were primarily made through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and Binance, with the whale paying an average price of $1,790 for each Ethereum.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Massive whale 0x931 spent $48M to buy 21,192 $ETH at $2,265 on avg ~2hrs ago. In total, the whale has bought 79,500 $ETH from #DEX and #Binance at $1,790 on avg since Jan 13, 2023, with $36.84M (+25.9%) in unrealized profit. The purchases were financed through revolving\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mD245C060o \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 5, 2024\n\nIThese purchases were funded using loans obtained from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols Aave and Liquidity. This strategy indicates a bullish outlook on Ethereum\u2019s future price. As of the report, the whale\u2019s investment has already yielded significant returns, with a profit of about 26%, amounting to more than $36.84 million.\n\nLookOnChain, another analytics firm, has pinpointed two whales who made substantial acquisitions of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the wake of their recent price declines. According to the analyst\u2019s report , these investors collectively purchased over 1,300 ETH, with each unit priced at approximately $2,225.\n\nEthereum To Jump by Over 340% in 2024?\n\nA prominent cryptocurrency analyst, known by the pseudonym Credible Crypto, has shared an optimistic prediction for Ethereum (ETH) on X. He forecasts Ethereum could reach a price of $10,000 in 2024. This prediction implies a substantial increase of more than 340% from its current price level.\n\nCredible Crypto has also shared an even more ambitious maximum price target for Ethereum in 2024. He suggests Ethereum could potentially reach $20,000. This would represent an impressive upturn of more than 780% from its current market value.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum\u2019s short-term price movements, Credible Crypto notes that, although Ethereum established a local bottom earlier in the week at around $2,100, there is still potential for another corrective dip towards $2,160. Following this, he anticipates that Ethereum might then test its resistance level at $2,400.\n\nHe said: \u201cThink that last liquidation wick marked our bottom but at least in the short term think we may see a small move down and a bit more ranging before we are ready for the next leg up.\u201d\n\nCredible Crypto\u2019s optimistic outlook on Ethereum (ETH) is further supported also by data from Santiment . This indicates a significant accumulation of Ethereum by whales.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the top 150 self-custody wallets currently hold a record-breaking 56.25 million ETH. In contrast, exchange wallets have seen a decrease in Ethereum holdings, now containing 9.46 million ETH, marking the lowest level since June 2018.\n\nThis trend of accumulation is evident in both exchange and non-exchange wallets. Santiment reports that the top 150 whales collectively own an all-time high of 65.71 million ETH."

However, ETH remained stable near the $2,180 and $2,170 levels. A low was formed near $2,170 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a decent increase above the $2,240 level. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,245 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the $2,320 resistance, but the bears were active near $2,350.\n\nA high was formed near $2,358 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor decline below the $2,320 level. The price moved below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high.\n\nETH is now trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,350 level.

The next key resistance is near $2,540. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,540, there could be a rally toward $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,350 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,280 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,260 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high. A downside break and a close below $2,260 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,170 support.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nDespite a bearish sentiment in the crypto industry, the leader of altcoins, Ethereum, continues to display neutral price action, indicating mixed sentiments in the market. The ETH price has experienced a change of less than 2% over the last week.\n\nThe Ethereum price constantly traded in a consolidated range between $2,137 and $2,248 for a while, following which the bulls gained momentum, and the price broke out of the range. However, the rally was short-lived as the bulls faced rejection at $2,342, following which the price traded sideways for a while.\n\nAs the bearish sentiment increased, the price faced a pullback within the range where it traded for about a week. After multiple attempts, the bulls broke out of the range and recorded a jump of approximately 5% before facing another rejection at $2,342.\n\nChart: TradingView\n\nThe price then started trading in a descending pattern and tested its support level of $2,200, but the bulls held the price strong, resulting in a bounce back. The ETH price jumped over 11% within the next 24 hours, after which it faced restriction at $2,450.\n\nFollowing this, the leader of altcoins recorded a correction of over 8% in its valuation and traded sideways for a while. As the market gained momentum, the ETH price made another attempt to breach its key resistance level at $2,450 but faced rejection, highlighting a strong liquidation point at that level.\n\nAfter this, Altcoin experienced massive sales, resulting in a correction of over 8%. Since then, the price has been trading sideways in a closed range between $2,200 and $2,248, suggesting weak buying and selling pressure in the market.\n\nNegatively, the Cross EMA 50-day is a resistance line to the price chart, indicating a bear power in the crypto space.\n\nWill The ETH Price Recover?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a minor rise in the histogram, indicating an increase in the buying pressure. Further, the averages show a bullish convergence, highlighting the price may undergo massive price action in the coming time.\n\nIf the bulls break out of their important resistance level at $2,248, the ETH price will regain momentum and test its upper resistance level of $2,300 this week. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the ETH price to attempt to test its resistance level of $2,342 over the coming week.\n\nNegatively, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the Ethereum price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $2,200. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $2,137 in the coming time."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (BTC 1.94%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (ETH 1.13%) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (MARA 3.84%) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table."

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nEthereum layer 2 activity is surging. But are the rollups ready for it?\n\nProjects pick Celestia stakers for token airdrops\n\nDeFi security may not be ready for another bull run\n\nHow decentralised are layer 2s?\n\nDeFi users are piling into layer 2 blockchains, pushing several metrics to new highs.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nArbitrum, the biggest layer 2 by total value locked, surpassed the Ethereum mainnet in decentralised exchange transaction volume. At the same time, the combined TVL of all layer 2s registered a fresh all-time high of over $20 billion.\n\nEven smaller layer 2s like Metis are benefitting from the excitement surrounding Ethereum\u2019s scaling options.\n\nEthereum\u2019s faithful cheer the increased adoption of layer 2s, which are faster and cheaper than the main Ethereum network they rely on to finalise transactions.\n\nBut there\u2019s an elephant in the room: most layer 2s are still nowhere near as decentralised as they would like to be.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nUsers must trust that transactions are verified correctly by a centralised entity \u2014 usually the company building the layer 2 \u2014 instead of through a decentralised consensus like the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis is a problem because it goes against DeFi\u2019s founding principle of not having to rely on or trust any single entity to transact.\n\nFor the average DeFi degen, whether or not a specific layer 2 is decentralised probably doesn\u2019t matter that much.\n\nBut for more sophisticated investors \u2014 such as institutions \u2014 having to trust the companies behind layer 2s will make some think twice before committing serious cash to them.\n\nThe first layer 2 to fully decentralise its transaction processing should benefit greatly \u2014 and I expect at least one to make it happen in 2024.\n\nA new airdrop trend emerges\n\nCelestia stakers had a great start to 2024: two projects have promised them airdrops of valuable tokens, with another strongly hinting at the prospect.\n\nSo why are these projects being so generous?\n\nIn a nutshell, because they rely on the Celestia blockchain for their transaction validation, and those who stake their Celestia tokens are pivotal to that.\n\nIf the projects running on Celestia can incentivise more people to stake Celestia tokens, the more secure they are.\n\nIt\u2019s likely this new trend of airdropping tokens to Celestia stakers is only just beginning. More projects building on Celestia \u2014 such as Berachain, Monad, and Kinto \u2014 are also set to launch later this year.\n\nCertiK calls out DeFi security \u2014 then gets hacked itself\n\nCrypto security firm CertiK warns the brewing bull run will be a key test for the DeFi sector in a new report.\n\nCertiK said the DeFi industry needs to decrease the correlation between the money deposited into it and the total amount lost in hacks and scams, if it wants to be taken seriously.\n\nWhile CertiK makes a valid point, a security breach in its own house dampened its effect.\n\nJust two days after publishing the report, CertiK\u2019s X account was compromised following an employee\u2019s interaction with a scammer posing as a representative from a media organisation.\n\nThe breached CertiK account disseminated a message to the security firm\u2019s 343,000 followers, claiming a vulnerability in the decentralised exchange Uniswap\u2019s router contract and linking to a phishing site.\n\nAfter a year of mishaps for CertiK, where the firm signed off on multiple projects that went on to get hacked or rug pull depositors, 2024 isn\u2019t off to a great start.\n\nData of the week\n\nL2Beat provides a nifty dashboard that keeps track of how decentralised each Ethereum layer 2 is.\n\nWhen it comes to general-purpose layer 2s, Arbitrum is the furthest along, but it has yet to make validation permissionless.\n\nL2Beat keeps track of what stage of decentralisation each Ethereum layer 2 is at. (L2Beat)\n\nThis week in DeFi governance\n\nVOTE: Establish the Arbitrum DAO procurement committee\n\nTEMP CHECK VOTE: Add PayPal\u2019s PYUSD to the Aave v3 Ethereum market\n\nPROPOSAL: Make Celestia liquid staking safer and more aligned with the blockchain\n\nPost of the week\n\nWe couldn\u2019t pass up on the opportunity to highlight some rare praise for DefiLlama from one of crypto\u2019s most notorious pseudonymous voices: Gwart.\n\nWhile Gwart\u2019s posts are usually heavily sarcastic, we\u2019re hoping this one is sincere!\n\nI will say something nice here: the most useful thing in DeFi is DefiLlama \u2014 Gwart (@GwartyGwart) January 8, 2024\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nAnd now $3,000,000,000 of leveraged stETH on Aave that was \"very liquid\" is relying on $300mn of Curve liquidity; there is still virtually no off-chain liquidity.\n\n\n\nEspecially with volatility from ETF news, if any large stETH holder gets impatient and sells, things could get ugly https://t.co/jgNhjesvc5 pic.twitter.com/AFL4Di6NBQ \u2014 Riyad Carey (@riyad_carey) January 5, 2024\n\nCelsius\u2019 move to unstake its Ether holdings has clogged the validator exit queue.\n\nSeveral analysts, including Kaiko\u2019s Riyad Carey, have pointed out that such a situation could put liquidity for Lido\u2019s stETH token in a potentially perilous position.\n\nHave you joined our Telegram channel yet?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s value against Bitcoin has dropped to historical lows as market anticipation grows for an imminent launch of a spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\n\nData from Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko showed that the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily declined since the smart-contract-enabled blockchain transitioned into a proof-of-stake network in September 2022. During the last 24 hours, the metric dropped to 0.048, its lowest point since May 2021.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial measure for gauging Ethereum\u2019s performance in relation to Bitcoin. When this ratio rises, Ethereum gains strength or maintains its value better than Bitcoin, suggesting a market preference for ETH over BTC.\n\nConversely, a decrease in the ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to Bitcoin, potentially signaling investor leanings toward the perceived safety of Bitcoin.\n\nThis ratio goes beyond mere price movements as it encapsulates shifts in investor confidence and market sentiment between these two prominent cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data shows that BTC\u2019s price has greatly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s over the past year. During the period, the top cryptocurrency\u2019s price rose by more than 170% to a 21-month high of more than $47,000, while ETH was able to post a modest gain of 74%.\n\nBTC\u2019s positive run could be attributed to the surrounding market optimism and demands for the potential approval of a spot ETF. Over the past several months, several asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, and others, have actively engaged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the applications, fueling speculations that these products could begin trading as early as Jan. 11.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s lukewarm price performance came amid the launch of several futures-based ETFs for the digital asset last year. These ETFs barely made a ripple in the market as they saw tepid demand, forcing asset manager CoinShares to describe ETH as the \u201cleast loved altcoin\u201d compared to rivals like Solana."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has found itself under the scrutiny of analysts as the digital asset hovers around crucial price levels. A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights, asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2,130, with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the latest market data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,262, reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days, showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours, reaching $9,626,210,522, indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.\n\n$ETH / $USD - Update\n\n\n\nThe ETH range is simple.

Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nCrypto Tony's emphasis on the $2,130 and $2,500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts, who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.\n\nPotential bullish catalyst\n\nIn a related development, the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade , known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade. This imminent update has generated considerable buzz within the Ethereum community, as it promises substantial enhancements and alterations to the platform. The Prague upgrade is anticipated to introduce improvements in scalability , security and overall functionality, which could positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory.\n\nThe potential bullish effect of the Prague upgrade on ETH's value has sparked discussions among investors and analysts, with some speculating that the impending changes could serve as a catalyst for a price surge, propelling Ethereum above current levels.\n\nWhile the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, the confluence of technical analysis highlighting key price levels and the anticipation of a major network upgrade contributes to the growing intrigue surrounding Ethereum's future price movements. Market participants are closely monitoring the developments, ready to capitalize on potential opportunities as ETH navigates these crucial junctures in the ever-evolving crypto landscape."

        "content": "Despite ETHBTC trending lower in favor of Bitcoin (BTC), there is a chance that the second most valuable cryptocurrency will recover in the months ahead. Taking to X in support of Ethereum (ETH), a crypto analyst, Mckenna, said a favorable combination of protocol-related and regulatory factors may support ETH, plugging the bleed versus BTC and sparking a refreshing rally.\n\nEthereum Under-performing Bitcoin: Will This Continue?\n\nLooking at the ETHBTC weekly chart, it is evident that Bitcoin bulls have had the upper hand since August 2022. During this time, Bitcoin gained 42% versus ETH, with bulls pressing on when writing.\n\nTo illustrate, Bitcoin is at a 2022 low versus ETH and will likely extend gains once a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto community expects this authorization to cement Bitcoin\u2019s position, possibly drawing in billions in capital.\n\nSome analysts argue that this event could support altcoins, including Ethereum. So far, Ethereum, though edging lower versus Bitcoin, is firm against the USD. McKenna also notes that once a spot Bitcoin ETF is live in the United States, attention will shift to the SEC on whether it will also greenlight a similar product, but for Ethereum.\n\nThese 2 Factors Might Support ETH\n\nDespite the ETH weakness versus BTC, Mckenna expects Ethereum to recover in the medium to long term. This is because of the expected preference for proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems over proof-of-work (PoW) methods that power Bitcoin.\n\nPoW is a computationally intensive process that uses much energy for block confirmation. This has led to criticism from those who are concerned about the environmental impact of crypto mining. For this reason, Ethereum adopted a PoS system, fully transitioning in 2021 after the Merge.\n\nBeyond the energy efficiency, the analyst also notes that the PoS in Ethereum provides ETH stakers with a base yield that will be considered \u201cthe safest bond instrument in the entire digital asset space.\u201d Subsequently, this may support ETH, with many viewing it as a safe haven. This assurance is based chiefly on the fact that Ethereum is the second most valuable crypto network, with over $276 billion in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAdditionally, ETH will, in the long run, be deflationary following the activation of EIP-1559 in August 2021. This system burns a portion of gas fees- the base fee- taking a portion of ETH out of circulation. According to Ultra Sound Money, over 17,600 ETH have been destroyed in the last week alone, 1,000 ETH more than those network issues.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOn Friday, January 5, the number of Ethereum validators queuing to withdraw staked ETH surged to a record high of 16,766.\n\nBankrupt crypto lender Celsius was responsible for at least 32% of exiting validators, representing more than 200,000 ETH.\n\nThe growth of Ethereum\u2019s validator count has slowed as it approached 1 million.\n\nCelsius has staked ETH worth hundreds of millions of dollars, generating yields that have helped offset the cost of restructuring, since it filed for bankruptcy in 2022\n\nAhead of a planned distribution among creditors, on Friday, January 5, the company\u2019s move to unlock more than 200,000 ETH caused a surge in the number of Ethereum validators queuing to remove staked tokens.\n\nWait Time Jumps Amid Record-High Ethereum Validator Exits\n\nOn a normal day, there are rarely more than 1,000 Ethereum validators queueing to withdraw their staked ETH. Usually, the entire process takes less than 24 hours.\n\nIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nHowever, with a record 16,766 validators queueing to unstake Ether, on Friday the wait time jumped to nearly 6 days.\n\nAs of Monday 8, Nansen data reveals that Celsius has over 206,000 ETH awaiting withdrawal, representing nearly 32% of the total exit queue. Moreover, a further 353,000 ETH is currently being removed by the third-party staking service Figment. The platform received around 41,000 ETH from Celsius in June. While it isn\u2019t certain, it seems likely some or all of the assets Celsius staked with Figment are part of the current exit queue.\n\nCelsius Withdrawals Slow Progress to 1M Validators\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade first enabled the withdrawal of staked Ethereum in April 2023, the number of validators, and consequently the total amount of staked ETH, rose steadily for the next six months. The growth of Ethereum\u2019s validator network started to stall in October. Things have now been set back even further by Celsius\u2019 mass unlocking event.\n\nPost-Shapella, the number of active Ethereum validators increased from around 570,000 to over 850,000. After this, though, the rate at which fresh ETH was being staked started to slow. The next milestone occurred on January 1, when the number of active validators surpassed 900,000. But the journey to a million could prove much more arduous.\n\nAt its all-time high on January 4, the total amount of staked ETH peaked at 28.9 million, representing 24% of the total supply. That figure has since fallen by around 300,000, with a further half a million coins still in the withdrawal queue."

In a recent tweet, van de Poppe conveyed his insights, indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC), there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this, analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there.\n\n\n\nIf an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nAccording to the most recent data, Ethereum is presently valued at $2,294, indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge, escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally, ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations, as reported by CoinGlass.\n\nSpillover effect\n\nThe focal point of van de Poppe's analysis revolves around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency market anticipates a breakthrough, with BlackRock, a financial behemoth, leading the charge. BlackRock, along with other prominent firms such as Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie and ARK 21Shares, has recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMarket sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF, with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market, impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions. As Ethereum stands at this critical juncture, the market awaits further clarity from regulatory bodies and key players in the cryptocurrency space."

        "content": "Ethereum price is struggling to clear the $2,300 resistance zone. ETH is showing a few bearish signs and might decline toward the $2,080 support.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to clear the $2,280 and $2,300 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,260 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline if it stays below the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Major Hurdle\n\nEthereum price attempted a fresh increase above the $2,200 level, like Bitcoin. ETH climbed above the $2,250 and $2,260 levels. However, the bears were active near $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nA high was formed near $2,289 and the price recently saw a bearish reaction. There was a move below the $2,250 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,860 swing low to the $2,289 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,260 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,250 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is now near $2,280. The next major hurdle sits at $2,300.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $2,300 resistance could start a decent upward move. The next key resistance is near $2,400. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,400, there could be a rally toward $2,500. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,620 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,250 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,120 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,080 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,860 swing low to the $2,289 high. A downside break and a close below $2,080 might spark strong bearish moves. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,960 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,080\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,280\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "ETH was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMarket indicators and metrics remained bullish on the token.\n\nThe crypto market recently turned bullish, allowing most cryptos to register gains, and Ethereum [ETH] was no exception. Though this sudden uptrend gave investors hope of a sustained bull rally, an analyst had something different to say.\n\nEthereum finally turns bullish\n\nAfter a week-long decline, Ethereum investors were finally enjoying profits as the token\u2019s daily chart turned green.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,318.33 with a market capitalization of over $278 billion.\n\nHowever, the latest analysis from CryptoQuant suggested that the probability of ETH moving within a small price range seemed likely.\n\nCryptoOnChain, an analyst and author at CryptoQuant, mentioned in an analysis that derivative market charts indicate a relatively high number of short transactions, which looked bearish.\n\nThe analysis also mentioned that it was unlikely for ETH to initiate a bull rally before Bitcoin [BTC] manages to go above a key resistance level of $43,500.\n\nHowever, the king of cryptos has toppled the resistance level already. At press time, BTC was trading at $46,770.41.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto planned to have a closer look at ETH\u2019s metrics to understand whether the king of altcoins can touch $2,500 anytime soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s metrics look bullish\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that buying pressure on the token was high. This was evident from the fact that its net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average.\n\nAnother bullish signal was its active addresses, which increased in the recent past.\n\nBuying sentiment among US investors was also high as its Coinbase premium was green. Not only that, but things in the derivatives market also looked pretty optimistic.\n\nEthereum\u2019s funding rate remained green, meaning that derivatives investors were actively buying ETH at its higher price.\n\nIf ETH manages to sustain its bull rally, as suggested by the aforementioned metrics, the coin might face resistance in quite a few zones.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum\u2019s liquidation levels revealed that in order to maintain a bull rally, ETH must go above the $2,400 mark and then the $2,450 mark in the near future.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe possibility of ETH going above these levels was likely, as most market indicators were bullish.\n\nFor instance, its Money Flow Index (MFI) registered an uptick. Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend, increasing the chances of a continued uptrend."

        "content": "While Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are still awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), executives from asset management firms are already speculating about the potential launch of spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nValkyrie Invest\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Steven McClurg, expressed his belief that the SEC\u2019s potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF could pave the way for similar offerings in the XRP and Ethereum markets.\n\nHowever, regulatory challenges and classifying XRP and Ethereum as securities may present hurdles toward these index funds.\n\nXRP And Ethereum Spot ETF Potential Hurdles\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has been classified as a commodity by regulators, XRP and Ethereum have been deemed securities. This divergence in classification poses potential difficulties and may necessitate a more complex approval process for spot ETFs tracking these cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe anticipated impact of spot ETF approval on the XRP and Ethereum price would mirror the pattern seen with Bitcoin. Still, the SEC\u2019s skepticism towards the broader cryptocurrency market could pose additional hurdles for XRP and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, the outcome of the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case holds significant implications and could hold the key for the cryptocurrency industry to pursue these index funds for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf Ripple, the blockchain payment company associated with XRP, emerges victorious and is not classified as a security by Judge Analisa Torres, it could establish a precedent for asset managers seeking to apply for an XRP ETF.\n\nThis legal precedent could also prompt potential litigation against the SEC to support an Ethereum ETF application.\n\nWhile discussions revolve around the possibility of spot ETFs for XRP and Ethereum, there is still uncertainty surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC may reject or delay the pending applications, making it uncertain whether these other index funds will materialize. Furthermore, US regulators\u2019 current classification of XRP and Ethereum as securities adds an additional layer of complexity to their respective ETF prospects.\n\nBitcoin ETF Decision Imminent\n\nAs reported on Monday by NewsBTC, Sources close to the process have indicated that the ultimate approval for Bitcoin ETFs may come on Wednesday.\n\nCNBC\u2019s sources suggest that this coincides with the application deadline for Ark Invest and 21 Shares, raising the possibility of a potential trading launch between Thursday and Friday. Several applications are expected to receive the green light, pending updates from the SEC on the filings.\n\nOverall, as anticipation builds around the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs, asset managers are already contemplating the prospect of spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the regulatory challenges and the classification of XRP and Ethereum as securities present significant hurdles for these index funds. The Ripple vs. SEC case outcome could have far-reaching implications, potentially setting a legal precedent for asset managers to pursue XRP and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nXRP is trading at $0.5673, showing a lack of bullish momentum with a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, it has experienced a continuous downtrend of 13% over the past 30 days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Poised For Breakout? Analyst Pinpoint Key Levels For Monumental Surge - NewsBTC",
        "content": "So far, Ethereum appears to be showing signs of an impending bullish run, according to Crypto Tony, a renowned analyst in the crypto space. Crypto Tony suggests that Ethereum\u2019s journey to bullish momentum could commence if it successfully maintains its position above the crucial level of $2,130.\n\nFortunately, the asset trades above this price level and appears to be climbing further above it, with its current trading price of $2,264 at the time of writing.\n\nKey Levels For Major ETH Rally\n\nThe $2,130 price mark, as disclosed by Crypto Tony, is seen as a pivotal point for Ethereum, as maintaining this level could signal \u201cstrength and stability,\u201d setting the stage for further gains.\n\nThis optimism further escalates should Ethereum reclaim the range high at $2,500, a price level Crypto Tony revealed that would reinforce the bullish sentiment in the Ethereum market. Notably, Crypto Tony\u2019s bullish outlook aligns with the sentiments of other analysts in the crypto community.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update The ETH range is simple. Remain above $2,130 and we are bullish .. Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nFor instance, Ali Chart, another notable crypto analyst, has identified $3,830 and $5,100 price levels as Ethereum\u2019s following major targets based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) price bands.\n\nFor context, MVRV is a key on-chain metric or indicator that compares a cryptocurrency\u2019s market value (market cap) to its realized value, offering an alternative approach to assess the network\u2019s valuation by considering the price at which each unit last moved.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a crucial indicator that can be utilized especially for gauging the relative valuation of a crypto asset like Ethereum. When the MVRV ratio is high, it often suggests that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may be overvalued, and when it\u2019s low, the asset could be undervalued.\n\nAccording to the #Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands, the next key price targets for $ETH are $3,830 and $5,100! pic.twitter.com/cLo4crWkPF \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024\n\nAccording to a chart recently shared by Ali Chart on X, Ethereum is currently on an upward trajectory, with the next significant MVRV Pricing Bands at 2.4 and 3.2. These levels indicate that Ethereum may become overvalued, correlating to Ali\u2019s price targets for Ethereum at around $3,830 and $5,100, respectively.\n\nEthereum Whale Movements Backs Bullish Sentiment\n\nAdding to the bullish sentiments are recent whale movements. Spot On Chain has disclosed that an Ethereum whale, identified as \u20180x931\u2019, made a significant purchase of 21,192 ETH, valued at approximately $48 million, at an average price of $2,265.\n\nThis accumulation of ETH is a strong indicator of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future performance, as the whale has now held roughly 79,500 ETH since January 2023, sitting on an unrealized profit of $36.84 million.\n\nMoreover, last week\u2019s on-chain data from Santiment revealed that Ethereum\u2019s largest private wallets now hold a record 56.25 million ETH, representing 46.8% of the crypto\u2019s total circulating supply. This concentration of ETH in large wallets could be interpreted as a sign of long-term holding strategies among major investors.\n\nAmid these developments, Ethereum has been showing signs of recovery from its recent retracement. Despite a week of decline, the altcoin is beginning to exhibit an upward trajectory, with a near 2% increase in the past 24 hours, trading at around $2,272.\n\nThis recovery is further evidenced by a surge in trading volume, which has surged from a low of $11 billion last Monday to over $20 billion, indicating a possible increasing buying activity.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the crypto market continues to experience a bullish momentum thanks to the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype, Ethereum (ETH) is riding on this wave since it\u2019s eyeing the $2,400 resistance zone.\n\nLeading on-chain metrics provider Santiment pointed out, \u201cEthereum has continued working its way back toward its local top resistance level of $2,444 while crypto prices rebound.\u201d\n\nA hodling culture is playing out in the Ethereum network, with non-exchange whales taking center stage.\n\nSantiment acknowledged that non-exchange Ethereum whales were accumulating at a rapid pace compared to their exchange counterparts, whose buying rate was almost at the lowest level since June 2018.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nTop analytic firm Spot On Chain echoed Santiment\u2019s sentiments and revealed that a whale spent a whopping $48 million to purchase 21,192 ETH.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, the accumulation of ETH coins has been playing an instrumental role in triggering an uptrend in the Ethereum network because hodling reduces selling pressure, given that coins are stored for future purposes other than speculation.\n\nWill Ethereum Build Significant Momentum Pre-Halving?\n\nSince Ethereum has not yet found a bottom in the Bitcoin pair, the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market value might erode BTC\u2019s strength before the halving event slated for April this year.\n\nThese sentiments were shared by prominent market analyst Michael van de Poppe, and this further paints a bullish picture for Ethereum.\n\nSource: Michael van de Poppe\n\nBitcoin halving is an event that happens around every four years after 210,000 BTC blocks are created, with its essence being reducing the mining rewards by half. Therefore, retrieving Bitcoin becomes difficult, and this is bullish because its value is speculated to increase on the foundation of limited supply.\n\nMeanwhile, key indicators have popped up showing that the next price levels to watch out for Ethereum are $3,830 and $5,100, as reported by ZyCrypto.\n\nETH was hovering around $2,265 at press time, according to CoinGecko data."

The token, which currently sits at $2.97, showed a price increase of 26.9% in the last 24 hours, marking part of a rather successful year for Optimism. At the time of writing, the network boasts nearly six million addresses with a balance, reflecting a substantial 391% growth from earlier in the year.\n\nWhat a year for @Optimism!

In this transition, Lisk intends to migrate its LSK tokens onto the Ethereum platform.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OasisProtocol/status/1737861987508560042\n\nHolding steady in the second spot is Oasis Network (ROSE), sitting at $0.1224, with a notable surge of 22.3% in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nJames Seyffart, Bloomberg ETF expert, believes the SEC had implicitly accepted $ETH as a commodity rather than a security when it approved Ethereum futures. The experts believe this is a green light to file Ethereum ETF, as it\u2019s likely to be approved.\n\nThe approval could positively impact the topmost altcoin\u2019s price action, making it one of the top crypto coins to buy now.\n\n$GFOX is another crypto coin with a promising outlook. The Ethereum-based meme token is on presale, gaining massive adoption. Galaxy Fox aims to top the 2024 ICO spot, and much is expected of it beyond that. The buzzing altcoin could yield excellent profit for its early adopters, and willing investors can still benefit from it by joining the presale.\n\nGalaxy Fox: Bringing Meme Excellence to the Web3 Ecosystem\n\nMany new-generation meme coins employ a unique approach to ensure they stand out in the saturated meme sector. From choosing uncommon themes to pioneering unique utility, you\u2019ll always find one thing that makes them incomparable to existing meme coins. This is vital in ensuring they\u2019re widely adopted and prominent in the crypto market. Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) is the latest to follow this culture.\n\nThe meme coin is fox-themed, which makes it the only one in the meme ecosystem with such a theme. Also, it has a hybrid meme-GameFi utility, which isn\u2019t widespread in the crypto landscape. Galaxy Fox aims to be a useful token across different web3 spaces. It will perform designated functions on these platforms, and the increased adoption will improve the ERC-20 token\u2019s value.\n\nIn the Galaxy Fox ecosystem, $GFOX will be a medium of earning income for members of the ecosystem. The token holders can HODL for improved profit, stake it for reward, or buy game-boosting items with it to help their gameplay. The game on Galaxy Fox will be P2E. This means you can earn while enjoying the excitement of playing the game. Galaxy Fox will have a dedicated treasury to fund the prize pool for the game.\n\nThe ecosystem\u2019s runner game will involve players running against one another. The top performers will be on the leaderboard, and the top 20% will be rewarded with the $GFOX token. The more games you play, the more $GFOX you can win, and the more ability you have to buy in-game items and increase your winning chances.\n\nGalaxy Fox will also have NFTs that can function as characters in the ecosystem, increase your winning chances, and be valuable items in exchange for real-life money. This implies that each Galaxy Fox NFT could be a valuable asset you can trade on OpenSea or other open NFT platforms. Galaxy Fox developers design the $GFOX token for growth and sustainability. They employ a smart tokenomics system with a capped supply and a surge token burn strategy. This will improve the GFOX\u2019s\u2019 value.\n\nThe buzzing meme coin is on presale, allowing investors to buy part of its available supply at a discounted price before hitting the wider market. The meme coin could be among the top crypto coins with impressive runs this year.\n\nETHER Likely to Explode With Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nWith Ethereum ETF looking likely, market observers believe paying more attention to $ETH is advisable. The high-value altcoin could experience an incredible price increase when the SEC finally approves. $ETH is currently hovering around $2,200 to $2,445 market price. The altcoin has endured a decline since the turn of the year, but its decline has been at a low rate.\n\n$ETH hopes to retest the $2,500 resistance zone in the coming weeks as it prepares to near the $3000 price zone. However, failure to break the nearest resistance could send the altcoin below $2,000. The crypto market\u2019s general decline is rubbing off on $ETH, but experts believe that could change with $ETH ETF approval. SEC verdict on applied $ETH ETF verdict isn\u2019t expected anytime soon, but analysts are still confident about its bullish potential. ETH remains the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it could be among the profit-yielding top crypto coins this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the crypto community awaits Ethereum ETF approval, the $GFOX token continues its impressive ICO performance. The budding meme coin is positioned for market success and is certain to be among the top gainers upon its launch.\n\nLearn more about Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Galaxy Fox on Twitter"

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights With a consolidation range formation below the $2400 mark, ETH price coils up huge trend momentum.\n\nThe recent overnight recovery with high anticipations around the Bitcoin Spot ETF fuels the rally in altcoins in Ethereum.\n\nRising momentum and improving sentiments tease a breakout run in ETH price to $2700.\n\nKeeping a bullish stance in the long consolidation range, the ETH price finds constant support at the bottom base of $2200. Becoming a multi-contact point of reversal, Ethereum price continuously the streak of bullish engulfing formation from the crucial support level.\n\nLasting for more than 30 days, the Ethereum price constantly struggles to enter a decisive trend. Nevertheless, the recent market-wide recovery aligns with our ETH price prediction, which holds a bullish standpoint for the upcoming trend.\n\nBuyers Preparing Breakout Challenges $2400 Barrier.\n\nSource \u2013 TradingView\n\nDespite the recent failure to sustain the New Year\u2019s rally, the ETH price avoids a downfall like other altcoins of lesser market cap. With the strong buying activity at the $2200 support level, the bulls are prolonging the range formation and coiling up more trend momentum.\n\nThe intent is clear to provide a high-speed move upon the fracturing of the boundary on either side. Moreover, the spike in the buying pressure, evidenced by the spike in trading volume supporting the price jumps, improves the breakout chances.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price trades at $2308 and takes a 1.04% intraday pullback following the 4.94% jump last night. As the tradition of $2200 bouncing the Ethereum price continues, the $2400 breakout possibility sustains.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nRSI indicator: The daily RSI line shows a sideways trend, diluting the prevailing downfall near the halfway line. Moreover, the bullish divergence in the past two dips at the $2200 support increases the bull run chances.\n\nMACD Indicator: The MACD and signal lines close up the gap with the recent jump in ETH price and tease a bullish crossover. Further, the recent price jump in Ethereum shows a spike in average lines, reflecting improved sentiment and a potential comeback for Ethereum.\n\nThe Bears Are On The Verge Of Liquidation\n\nFollowing the recent liquidation event of almost $100Mn Liquidation from the bulls, the ETH price stabilizes normally within the range. Further, the recent liquidation chart from Coinglass shows a spike in liquidations on the bearish side.\n\nAs bears lose $42Mn due to liquidation on Monday and the uptrend gaining momentum, the Ethereum price may soon make a strong comeback. This can lead to more bearish liquidations in the coming days.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready to Cross $2400?\n\nAs per the technical analysis, the ETH price action shows a high momentum bullish trend entering a sideways track. Therefore, as per the price pattern analysis, a bullish flag pattern forms in the daily chart. Hence, the breakout of the consolidation range is most likely on the upside as the flag pattern is a trend continuation pattern.\n\nThe recent surge has tested the $2400 level and presented a breakout entry for traders who missed the $220 breakout. Additionally, the likelihood of Ethereum crossing the $2500 level is increasing, with significant upside potential remaining. The uptrend could potentially reach the $2700 level.\n\nConversely, a reversal could drive the price of ETH back to $2200."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto bear believes that major corrections are coming for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) after fleeting rallies.\n\nPseudonymous trader Capo tells his 83,873 Telegram subscribers that the possible approval this week of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will likely ignite a short-lived rally for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\n\u201cWhales are showing strong interest in the $48,000-$50,000 level. News can trigger volatility and leave large wicks. So a pump to that level and a big rejection afterward is a likely scenario.\u201d\n\nThe trader shares a chart predicting Bitcoin\u2019s price action \u201cfor the next few days.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that Bitcoin will soar toward $51,000 upon news of the approval of a spot market Bitcoin ETF. After the rally, he suggests that Bitcoin will likely correct down to the $30,000-$31,000 as whales \u201csell the news.\u201d\n\nThe trader also predicts Ethereum will rally to as high as $2,600 before correcting. And he expects other altcoins to also undergo a massive correction after a brief move to the upside.\n\n\u201cInteresting week ahead. ETF news should be released soon. As explained these days, I expect the market to pump first. BTC to $48,000-$50,000, ETH to $2,500-$2,600. Alts should pump more, especially low caps. After this, which should take a few days, the market should reach a very important local top. That\u2019s when I will start opening swing short positions, aiming for new lows.\u201d\n\nLooking further out, the trader maintains his long-standing prediction that Bitcoin will eventually collapse to the $12,000 level, which his chart suggests will happen around April.\n\n\u201cBTC HTF (high timeframe) idea.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $46,776 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nA recent Bloomberg report suggests that Bitcoin Spot ETFs could gain approval from the US financial regulator this week. Ahead of the January 10 deadline, BTC investors await the SEC\u2019s decision on this product. This anticipation has sparked market activity, with Bitcoin\u2019s price stable above $45,000 and Ethereum aiming for $2,300. Concurrently, increased liquidations have been observed in Ethereum, as bearish traders get caught, weakening its immediate resistance levels.\n\nETH Triggers Over $7 Million In Liquidations\n\nCoinglass data reveals a surge in Ethereum liquidations following its recovery from a recent low of $2,170 to $2,277. This period saw liquidations of ETH positions worth over $7.3 million, including approximately $5.8 million in short-position liquidations by bears. This has boosted Ethereum\u2019s support level, sending its price above moving averages.\n\nA key factor in this stable buying confidence is the negative Netflow, indicating ongoing accumulation of ETH despite bearish trends. As reported by IntoTheBlock, Netflow became negative when the ETH price dropped below $2,250. In the last two days, about 25K Ethereum coins were removed from exchanges, reflecting a holding sentiment among investors.\n\nRecent data indicates a decline in interest from Ethereum whales, reaching a three-month low. The value of large transactions in USD has fallen by $3 billion to $1.74 billion. This decrease may explain why Ethereum\u2019s price hasn\u2019t been influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s recent climb above $45K, as ETH was expected to surpass $2,400.\n\nNotably, bears are strongly defending the $2,300 resistance level, as seen by the long/short ratio dropping below 1, currently at 0.8038. Bearish sentiment is gaining momentum, with approximately 55.5% of positions anticipating a price drop. On the other hand, only 45.5% of positions remain bullish about Ethereum\u2019s uptrend.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEthereum price has successfully rebounded from the ascending support line and buyers quickly sent the price above the EMA20 trend line. However, sellers are strongly defending a surge above $2,300. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,280, surging over 2.33 from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nCurrently, the 20-day EMA is showing minor upward activity, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers above the midline at level, suggesting potential breakout movement in the short term. Should Ethereum break above the $2,300 level, the ETH price might climb to $2,400 to test buyers\u2019 patience. Overcoming this level could pave the way for a rally towards $2,700 and possibly extend to $3,100.\n\nThe initial support lies around the $2,100 level. If ETH price fails to gain buying confidence, we might see its price declining toward the crucial support line at $1,974. However, this level might attract buying interest, resulting in a rebound.\n\nIn the short-term, Ethereum is expected to experience a significant surge, potentially surpassing the $2,500 mark and aiming for $3,000, depending upon a favorable outcome from the SEC by January 10th."

        "content": "Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje, known as the godfather of decentralized finance (DeFi), further raised concerns over probabilistic finality in blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum as the market sees expanding use cases and adoption in traditional finance. He said Fantom has already solved state bloat as Ethereum developers look to solve state bloat in the chain.\n\nAndre Cronje Says Fantom Has Resolved S tate Bloat Issue\n\nIn response to Ambient Finance founder Doug Colkitt\u2019s belief that Ethereum is the only chain looking to solve state bloat in its long-term plan, Andre Cronje said \u201cI am pretty confident in saying we already solved state bloat at Fantom.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum roadmap entails using Verkle trees to allow for \u201cdata to be small enough to be attached to every block.\u201d It could help validators and nodes to become stateless as all \u2018state\u2019 can be stored more efficiently off-chain.\n\nHowever, Andre Cronje said any blockchain that uses probabilistic finality or any variant of the longest chain rule won\u2019t resolve this issue. Bitcoin and Ethereum chains depend on probabilistic finality. Finality refers to when a block of transactions is considered permanent and cannot be altered or reversed.\n\nFantom uses aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism, which does not require the longest chain rule.\n\nMoreover, Fantom introduced the new database Carmen, a flat storage method that does not use tree or dictionary structures while maintaining a cryptographic signature of the world state. This greatly reduces the bloat of the current active state (two epochs). Carmen supports real-time pruning, and although archive nodes still need to retain all data, most validators can enable pruning.\n\nAfter adopting the above technology, Fantom\u2019s status is reduced from about 2TB (archive) to 60GB (archive). Cronje said state bloat has been one of Fantom\u2019s core milestones since its early days.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock And VanEck Files Updated S-1 For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval"

        "content": "The supply of Ethereum on exchanges has continued to decrease in the new year.\n\nThe number of daily stakes showed that the asset, once taken off exchanges, was not flowing back in.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed a decrease in its supply on exchanges. How has this impacted the number of holders?\n\nExchanges keep getting less supply of Ethereum\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s Supply on Exchanges shows a gradual reduction from the 1st of January, although it remained above 10 million at press time. The exchange supply stood at around 10.52 million at the beginning of the year.\n\nStill, as of this writing, it has decreased to around 10.45 million. This represented a decline from over 8% to about 7.9%.\n\nThe decreasing Supply on Exchanges indicated that holders were withdrawing their assets from these platforms at the time of the report. This could lead to increased scarcity, depending on the destination of these assets.\n\nAre more Ethereum flowing into stakes?\n\nAMBCrypto found that Ethereum\u2019s staking chart on Glassnode showed a consistent increase in stakes, with over 35.7 million as of this writing.\n\nWhile the overall growth might suggest that ETH withdrawn from exchanges was being staked, a closer look at the daily new stake numbers challenged this assumption.\n\nPost the 30th of December 2022, the chart showed a decline in new deposits, dropping below 2,000. As of this writing, the number had fallen below 1,000.\n\nThis trend suggested that not all ETH withdrawn from exchanges had been staked, at least not in its entirety and for the present period.\n\nEthereum holders keep increasing\n\nAMBCrypto also found that Ethereum holders showed sustained growth over recent months, with the press time count approaching 112 million. The chart showed an upward trend, affirming the ongoing expansion.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis suggested a continuous increase in wallets acquiring and holding ETH, even amid reduced Supply on Exchanges. Additionally, the Supply outside of Exchanges implied that the diminishing supply might be attributed to accumulation.\n\nAs of this writing, the Supply outside of Exchanges was over 120 million."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could ascend to $50,000 if SEC greenlights spot BTC ETF.\n\nEthereum price readies for a possible 10% climb to $2,500 amid rising momentum and a weakening downtrend.\n\nRipple price finds support at $0.5442, recovery rally in the works as altcoin hopes rest on SEC decision.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains broadly bullish, though not to its full potential, as it could spring higher on chatter about regulator approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Altcoins, starting with Ethereum (ETH) price and Ripple (XRP) price, are also poised for a positive move, with all hopes pegged to the decision expected this week from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETF could see SEC greenlight, Grayscale Investments files amended S-3 sets 1.5% fee\n\nBitcoin eyes $50,000 amid spot ETF-related optimism\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to intertwine itself with the midline of the weekly supply zone at $43,860 but could break out soon as spot ETF developments approach a deadline. The king of cryptocurrency\u2019s price has strong support provided by the 25-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at $43,130 and $41,391, respectively. The inclination of these moving averages to the north show it is the path with the least resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also tipping north, showing rising momentum. Increased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price make a decisive move above the critical threshold of $43,860, before an extension to the next critical range at $48,000.\n\nOnce Bitcoin price overcomes the $48,000 steeple, it could make a quick run to the $50,000 psychological level before potential profit booking. However, traders keeping their profit appetite in check could set the pace for BTC to reach the highly ambitious target of $60,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if early profit booking commences, instigated either by a rejection from the SEC or a delay in the decision, Bitcoin price could descend. Such a move could see it break below the 25 and 50-day EMAs before testing the confluence between the 100-day EMA and the horizontal line near the $37,800 level.\n\nHowever, for the prevailing bullish outlook to be invalidated, Bitcoin price must close below the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast, Analyzing possible short-term implication of probable spot ETF approval on BTC price\n\nEthereum price coils up for a 10% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains within the confines of an ascending parallel channel, with the final retest of the lower boundary of the channel possibly precipitating a 10% climb to $2,500. The RSI is moving north, evidence of rising momentum, accentuated by the falling Average Directional Index (ADX), showing that the slump that saw ETH value drop is losing strength.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price shatter the $2,388 resistance, before clearing the $2,445 range high as it heads to the forecasted $2,500 target. A strong jolt past this level could see ETH market value reach $3,000.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if profit takers pull the trigger, Ethereum price could roll over, potentially losing the support at $2,135. Below this level, the cliff could send Ether to the depths of $2,000, or in a dire case, invalidate the bullish outlook by breaking and closing below $1,935.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price could target $3,000 with ETH whales buying the dip\n\nRipple price could scale a recovery with $0.5442 support holding\n\nRipple (XRP) price may have bottomed out after the $0.5442 support came into play. The RSI edging north points to rising momentum, whereas the ADX indicator rising suggests a strengthening trend.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see Ripple price overcome the critical support at $0.5784, potentially going as high as to breach the resistance due to the descending trendline and collecting sell-side liquidity around the $0.7000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders who got wrecked during the January 2 crash choose to exit the market after breaking even, XRP price could drop, with a break below the $0.5442 support exposing Ripple price to a cliff. This would expose further downside as low as the midline of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.5002. A break and close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price likely to bounce 20% as balance restores in the XRP market"

The downward trends were a plunge in the unique address graph and a decline in transaction numbers after reaching a summit on December 25, 2023. Nonetheless, these adverse trends were balanced by an upthrust in the market valuation of Polygon\u2019s native token, $MATIC, escalating its market cap beyond $8 billion.\n\nThe differing trends in Polygon\u2019s NFT environment highlight the intricate dynamics involved. Despite a reduction in the \u201cMarket Value to Realized Value\u201d ratio and the weighted sentiment, the price of the $MATIC token has displayed an upward trajectory, and its high social volume denotes a cautiously upbeat expectation for future expansion.\n\nDespite the contrasting market movements, the mood within the ecosystem remains optimistic regarding potential growth, considering the tightening rivalry in the crypto space and the advancement of Polygon as a key Layer-2 system in this swiftly evolving industry.\n\nWant more?

Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF being launched in the US has the crypto community buzzing, with some analysts speculating that these funds could be approved as early as this week.\n\nWe tasked the AI model ChatGPT with providing an in-depth price prediction for Ethereum (ETH) if one of these ETFs was given the green light.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted a new altcoin, Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), that could be primed to benefit from the tailwinds associated with ETF approval.\n\nHow Could Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Affect Ethereum\u2019s Price?\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin are separate blockchains with different use cases, the two leading cryptos have often moved in tandem in the market and look likely to continue doing so.\n\nThe reasons are multifaceted \u2013 for one, regulatory approval of a spot BTC ETF could mean greater legitimacy for cryptocurrencies as an asset class.\n\nIn turn, this may inspire investor confidence in altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, launching a successful BTC ETF may increase the appetite for a spot ETH ETF down the line, which would likely boost the ETH price in anticipation.\n\nHowever, some analysts caution that the actual debut of a spot BTC ETF could be underwhelming relative to expectations.\n\nThis might start a wave of profit-taking that spills over into Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nStill, the overall consensus suggests a spot ETF would introduce new institutional inflows, outweighing any short-term volatility.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum investors are eagerly anticipating the potential launch of one of these funds in the US.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Bullish ETH Price Prediction If SEC Gives Spot ETF Green Light\n\nMoving from market speculation to AI-generated projections, we consulted ChatGPT to analyze how the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could impact Ethereum\u2019s price outlook.\n\nWith ETH currently trading around $2,270, ChatGPT delivered an overwhelmingly bullish forecast.\n\nThe AI model argues ETF approval would accelerate crypto asset adoption, attract institutional dollars, and create a halo effect, boosting the broader altcoin market \u2013 all positive for Ethereum.\n\nConsidering these factors and Ethereum\u2019s independent growth drivers within the DeFi space, ChatGPT sees significant upside potential even after the recent rally.\n\nIn the model\u2019s most optimistic scenario, if a spot BTC ETF gets the green light, ChatGPT predicts ETH could reach between $3,000 and $4,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThis would represent a rally of up to 76% from current levels.\n\nWhile this forecast is entirely hypothetical, ChatGPT makes a strong case for ETH benefiting from a regulatory breakthrough on the Bitcoin front.\n\nWhich Other Coins Could Rise After Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval?\n\nWhile all the attention is being given to Bitcoin and Ethereum, a spot BTC ETF could open the floodgates for capital into smaller-cap tokens.\n\nOne under-the-radar project on the verge of a significant breakthrough is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an innovative Stake-to-Mine platform in its presale phase.\n\nChatGPT Predicts 687% Price Pump for Bitcoin Minetrix as Presale Nears $8M Milestone\n\nAs a crypto project striving to open Bitcoin mining to mainstream investors, Bitcoin Minetrix is well-positioned to ride the wave of interest from spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe project\u2019s novel \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model lets users earn BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than running expensive mining hardware.\n\nThis feature has already helped raise over $7.9 million in presale funding, showcasing strong investor interest.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT how BTC ETF approval could impact Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s price outlook in 2024.\n\nThe AI model cited several bullish factors, including increased crypto legitimacy, which would translate into potential tailwinds for mining tokens like BTCMTX.\n\nConsidering these factors, ChatGPT forecasts that BTCMTX\u2019s price could rise as high as $0.10 if the token is listed on exchanges following spot ETF approval.\n\nShould ChatGPT\u2019s prediction come true, it would represent a staggering 687% increase from the current presale price of $0.0127.\n\nWith anticipation ramping up in the Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram group, ChatGPT\u2019s bullish forecast could fuel further enthusiasm and attract more attention to the project.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

        "content": "Solana SOL/USD, often touted as an \u2018Ethereum ETH/USD killer\u2019, has seen its native token, SOL, slide by 12% over the past 24 hours, interrupting its end-of-year upswing.\n\nWhat Happened: Following a high of $126.30 on Dec. 25, SOL has experienced a sharp decrease of 13% within seven days.\n\nThe previous price rally can be attributed to an airdrop craze triggered by the listing of the new JITO token on significant exchanges on Dec. 7, 2023, which swiftly achieved a market cap surpassing $300 million. This event was closely followed by the launch of the BONK BONK/USD meme coin on Dec. 14, 2023, which led to a complete sell-out of Solana\u2019s Saga phone, as certain airdrops aimed at mobile device holders.\n\nAmidst this, there was a notable uptick in transaction volume among Solana\u2019s decentralized applications, standing resilient even as rival blockchains such as Arbitrum, zkSync, and BNB Chain faltered under increased December activity.\n\nThe decline in investor interest became evident post the airdrop euphoria with Jito JTO/USD, DogWifHat WIF/USD, and BONK notes facing dips of 40%, 41%, and 44% respectively.\n\nWhen delving into Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL), a downward trend has been noted. The TVL, measured in SOL, hit a peak of 15.4 million SOL on December 19, 2023, but subsequently descended by 17%, landing at 12.8 million SOL on January 5, 2024.\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: American broadcaster and filmmaker Max Keiser revisited an earlier statement on X, succinctly echoing his previous sentiment, stating, \"The rug pull has begun, anon.\"\n\nA pseudonymous analyst known as Pentoshi shared a perspective on SOL\u2019s potential trajectory. \"SOL update #1 Not sure we get as low as I have here, but do expect at some point to be able to bid in the $70\u2019s. Looking forward to not just trading sol, but holding some ecosystem coins for the next year or so,\" Pentoshi remarked.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $89 down 12.50% on Sunday, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"

        "content": "Ethereum, after a brief dip in Monday's trading session, has shown signs of resurgence, breaking above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average.\n\nThe momentum suggests a potential target of around $2,400. This level has repeatedly resisted price advances and represents a significant point of interest.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Bitcoin remains the primary driver in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe $2,400 level is expected to continue offering resistance. Should a breakthrough occur, the market might make a concerted effort to surpass the $2,500 level, which also holds considerable attention and resistance. Beyond that, the $2,750 level becomes the next potential target. Over the longer term, there is a possibility of ascending even further, with a measured move from the previous ascending triangle indicating a potential destination of $3,400 or potentially higher.\n\nConsolidation Phase\n\nIn the recent trading session, the market has been in a consolidation phase, accumulating momentum for an upward push. The $2,100 level is considered reliable support, complemented by the presence of the 50-day EMA in the same vicinity. These elements align to create a setup that suggests an impending upward move. Additionally, if there is an expectation of central banks adopting loose monetary policies, it could benefit Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Monitoring the 10-year yield is crucial in this context. A decline below the $2,000 level would necessitate a reassessment of the entire market. However, for now, the prevailing sentiment leans towards buying opportunities during dips.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nIn the end, Ethereum has displayed renewed strength, breaking above the 20-day EMA and potentially targeting the $2,400 level. Resistance is expected at this juncture, with subsequent targets at $2,500 and $2,750. A longer-term perspective suggests the possibility of reaching $3,400 or even higher. The market has been consolidating recently, with support at $2,100 and the 50-day EMA reinforcing this zone. The prospect of looser central bank policies could further boost Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Keeping an eye on the 10-year yield is essential. A drop below $2,000 would necessitate a reevaluation, but for now, buying the dips appears to be the prevailing strategy employed by most traders around the world. The market continues to see plenty of opportunities for people to take advantage of now.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD? Here\u2019s a list of some of the best crypto brokers to check out."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently offered some words of wisdom for navigating the crypto markets amidst economic uncertainty. His advice blends traditional investment strategies with a nuanced understanding of digital assets. Buterin stresses the importance of diversification, savings, moderation, and financial safety.\n\nKeypoints\n\nDiversify your investments across different sectors to mitigate risk\n\nAccumulate enough savings to cover multiple years of expenses for financial safety\n\nHave a \u201cboring\u201d portfolio focused on steady, reliable long-term investments rather than thrill-seeking\n\nDon\u2019t use more than 2x leverage when trading crypto to avoid excessive losses\n\nSpreading assets and having multiple income sources is better than relying on a single one\n\nFirst and foremost, Buterin advocates diversifying across different sectors to reduce risk. With new cryptocurrencies launching daily in an ever-evolving landscape, spreading assets across various areas can hedge against volatility. Buterin cautions against putting all your eggs in one basket. This aligns with proven investing principles in traditional finance.\n\nAdditionally, Buterin underscores accumulating substantial savings \u2013 enough to cover multiple years of expenses. With cryptocurrency prices and job markets increasingly unpredictable, having this financial safety net provides freedom. It\u2019s a buffer for riding out downturns when investing returns decline. Buterin sees this as the true meaning of financial freedom.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nFurthermore, Buterin recommends keeping most crypto portfolio allocations in \u201cboring\u201d assets, not thrill-seeking speculative bets. Though overnight crypto millionaire stories spark excitement, Buterin calls for responsible long-term positions focused on steady returns. Moderation and prudence should prevail over gambling on ultra-high risk holdings.\n\nFinally, the Ethereum founder warns strongly against using over 2x leverage when trading crypto futures. With such high volatility, excess leverage can lead to devastating liquidations, wiping out positions. Buterin insists on maintaining this boundary for long-term sustainability over short-term windfall bets.\n\nButerin blends traditional wisdom with crypto-specific advice: diversify wisely, accumulate ample savings, keep allocations moderate, and avoid extremes of leverage. Follow these tips from one of crypto\u2019s leading pioneers to navigate uncertainty and come out ahead.\n\nThe key is prudent, balanced investing for sustainable gains rather than resorting to excess speculation. Buterin offers guidance for both newcomers and veterans alike facing the digital asset frontier."

        "content": "Celsius, once a prominent player in the cryptocurrency lending space, has embarked on a significant move to unstake and potentially sell a vast amount of Ethereum (ETH), estimated at nearly $470 million. This decision is a critical part of the company\u2019s bankruptcy process, which ensued following allegations of mismanagement and the subsequent arrest of its founder, Alex Mashinsky, for fraud.\n\nThe Unstaking Strategy: A Path to Liquidity\n\nIn an effort to repay its creditors, Celsius is liquidating its assets, including its Ethereum holdings. The company had been leveraging these assets for income through staking, a method where cryptocurrencies are used to support blockchain network operations in exchange for rewards. The unstaking process is intended to increase liquidity, a necessary step for the repayment process.\n\nIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nNansen\u2019s Insights: A Glimpse into Celsius\u2019s Ethereum Holdings\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen has shed light on the scale of Celsius\u2019s undertaking, revealing that the company is set to unstake 206,319 ETH. This move is crucial for customers who have been awaiting the return of their funds for over a year and a half. According to the recovery plan, these creditors are slated to receive distributions in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSource: Nansen.ai\n\nMarket Impact and Future Outlook\n\nThe decision to unstake such a significant amount of Ethereum has sparked mixed reactions. While some express concern over its potential market impact, others anticipate a positive long-term effect on the Ethereum market. This action is a key component of Celsius\u2019s strategy to navigate its bankruptcy and meet its obligations to creditors.\n\nConclusion\n\nCelsius\u2019s decision to unstake a large portion of Ethereum marks a pivotal moment in its journey through bankruptcy proceedings. It reflects the company\u2019s commitment to resolving its financial obligations and the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market. As Celsius continues to address its challenges, the crypto community watches closely, anticipating the broader implications of these actions on the market and investors.\n\nMore from Ethereum"

        "content": "Loading... Loading...\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic hit businesses and consumers with job cuts, layoffs and business closings. The impact continues to be felt today with higher inflation and a tight job market coming after the pandemic.\n\nTo help mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the U.S. government sent out several stimulus payments to help individuals and families deal with rising costs and job losses.\n\nWhile the stimulus payments were meant to help with everyday spending and bills, Americans who received the payments were free to do with the money as they wished, potentially investing it if they did not need the money at the current time or putting it into savings.\n\n\n\nWhat Happened: In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. Under the law, Americans received a total of three stimulus payments.\n\nMany used the money for bills and savings, but some also turned to investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies at the time.\n\nThe CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment.\n\nThe subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020. The American Rescue Act of 2021 provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the return a consumer would have if they put their stimulus checks ($1,200, $600 and $1,400) into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nThe hypothetical results are based on the dates of April 11, 2020; Dec. 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021, for the stimulus checks.\n\nRelated Link: EXCLUSIVE: Why Does Cathie Wood Think Bitcoin Is Going To $1 Million \u2014 What Does She Know That We Don\u2019t?\n\nStimulus Checks in Bitcoin: Investing in Bitcoin with a portion of the stimulus checks may have been a popular option for investors and people looking to store some of the payment away or get involved in the cryptocurrency market for the first time.\n\nBitcoin traded at $6,926 on April 11, 2020, $27,370 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $57,996 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Bitcoin would have been able to purchase a total of 0.219 BTC.\n\nBased on a price of $46,975.28 for Bitcoin today, that $3,200 would now be worth $10,287.59, gaining 221.5%.\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nStimulus Checks in Dogecoin: The meme cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin gained interest and value in 2021 thanks to retail investors and vocal public supporters like Mark Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Here's how stimulus checks in Dogecoin would have fared.\n\nDogecoin traded at $0.0020 on April 11, 2020, $0.0046 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $0.0570 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Dogecoin would have been able to purchase 754,996 DOGE. Based on a price of $0.08107 today, that $3,200 would now be worth $61,207.53, gaining 1,812.7%.\n\nStimulus Checks In Ethereum: One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021 was Ethereum, thanks to its connection to non-fungible tokens. Here's a look at how stimulus checks invested in the second-largest cryptocurrency would have fared.\n\nEthereum traded at $161.17 on April 11, 2020, $737.95 on Dec. 29, 2020, and $1,839.50 on March 12, 2021. A person who put the $3,200 into Ethereum would have been able to purchase 9.02 ETH. Based on a price of $2,353.96 for Ethereum today, that $3,200 investment would now be worth $21,232.72 today, gaining 626.0%.\n\nStimulus Check In All 3 Cryptocurrencies: A more diversified approach from an investor could have seen investments in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Splitting the $3,200 into equal investments of the three cryptocurrencies on the respective stimulus payout days would have given an investor 0.0731 BTC, 251,665 DOGE and 3 ETH. The three cryptocurrencies would be worth $20,898.25 today based on equal investments from the three stimulus checks.\n\nThis represents a return of 865.8% for investing the stimulus checks in the three cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: The Man Who Bets Against Cathie Wood, Jim Cramer Filed For New Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 How Leveraged ETFs Are An Investment Tool\n\nPhoto: Unsplash"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Rally Hiatus Eyes Fresh Liquidity With Spot BTC ETF Approaching - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the window for spot Bitcoin ETF approval shrinks to 36 hours, market participants exhibit contrasting strategies. Bulls favor a breakout in Bitcoin and Ethereum price, while bears anticipate a correction triggered by the \u201csell-the-news\u201d narrative, potentially preceding a longer-term upward trend.\n\nEthereum Price Trend Continuation Depends On Critical Support Levels\n\nAlthough buoyant, Ethereum price stalled close to the stubborn $2,400 resistance. The leading smart contracts token has since early December consolidated within a narrow range, with resistance cut out at $2,400 and support around $2,200.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt is this consolidation that has led to ETH forming a bullish rectangle pattern which if validated may treat investors to a 10% move. Therefore, the next sessions could determine the next direction Ether takes.\n\nSimilarly, if the immediate support highlighted at $2,274 by the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in blue) remains intact, the least resistance would shift upwards, paving the way for Ethereum price to activate the rectangle breakout targeting highs at $2,600. It would be worth looking out for a daily candle close above this support line likely to reinforce the bulls\u2019 presence in the market.\n\nRecommended for you: Crypto Price Prediction For January 9: HNT, BONK, TIA\n\nLong-term success in a news-sensitive market necessitates a measured approach. While experienced investors navigate this volatility with practiced caution, novice traders might find it particularly challenging.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, although donning a sell signal, has the potential to send a call to buy ETH in the near term.\n\nBefore entering new long orders, traders must make sure that the MACD line in blue is above the signal line in red and accompanied by an upward-slopping movement.\n\nPrudence remains paramount even amidst bullish murmurs. As Ethereum price continues to lack directional momentum, a breach below the 20-day EMA (purple) support would lend credence to the prevailing bearish sentiment. This, coupled with the potential market response to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, could intensify downward pressure on Ethereum, potentially pushing it towards the $2,200 rectangle support level.\n\nCollecting liquidity from this support could mean that Ethereum price gains momentum to make another approach for a breakout to $2,600. However, if the support weakens amid increasing panic-selling pressure, ETH may be forced to retest $2,200 and perhaps brush the 200-day EMA (purple) support before the next significant trend reversal starts to build.\n\nThe token is also approaching the 2022 low on the ETH/BTC pair, which crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes holds immense liquidity to support the next breakout above $3,000.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nThe anticipation for the ETF would greatly impact the performance of Ethereum price. While a sell-the-news scenario is possible, investors cannot ignore the spike in capital flow likely to give cryptos like ETH and BTC momentum to hit higher highs.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin offers four financial tips to help new and seasoned investors mitigate risks amid massive volatility in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum boss shared the tips after famous blogger Alexander Voigt highlighted how diversification strategy helped Microsoft founder Bill Gate to build his net worth.\n\nHow Microsoft Founder Boosts Portfolio Using Diversification Strategy\n\nVoigt noted that when Gates became friends with prominent American businessman Warren Buffett, he sold most of his Microsoft shares. According to Voigt, the move helped Gates to diversify his portfolio and acquire other stocks.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result of the decision, the Microsoft founder built his fortune to $138 billion. Voigt emphasized that Gates would have been worth only $1.33 billion if he did not diversify his portfolio.\n\nEthereum Founder Reacts, Offers 4 Financial Tips\n\nReacting, Buterin characterized Voigt\u2019s financial tip as awful. However, he offered four tips, which he described as \u201cactual financial advice.\u201d\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum founder first recognized the importance of diversification. Diversifying one\u2019s portfolio cannot be overemphasized, as it helps mitigate risks. Spreading your investment across various assets would ensure that the negative performance of one asset does not entirely affect your portfolio.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSecondly, Buterin pointed out the importance of saving. He recommended that people should accumulate sufficient funds to the point where they can cover multiple years of expenses. It bears mentioning that there is no guarantee in investing, given the recent economic downturn that has wreaked havoc on most financial markets. Hence, saving more could help shield one from the problems associated with investing.\n\nFor the third point, Buterin encouraged investors to be boring with most of their portfolios. The concept of being boring with one\u2019s portfolio suggests that people should opt for low-cost and low-risk assets. Here, Buterin recommends that people be prudent with investing instead of committing their funds to high-risk assets.\n\nLastly, the Ethereum founder warned against using high leverage when investing in the futures markets. Specifically, he cautioned against using over 2X leverage. This advice is necessary, especially in crypto trading, where volatility is rife. Recall that following a 7% dip in Bitcoin price last week, over $655 million worth of long positions were liquidated. The majority of long traders who got liquidated were mainly those who used high leverages.\n\nButerin\u2019s financial tips are suitable for both new and seasoned crypto investors. They serve as a reminder, urging people to be prudent as they seek to bolster their portfolio."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Eruption Past $3k Imminent? Investors Unpack Vitalik \u2018s Bull Run Tips - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has been on an upward trajectory for the past few months. The cryptocurrency value has soared from under $2,000 to $2,400, indicating a positive trend. However, the current market displays mixed sentiments about its future direction. The digital currency has been fluctuating within a defined range, showing signs of both strength and uncertainty.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum price value has impressively hit $2,270, marking a 0.78% increase in just 24 hours. This rise suggests a positive market mood. The trading volume, according to data by CoinMarketCap, has also seen an 84% jump in the same period, reaching $509 million. With a market capitalization of $10 billion, Ethereum ranks second among cryptocurrencies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum faces a consolidation phase, especially under the $2,400 mark. The leading smart contracts token has been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400 in the past week, with bears and bulls struggling. In the past year, Ether experienced a significant increase of over 79%, demonstrating resilience and optimism as bullish sentiment prevails despite occasional minor dips.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Investment Tips for Ethereum Enthusiasts\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently shared some investment wisdom. This came after a noted blogger, Alexander Voigt, discussed how diversification aided Bill Gates in wealth accumulation. Buterin, however, termed Voigt\u2019s advice as subpar and offered his own financial guidelines.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nButerin\u2019s tips are simple yet profound. He emphasizes the importance of diversification, suggesting that a varied portfolio can reduce risk. He advises investors to save enough to cover multiple years of expenses, stressing the value of financial safety and freedom. Buterin also recommends keeping the bulk of one\u2019s portfolio in stable investments and strongly advises against using more than 2x leverage.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly relevant for both new and seasoned investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Adhering to such prudent strategies could potentially pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s price to surge past the $3,000 mark. If the bullish trend persists, this milestone could soon be within reach.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Supporting a Bullish Outlook\n\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price movement adds another layer of optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently around the 50 mark, suggesting a balance in market momentum. On a 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased since breaking above the 200-day moving average and exiting a major descending channel. This bullish trend is visually evident through the formation of three four-hour green candlesticks.\n\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has overtaken the signal line, indicating a positive market outlook. The rising histogram supports this bullish sentiment. The 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on an upward curve, and the 50-day MA crossing over the 200-day MA reaffirms the bullish market sentiment. The Chaikin money flow indicator is also in the positive region at 0.04, indicating a bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "In the imminent crypto surge, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to reach $2,500, with Everlodge (ELDG) and Fantom (FTM) emerging as prominent players in the bullish market. As these tokens ride the wave, investors seek the best crypto to invest in for optimal returns. Explore these promising opportunities now!\n\nETH Rebounds After Flash Crash \u2013 Eyes Set on $2,500 Amidst Bullish Momentum\n\nIn recent developments, Ethereum (ETH) faced a substantial flash crash, experiencing a 14% correction on January 3, 2023, causing concerns among investors. This sharp decline saw ETH price plummet from a daily high of $2,380 to $2,050 in less than two hours, triggering a volatile market reaction. Analysts attributed this plunge to external factors such as global market uncertainties, regulatory developments, and profit-taking sentiments among traders.\n\nDespite the sudden decline, ETH showcased resilience by recovering from $2,050 to a high of $2,371.81 before settling around $2,237 at the time of writing. Given its potential to influence the market, monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements on a weekly and monthly basis becomes crucial for investors navigating the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum enthusiasts and analysts anticipate a bullish momentum that could propel the cryptocurrency to new heights. Market predictions, such as those from Changelly, equally suggest a positive trajectory, with Ethereum expected to reach a maximum of $31,984.26 by 2030. Short-term projections are optimistic as well, indicating a potential surge to $2,500 in the near future.\n\nFantom (FTM) Leverages Bull Run Momentum \u2013 Positioned for Exponential Growth\n\nRecent events have played a crucial role in shaping the price of Fantom (FTM). A surge in demand and investor interest has been fueled by the integration of Fantom into various decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and partnerships with prominent blockchain platforms.\n\nNotably, the collaboration with Coindesk and The Block to provide real-time price data and live charts has enhanced Fantom\u2019s visibility, attracting more investors seeking a good crypto to buy. Additionally, technological advancements and the successful execution of key milestones have contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding Fantom\u2019s future growth.\n\nAs Fantom continues to leverage the current bull run momentum, future price forecasts are optimistic. Analysts, including those at CoinCodex, predict sustained growth for Fantom in the coming years. Meanwhile, projections for 2024 suggest a higher value target, emphasizing the crypto\u2019s potential for exponential growth.\n\nAdditionally, long-term predictions point to a positive trend, positioning Fantom as a promising investment for those seeking the best cryptos to invest in. Investors looking for insights on FTM price predictions can rely on these analyses to make informed decisions about including Fantom in their portfolios.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Defies Market Correction, Shows Resilience in the Bull Run\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) showcases remarkable resilience amidst market corrections, positioning itself as a standout crypto for investors seeking the best assets to invest in. Offering a unique blend of fractional vacation home ownership, timeshare, and NFT technology, Everlodge introduces a groundbreaking concept where traditional real estate meets the blockchain revolution.\n\nThe property marketplace enables users to invest fractionally in hotels, vacation homes, and luxury villas. Digitizing these properties into NFTs and fractionalizing them allows users to purchase smaller amounts, with NFT prices tied to the property\u2019s value. The ecosystem, including a marketplace, launchpad, rewards club, and lending platform, positions Everlodge as a comprehensive solution for blockchain-based real estate investments.\n\nHolders of $ELDG token, Everlodge\u2019s native asset, enjoy various benefits, from discounts on property purchases to using ELDG as a payment currency within the Everlodge ecosystem. Moreso, rewards, staking opportunities, and a dynamic pricing model attributed to the token further enhance its attractiveness amongst prospective investors.\n\nLooking ahead, Everlodge\u2019s future price forecast appears promising. With a presale stage anticipating a 280% rise and a projected 30x rally on launch day, coupled with strategic partnerships in the global real estate and hospitality sectors, Everlodge aims to redefine property ownership in the crypto space.\n\nWith the current bullish momentum and promising developments within the Everlodge ecosystem, $ELDG which is currently selling for $0.029, is well-positioned for exponential growth. Ultimately, Everlodge, alongside standout cryptos like Ethereum and Fantom, are an ideal option for investors eyeing good cryptos to buy.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This suggests that the market may see additional growth.\n\nAnalysts cite metrics such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in the candle of profits, suggesting so far that this market is not yet overheated like it did in 2023. This indicates possible further upwards moves.\n\nPrices could also be buoyed by the next Bitcoin halving, due in April 2024 when the block reward will shrink to half. Coinbase Research, however, remains careful to point out that the link between halvings and price rises is still not completely made.\n\nBitcoin price performance since cycle low/ Source: Coinbase Research\n\nThe upcoming Cancun upgrade for Ethereum, scheduled to enhance scalability and security features in its protocols could also result in an increased transaction volume leading potentially to an increased ETH price.\n\nOverall, Coinbase\u2019s research indicates that the current crypto market cycle appears to be on track with this 2018-2022 cycle followed by potential upside before reaching its peak."

        "content": "On Friday, Ethereum's market experienced an initial dip, reflecting the ongoing volatility pervasive across the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nDespite this turbulence, the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average has played a pivotal role in providing the necessary support to reverse the pullback, at least so far.. Notably, the $2100 price level stands out as a critical focal point for market participants.\n\nThis level holds significance not only due to its historical role as a resistance barrier but also because it aligns with the 50-Day EMA, thereby reinforcing its importance within the market's collective memory.\n\nExamining the candlestick pattern, it bears resemblance to a hammer, indicating a recurring phenomenon where a substantial number of buyers surface whenever prices experience a downturn. Immediate resistance levels are discernible around the $2400 mark, followed by the psychologically significant milestone of $2500, which is anticipated to attract significant attention.\n\nPay close attention to the movements in Bitcoin\n\nThe movements in the Bitcoin market warrant close attention, as Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum included. It appears that traders are still placing their bets on the possibility of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund, with the expectation that Bitcoin's performance will influence the trajectory of the entire crypto market. Ethereum enjoys a unique advantage as it serves as a foundational element for numerous smaller crypto projects. Consequently, Ethereum stands to gain significantly as long as the broader cryptocurrency sector maintains its vitality, given its high utility within this ecosystem.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's market continues to be characterized by noise and fluctuations. However, there remains a resilient pool of buyers, ready to seize opportunities presented by lower prices. Shorting Ethereum does not appear to be a prudent strategy in the near term. Nevertheless, it is essential to remain vigilant, particularly in the event that Ethereum's price falls below the $1900 level, as such a development may necessitate a reevaluation of what to do with crypto in general as we will continue to see a lot of noisy movement. I think this year is going to be difficult to hang onto, but it\u2019s also worth noting that the momentum is most certainly to the outside and that\u2019s probably the most important thing when it comes to crypto as it is momentum driven market.\n\nReady to trade our ETH/USD forecast? We\u2019ve made a list of the best Forex crypto brokers worth trading with."

Earlier, they focused on conducting crypto scams via EVM chains. However, the trend has changed after they expanded their reach into well-established crypto groups.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Scam: Trading Platform Coinspaid Might be the Latest Victim\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverview of Wallet Drainers\u2019 Airdrop Scam\n\nAccording to a post by Scam Sniffer on X, phishing scams have been initiated by attracting crypto enthusiasts via fake airdrops. They have designed a webpage wherein one can claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThe scammers term the airdrop scam as an \u201cexclusive opportunity\u201d for the community. Moreover, they encourage people to connect their primary wallet to be able to access these airdrops. In addition, Scam Sniffer noted that these fraudsters can drain various types of crypto wallets via this webpage.\n\nThis update is an alarming one considering the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, Solana, and Tron. It could instill crypto investors into believing such wallet drainers in anticipation of high-end crypto rewards. Thereby, millions and billions of digital asset investments could be wiped off owing to such wallet drainer scams.\n\nHowever, it is possible to identify such scams via a few checks. The snapshot shared by Scam Sniffer shows that the concerned airdrop scam webpage has grammatical errors, which could be a way to be safe from such fraudsters. But, they can upgrade their strategies from time to time.\n\nHence, it\u2019s always better to check the source of such links. If a trusted entity isn\u2019t posting such airdrop updates, then avoid such offerings completely. Moreover, it\u2019s time to be even more cautious since hackers have been hacking reputed companies\u2019 X (formerly Twitter) accounts to promote crypto scams.\n\nCertik and Mandiant Official X Accounts Get Hacked\n\nEarlier this month, Certik, a blockchain audit firm, witnessed its X account being hacked. Thereafter, malicious links were posted that promised people to return the digital assets they lost to various crypto scams. The dubious link was available on their website for quite sometime before the Certik team managed to regain access.\n\nThe X account of Mandiant, a cybersecurity company, was successfully reclaimed by its rightful owner on January 4, 2024, after falling victim to hacking. The incident unfolded over several hours on X, with users presenting evidence of the account takeover. The attackers, posing as the Phantom, a non-custodial crypto wallet, used the compromised Mandiant X account to promote a cryptocurrency scam.\n\nAlso Read: Just In: Founder of ACE Crypto Exchange Arrested for Fraud"

        "title": "What is VeChain, and how does it work? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The fundamental traits of blockchain technology, including decentralization, immutability, transparency and automation, have proven to be capable of several use cases for different businesses. However, due to the costs of creating and maintaining blockchain-powered applications, it can be difficult and expensive for enterprises to fully utilize its benefits.\n\nWith the adoption of distributed ledgers, many projects have made efforts to lower the barriers to entry. VeChain is one such blockchain platform built to improve the widespread use of blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the most significant issues facing supply chain organizations is a lack of transparency, which blockchain aims to resolve by enabling businesses to conduct transactions directly and without a third party. It also allows data sharing between stakeholders and supports increased integration of financial and logistical services.\n\nThis article will discuss what the VeChain public blockchain is, the unique features of VeChain, how VeChain (VET) works, how to buy VeChain and how VeChain staking works.\n\nWhat is VeChain?\n\nThe public blockchain called VeChainThor is intended for widespread use of blockchain technology by companies of all sizes, acting as the building block for a resilient and expandable enterprise blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAccording to VeChain, Ethereum remains unsuitable for running large-scale commercial decentralized applications (DApps) while being a significant technological milestone. This is because Ethereum does not have a robust governance framework to allow for quick and transparent protocol changes to address emerging issues or breakthroughs.\n\nAlso, an appropriate economic model is absent in the Ethereum blockchain, restricting businesses from operating their DApps at a controllable and predictable cost. In addition, given how volatile the price of Ether (ETH) is, companies may not forecast future ETH prices or the expense of maintaining an Ethereum-based decentralized application for a specific time. So, what makes VeChain unique?\n\nThe VeChainThor blockchain hopes to address the above issues using meta-transaction features, a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus method, an on-chain governance mechanism and a unique two-token system.\n\nVeChain meta-transaction features\n\nFor enterprise adoption, VeChain\u2019s meta-transaction features, as discussed below, help make the development user-friendly:\n\nMulti-party payment: A decentralized application\u2019s freemium model is enabled by flexible transaction fee delegation schemes to onboard users smoothly. With VeChain\u2019s innovative fee delegation protocol, an enterprise can have a smart contract and designated gas account to manage the gas fees necessary to use the network.\n\nControllable transaction lifecycle: Users can set the time when a transaction is executed or expires if it is not included in a block using the Expiration and BlockRef transaction fields.\n\nMulti-task transaction: Developers can batch payments, include many calls to various contract functions in a single transaction and control the order of the calls using multi-function atomic transactions.\n\nTransaction dependency: Users can set dependencies to stop transactions from being executed until the relevant transaction has been processed, ensuring that the execution order satisfies the business need.\n\nVeChain POA consensus mechanism\n\nVeChain\u2019s PoA consensus mechanism has evolved from PoA 1.0 to PoA 2.0. The original PoA 1.0, implemented at the launch of the VeChainThor blockchain in 2018, relied on Authority Masternodes for block validation, offering efficiency and low energy consumption but facing scalability and financial limitations.\n\nPoA 2.0, introduced in 2022, enhanced the system by improving scalability, security and data finality. It addressed the challenges of PoA 1.0 and aimed to offer a more robust consensus mechanism, reflecting VeChain\u2019s commitment to continuous technological evolution.\n\nVeChain governance\n\nThe community-elected Steering Committee, elected by stakeholders, is responsible for strategic decision-making and overseeing VeChain improvement proposals (VIPs). The key benefits of such a system include lower organizational and technical development uncertainty due to role-based voting.\n\nAdditionally, VeChain\u2019s model includes community engagement through tokenholder voting, allowing broader participation in key governance decisions.\n\nVeChain dual token economy\n\nThe VeChain ecosystem comprises two tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). VET is the primary token for carrying value, or \u201csmart money,\u201d within the ecosystem, enabling investment, transactional activities and stakeholder voting. VTHO, on the other hand, is used as the energy or \u201cgas\u201d to power transactions and smart contracts on the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVTHO is generated by holding VET, and it provides a mechanism to decouple the cost of using the blockchain from the market price of VET, thereby stabilizing transaction costs and facilitating efficient resource allocation within the ecosystem.\n\nHow does VeChain work?\n\nLet\u2019s understand the workings of VeChain using supply chain management as an example:\n\nUnique identification creation\n\nA unique identification number is given to each product or batch. This might be a near-field communication (NFC) chip, a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag or a quick response (QR) code. This identifier is essential for monitoring the product\u2019s progress along the supply chain.\n\nData capture and recording\n\nRelevant data is recorded at every stage of the supply chain, including manufacturing process details, batch numbers, expiration dates, storage circumstances, transit information and other facts. After that, this information is stored on the VeChain blockchain.\n\nBlockchain entry\n\nThe captured data is stored on the VeChain blockchain. Every record is time-stamped and connected to the one before it, forming an unchangeable and transparent chain of records.\n\nSmart contracts activation\n\nOn the blockchain, smart contracts are pre-written agreements that take effect automatically if specific requirements are met. In the supply chain, this could mean releasing payments, notifying stakeholders when a product reaches a particular location or automatically updating the status of a product.\n\nReal-time tracking and verification\n\nReal-time tracking and verification are possible for all parties involved in the supply chain, including customers, distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and retailers. They can confirm the product\u2019s background and other information by accessing the blockchain.\n\nEnd-user interaction\n\nTo confirm a product\u2019s legitimacy, provenance and other pertinent information, end users can engage with its blockchain record, even by using a smartphone app. This promotes consumer confidence and product authenticity.\n\nContinuous updates and audits\n\nThe product\u2019s record on the VeChain blockchain is updated continuously as it progresses through its lifecycle. Due to this ongoing process, the data is updated and auditable for compliance, quality assurance and other uses.\n\nIn VeChain\u2019s supply chain management, Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are crucial for verifying the identity of businesses and stakeholders, ensuring that only legitimate entities participate in the network.\n\nVarious nodes (such as Authority Masternodes and Economic Nodes) on the blockchain record transactions within this ecosystem. This system maintains the integrity and transparency of the supply chain data, with smart contracts automating key processes like confirming deliveries or payments, ensuring efficient and secure transactions without intermediaries.\n\nBut, is the VeChain network secure? VeChain works with a number of security companies, including Hosho, SecureWare, SlowMist and HackenProof, to find potential vulnerabilities and proactively prevent cyber threats.\n\nWhat is the VeChain ToolChain?\n\nVeChain ToolChain is the key product offered by the VeChainThor blockchain platform. Designed for accessibility, the ToolChain caters to businesses of all sizes, enabling them to implement blockchain technology effortlessly, with applications ranging from product lifecycle management to carbon credit solutions and environmental sustainability reporting.\n\nVeChain ToolChain provides platform-as-a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS) and blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) to create new strategies for generating value for various stakeholders, promote transparency, and offer insights into product life cycles.\n\nFor instance, VeChain\u2019s low-code deployment PaaS allows customers to design process templates and use the built-in tools to avoid creating their own blockchain applications from scratch. In addition, its Food Safety Track & Trace SaaS offers the food and beverage industry a range of easily deployable traceability features, such as quality certificates, to communicate and reliably increase brand recognition.\n\nThrough BaaS, VeChain offers a restful API for standardized smart contract services. Two computer systems use the restful API, an application programming interface, to exchange information safely over the internet.\n\nHistory of VeChain: Who is behind VeChain?\n\nSunny Lu, former chief information officer of Louis Vuitton China, and Changpeng Zhao, Chinese-Canadian founder and ex-CEO of Binance, founded VeChain in 2015 as a subsidiary of Bitse, an organization that provides blockchain-powered solutions. The VEN token once operated on the Ethereum platform, but in 2018, VeChain switched to its own blockchain and rebranded itself as the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVET, the main token, has a fixed max supply, with a portion in circulation and the rest allocated for enterprise investors, the team and ongoing development. VeChain implements a VTHO burning mechanism to maintain equilibrium, where a portion of VTHO used in transactions is destroyed, balancing the supply-and-demand dynamics and ensuring the stability of transaction costs.\n\nVeChainThor is used in various industries, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals and automobiles, to improve supply chains\u2019 effectiveness, transparency and affordability. Utilizing RFID sensors, the blockchain tracks goods along the supply chain to guarantee proper handling and authenticity. This adoption by several Fortune 500 companies, including BMW, Walmart, LVMH, Deloitte, Renault and PricewaterhouseCoopers, reflects its real-world application and effectiveness\u200b.\n\nRelated: How blockchain technology is used in supply chain management\n\nHow to buy VeChain (VET)\n\nDepending on your jurisdiction, choose a crypto exchange that supports VeChain (VET) cryptocurrency and download a wallet to store your tokens. Alternatively, storing your tokens in the exchange wallet is an option; however, it comes with the risk of \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nVeChain has also developed the VeChainThor Wallet specifically for its own cryptocurrency, which is compatible with both Android and iOS. However, VeChain tokens are incompatible with wallets like MetaMask since VET and VTHO are not based on the Ethereum blockchain. The final step is to purchase VET tokens for the amount you desire and transfer them to the wallet of your choice for safekeeping.\n\nTo buy VeChain (VET) on Coinbase, the key steps include the following:\n\nAccount creation: The individual should download the Coinbase app and initiate the sign-up process, providing a valid ID and, if required, proof of address. The ID verification process may vary in duration depending on the user\u2019s location.\n\nAdd a payment method: The user needs to add a payment method by selecting the payment method box in the app. Available options include linking a bank account, using a debit card or initiating a wire transfer.\n\nInitiating a trade: On the Coinbase website, the user should select \u201cBuy and Sell.\u201d The mobile app achieves this by tapping the \u201c( + ) Buy\u201d option on the \u201cHome\u201d tab.\n\nSelecting VeChain: To choose VET, the user should use the \u201cBuy\u201d panel on the website or the search bar in the app to find and choose VeChain.\n\nEntering purchase amount: The individual must input the desired expenditure in their local currency. The app automatically calculates the equivalent amount in VeChain.\n\nFinalizing the purchase: The user can review the details by tapping \u201cPreview buy.\u201d They confirm the transaction by clicking \u201cBuy Now\u201d if all is satisfactory.\n\nConfirmation: After the order is processed, a confirmation screen appears, indicating the successful purchase of VET.\n\nApart from buying VET, can you make passive income with VeChain? Typically, users must first buy other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and then trade their BTC for VET after locating a wallet or exchange that supports VeChain staking. There aren\u2019t any staking pools where one can combine VET investments to earn more VTHO, unlike other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated: How to earn passive crypto income with Bitcoin\n\nDoes VeChain have NFTs\n\nAlong with VeChain\u2019s use cases in the supply chain, its nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystem is also thriving. For creating and trading VIP-181 tokens that are kept on the VeChain blockchain, there is a decentralized NFT marketplace called VeSea. The VeChain Foundation introduced the VIP-181 Standard, which enables fundamental functionality for tokens within smart contracts.\n\nNFT marketplaces: VeSea and World of V\n\nVeSea is a decentralized NFT marketplace on the VeChain blockchain where users can buy, sell and discover VeChain NFT collections, including VeKings, Veysarum and others. Users require a VeChain-compatible wallet to interact with NFTs on VeSea. VeChain Sync2 and VeChainThor Wallet are among the compatible wallets.\n\nWorld of V is another VeChain NFT marketplace that is compatible with the Sync2 wallet. This platform facilitates the creation and collection of NFTs with no gas fees. It supports the minting of new NFT projects and allows NFT owners to stake their NFTs in the creator ecosystem.\n\nNFT collections: VeKings and Paper Project\n\nThe VeKings collection initially consisted of 9,999 artworks of vikings and valkyries issued by the creators of the VeSea NFT marketplace. This collection has undergone periodic burn events, reducing the total supply. As per VeChainstats.com, there are 6,866 NFTs in circulation, with 3,133 NFTs burned.\n\nThe Paper Project Alpha Collection is an interactive work by Emmet Ahlstrom, an artist residing in Southern California. This collection consists of 11,880 individually generated NFTs.\n\nWhat is the VeUSD stablecoin?\n\nStablecoin VeUSD was created on the VeChainThor blockchain with the goal of offering a stable digital currency choice for users within the VeChain network. Announced on Jan. 5, 2022, VeUSD is pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar, ensuring its value remains stable against the fiat currency. This peg is maintained through equivalent reserves of U.S. dollars, which back the stablecoin.\n\nVeUSD was officially launched for public minting on March 14, 2022, marking a significant development in the VeChain platform. It seeks to provide the advantages of cryptocurrencies, such as digital speed, ease of use and security while avoiding their notorious volatility.\n\nVeUSD enhances the utility and scalability of the VeChain network by being utilized for various transactions inside the VeChain ecosystem, such as payments and remittances, and serving as a reliable medium of exchange for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.\n\nIs VeChain (VET) a good investment?\n\nVeChain aims to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain technology by addressing issues such as the high cost of maintaining an Ethereum-based DApp. Despite VeChain\u2019s use cases in supply chain management and other industries, investment choice depends upon one\u2019s financial objectives and risk-return profile.\n\nThat said, investing in a cryptocurrency in which you feel you need more confidence can be risky, and you may lose your hard-earned money. Therefore, determine your asset-allocation decisions based on your expectations for returns on your investment.\n\nThe future of VeChain\n\nVeChain is a layer-1 smart contract platform that allows developers to create unique smart contracts and DApps on top of it. Its applications in logistics, supply chain management and other industries help businesses enhance their operations. However, from an investment perspective, one must always weigh the pros and cons before making portfolio allocations.\n\nAs the future is uncertain, the same goes for VeChain; it cannot be predicted if VeChain will become the new Ethereum. Whatever the case, it will be exciting to see how VeChain will compete with its rivals and offer distinct solutions to achieve a competitive edge."

        "content": "THE FALL FROM GRACE of Sam Bankman-Fried, who once lorded over the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, FTX meant that the buzz around cryptocurrencies and tokens would fizzle out as Bankman-Fried faced charges of embezzlement of over $8 billion of client funds. But numbers tells a different story. Thus far in 2023, cryptocurrencies have seen a major uptick, largely Bitcoin, which is up 163% YTD (December 9) at $43,519, on the back of the upcoming SEC approval for the first Bitcoin spot ETF, opening up the near $40 trillion retirement fund market to the crypto asset class, possible rate cuts in 2024 and the impending halving that will reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins enter into circulation. Ethereum saw two declines in value during August and September, dipping to a low of $1,540 on September 11. It has since seen a rebound to $2,266. The two currencies continue to corner a chunk of the overall crypto market cap at $851 billion and $272 billion, respectively. Back home, with the introduction of 30% tax along with 1% TDS on crypto investment, the government has delivered a body blow to the frenzy that Indians had shown towards digital currencies. With the Prevention of Money Laundering Act coming into play as well, the crypto story for Indian investors is as good as over. The interest shown by HNIs, too, has waned with most wealth managers not officially advocating cryptos, and instead encouraging Indians to invest in U.S. equities."

        "title": "Solana (SOL) Could Be Poised For 50x Surge in 2024, Here's Why - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Amid what has been a rather volatile start to the year for digital assets across the board, one analyst has projected that Solana (SOL) could be prepping a 50x surge in 2024. Indeed, the often labeled \u201cEthereum killer\u201d could be following the same trajectory that led ETH to earn 50x returns in 2018.\n\nThe asset saw a positive end to 2023 and could be preparing to go on an extended rally. Moreover, many have observed the potential for the asset to even surpass Ethereum. Especially if it can mirror the bull run that propelled ETH. Still, some obstacles may hinder an eventual rally; let\u2019s explore more of what those could be.\n\nSource: Observatorio Blockchain\n\nAlso Read: Solana: Will SOL Reclaim its All-Time High of $259 in 2024?\n\nSolana Could Mirror Ethereum 2018 Run to REach 50x Gains in 2024\n\nThe optimism for Solana has been immensely high as we are just one week into the new year. Along with the overall crypto market, there are high expectations on how several assets could perform throughout the year. Moreover, one analyst has pointed to the Ethereum killer for its immense potential.\n\nIndeed, analyst Raoul Pal believes that Solana (SOL) could be poised for a 50x surge in 2024. Moreover, he notes that the asset could parallel the 2018 surge that propelled Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum to new heights. Additionally, traders are preparing for renewed funds to enter into the ecosystem as the year progresses.\n\nAlso Read: Solana Holds Steady Above $100; Will SOL Hit $130 Soon?\n\n\u201cSo I just flip up the chart of ETH in 2018, and then put it against the chart of Solana,\u201d Pal said. \u201cThey are pretty much identical. ETH did 47x from that low.\u201d Subsequently, Solana could begin to flourish as an Ethereum alternative. Its closed system, passionate community, and lower gas fees have already created stiff competition between the two.\n\nConversely, some believe inflation of the SOL token could hinder any sort of rally. When SOL reached its previous all-time high in 2021, it had a market cap of more than $75 billion. Now, it would require a market cap of $111 billion in order to reach a new all-time high above $260. Although not impossible, it certainly begins to hinder expectations for the asset ceiling throughout 2024."

        "content": "Veno Finance Spearheads Liquid Staking on zkSync Era with Ethereum Integration\n\nVeno Finance has announced its integration with the zkSync Era blockchain, offering Ethereum users new liquid staking solutions and yield farming opportunities within its DeFi ecosystem.\n\nVeno Finance Expands to zkSync Era\n\nLeading liquid staking protocol Veno Finance has extended its reach to zkSync Era, a Layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. By allowing users to stake their ETH and receive Liquid ETH (LETH) tokens, Veno opens up a world of yield farming possibilities on the zkSync platform. This strategic move leverages the simplified staking processes of Veno, facilitating a bridge between zkSync Era and the Ethereum mainnet, and automating staking and withdrawal of ETH for users.\n\nLETH Tokens and Yield Farming\n\nThrough the Veno protocol, users staking ETH on zkSync Era are rewarded with LETH tokens, which can be used to earn additional yields across DeFi protocols. This not only incentivizes participation but also serves as a testament to Veno\u2019s commitment to enhancing the utility and liquidity of staked assets.\n\nIntroducing VNO Token and Incentive Mechanisms\n\nIn a bid to further incentivize liquidity providers, Veno plans to introduce its native VNO token on the zkSync Era blockchain. VNO holders will have the opportunity to engage in various liquidity-providing activities, such as locking VNO in the Fountain to earn more VNO or in the Reservoir to receive Real Yield rewards in ETH.\n\nNFT Receipts: A Novel Feature\n\nA standout feature of Veno\u2019s service is the issuance of NFT receipts upon LETH withdrawal, allowing users immediate access to the value of their unstaked assets. These NFTs serve as proof of withdrawal and can be utilized within the Cronos and zkSync Era ecosystems, offering additional liquidity options during the waiting period for staked ETH.\n\nVeno\u2019s First-Mover Advantage on zkSync Era\n\nBy becoming the first Ethereum liquid staking protocol on zkSync Era to support native staking and withdrawals, Veno has secured a significant first-mover advantage. This is underscored by Veno\u2019s impressive growth metrics, with a doubling of its total value locked (TVL) in the past three months and a tenfold increase in unique stakers over the past year.\n\nRecent Milestones and Expansion\n\nVeno\u2019s expansion onto zkSync Era follows the successful launch of its Veno Gardens platform and other key developments, including being the first to enable ATOM staking on Cronos and the introduction of a CRO Liquidity Strategy to optimize rewards for users.\n\nAbout Veno Finance and zkSync Era\n\nVeno Finance, a liquid staking protocol incubated by Cronos Labs, offers staking solutions across multiple chains. Its receipt token system, designed to maximize composability, underscores Veno\u2019s commitment to innovation and user-friendly DeFi services. zkSync Era, leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, has emerged as a robust Layer-2 scaling solution, reducing transaction fees and enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nThe Future of Veno Finance and zkSync Era\n\nAs Veno Finance continues to grow and evolve, its integration with zkSync Era represents a significant advancement in liquid staking and DeFi. The collaboration between Veno Finance and zkSync Era exemplifies the potential for innovative solutions to enhance the Ethereum network\u2019s functionality, providing users with more efficient, cost-effective ways to stake and utilize their digital assets. With a focus on cost savings, enterprise-grade node infrastructure, and an insurance module to secure funds, Veno Finance is well-positioned to drive forward the mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies."

        "title": "Top Picks for Massive Gains in January \u2013 Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Pullix (PLX) - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nAlthough the year is just starting, crypto traders and investors are already searching for the best crypto to buy. Unfortunately, there are so many projects to pick from. This article has highlighted three top coins and why they are a good pick. They are Shiba Inu, Ethereum, and Pullix.\n\nCan Shiba Inu (SHIB) Token Burn Increase Price in January?\n\nThe Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is still burning Shiba Inu coins in 2024. On January 5th, they burned 5,203,527 SHIB, which increased the burn rate by 2,274.64%.\n\nOn January 1st, 2024, there was another big increase in the burn rate. It increased by 2,555%, with a massive 129,716,497 SHIB being burned. Regretfully, despite the rise in token burn, the price of Shiba Inu remains stagnant.\n\nHowever, the SHIB community thinks the team's automated token burn mechanism will accelerate the burn pace. If this happens, there may be fewer Shiba Inu coins, which would lead to scarcity. There are two potential price points: $0.00001893 and $0.00002091.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing bullish signs as it tries to bounce back from its recent fall. Both on-chain data and technical indicators are backing up this positive view for the ERC20 coin. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are rising.\n\nAdditionally, Santiment data shows that whale accumulation has increased as they buy the dip. Ethereum's price is now trading at $2,200 in the meanwhile. This occurs subsequent to the altcoin's price decline from the $2400 range.\n\nAnalysts and investors are still optimistic about the coin. Additionally, the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator from IntoTheBlock indicates that Ethereum faces little to no resistance going forward. The resistance level of $2,347 is not very strong. Therefore, if it crosses it, the price of Ethereum might rise to $2,400, $2,562, $2,652, and $2,859 if the momentum picks up.\n\nPullix (PLX) To Give 100x Gains After Its January Launch\n\nJust like Shiba Inu and Ethereum, Pullix (PLX) is also gearing up for a price surge this month. Recently, the token soared to $0.08. Currently, bulls are aiming for more gains. Let us dive into some features that make Pullix a worthy coin for gains this January.\n\nPullix combines the best parts of decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX), giving users a full trading experience. Pullix is notable for its wide variety of assets you can trade. This includes digital currencies, stocks, forex, ETFs and commodities. This makes it simple for people to get into different financial markets all in one platform.\n\nPLX is an essential component of Pullix. It's an ERC20 coin that's crucial to everything in the Pullix ecosystem. Pullix offers a \"Trade-to-Earn\" system that is made possible with PLX. The more you trade on the platform, the bigger your gains from the platform's profit share.\n\nPullix also provides a solution for copy trading that employs artificial intelligence. Pullix is incorporating artificial intelligence to assist traders in replicating the moves of seasoned specialists. This is a bonus because they've had a lot of successful transactions, which can help you make better deals and earn more money.\n\nPullix's PLX is now available on presale, and the exchange becomes available in January. PLX is currently valued at $0.08. However, the exchange gives it the potential to become one of the best crypto to buy in 2024 with analysts tipping the presale gem to 100x upon launch.\n\nConclusion\n\nBecause of its connection to the global market, Pullix is one of the best altcoins you can invest in this January. Another good option is Ethereum. However, With Pullix looking to launch this month, experts think the token will grow 100x after they release the exchange.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "How Ethereum\u2019s Prague upgrade could fuel ETH price growth in 2024\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency and the leading platform for decentralized applications is gearing up for a major upgrade that could boost its performance and functionality. The upgrade, known as Prague or Pectra, is expected to roll out across several testnets in early 2024, before going live on the main network.\n\nIntro of Ethereum: Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology.

As of January 3, 2024, the price of ETH was US$2,360.78 per ETH.\n\nLatest News of Ethereum: The article is about the Prague upgrade, a major update for Ethereum that will improve its performance and functionality. The upgrade will include precompiles, a new EVM format, and smart contract changes. The article also discusses the testnet schedule, the Verkle tree debate, and the implications for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPrice prediction of Ethereum: According to your Ethereum price prediction, the value of ETH might rise by +5% to US$ 3,139.55 by 2030. The current sentiment is quite positive, according to the consensus rating.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Soar As Low-Fee ETF Competition Heats Up: Analyst Says 'Upcoming Bull Cycle I - Benzinga",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies spiked on Monday evening amid growing anticipation for the approval of a spot-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +6.45% $46,527 Ethereum ETH/USD +4.71% $2,309 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +2.28% $0.079\n\nWhat Happened: The rally occurred as investors eagerly await a regulatory decision for the first spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., expected sometime this week.\n\nMost market observers anticipate approval, with bulls predicting that these funds would significantly broaden the investor base for the asset and attract substantial inflows.\n\nToday, major asset management companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale submitted updated S-1 filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Multiple issuers also disclosed the fees they would charge investors.\n\n\n\nTwo days before the SEC is expected to approve one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs, all potential issuers have disclosed a crucial detail about their product: the fee, and they vary significantly.\n\n\n\nAmong the 13 proposed ETFs awaiting SEC approval or rejection, the fee they charge is a key factor in setting them apart from one another. Lower fees, calculated as a percentage of the fund\u2019s assets, mean more returns for investors.\n\nBitwise, a crypto native fund manager, stands out by charging the lowest fee at 0.24% after a 6-month period of no fees. However, some of its rivals are not far behind. Ark and 21Shares plan to charge 0.25%, while VanEck and Franklin list their fees at 0.25% and 0.29% respectively.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has set its fee at 0.30%, which is lower than what some experts had anticipated, considering its size and reputation could have allowed it to charge more and still remain highly competitive in popularity.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Astar ASTR/USD +26.85% $0.14 Bitcoin SV BSV/USD +22.41% $90.08 Stacks STX/USD +21.26% $1.97\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion, showing a slight decline of 1.71% in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, major stock averages showed an increase, mainly driven by the performance of technology shares, as Wall Street aimed to bounce back from a challenging week. The S&P 500 concluded with a 1.41% gain, closing at 4,763.54, while the Nasdaq Composite surged by 2.2%, ending the day at 14,843.77, marking the tech-heavy index\u2019s most substantial one-day gain since Nov. 14.\n\nThis week, traders are anticipating increased clarity regarding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The release of the December consumer price index on Thursday and the producer price index on Friday will provide crucial insights into whether the central bank\u2019s efforts to stabilize inflation at its 2% target are yielding results.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe said that a Bitcoin Spot ETF is on the horizon for approval, \"which is true legitimacy for an asset created out of the Financial Crisis of 2008 only existing for 15 years. The upcoming bull cycle is likely going to be glorious.\"\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Carl from the Moon said \"If the ETF is denied on Wednesday then that would be the biggest manipulation\" of Bitcoin so far.\n\nAccording to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, regardless of the outcome of the Bitcoin ETF, we can look forward to another bullish trend this year: The BTC Halving. \"It has historically been a catalyst for major price surges.\"\n\nPhoto by Igor Faun on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nStory Highlights Solana is often seen as a competitor to Ethereum, and recently even surpassed Ethereum's 7-day transfer volume.\n\nSolana's developers are working hard to make it more user-friendly and accessible to the mainstream.\n\nSolana sees a bullish flag pattern forming on the SOL/USD chart, and suggests that a break above the $110 could trigger a rally.\n\nSolana (SOL), a rapidly advancing layer one (L1) blockchain, has been gaining traction in the crypto landscape, boasting a Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing $138 billion. Currently valued at approximately $57 billion, Solana has piqued the interest of institutional investors looking to broaden their crypto horizons beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nSolana\u2019s core developers are not resting on their laurels. They are diligently constructing the necessary infrastructure to propel the web3 industry into mainstream acceptance.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is preparing for a competitive 2024, with leading market players like Ethereum expected to grow significantly. However, emerging disruptors like Retik Finance have key advantages that could accelerate this year\u2019s expansion. With unique offerings and a focus on user adoption, Retik seems ready to challenge the establishment.\n\nEthereum Primed for a Price Surge\n\nEthereum had a relatively quiet 2023, focused largely on infrastructure upgrades like the Shanghai fork, which bolstered network security. While less flashy than the monumental 2022 merge, these essential improvements have set the stage for Ethereum\u2019s price to skyrocket in 2024.Analysts predict two key drivers will fuel an Ethereum price surge this year. First, the upcoming Protodanksharding upgrade, expected to launch in mid-2024, will drastically reduce transaction fees and improve network capacity. This will likely attract swaths of new dApps and users to the chain.Second, macrotrends like rising institutional adoption spell good news for Ethereum. As more mainstream companies and investors enter crypto, Ethereum remains the go-to hub for tokenized assets and smart contracts. With the regulatory landscape clarifying in 2023, 2024 could see billions in institutional capital flow into ETH.Technical data suggests an ETH rally, with the $2500 cycle high set for July 2023 as the key resistance level. JPMorgan recently predicted momentum with $5,300 as the price target. If liquidity in 2024 rises as expected, Ethereum seems ready to achieve new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nThe Underdog Challenger \u2013 Retik Finance\n\nWhile Ethereum works to strengthen its blockchain, newer competitors like Retik Finance have certain advantages that could drive even faster growth in 2024.Retik Finance\u2019s star feature is its decentralized debit card, which enables crypto and fiat transactions without requiring KYC. Users can seamlessly spend crypto on real-world purchases while earning cashback rewards. The cards also provide worldwide ATM access, allowing holders to withdraw cash anywhere using crypto. This expands the real-world utility of digital assets.Retik\u2019s non-custodial wallet links directly to the DeFi debit card for streamlined accessibility. The wallet provides users with security-focused storage for crypto assets while also integrating advanced DeFi activities like swapping, lending, and derivatives trading. By combining exchange-like functionality with everyday payment utility on one platform, Retik enhances mainstream adoption.To embed crypto further into daily business, Retik Pay enables online merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments without hassle. Features like instant settlements, a user-friendly UI and protection against chargebacks make implementation frictionless for merchants while enhancing the customer experience.Importantly, Retik\u2019s relatively low market cap offers more room for explosive expansion compared to Ethereum\u2019s $200 billion cap. The project also has no VC backers, avoiding potential price manipulation by crypto whales.Retik\u2019s community-focused ethos has already attracted 27,000+ Telegram members and over $6 million in organic presale funding. With influencers praising the project, Retik seems poised to become a top 100 crypto asset based on community momentum alone.If the team meets its aggressive roadmap goals, like launching card staking rewards and adding cross-chain interoperability this year, 10-50x price multiples for the RETIK token in 2024 seem highly achievable.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nIn an ideal world, Ethereum and Retik Finance can thrive this year without being viewed as direct competitors. However, Retik\u2019s laser focus on retail user adoption gives it an edge in potential growth as everyday consumers finally flood into crypto. For speculative crypto enthusiasts and new adopters, Retik Finance checks all the boxes for a moonshot gainer in 2024.As Ethereum continues its slow and steady development, it\u2019s time for the crypto wild west\u2019s next breakout star to take centre stage. All aboard the Retik train before it leaves the station!\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

His comment suggests that this evidence could have far-reaching consequences as it will expose \u201ccriminals on a magnitude that is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nNerayoff Promises To Expose Criminals Posed As Altruists\n\nNerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he was soon going to unveil \u201cdata\u201d that unmasks certain criminals that are currently posing as \u201caltruists.\u201d He noted that he had made good on his earlier promise of the recording. As such, the crypto community can also be certain that he will make good on this one, too.\n\nIt is uncertain who these \u201caltruists\u201d might be. However, Nerayoff could be alluding to Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin, as he had earlier remarked that the duo were \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d as \u201ccrypto saviors.\u201d Meanwhile, Nerayoff, who was an active participant during Ethereum\u2019s ICO, made further claims against the ETH ecosystem.\n\nA \u201cfew players\u201d are allegedly said to control the vast majority of Ether. The Ethereum insider alleged that these same persons have significant control of other cryptocurrencies, including the \u201cmajority of rug pulls, fraudulent ICOs and exploits.\u201d Nerayoff also hinted that everything might not be as it seems as he says that \u201cthe whole game is rigged and controlled by these few.\u201d\n\nA former Ethereum core developer, Lane Rettig, had previously backed some of Nerayoff\u2019s claims as he said that 70% of pre-mined ETH was immediately distributed. Then, Rettig seemed to be suggesting that a majority of the distributed ETH went to Etthereum\u2019s founders or those closely associated with them.\n\nMeanwhile, Nerayoff highlighted the fact that none of Ethereum\u2019s founders or close associates have come out to refute his allegations. He suggested that they have chosen to remain silent because everything he has said so far is true.\n\nNerayoff Comes For Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin\n\nThe Ethereum insider wasn\u2019t done as he took a swipe at co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He labeled him as a \u201cfalse altruist\u201d and accused him of putting up a facade. Nerayoff also said that Buterin makes a lot of calculated financial decisions for someone who says he doesn\u2019t care about the money.\n\nHis comments about Buterin also suggest that the Ethereum co-founder might be one of the criminals that he was referring to in his earlier remarks. Nerayoff even went as far as alleging that Vitalik controls the market.\n\nOne of Nerayoff\u2019s boldest claims to date came in a subsequent post where he accused Vitalik of blowing \u201chalf the Ethereum ICO proceeds betting it all on the price of BTC.\u201d The Ethereum co-founder went on to beg the Chinese government after this was done, Nerayoff claimed."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe recent crypto market downturn has led to various speculations on the future of some cryptos. Some of these tokens, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Stellar (XLM), which all had bullish potential, are now experiencing a bear trend. Meanwhile, Everlodge (ELDG) continues to generate presale momentum. As a result, the token is keenly establishing itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024. More details below.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Attracts Massive Presale Investors Amid Show of High Growth Potential\n\nFollowing an entry into stage 9 of its presale, Everlodge (ELDG) is growing in reputation and growth potential. The Everlodge token which is tipped to achieve over 280% growth before launch, is seeing a massive investment influx. This is due to the innovative model that Everlodgeis implementing to solve luxury property investment issues. A development that has placed the project on investors' list of top cryptos to buy.\n\nEverlodge is a property marketplace that combines blockchain technology to make investing in real estate affordable and safe. To achieve this, Everlodge is creating fractionalized NFTs backed by real-world luxury properties. As such, individuals who buy these NFTs will own a fraction of the luxury assets that the NFTs represent. Records of ownership are kept in smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nThere's a high chance of the ELDG gaining more value and reputation in Q1 of 2024. This is in view of the recent announcement by Everlodge to start staking the $ELDG token soon. Moreover, owners of the ELDG token will easily transact on the Everlodge platform as well as gain rewards and other privileges that come with owning the token. The ELDG token is currently sold for $0.029. Crypto experts have projected a 280% increase in token value in presale and 30x on launch.\n\nSecurity-wise, Everlodge has passed audits from Interfi and Block Audit teams. The liquidity of the token will be locked for 8 years to prevent a rug-pull scenario. Overall, the Everlodge project is proving to be one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Heading for a Positive Turnaround\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing signs of a resurgence after battling the bear trend in the last few days. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ethereum price dropped by 4% in the last few days with the market cap dipping at the same time. Moreso, Ethereum trading volume has also lost about 40% on a day-to-day average since the turn of the year.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum price chart shows that the coin is heading for a resurgence which could push the price up. Crypto experts are projecting a high ROI before the end of the year. Based on Ambcrypto Ethereum price prediction for 2024, the coin will trade at an average price of $3062 before the end of the year. With the speculations of a bull run coming soon, Ethereum's price might hit the target in the year.\n\nBear Trend Sets Tone for Stellar (XLM) in 2024\n\nStellar (XLM) is starting the first week of 2024 with a bearish sentiment. While the Stellar token struggled to maintain a price boost in December, investors hoped the turn of the new year might change the price trajectory. However, that's not the case as Stellar records a 9% loss in price value so far in 2024.\n\nMoreover, Stellar trading volume is declining rapidly. For context, Stellar has lost over 25% in day-to-day average trading volume as shown by data from CoinMarketCap. Experts believe the token may break its bearish form in the next few weeks.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website."

        "title": "Weekly Recap: Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana... The crypto news you shouldn't miss! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jan 2024 \u25aa 10 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nWeek after week, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to surprise and reshape the paradigms of digital finance and technology with ever-renewed boldness and innovation. In our weekly recap, we\u2019re going to explore the most captivating and significant events of the past week. From the enigmatic transfer of Bitcoin to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s wallet, to Solana\u2019s controversial strategy against layer 2 solutions, through the turbulence on the stablecoin market and the heated debates around the upcoming upgrade to Ethereum.\n\n$1.2 Million in Bitcoin Transferred to Satoshi\u2019s Wallet!\n\nAn unidentified individual recently sent $1.2 million in Bitcoin to the Genesis wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the very first wallet created on the Bitcoin network. Though Nakamoto has long since vanished and it\u2019s highly unlikely that they will recover these funds, this mysterious transfer has captivated the crypto community\u2019s attention. The Genesis wallet originally had only the 50 bitcoins mined upon its creation, but over time, other funds have been sent there, and its balance increased to 72 Bitcoins by the end of 2023. With this latest transaction, the current balance is 99.67 bitcoins, valued at approximately $4.3 million.\n\nThe Genesis wallet is the very first wallet created on the Bitcoin network by Satoshi Nakamoto, and although it could theoretically still hold the private keys to access these wallets, it\u2019s very unlikely to do so since no funds from wallets associated with Nakamoto, including those from the Genesis block, have moved since his disappearance in December 2010. While some crypto-enthusiasts see this transfer as a mindless waste of money, others consider it a fitting tribute to the anonymous genius behind the Bitcoin revolution.\n\nSolana: A Strategic Rejection of Layer-2s!\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, has recently made a bold claim that has shaken the crypto ecosystem: Solana does not require layer 2 solutions. This claim goes against the current trend where many blockchains are adopting layer 2 solutions to enhance scalability and performance. According to Yakovenko, Solana is focusing on expanding its global atomic state machine, an approach that would render layer 2s redundant.\n\nSolana isn\u2019t just another blockchain, it aspires to be the architect of a parallel universe. By focusing on global atomic synchronization, Solana seeks to surpass the limitations of current blockchain technologies. Yakovenko envisions a world where Solana\u2019s unique virtual machine is self-sufficient without the need for external solutions. With hardware upgrades on the horizon, the platform is preparing for a future where it might, possibly, reign supreme. But the real question remains: will this isolated strategy bear fruit in the constantly evolving crypto ecosystem?\n\nUSDC: A Not-So-Stable Stablecoin?\n\nThe USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, recently lost its peg to the US dollar, plunging the crypto community into panic. Instead of maintaining its usual value of 1 dollar, USDC saw its value drop alarmingly, hitting a low of as much as $0.74 on the Binance exchange platform. This sudden drop has sparked concerns and speculation among investors and market observers.\n\nThe USDC de-peg phenomenon is not isolated in the world of stablecoins. Previously, Tether\u2019s USDT had also experienced periods where it could not maintain its 1:1 parity with the US dollar, resulting in massive liquidations on major crypto exchange platforms. The details of the USDC incident reveal that during a period of widespread market selling, fueled by dubious reports about the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF, USDC even lost its parity with the dollar three times.\n\nCould the USD Soon Be Pegged to Bitcoin?\n\nThe financial world might be on the brink of a revolution with the idea that the US dollar (USD) could soon be pegged to Bitcoin. This bold proposal has sparked a spirited debate among economists and policymakers. Proponents of this project view Bitcoin as a credible alternative to gold, traditionally used to back the value of currencies. They argue that Bitcoin, with its blockchain technology and decentralized network, offers increased security, limits counterfeiting, and thus reduces the risk of inflation. Furthermore, a USD indexed to Bitcoin would benefit from a limited and pre-programmed supply of new bitcoins, unlike traditional currencies that rely on central bank decisions. This could reinforce the dollar\u2019s status as a safe haven for investors.\n\nHowever, this idea is not without pitfalls. The volatility of Bitcoin is a significant concern, as pegging the world\u2019s primary reserve currency to such a volatile asset could destabilize the American economy and the international monetary balance. Additionally, China\u2019s dominance in Bitcoin mining poses a risk to US sovereignty and a systemic risk in the event of conflict between the two powers.\n\nBinance Tightens Policy on Monero and Zcash!\n\nBinance has recently announced a tightening of its trading rules for ten cryptocurrencies, including Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), which will now be placed under \u201cenhanced surveillance\u201d due to the increased risks they pose. This move follows Binance\u2019s recent regulatory hurdles, as it faced allegations of money laundering and violations of KYC rules set by the US SEC. Monero and Zcash, known for their anonymizing properties, have often attracted regulatory attention for their potential to facilitate large-scale money laundering. Binance will also more closely monitor other tokens, while loosening rules for some like GMX and SushiSwap.\n\nTo trade these high-risk cryptocurrencies, Binance users will now have to take a quiz every 90 days and accept strengthened terms of use aimed at raising awareness of the risks involved. Tokens branded with Binance\u2019s \u201cSeed Tag\u201d are considered promising but highly volatile projects, and warning banners will be visible on their trading pages. Binance will conduct periodic reviews of crypto projects, taking into account various factors to add or remove tokens from surveillance lists. By tightening its compliance policy, Binance hopes to regain trust with authorities shaken in 2023, reflecting the difficult balancing act undertaken by the crypto giant.\n\nUNHCR Adopts Blockchain with Cardano for Humanitarian Aid\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has adopted blockchain as a powerful tool for refugee aid. With Cardano by its side, UNHCR is opening a new era of digital solidarity. Blockchain brings transparency and efficiency in the distribution of aid, and thanks to Cardano, the organization simplifies the management of donations, ensuring quick and direct help to refugees while securing their personal data. UNHCR is also innovating with crypto digital wallets that facilitate donations and receiving aid, even remotely, while educating refugees in digital literacy.\n\nCardano and UNHCR have launched a unique staking pool, \u201cBlockchain for Refugees,\u201d where each ADA crypto contribution directly supports the operations of UNHCR. This revolutionary crowdfunding model allows donors to maintain control of their assets while contributing to a noble cause. Cardano, with its committed community and unique staking system, has won over UNHCR, and their collaboration has already borne fruit with several innovative projects underway. The use of zero-knowledge proofs by Cardano further strengthens the security of refugee data.\n\nThe Pectra Update Causes a Split Among Ethereum Developers\n\nThe Ethereum community is actively preparing for Pectra, the next network upgrade scheduled for 2024, but a significant disagreement remains among developers on how best to integrate Verkle, a promising validity proof technology. The deployment of the Pectra upgrade will begin in 2024 with a series of tests on Ethereum development networks, allowing for the validation of the code in various environments and the identification of any potential bugs or performance issues.\n\nRegarding Verkle, two approaches oppose each other among Ethereum developers. Pro-mandatory Verkle advocates for total and immediate adoption, considering its advantages in terms of performance and scalability too important to provide a choice. On the other hand, anti-mandatory Verkle developers are more cautious, fearing security or stability issues if Verkle is deployed too quickly. They suggest that Verkle should first be offered as an option, alongside the current validation mechanism. The upcoming Pectra upgrade of Ethereum promises to be decisive for the network\u2019s future, but the integration of Verkle divides developers on the best strategy to adopt.\n\nBitcoin in 2023: A Whirlwind of $6 Trillion\n\nIn 2023, the Bitcoin market witnessed frenetic activity, with over $6 trillion exchanged, although this represents a 38% decrease from the previous year. This colossal sum equals more than 2.3 times the value of the French GDP and underscores the massive scale of transactions carried out with the flagship crypto.\n\nThe year was also marked by a relative stability of the average price of Bitcoin, with a slight increase from 2022. The number of active addresses remained steady, while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance climbed to 50%. More than 75% of Bitcoin holders are now considered long-term investors, a historic high that indicates a growing maturity of the market. Meanwhile, the amount of Bitcoin in circulation has increased by 1.75%, continuing its long-term downward trend.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Valkyrie Funds' co-founder and chief investment officer, Steve McClurg, hinted at the possibility of the approval of Ethereum or XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following the anticipated launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\n\"So, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw Ripple or Ethereum spot ETFs out there,\" he said.\n\nThis prediction comes in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) likely giving the green light for Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF, with trading expected to commence as early as Thursday.\n\nHowever, McClurg is not certain whether Valkyrie is going to launch such products in the future. \" I really don't know if we're going to do that or not,\" he added.\n\nMore spot ETFs on the horizon?\n\nMcClurg's optimism about Ethereum and Ripple ETFs is backed by recent market developments.\n\nHe pointed out that Grayscale's addition of XRP to one of their publicly traded trusts shows a growing interest in diversified cryptocurrency investment products.\n\nValkyrie has not confirmed plans to pursue these specific ETFs, McClurg believes that the market is ripe for such offerings.\n\nHe emphasized that these potential ETFs could be more retail-focused, providing easier access to a broader range of investors who may not be deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"Anything can happen\"\n\nHowever, McClurg cautioned that the SEC's decision-making process is unpredictable, and the agency's approval is never guaranteed.\n\nValkyrie is prepared to launch its Bitcoin ETF, but McClurg remains cautiously optimistic, acknowledging that \"anything can happen\" in the regulatory landscape.\n\n\"We're prepared for an effective date on Wednesday and trading on Thursday, but we know that anything can happen. So I'm about 95% sure that we will be trading on Thursday,\" he said."

        "title": "Analyzing the ETH Price: Trends and Forecasts in the Crypto Economy - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "Analyzing the ETH Price: Trends and Forecasts in the Crypto Economy\n\nThe ETH price is a crucial indicator in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the ongoing evolution and adoption of the Ethereum blockchain. Investors and developers alike watch it closely.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Position in the Crypto Market\n\nEthereum has cemented its place as a cornerstone of the crypto economy, with its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), serving as a vital indicator of both the network\u2019s health and the blockchain industry\u2019s trends. As the primary platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum\u2019s innovations directly influence ETH\u2019s price. The network\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), promises further advancements and efficiencies, potentially affecting ETH\u2019s valuation.\n\nFactors Influencing ETH Price\n\nThe price of ETH, much like other cryptocurrencies, is shaped by various factors, including market demand, blockchain upgrades, the regulatory environment, and macroeconomic trends. Market sentiment can be significantly swayed by Ethereum\u2019s network upgrades, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which aim to enhance network capabilities and scalability. For instance, EIP-1559, which introduced a mechanism for burning transaction fees, has had a notable impact on ETH\u2019s economics by reducing the overall supply of ETH.\n\nHistorical Volatility and Price Analysis\n\nETH\u2019s price has experienced considerable volatility, characteristic of the broader cryptocurrency market. This volatility is driven by a mix of investor sentiment, liquidity, market manipulation, and the rapid pace of technological change. Analyzing ETH\u2019s historical price data reveals patterns and trends that can offer insights into its future movements. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that past performance is not always indicative of future results, especially in a market as young and dynamic as cryptocurrency.\n\nComparative Analysis with Bitcoin\n\nWhen comparing ETH to Bitcoin, it\u2019s clear that although both are leading cryptocurrencies, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin is primarily seen as a store of value or \u2018digital gold,\u2019 while ETH is the backbone of an ecosystem that enables decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other blockchain applications. These fundamental differences often lead to divergent price movements, particularly in response to developments that specifically affect either the DeFi sector or the broader acceptance of digital assets as a store of value.\n\nETH and the DeFi Ecosystem\n\nETH\u2019s price is also intimately linked with the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, most of which is built upon Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. The rise of DeFi platforms, which offer decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading, has significantly increased the demand for ETH, as it is often required as collateral or for transaction fees within these systems.\n\nThe Impact of Institutional Adoption\n\nInstitutional adoption of ETH has been a key driver of its price. As more financial institutions, corporations, and investment funds embrace Ethereum for its smart contract capabilities and as an investment asset, this institutional demand can lead to increased price stability and growth. Conversely, negative sentiments or regulatory crackdowns in the institutional space can adversely affect ETH\u2019s price.\n\nRegulatory Factors Affecting ETH Price\n\nThe regulatory landscape is a wildcard in the valuation of ETH. Positive regulatory developments can lead to price surges, as seen with the SEC\u2019s decision not to classify ETH as a security. On the flip side, adverse regulatory news can cause sharp declines, as uncertainty can lead to decreased investor confidence.\n\nETH Price Predictions and Market Sentiment\n\nMarket analysts and enthusiasts often attempt to predict ETH\u2019s price, using a variety of methods including technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and the examination of on-chain metrics. While some predictions are based on sophisticated models, the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market means that such forecasts should be taken with caution.\n\nInvestment Strategies for ETH\n\nInvestors looking to include ETH in their portfolios should consider a range of strategies, from long-term holding to active trading, depending on their risk tolerance, investment goals, and expertise in the crypto market. A balanced approach, often including a diversified portfolio of assets, can help mitigate the risks associated with ETH\u2019s price volatility.\n\nThe Future of ETH\n\nThe future price of ETH is inextricably linked to the continued development and success of the Ethereum network. As Ethereum evolves, particularly with the complete rollout of Ethereum 2.0, ETH could see significant changes in demand, supply dynamics, and overall utility, which will ultimately shape its price trajectory.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the price of ETH requires a multifaceted approach that considers the complex interplay of market forces, technological advancements, and regulatory changes. The Ethereum network\u2019s central role in the blockchain ecosystem makes ETH one of the most watched and analyzed digital currencies in the world. As the network continues to grow and adapt, so too will the factors influencing ETH\u2019s price, underscoring the importance for investors to stay well-informed and strategically agile."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are both bullish on the charts. ETH specifically faced an upward momentum fueled by an increase in its usage and trading volume. XRP, on the other hand, is projected to experience gigantic growth soon by major crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO. Alongside them, Meme Moguls (MGLS) is also making significant progress. We will analyze the on-chart data for both to determine the best crypto to invest in.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Stays Above $2,200 \u2013 Price to Reach $3,829.22 by the End of Q4\n\nEthereum (ETH)\u2019s indicators are in a mixed position, with the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent rallies putting it in a position where it could correct. Yet, other data suggests that it could also see another rally. The 30-day average has been well above the 200-day average for multiple months. This implies that the Ethereum crypto was overbought by traders in recent weeks.\n\nAt the same time, the RSI for the crypto is around 50, indicating neutral territory for the Ethereum price. Holders are aware that ETH\u2019s support level has risen and held up consistently since November of 2023. Even if ETH struggles in the short term, it is highly unlikely that it can fall significantly.\n\nDuring the past week, the crypto traded between $2,187.29 and $2,434.45 and has consistently remained above $2,200. According to the Ethereum price prediction, it can rise to $3,829.22 by the end of Q4 2024.\n\nRipple (XRP) to Rally 96X According to EGRAG CRYPTO\n\nRipple (XRP) remains the subject of bullish projections. The X (Twitter) user EGRAG CRYPTO, a notable analyst, expects the price to surge in the upcoming sessions. The analyst outlined Ripple crypto\u2019s 20X rally in 2021 when the overall industry was booming. He noted how progress occurred despite the lawsuit they had with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company secured three vital court victories.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Ripple price could potentially grow between $5.88 and $16. This is a bullish Ripple price prediction, but the analyst also forecasted further growth. The crypto could rise an incredible 96X from the cycle bottom, which would result in a value of $27.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) to Introduce Virtual Trading and a P2E Ecosystem\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) is an upcoming P2E meme-oriented ecosystem aimed at helping investors and traders enhance their strategies while also improving the performance of their portfolios. This will be completed through an introduction of a platform where they can access real-time market simulations.\n\nPlayers will get immersed in a fantasy meme-trading world. Here, they can create custom avatars and climb their way up leaderboards. They can reach Moguls status to get the highest rewards. They can also begin trading or selling character NFTs on the market alongside other rare NFT items and mined materials.\n\nThere is also Moguls Land, which is the dedicated Metaverse in the ecosystem. Here, each player can join liquidity pools or mine tokens. All they need to do to accumulate more MGLS is to stake it in the pool, which will result in fixed passive capital gains. These aspects make it the best crypto to invest in.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum and Ripple both have growth potential, but Meme Moguls has seen a massive rally. Its presale has reached Stage 4, where MGLS trades at $0.0027. This blockchain ICO has been growing at a rapid speed, analysts project an 80x price jump.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nCryptocurrency markets continue to evolve with varying trends, particularly in the case of Meme Moguls, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH). Despite the broader market's ups and downs, Ethereum's prices have seen a notable increase. Meanwhile, Solana faces challenges as its NFT sales experience a downturn, reflecting the ever-changing dynamics of the crypto and NFT landscapes.\n\nSolana's (SOL) Struggle Amidst NFT Sales Decline\n\nSolana (SOL), known for its high-speed blockchain, has recently encountered a significant challenge as its NFT sales have dropped. This downturn has coincided with a market price of $98.80 for Solana, which represents a substantial 64.35% increase over the past month. The decline in NFT sales on Solana's platform could be attributed to a variety of factors, including shifting market preferences and increasing competition within the NFT space. Despite this setback, Solana holds a significant position in the cryptocurrency market, thanks to its technological advantages and strong community support.\n\nThe drop in NFT sales is particularly noteworthy given Solana's reputation as a hub for digital art and collectibles. This decrease may signal a broader trend in the NFT market or could be reflective of temporary market fluctuations. As investors and enthusiasts closely watch these developments, Solana's future in the NFT market remains a topic of keen interest.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) Steady Ascent: A Year of Growth\n\nEthereum (ETH) continues to showcase its resilience and potential in the cryptocurrency market, marked by a significant price increase to $2,229.81, reflecting a remarkable 78.45% growth over the past year.

The platform's ability to adapt and evolve, particularly with its scalability solutions and reduced environmental impact, has played a key role in maintaining its position as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe year-on-year growth of Ethereum is not just a testament to its robust technology but also indicates the growing investor confidence in its long-term viability.

Such a price tag would signify a remarkable 321.52% increase from its current value of $2,370.\n\nWhile Davis didn\u2019t specify a timeline, his confidence underscores the growing optimism surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future prospects.\n\nRecent Milestones for Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nOn-chain data from Santiment reveals that both Ethereum and Bitcoin are approaching new milestones. Ethereum is now just 1.6% away from its highest value since 11 May 2023. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is within a 2.9% range of its peak value since April 6 of last year. These near highs suggest a renewed bullish sentiment for the crypto market leaders.\n\nFurther insights from crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggest that Bitcoin may soon enter a range-bound phase post-ETF approval. However, this could pave the way for Ethereum to make significant strides, potentially surging past $3,000.\n\nIn-Depth Analysis Highlights Ethereum\u2019s Strengths\n\nA recent blog post by crypto researchers Qiao Wang and Dan McArdle delves into Ethereum\u2019s unique position in the crypto landscape. Drawing parallels with Bitcoin\u2019s status as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and Solana\u2019s efficiency, they underscore Ethereum\u2019s distinctive advantages. The Lindy effect, which posits that the longevity of a technology signifies its continued relevance, is particularly relevant to Ethereum, given its nearly decade-long presence and resilience.\n\nThe duo also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s regulatory edge, notably its ETH futures contract on the CME, a privilege shared only with Bitcoin. This has instilled a level of confidence among regulators, particularly the SEC, distinguishing Ethereum from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s strategic alliance with Coinbase via the Base rollup positions it advantageously in the compliant DeFi space. Post-EIP1559 and the Merge, Ethereum\u2019s \u2018real yield\u2019 feature has become a magnet for institutional investors seeking crypto-based yields.\n\nCardano\u2019s Market Movement\n\nShifting focus to Cardano, one of the top altcoins that has been consolidating in the $0.600 to $0.650 range. Despite facing a supply zone hurdle between $0.631 to $0.678, Cardano\u2019s price action indicates persistent buying interest. While there\u2019s potential for a short-term retracement, especially if the price breaches the uptrend line, the overall sentiment remains positive.\n\nA Closer Look at Rebel Satoshi\n\nWhile Ethereum and Cardano continue to make waves, another crypto to watch is Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). With an impressive presale of over 96 million $RBLZ and having raised $1.3 million, the project is gaining traction.\n\nBuilt on Ethereum, Rebel Satoshi stands out for its robust security measures, having undergone thorough auditing by Source Hat. This is one of the many reasons why many top crypto analysts regard it as one of the best meme coins. As the presale edges closer to $2 million, now might be the opportune moment for investors to consider this promising venture.\n\nIn conclusion, the crypto landscape is rife with opportunities and predictions. While Ethereum\u2019s potential ascent to $10,000 excites many, altcoins like Cardano and Rebel Satoshi also present unique investment avenues. For those looking for which crypto to buy today for the long-term, Bitcoin is almost a sure bet. However, as always, due diligence and staying informed are paramount in navigating this dynamic market."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is a vibrant and ever-evolving space, where new opportunities and innovations arise daily. In this comprehensive analysis, we will explore the current market dynamics of three prominent tokens: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the promising newcomer, Retik Finance (RETIK).As we navigate the landscape of these digital assets, we\u2019ll also shed light on the unique investment potential presented by Retik Finance\u2019s ongoing presale.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Giant Awakening\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the king of smart contracts, has recently experienced a period of relative stagnation in its price. Despite this, market analysts are optimistic about the potential for a resurgence. Ethereum\u2019s recent movement out of centralised exchanges and the steady increase in network activity suggest a brewing momentum.Crypto analyst \u2018Metaquant\u2019 notes that Ethereum has been holding steady while competitors like Solana and Avalanche have slowed down after significant price hikes. The rotation of capital in the layer-1 ecosystem points towards a potential shift back to Ethereum and its ecosystem.The on-chain metrics support this narrative. Ethereum and its layer-2 networks have seen consistent growth, with a record-high total value locked (TVL) across the layer-2 ecosystem. Daily active addresses, layer-2 fees, and layer-2 stablecoin market capitalization have also been on the rise. Ethereum currently trades at $2,265.78 as of writing and has seen a 24-hour growth of 1.76%.\n\nThe recent move by crypto lender Celsius to unstack Ethereum is seen as a positive development, reducing short-term volatility and clearing the way for a potential Ethereum resurgence. Despite current price consolidation, some analysts predict Ethereum could easily reach $10,000, doubling its previous all-time high.\n\nSolana (SOL): Building Momentum\n\nSolana, a rising star in the cryptocurrency space, experienced rapid price action from mid-October to mid-December. However, the token has since entered a consolidation phase, building a price structure for its next move. While the short-term 4-hour time frame shows Solana moving within a potential bull flag, analysts caution that confirmation requires a third touch on the top trend line.Zooming out to the weekly time frame, Solana appears to be consolidating around the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Analysts anticipate a potential target of $163 at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, though a healthy price structure may involve retracement to at least $137.The current Solana price stands at $102.15, reflecting a 3.37% increase over the past 24 hours. Amidst a brief respite following its remarkable surge, Solana maintains its status as a pivotal contender worth monitoring. This is especially true in light of the ongoing developments in market rotation and capital flow dynamics.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): Unlocking the Future\n\nRetik Finance emerges as a new contender in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, aiming to revolutionise the global financial landscape. Currently, in its presale stages, Retik Finance has already exceeded expectations, offering an all-time profit of 100%. The token is now at presale stage 4, with tokens available at $0.060, poised to grow by 150% on its way to the listing price of $0.15.Experts in the crypto space project even more substantial gains for Retik Finance, with potential pumps of up to 2000% upon listing.

The $RETIK token serves as the backbone of this ecosystem, promoting financial autonomy, governance, and user engagement.

BTC is facing resistance at $43,900, and a breakthrough could lead to a continued upward movement to $44,200. The market is currently in a state of equilibrium, with neither bulls nor bears taking the lead. In this scenario, Bitcoin is likely to trade within the narrow range of $43,000 and $44,500 in the coming days. Ethereum is following a similar trajectory to Bitcoin, and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs might pave the way for regulatory clarity on Ethereum ETFs. The upcoming week is anticipated to be volatile, especially with the release of US CPI data on Thursday.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cUS Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seem poised for imminent launch as the exchanges that will list them have submitted revised documents, indicating anticipation of approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the near future. Resonating the positive sentiment, VanEck, an asset management firm, has pledged to allocate 5 percent of its fund's potential profits to support Bitcoin developers at Brink, contingent upon approval.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) demonstrates resilience around the $43.4k mark; however, recent analysis suggests caution, hinting it might not reach a new ATH soon. The broader crypto market presents varied sentiments, witnessing altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) navigating complexities. As SHIB's address count rises, it reflects the burgeoning interest and potential market dynamics, emphasising the need for vigilant monitoring amidst evolving crypto landscapes.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is at a critical point, trading at $43,600 , with potential ETF approvals from BlackRock and Grayscale fueling excitement. VanEck's adviser suggests that ETFs could overcome unit bias and open the door to wider adoption. A surprise $1.17 million transaction to the genesis Bitcoin wallet raises speculation of Nakamoto's involvement or a publicity stunt. SEC rulings on ETF applications with impact on institutional engagement and market dynamics are expected. Bitcoin's recent drop to $42,125 reflects continued volatility with crucial support at $39,891. Technical analysis shows resistance at $44,200 and potential upside momentum, but RSI signals overbought conditions. Bitcoin's trajectory continues to be subject to rapid change due to the cryptocurrency's inherent volatility.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market witnessed profit booking by traders due to which Bitcoin dipped to the $43,000 level while Ethereum slipped to the $2,181 mark. The latest market rally may have triggered profit booking and traders may have created fresh positions to prepare for the next cycle. The market sentiment is extremely positive as there is a lot of news around Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. Bitcoin approval will be the biggest market mover in 2024 and make digital assets mainstream across the globe. The market is expected to remain volatile in the coming weeks owing to the macroeconomic factors.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cDuring the weekend, the overall crypto market displayed a slight bearish sentiment. BTC traded sideways, currently positioned below the key resistance level at $44,300 and above the incline trendline support at $42,600. The rising BTC dominance contributed to bearish trends in altcoins. ETH witnessed a break below an incline trendline support and is also below the 20EMA Daily, indicating a bearish stance. The support level for ETH is at $2,131, with resistance at $2,390. Notably, investors are actively speculating on the potential approval of the BTC spot ETF on January 10.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
