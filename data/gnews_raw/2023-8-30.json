        "title": "Ethereum records more long-term holders than Bitcoin in 2023, on-chain data - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum records more long-term holders than Bitcoin, according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nWhile there is a notable increase across the board, ETH outranks BTC when it comes to large holders.\n\nMetrics such as percentage coins in USD, time held, and number of addresses were considered.\n\nExperts attribute this margin to Ethereum\u2019s DeFi dominance as the network offers more functionality besides being a crypto, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has shown a significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) price, tracing almost similar price actions with momentum indicators also aligning. A closer look, however, reveals that ETH has outranked BTC on several metrics, particularly where large holders or whales are concerned.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner.\n\nOn-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a commendable rise in long-term holders over the last year, with Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Specifically, Ethereum boasts a stark 73.5 million long-term holders (those who have held the cryptocurrency for more than one year) vs Bitcoin\u2019s 33.61 million.\n\nWhen it comes to whales, ETH boasts 5,370 addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. BTC, on the other hand, only has 1,920 addresses with between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin.\n\nETH assets by time held\n\nThe number of humpbacks (addresses holding more than 5000 ETH) is also very high: 106,000 Ethereum holders own between 10K-100K, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 103,670 holders.\n\n108 addresses hold more than 100,000 ETH versus only four holding as many BTC.\n\nETH Addresses by holdings\n\nIn addition, six wallets hold over a million Ether.\n\nBTC assets by time held\n\nThe percentage of Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings in USD also paints a similar picture in favor of ETH.\n\nBTCassets by holdings\n\nPossible reasons for Ethereum flippening Bitcoin\n\nExperts attribute the disparity, which favors Ethereum, to the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) space dominance. Specifically, the proof-of-stake (PoS) token has more functionality or use cases than Bitcoin, which is valued only as a digital currency.\n\nAmong the applications of the Ethereum network include:\n\nHosting other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n\nCreation and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nDevelopment of decentralized applications (DApps) in finance, web browsing, gaming, and advertising, among others.\n\nProviding access to financial services, including but not limited to crypto-lending, yield farming, and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nCreation and maintenance of digital identities for individuals, companies, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n\nThe share of ETH locked in the DeFi landscape is also vast, recording up to $22.31 billion, relative to Bitcoin\u2019s $162.6 million locked within the same domain. This explains why Ethereum has more long-term holders.\n\nBitcoin price is up approximately 31% year-to-date, while Ethereum price is up only 6.8% over the same timeframe. Needless to say, the variation shows that dynamics in the cryptocurrency market are not limited to valuation alone. Despite Bitcoin being the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has managed to attract more large holders."

        "title": "How Many Ethereum Are There? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "There are about 120.2 million Ethereum coins in circulation at the time of writing. The supply of Ethereum has been changing quite a bit over the years, as it initially displayed consistent growth, but entered a slightly deflationary trend in September of 2022 after Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with The Merge upgrade.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain the Ethereum supply and how it is expected to change over time. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, supply dynamics are very important and can have a massive impact on long-term price movements.\n\nEthereum supply explained\n\nWhen talking about Ethereum\u2019s tokenomics, it\u2019s important to understand that there is no upper limit to the amount of ETH that can exist. Therefore, the max supply of Ethereum is technically infinite. This is different from a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, where the protocol has a clearly defined limit of how many coins can exist (21 million BTC in the example of Bitcoin)\n\nHowever, Ethereum having a theoretically unlimited maximum supply doesn\u2019t mean that you should be concerned about massive inflation in the Ethereum supply. In fact, the supply of ETH has been gradually decreasing for about a year now.\n\nAs we can see on the Ethereum supply chart, the Ethereum supply was growing between launch and September of 2022, although the rate at which new coins were being issued was gradually decreasing. For example, in June 2016, around 30,000 ETH was entering circulation through block rewards on a daily basis. By June 2022, three months before The Merge, only around 13,000 ETH was entering circulation each day.\n\nOn the chart, we can clearly see that the ETH supply growth peaked in September of 2022, when Ethereum adopted its new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nGrowth of the ETH supply from July 2015 to August 2023. Image source: Etherscan\n\nAnother important aspect of the Ethereum supply to understand is that each ETH coin can be broken down into a very large amount of smaller units. The smallest unit of ETH is called wei, named after Chinese computer engineer and cryptography expert Wei Dai.\n\nWei is similar to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest denomination, satoshi. Each ETH coin can be broken down into 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one quintillion) wei. Here\u2019s what the different denominations are called:\n\nName Number of wei wei 1 kwei 1,000 mwei 1,000,000 gwei 1,000,000,000 twei 1,000,000,000,000 pwei 1,000,000,000,000,000 Ether 1,000,000,000,000,000,000\n\nThe move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has had a big impact on the Ethereum supply\n\nAfter the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the Ethereum protocol needs to issue much fewer ETH coins to ensure that the network is secure \u2014 simply put, staking is a much less resource-intensive process than mining.\n\nBefore the move to Proof-of-Stake in September of 2022, around 13,000 ETH was being issued per day to provide incentives to Ethereum miners. Meanwhile, the new Proof-of-Stake system only has to issue about 1,600 ETH to adequately incentivize stakers and ensure that the network remains secure. After the transition to PoS, there has been about an 87.7% drop in the amount of new ETH coins that enter circulation each day.\n\nThere is another crucial aspect to Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics called EIP-1559. EIP-1559 is an upgrade that was activated on the Ethereum network in August of 2021. The upgrade reworked Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee market. After EIP-1559, the base ETH transaction fee paid for each transaction is burned (removed from circulation forever), while users retain the option to include tips to validators in order to have their transactions prioritized.\n\nEssentially, EIP-1559 means that the more demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum network, the more ETH is being burned. Since the move to Proof-of-Stake, enough ETH has been burned through EIP-1559 to reduce the overall supply of ETH, even though about 1,600 ETH are being created each day.\n\nThe combination of factors that is contributing to the reduction of the ETH supply is often called the Ethereum triple halving.\n\nBased on trends since The Merge, 674,000 ETH will be issued in the next year, while 996,000 ETH will be burned. This would mean a 322,000 ETH reduction in the Ethereum supply.\n\nEstimated yearly ETH issuance and burn based on trend since The Merge. Image source: ultrasound.money\n\nIf you want to track detailed information about the ETH supply, we recommend you check out the platform ultrasound.money. It offers an Ethereum supply chart, tracks trends in changes to the ETH supply, and provides real-time tracking of how much ETH is being burned through EIP-1559.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWe can expect the supply of Ethereum to continue decreasing gradually, provided that demand for Ethereum transactions remains high. Since Ethereum is easily the largest blockchain platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that the majority of users looking to engage in DeFi, stablecoins, NFTs, blockchain gaming and other use cases will continue to have Ethereum as their first option.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Ethereum, make sure to check out our article exploring if Ethereum is a good investment or not.\n\nEthereum supply FAQs\n\nHow many Ethereum are there?\n\nCurrently, there are about 120.2 million Ethereum coins in circulation. However, we can expect the amount of Ethereum to gradually decrease over time due to the EIP-1559 burn mechanism.\n\nIs there a max supply of Ethereum?\n\nNo, there is no max supply of Ethereum. Theoretically, an infinite amount of ETH could exist, but only a limited of ETH is issued each day and ETH coins are also constantly being burned through EIP-1559.\n\nHow much Ethereum is left?\n\nSince there is no maximum supply of ETH, the Ethereum protocol will never run out of new ETH coins to create.\n\nHow many Ethereum are destroyed?\n\nBased on current trends, around 996,000 Ethereum coins are destroyed each year through the EIP-1559 burn mechanism.\n\nWho has the most ETH in the world?\n\nCurrently, the most ETH is held by the Beacon Deposit Contract, which holds more than 29 million ETH (over $50 billion)."

        "content": "Can you Make Money with Ethereum?: Guide\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies can be a lucrative venture, but it\u2019s important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making any financial decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, many investors wonder if it\u2019s worth putting their money into this digital asset.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the long-term investment potential of Ethereum and provide insights into how you can make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso read: Worldcoin\u2019s Surge Causes Optimism to Dethrone Arbitrum in Daily Transactions\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThis unique feature sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThey automatically execute when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and making transactions more efficient and secure.\n\nThe potential use cases for Ethereum are vast and extend beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe platform can be used for a wide range of applications. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, gaming, and even social media.\n\nThe demand for Ethereum is expected to grow exponentially. Most likely due to more industries recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology and smart contracts.\n\nThe long-term investment potential of Ethereum\n\nWhen considering Ethereum as a long-term investment, it\u2019s important to look at several factors that contribute to its potential growth:\n\nAdoption and Use Cases\n\nEthereum\u2019s versatility and widespread adoption make it an attractive investment option. As the platform continues to grow, the demand for Ethereum and its native token, Ether (ETH), is likely to increase.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to support a wide range of industries contributes to its long-term investment potential.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nEthereum is in the process of transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient and secure proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to address the scalability and environmental concerns associated with PoW.\n\nBy staking Ethereum, individuals can participate in the network\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by validating transactions. This transition is expected to drive demand for Ethereum as more individuals and institutions participate in staking activities.\n\nNetwork upgrades and improvements\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly evolving, with regular upgrades and improvements being implemented to address scalability, security, and usability concerns.\n\nUpcoming upgrades, such as the London hard fork, aim to reduce transaction fees and improve the overall user experience.\n\nThese improvements contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMarket dominance and liquidity\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has established itself as a dominant player in the crypto market.\n\nThis market dominance translates to increased liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Ethereum tokens.\n\nHigher liquidity enhances the overall stability of the asset and provides investors with more opportunities to enter or exit positions.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin \u2018Oversold\u2019 For The 1st Time Since 2020\n\nHow to Make Real Money With Ethereum\n\nNext, let\u2019s explore some strategies that can help you make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nBuy and hold (HODL)\n\nOne of the simplest and most popular strategies is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies for the long term.\n\nThis strategy, often referred to as \u201cHODLing,\u201d involves purchasing Ethereum tokens and holding onto them. You do this with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time.\n\nBy taking a long-term perspective, investors can potentially benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStaking Ethereum\n\nPeople can participate in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by staking their Ethereum tokens.\n\nIn return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional Ethereum tokens. The amount of passive income earned through staking depends on factors such as the amount of Ethereum staked and the overall network participation.\n\nParticipating in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained significant attention in recent years, and Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement.\n\nDeFi platforms built on the Ethereum network offer a range of financial services. These include lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, by participating in DeFi protocols, individuals can earn interest on their Ethereum holdings, provide liquidity to earn fees or engage in arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with DeFi before participating.\n\nTrading Ethereum\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nFor individuals with trading experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics, actively trading Ethereum can be a profitable endeavor.\n\nDay trading or swing trading Ethereum involves buying and selling the cryptocurrency within short time frames to take advantage of price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, this strategy requires careful analysis, technical skills, and risk management to be successful.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that trading cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and losses are possible.\n\nHow Much Can You Make with a $100 Investment in Ethereum?\n\nThe potential returns on a $100 investment in Ethereum depend on various factors, such as the entry point, market conditions, and the holding period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced significant volatility in the past, with periods of both rapid growth and sharp corrections.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nHowever, a $100 investment made at a favorable entry point could potentially grow substantially over time.\n\nFor example, if an individual had invested $100 in Ethereum in early 2020 when the price was around $150, their investment would have grown to approximately $13,333 by mid-2021 when the price reached $2,000. This represents a significant return on investment.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky, and investing in Ethereum or any other digital asset carries the potential for loss. It\u2019s important to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds that you can afford to lose.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity due to its versatile platform, potential for widespread adoption, and ongoing network improvements.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum requires careful consideration and an understanding of the associated risks.\n\nBy adopting strategies such as buying and holding, staking, participating in DeFi, or trading Ethereum, individuals can potentially make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, conduct thorough research, and make informed investment decisions based on your risk tolerance and financial goals."

It also holds more than 100 ERC-20 tokens, collectively worth $177.1 million. Those numbers bring Robinhood\u2019s total holdings for all Ethereum-based tokens above $2.71 billion.\n\nArkham noted that the address holds funds in custody on behalf of Robinhood users. Robinhood\u2019s trading model requires the company to back user balances at a 1:1 ratio in line with regulations set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe four Ethereum addresses larger than Robinhood\u2019s account include Ethereum\u2019s beacon deposit contract, a wrapped Ether contract, and addresses belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Binance.\n\nThe beacon deposit contract is by far the largest of those addresses. With more than 29 million ETH ($49.7 billion), it accounts for one-quarter of the entire Ethereum supply.\n\nRobinhood has addresses on other chains\n\nArkham\u2019s data additionally shows that Robinhood holds funds on numerous other exchanges, including Avalanche ($29.83 million), Polygon ($1.40 million), Arbitrum ($395), and BNB Chain ($203). The funds that Robinhood holds on each of those blockchains are not entirely made up of the chain\u2019s native token.\n\nIn total, Robinhood holds $7.39 billion of crypto in those addresses as of Aug. 30. The company\u2019s earlier quarterly results indicated that it held $11.5 billion of assets related to user cryptocurrency safeguarding obligations on June 30. It is unclear whether this change is due to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices or actual changes in the amount of crypto in each of Robinhood\u2019s addresses.\n\nSo far, Robinhood has only confirmed to CryptoSlate that it owns the $3 billion Bitcoin address. This article will be updated as Robinhood provides more information.\n\nThe news comes alongside an announcement from Robinhood stating that it will extend wallet support to Bitcoin and Dogecoin and add Ethereum swaps.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are likely setting the stage for a big move to the upside.\n\nCrypto trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggests to his 665,600 followers on the social media platform X that the digital assets market is following a historical pattern before Bitcoin (BTC) halving events.\n\nHe says that just like in the past investor sentiment and altcoins are currently reaching cycle lows 10 months before the next BTC halving event, which is expected on April 20, 2024, and he believes just like in the past altcoins will soon turn bullish.\n\n\u201cEvery rally is getting sold into, as people want to get out of the markets and tend to disbelief the markets have already started in a new bull cycle. Until the real move happens and people don\u2019t get a chance to get into their positions. That\u2019s why positioning is super important to do that in an early stage, which is when you start to take a look at price levels.\n\nWe\u2019re 10 months prior to the Bitcoin halving. The period where sentiment is the lowest and altcoins are usually swimming around their cycle lows. Bitcoin dominance is peaking, and will not peak to that level anymore in this cycle. It happened in 2015, ten months prior to the halving. It happened in 2019, ten months prior to the halving. It happens in 2023, ten months prior to the halving.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Bitcoin dominance chart is flashing bullish for altcoins as the the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) are starting to act like resistance just like they did months before Bitcoin\u2019s 2020 halving event.\n\n\u201cA clear rejection at the 200-Week MA and EMA and looking to continue the fall, while altcoins are slowly picking up in their BTC pairs as a new cycle starts. While nobody expects it.\u201d\n\nHe also says that several altcoin projects, like Ethereum and blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK), have continued to develop during the bear market, setting the stage for massive rally events when the bull cycle takes off.\n\n\u201cAre projects still developing and did something change on that perspective? Well. The good part is that many fraudulent projects are washed out of the markets, while the good ones are constantly building further. Ethereum has swapped towards PoS (proof-of-stake) and is getting Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on futures in a month maximum. Chainlink has developed CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) and I\u2019m not even mentioning all the other progress in DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and more.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,733 at time of writing, up 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "In laying out the bull case for ether on Wednesday, Fidelity\u2019s digital assets subsidiary said dapps built on Ethereum are \u201ccapable of things that could not be done on Bitcoin\u2019s network due to Ethereum\u2019s superior programmability.\u201d\n\nResearchers who compiled the report said investors could view ether (ETH) as an \u201caspiring\u201d form of money.\n\nEther, they wrote, will \u201clikely face significantly more headwinds than bitcoin to become widely accepted as a form of money.\u201d\n\nWhy? Unlike bitcoin (BTC), which has a hard cap of 21 million, ether technically has \u201cunlimited supply parameters\u201d \u2014 even though there is a fee burning mechanism. It was introduced by upgrade EIP-1559 in August 2021 and has led to deflationary periods for ether.\n\nThere\u2019s uncertainty relating to future upgrades to Ethereum and the number of the tokens in circulation on an untethered schedule, according to the report. And the cumulative effect has been that ether\u2019s supply has a slew of obstacles before it can be \u201creliably consistent to that of other store of value assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems unlikely that any other digital asset could improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good because bitcoin is viewed by some as the most secure, decentralized, sound digital money to this point, and any \u201cimprovement\u201d would require tradeoffs,\u201d the report said.\n\nFidelity acknowledged that Ethereum\u2019s use of smart contracts, which unlocks a whole new layer of programmability, is ether\u2019s \u201ctrue differentiating factor.\u201d\n\nThe other thesis Fidelity discussed behind ether\u2019s value was its potential to generate yield through staking.\n\nThe act of staking ether on the network has changed dramatically since the Shapella upgrade in April 2023.\n\nFidelity said the payout structure for validators attesting to the blocks of each epoch and for block proposals proffer incentives to stake the maximum of 32 ETH. The base reward is proportional to validators\u2019 effective balance.\n\nThe report also pointed out that base reward is inversely proportional to the number of validators.\n\n\u201cThe rationale for this issuance formula is to ensure enough validator participation because higher yields are paid if the validator set is small, while also guaranteeing that unexpectedly high issuance will not occur if many validators participate,\u201d the report said.\n\nThis balance, Fidelity argued, has allowed Ethereum to sustain yield payouts. Plus, there are forms of yield paid out by users including MEV and tips, which supplement the network\u2019s payout burden.\n\nFidelity\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that increased activity on Ethereum does in fact drive block space demand, which in turn, generates cash flow for token holders.\n\nBut, the report said there remain \u201ccomplex, nuanced\u201d factors, including protocol and scaling upgrades, that make Ethereum\u2019s future uncertain for investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Can any Layer-1 blockchain overtake Ethereum? | KrASIA - KrASIA",
        "content": "Is Ethereum the king of Layer-1 blockchains?\n\nYour perspective on blockchain technology is likely to shape your answer, but one fact remains indisputable: Ethereum hosts an unparalleled ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s preeminent position has not gone uncontested, with numerous competitors hoping to take its place. Consider this: over half of the top 20 cryptocurrencies, based on market capitalization, are native tokens of L1 blockchains, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and BNB Smart Chain. The emergence of alternative L1 blockchains was a key theme during the 2017 and 2021 adoption cycles, when Ethereum grappled with congestion issues due to its limited blockspace, prompting users to migrate to other L1 blockchains with higher capacities and lower fees.\n\nYet, years later, Ethereum remains de facto the top L1 blockchain, while some alternatives have begun to resemble virtual \u2018ghost towns\u2019 due to stagnant or declining user counts.\n\nNevertheless, new L1 blockchains have been introduced over time, such as Aptos and Sui, to relative success. Both blockchains command a combined valuation of over USD 12 billion at the time of writing. More L1 blockchains are expected to launch at similar valuations, and some of them could rival Ethereum in due time.\n\nOverview of L1 blockchains\n\nWith more alternative L1 blockchains emerging, a question looms large: can any of them overtake Ethereum? Unpacking this question requires a review of the history of L1 blockchains and analyzing them against Ethereum.\n\nThe genesis of most L1 blockchains, including Ethereum, finds its roots in Bitcoin\u2019s limitations. Bitcoin\u2019s original purpose was to be a trustless, peer-to-peer electronic cash system. When bitcoins became gradually recognized as a legitimate asset class, developers sought to emulate it by creating digital currencies atop Bitcoin. But this was largely unsuccessful due to the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language and social layer. Frustrations of these developers led to the introduction of Ethereum as a solution.\n\nLike Bitcoin, early-stage Ethereum prioritized decentralization over scalability. As adoption grew, the network quickly hit throughput limits. This was exemplified by instances like the 2017 boom in initial coin offerings (ICOs), when the demand for blockspace far exceeded the network\u2019s capacity. Clogged for hours, Ethereum\u2019s gas fees, which are paid to conduct transactions on the blockchain, skyrocketed. A simple token transfer cost as much as USD 150 at one point.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability issues paved the way for other L1 blockchains to emerge. During the ICO boom, blockchains like EOS, Tezos, and Cardano raised hundreds of millions of dollars, promising the development of faster L1 architecture. Many cited Ethereum\u2019s low transactions per second and other limitations when raising funds.\n\nState of the market\n\nMany L1 blockchains have been launched since Ethereum\u2019s inception, but the latter has retained its place as the leader, based on market capitalization. How has Ethereum maintained its lead, and what drives its high valuation?\n\nCheaper, faster L1 blockchains win out\n\nAccording to Metcalfe\u2019s Law, users drive value, as network value is assumed to grow superlinearly to the number of users. Active user counts are difficult to assess due to the lack of anti-sybil systems and the ease of generating new addresses at will. Nonetheless, active addresses can provide a reasonable estimate of each L1 blockchain\u2019s user count.\n\nEthereum has less active users than \u2018cheaper\u2019 blockchains like Tron, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon despite its higher valuation, suggesting that user count and network value do not necessarily correlate with one another. Some other networks, such as Polkadot and Cardano, also have low active user counts, yet are valued comparatively higher, supporting this viewpoint.\n\nDevelopers, developers, developers\n\nDevelopers serve as an additional gauge of network health, as they contribute value by maintaining and enhancing the protocol layer, in addition to building applications on L1 blockchains.\n\nAccording to a report by Electric Capital, Ethereum has the highest aggregate of total active developers, though Polkadot, Cosmos, and Solana also possess notable developer counts, which could stem from them utilizing programming languages that differ from Ethereum\u2019s Solidity language.\n\nLiquidity\n\nLiquidity is crucial for L1 blockchains because it directly impacts their functionality. By stabilizing prices and enabling efficient price discovery, it empowers users to engage in trading, transactions, and network involvement.\n\nTherefore, liquidity signifies volume of tradable assets, and is typically measured using metrics such as total value locked (TVL), trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), count of trading pairs, and more.\n\nEthereum has a clear lead in terms of liquidity, with its TVL market share hovering stably around 60% since the summer of 2022, after Terra collapsed.\n\nEthereum leads, but not without asterisks\n\nWhile other factors exist, Ethereum\u2019s predominance likely stems from its liquidity and capital flows, noting its weaker position in some aspects such as user adoption rates. This may suggest that the market places significant importance on capital. The following subsections delve into the factors behind the metrics discussed above, including active user count, liquidity, and developer activity.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization, as a fundamental characteristic of blockchains, yields benefits such as improved censorship resistance, network resilience and security, among others. It instills users with the confidence to store and transact value, with higher degrees of decentralization equating to higher value attributed to an L1 blockchain.\n\nWhile decentralization can seem abstract, it can be gauged using several factors:\n\nNumber of nodes and node distribution: Nodes participate in a network to maintain its blockchains and, depending on their type, validate and relay transactions. Spreading nodes out across geographies and organizations reduces the influence of single actors, improving network resilience and security. The Nakamoto coefficient is a useful gauge, quantifying the nodes needed to achieve a majority and thereby safeguard a blockchain. A higher coefficient typically signifies stronger decentralization, though this single metric may overlook certain nuances.\n\nNodes participate in a network to maintain its blockchains and, depending on their type, validate and relay transactions.

A higher coefficient typically signifies stronger decentralization, though this single metric may overlook certain nuances. Token holder distribution: When the majority of tokens is held within a small number of wallets, owners could have the authority to dictate the development of an entire network. This could deter users from transacting on the network.\n\nWhen the majority of tokens is held within a small number of wallets, owners could have the authority to dictate the development of an entire network. This could deter users from transacting on the network. Governance model: Off-chain governance involves decision-making outside the blockchain through community coordination, while on-chain governance embeds governance directly into the protocol, enabling automated, token-based voting on changes. The impact varies. Off-chain governance is less affected by the concentration of token holders but is prone to political centralization and potentially faces high barriers to participation.\n\nOff-chain governance involves decision-making outside the blockchain through community coordination, while on-chain governance embeds governance directly into the protocol, enabling automated, token-based voting on changes. The impact varies. Off-chain governance is less affected by the concentration of token holders but is prone to political centralization and potentially faces high barriers to participation. Client diversity: Running more nodes could improve network resilience, but if a network is run only on a single client, a client bug can threaten the entire blockchain.\n\nRunning more nodes could improve network resilience, but if a network is run only on a single client, a client bug can threaten the entire blockchain. Culture: A community culture with strong values can help defend a blockchain against centralization-related risks and threats, such as Bitcoin\u2019s defense against app development in 2014. It\u2019s an underrated but pivotal aspect of decentralization.\n\nNetwork effects\n\nNetwork effects encompass various dimensions in the context of L1 blockchains. One example is the interplay between users and developers, reminiscent of Web2 platforms. User growth attracts developers, leading to new apps and use cases, thereby attracting more users, thus perpetuating the cycle.\n\nSuch effects can also manifest in other ways, including the choice of programming language. Ethereum\u2019s Solidity is a popular language, which can cultivate a larger pool of Solidity developers, fostering a bigger community and simplifying collaboration, hiring, and issue resolution. These factors could bolster innovation cycles by drawing in developers and expediting app launches.\n\nCapital network effects are crucial, especially within financial applications. They tend to emerge on networks with substantial market size and liquidity. Stakeholder support bolsters these effects. Examples include Coinbase\u2019s deposit and withdrawal features, Circle\u2019s USDC issuance, and Fireblocks\u2019 custody support.\n\nLindy effect\n\nGiven the nascency of digital assets and lack of historical data, the Lindy effect could be used to evaluate the success of L1 blockchains. It\u2019s a model that theorizes the lifespan of non-perishable things, such as blockchains, is correlated to their current age. It is, in some ways, applicable: L1 blockchains that survive a myriad of challenges, such as technical issues, hacking attempts, market volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and competition, and still retain their users, are likely better positioned to thrive in future cycles.\n\nThis model suggests that mature L1 blockchains that have hitherto stayed relevant have better odds of eventually overtaking Ethereum.\n\nHysteresis\n\nHysteresis describes how systems, once set on a path, persist, making them harder to deviate the longer their trajectory stays unchanged. For example, Ethereum\u2019s initial use of proof-of-work before transitioning to a proof-of-stake model facilitated widespread participation and token distribution. This type of distribution is incredibly difficult for new networks to replicate. Another example is FTX, despite its negative impact on the Solana ecosystem over the past few years. FTX\u2019s affiliation helped propel Solana into the mainstream and become a leading L1 blockchain and ecosystem.\n\nViewed in this context, Ethereum\u2019s leadership isn\u2019t necessarily the result of technical superiority, but a culmination of its history, momentum gained over the past decade, and compounded effects generated of its own volition.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nL1 blockchains may differentiate themselves by offering superior architecture or catering to specific niches. This could involve scalability, transaction costs, consensus mechanisms, privacy features, or specialized tools for specific industries. For example, Solana is committed to a monolithic blockchain architecture to maximize the benefits of composability and liquidity effects. Aptos and Sui offer Move as a more secure and intuitive programming language, which could make them more appealing to developers who want to minimize the occurrence of code bugs.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nA blockchain\u2019s monetary policy could be a cornerstone for its success. It dictates how the native cryptocurrency of a blockchain is issued, distributed, and potentially burned, influencing both its scarcity and value proposition. A clear, consistent, and transparent monetary policy can foster trust among participants, attract investors, and stabilize the network\u2019s economic environment.\n\nMoreover, it determines the incentives for validators or miners, thereby impacting the security and functionality of blockchains. A well-balanced monetary policy can promote growth, adoption, and stability, differentiating a blockchain and improving its long-term viability.\n\nLayer-2 blockchains\n\nAlternative L1 blockchains are not the only way to scale anymore. Rollups became a key aspect of Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap in October 2020. Since then, they have gradually garnered market share from other blockchains. Arbitrum and Optimism\u2014both optimistic rollups\u2014have more active users and TVL than most L1 blockchains. Coinbase\u2019s optimistic rollup, Base, has also been gaining traction.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, optimistic, zero-knowledge, and application-specific rollups all constitute integral components of the Ethereum ecosystem. When viewed holistically, the hurdle to overtake Ethereum becomes significantly higher.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nDetermining whether another L1 blockchain can overtake Ethereum is an exercise fraught with potential folly. The technology landscape, especially in a nascent field like crypto, is in constant flux and rife with uncertainties. The question also implies zero-sum thinking, suggesting that one L1 blockchain\u2019s win is another\u2019s loss. It may be more prudent to heed the words of Warren Buffett, who aptly stated: \u201cForecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster \u2026 they tell you nothing about the future.\u201d\n\nIt seems likeliest that Ethereum will retain its leading position for the foreseeable future. It stands out in terms of decentralization and its ecosystem is pioneering a myriad of frontier technologies such as scaling and privacy solutions, zero-knowledge applications, and more.\n\nAmong the alternative L1 blockchains, Solana is seemingly the most promising contender. Its monolithic architecture is meaningfully different from Ethereum\u2019s, and it is the only other network with multiple validator clients. Its community, hardened by recent events, is one of the most vibrant and ardent. Concurrently, its ecosystem teems with innovation, giving rise to solutions such as xNFTs, compressed NFTs, state compression, the Solana Mobile Stack, and more.\n\nThis article was adapted based on a feature originally written by Steven Shi and published on Amber Labs\u2019 Substack.

        "content": "RocketPool, Stakewise, Stader Labs and Diva Staking have agreed to limit their share of the Ethereum staking market to 22% as part of an effort to make sure the network stays decentralized.\n\nA group of Ethereum staking service providers have agreed to a self-imposed limit which would restrict the amount of the staking market they control.\n\nSuperphiz, a member of the Ethereum staking community, said in an Aug. 31 post on X that RocketPool, Stakewise, Stader Labs and Diva Staking were all in the process of committing to an agreed-upon limit to not own more than 22% of all Ethereum validators.\n\nThese providers are committed (or are in the process of committing) to self-limit to <22% of Ethereum validators.

Finalization refers to the state of the blockchain which guarantees transactions within a block cannot be altered.\n\n\u201cThis is a low bar, but a good start,\u201d Superphiz said, adding that the first step was to make sure a staking service did not gain control of 33% of validators.\n\nIn the event that it happens, he noted that they would essentially have the power to prevent finalization if they chose, and even resist a forced slash by the network.\n\nSome users pointed out that verbal commitments such as this one were easy to make when the likelihood of one staking service provider reaching 22% of market share was fairly low.\n\nVerbal commitments from some of these solutions will melt away as quickly too \u2013 if & when they do reach the 22% threshold. Network security should not be based on such commitments in the first place \u2014 Neel Daftary \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@DaftaryNeel) August 31, 2023\n\nOthers highlighted that Lido already controls 32.4% of the staking market, with the amount of ETH staked through the platform amounting to over 22% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. Interestingly, 99.8% of the Lido community voted against imposing a self-limit on its share of the staking market in June."

EELS provides complete snapshots of the protocol at each fork, making it easier to follow.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n* Ethereum unveils EELS, a Python-based reference implementation for its execution client.\n\n* EELS aims to be a more programmer-friendly successor to the Yellow Paper.\n\n* The project has been in development for over a year and is backed by ConsenSys' Quilt team and the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthereum has publicly introduced the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification (EELS), a Python reference implementation designed to make the core components of an Ethereum execution client more readable and clear. Developed over more than a year, EELS is intended to be a \"spiritual successor to the Yellow Paper\" and is focused on \"readability and clarity.\"\n\nBackground and Context\n\nThe EELS project comes on the heels of significant upgrades to the Ethereum network, notably the Shapella upgrade. Shapella, which went live on April 12, 2023, followed \"The Merge\" and enabled validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. It also introduced new functionalities to both the execution and consensus layers. The Shapella upgrade was first tested on the Sepolia testnet and was a collaborative effort that combined changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella), and the Engine API.\n\nWhat is EELS?\n\nEELS is an \"execution layer reference implementation in Python\" that is \"up to date with mainnet.\" It can \"fill and execute state tests\" and \"follow mainnet.\" The project aims to provide complete snapshots of the protocol at each fork, making it easier to follow than EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and production clients, which often mix multiple forks in the same code path.\n\nTechnical Features\n\nEELS is \"just regular Python\" and can be tested like any other Python library. It supports the entire \"ethereum/tests\" suite and also includes a selection of \"pytest\" tests. The project does not implement peer-to-peer networking and requires a production client to sync blocks.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nWhile EELS is still \"a bit rough around the edges,\" it aims to become the \"default way to specify Core EIPs\" and the \"first place EIP authors go to prototype their proposals.\" Those interested in contributing can join the \"#specifications\" channel or pick an issue from the project's repository.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of EELS marks a significant step in Ethereum's ongoing efforts to make its execution layer more accessible and understandable. By providing a Python-based, readable, and testable reference implementation, EELS aims to serve as a valuable resource for both developers and researchers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Popped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have rallied sharply this week, but that rally cooled off over the last 24 hours. Tuesday's jump was driven by Grayscale's win over the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court, which could pave the way for more crypto ETFs, but the rally hasn't lasted.\n\nBetween noon ET on Tuesday and 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the value of Bitcoin (BTC 1.14%) fell 2.7%, Ethereum (ETH 0.47%) was down 1.9%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 0.53%) dropped 2.1%. But the cryptocurrencies are up 2.9%, 1.4%, and 2.2% over the past week, so there has been a rally overall.\n\nSo what\n\nThe court's ruling yesterday that the SEC must review the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust application to convert into an ETF could pave the way for more Bitcoin ETFs. And that could open up more crypto ETFs for Ethereum or even Dogecoin.\n\nWhat the judge's ruling doesn't guarantee is that any ETFs will actually be approved. The SEC just needs to review the application and treat it like any other Bitcoin ETF application, which hasn't yet been approved. So, it's back to a waiting game for investors.\n\nWhat we have seen is repeated wins for the crypto industry in court. The Ripple ruling in July paved the way for cryptocurrencies to be regulated more like commodities rather than securities, and now trading options may be opening up via ETFs.\n\nIt's not clear when there will be a final ruling on a Bitcoin ETF or if an answer on what's a commodity and what's a security will be coming, but this was seen as a positive sign for the industry.\n\nNow what\n\nThe bounce in values on Tuesday is what's reversing today. There was at least some hope that this would lead to more ETFs and more certainty for the industry, but as the market has processed the ruling, it's clear that's not what happened.\n\nThat said, the court being more friendly to the crypto industry should be an incremental positive long term. Trading has all but dried up for most cryptocurrencies, and that's left the industry in an uncertain place. The regulatory uncertainty hasn't helped, but if that gets answered, there's billions of dollars of investment that's gone into companies building on the blockchain. That's where the real innovation will take place that could cause values to increase.\n\nFor now, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic when there's a positive ruling, but the bounce doesn't last long because there's no fundamental change in the market. That's what's holding values back and why we get the pop and then the slow drop of the last 36 hours. Expect that trend to continue until there's regulatory clarity, which at this rate could still be years away."

        "title": "Ethereum Registers More Long-term Holders Than Bitcoin in 2023 - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] have remained unrivaled in terms of their standing. Nevertheless, there has been a major shift in a lot of aspects. Data provided by IntoTheBlock indicated that Ethereum currently has 73.9 million long-term holders. However, Bitcoin has 33.6 million HODLers, showcasing a disparity of over 40 million between the two assets.\n\nWhile both digital currencies encountered an expansion in this regard when examining year-over-year information, Ethereum once again outperformed with a significant surge of 44.2%, in contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s modest growth of 17%. The foremost position for achieving the highest percentage increase was claimed by Cardano [ADA], as it observed a remarkable upsurge of 170% in its long-term holders over the past year. Following suit, Litecoin [LTC] also exhibited a notable increase of 100%. Dogecoin [DOGE], the OG meme coin and one of the earliest cryptocurrencies, encountered a 26% rise. Currently, it entails 3.4 million long-term holders.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nThere are multiple factors behind Ethereum\u2019s overtaking of Bitcoin. Firstly, the ETH network has continuously evolved since its inception. Ethereum\u2019s journey began with the intention of establishing itself as a programmable network. Notably, significant transformation was introduced through events like The Merge, which brought about substantial changes across the network. Conversely, Bitcoin has retained its role as a peer-to-peer payment network and a store of value for its stakeholders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supremacy in the realm of decentralized finance [DeFi] stands unchallenged. The restricted capabilities of Bitcoin undeniably provide Ethereum with an advantage. The ETH network extends its functionality beyond merely serving as a digital currency. It encompasses features like decentralized applications and intelligent contracts.\n\nDespite a significant drop in the amount of value that Ethereum has secured within the DeFi sector, it continues to maintain a lead over Bitcoin. Among the $38 billion that is locked within the DeFi landscape, Ethereum holds a substantial share of $22.31 billion. In comparison, Bitcoin has a relatively modest amount of $162.6 million locked within this domain.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Is Becoming \u2018Cheaper\u2019 Amidst Rising L2 Transactions\n\nPrice and profitability\n\nRegarding price, Bitcoin has unquestionably outperformed as it predates the introduction of ETH. Bitcoin\u2019s price and market cap have remained unmatched for the longest time.\n\nThe second-largest crypto has witnessed a remarkable increase of 61,363.72% over its complete timeline. In contrast, BTC has achieved an even more extraordinary overall growth of 44.22 million. Similarly, a greater percentage of Bitcoin holders are in a profitable position when compared with Ethereum. Information from IntoTheBlock indicated that approximately 63% of BTC holders are currently in profit, while only 56% of ETH holders are experiencing gains at the present value of the asset. In spite of Bitcoin\u2019s performance, Ethereum has succeeded in attracting a larger number of long-term holders. This also suggested that the market\u2019s dynamics extend beyond valuation.\n\nAlso Read: Is Ethereum Better than Bitcoin?"

        "content": "Large holders of Ethereum (ETH) have displayed bearish behavior on the second-largest crypto asset by market cap since around April, according to Santiment.\n\nSantiment\u2019s director of marketing Brian Quinlivan says that addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH turned bearish around April, a contrast to their bullish stance witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cThere has been about a 4-month long dump in supply from addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH.\n\nThey really were accumulating significantly at the end of last year, but profit taking from these key tiers happened hard and quickly right as the price was hitting around a 1-year high of approximately $2,120.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,641 at time of writing.\n\nOn the likely impact of the sharks and whales\u2019 behavior on the price of Ethereum going forward, Quinlivan says,\n\n\u201cThis continued tailslide in supply held by sharks and whales is something we need to monitor. Prices can still rise as they take profit, and their holdings are far from a perfect correlation. But in terms of a signal for an immediate return to $2,000 and above, it certainly isn\u2019t being perpetuated by whales.\u201d\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s director of marketing, Ethereum\u2019s transaction and trade volumes have demonstrated a positive correlation with the price of ETH.\n\n\u201cAs far as utility goes, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s [co-creator of Ethereum] project has slumped mightily, with on-chain transaction volume and trading volume seeing a significant drop since peaking in early November of last year.\n\nThough not necessarily a red flag for any asset, this is indicative of the crowd simply showing disinterest during a time when many traders really can\u2019t decide whether the $1,650 price level is overvalued or undervalued.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "In an effort to expand its exposure toward cryptocurrencies, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD has added wallet support for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\n\n\n\nEarlier, the Robinhood wallet \u2014 a multi-chain, self-custody and Web3 wallet \u2014 was restricted to sending and receiving tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain only. However, as customers asked for more assets on more chains, Robinhood decided to expand its product offerings.\n\n\n\nThe company said that now all users of Robinhood wallet can send and receive Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Robinhood has begun rolling out swap features for selected users that allow them to trade Ethereum for more than 200 different assets.\n\n\n\nThe Robinhood wallet can charge gas fees from its users, which is the price for transacting on Ethereum, from any tokens they hold.\n\n\n\nThus, the crypto wallet will now allow users to own, send and receive crypto on Arbitrum, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Optimism and Polygon networks; swap cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and Polygon; and connect to a wide range of decentralized applications.\n\n\n\nThe Robinhood wallet, which combines a simple and intuitive design with powerful tools that push the boundaries of a typical wallet, gives its users full control over their cryptocurrencies such that only they can hold and maintain the private keys to their assets.\n\n\n\nThe Robinhood wallet was launched for the general public six months ago. Since then, the wallet has seen significant adoption globally, with hundreds of thousands of users in more than 140 countries.\n\n\n\nOver the past six months, shares of Robinhood have gained 13.7% against the 10% decline of the industry.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, HOOD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nUntil July 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency did not grant permission to banks in the United States to hold cryptocurrencies. The amendment post-July gave banks the go-ahead to begin exploring cryptocurrency operations.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, banks were not very interested in the crypto and digital asset space. But, after witnessing increased demand for the emerging market, banks and financial institutions started to embrace cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, JPMorgan JPM became the first major bank in the United States to allow its financial advisors to give all its wealth-management clients access to cryptocurrency funds. Next month, it came to light that JPMorgan was offering its Private Bank wealth management customers access to an in-house passively managed bitcoin fund. The offering was being made in partnership with bitcoin powerhouse New York Digital Investment Group.\n\n\n\nJPMorgan also launched a division focused on digital assets named Onyx. The Wall Street giant even launched its digital currency, JPM Coin.\n\n\n\nIn August 2022, BlackRock, Inc. BLK partnered with cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global, to provide its institutional clients access to digital currencies.\n\n\n\nThrough the partnership, BLK\u2019s institutional clients have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage and reporting via Coinbase Prime, which is the exchange\u2019s institutional platform, providing a wide range of features and tools.\n\n\n\nAlso, BLK launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States. The fund seeks to track the performance of Bitcoin, less expenses and liabilities of the trust.\n\n\n\nHowever, in July 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that the application filed by BLK for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was inadequate.\n\n\n\nReportedly, the filing did not have enough detail with respect to the \u201csurveillance-sharing agreements.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Espresso co-founder Jill Gunter recalls Ethereum\u2019s ICO token heyday, when she first tried to buy into a token sale.\n\nComparing the experience to the ruthlessly competitive efforts to acquire Taylor Swift tickets, Gunter felt compelled to \u201ckeep putting in higher and higher fees to try and get my transaction actually accepted.\u201d\n\nGunter says it was then that she realized that the nodes running Ethereum were operated by \u201cactual humans,\u201d who could insert their own transactions and front-run the crowd. \u201cOr, they were just asking for astronomically high fees in order to get your transactions into the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that this was a fair, decentralized system,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat are the dynamics at play here?\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Chase Chapman on the On the Other Side podcast (Spotify/Apple), Gunter delves into the complexities and pitfalls of Ethereum\u2019s transaction environment.\n\nThe ICO token sale, Gunter says, was her first interaction with maximum extractable value, or MEV. It\u2019s a buzzword, Gunter explains, that describes the value that participants operating the system can extract from it by ordering transactions in a way that favors them.\n\nNaive crypto users might imagine transactions entering a waiting room and then getting picked up in an orderly manner, Gunter says. In reality, she explains, certain network participants can insert transactions between multiple sets in order to capture arbitrage between two decentralized orders or frontrun a transaction if it\u2019s set at an unfavorable price.\n\n\u201cYou as a user,\u201d Chapman adds, \u201care now having to deal with, basically, miners who should be relatively neutral but are no longer neutral because they\u2019re playing this weird meta game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean that they should be neutral?\u201d Gunter asks. \u201cPart of the reason why this works is because there\u2019s this game theoretic around this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are these surprise dynamics that then we have to figure out,\u201d she says. \u201cAs the architects of these systems, how do we want to approach this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen crop up are all kinds of approaches to mitigate the negative effects of MEV, this notion of extractable value from smart or clever ordering of transactions.\u201d\n\nGunter mentions the example of specialized actors who build blocks and order transactions in a way that makes \u201cmaximal economic sense,\u201d performed independently from nodes in a process called proposer builder separation (PBS).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interaction that happens between the builder and the proposer now, and this is actually the case for how most Ethereum transactions work today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lied to all of these years\u201d\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive, Gunter says, \u201cbecause you might hear, \u2018Oh, there are these specialized players who are just taking all the value.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the idea is to figure out how to make the system as efficient as possible, Gunter says, and then determine ways to redistribute that value back to users while combating monopolistic tendencies.\n\n\u201cWhen I first found out about this, my mind was blown,\u201d Gunter says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I have no idea how anything works.\u2019 I\u2019ve been lied to all of these years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually that nefarious, rest assured, but this is indeed again, how most of Ethereum actually does function today.\u201d\n\nGunter acknowledges, \u201cthere are no perfect solutions to this that we\u2019ve come up with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have this decentralized open source financial infrastructure that we\u2019re building,\u201d Gunter says. She contrasts the open transparency of Ethereum development with the \u201cWall Street Flash Boys dynamic,\u201d where no one knew that a few specialized firms were secretly frontrunning the stock market for years. It was this phenomenon that inspired the name of MEV mitigating organization, Flashbots.\n\n\u201cI am very glad and grateful that all of this research is going on and that these issues are being addressed and discovered out in the open.\u201d\n\nChapman observes the double edged sword nature of transparency in blockchain. \u201cSo many things in the crypto ecosystem are so transparent that sometimes it feels like we have way more problems than anyone else does.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut really we just know. We can all see everything. All our shit is out in the open and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018that is not great.\u2019 And I think that does push us forward.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Data recorded on the blockchain is often perceived as everlasting, and in many ways, it is. Ethereum, for instance, is expected to operate for as long as the internet exists. Every piece of data in every block is publicly accessible, forming a continuous chain from its genesis in 2015 to the present \u2014 18+ million blocks later.\n\nBut when it comes to smart contracts, only the previous 256 blocks \u2014 less than an hour of data \u2014 are accessible.\n\nAccessing all of Ethereum\u2019s historical data relies heavily on platforms like Etherscan, which indexes the data off-chain, and oracles like Chainlink. While these are essential tools, they require users to trust the data providers.\n\nRelic Protocol, developed by blockchain security firm ChainLight, instead offers a trust-minimized way for smart contracts to call upon Ethereum\u2019s vast history, replacing platforms with pure mathematical precision.\n\nV2, which launched today, will now bring that data to other blockchains as well, starting with zkSync Era.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the building blocks for the app developers to build on top of,\u201d Brian Pak, ChainLight\u2019s CEO, told Blockworks.\n\nBayo Akins, who handles business development at zkSync developer Matter Labs, noted that Relic is the first oracle provider on zkSync to use zk-SNARKs as part of their oracle design.\n\n\u201cThis deployment not only improves data accessibility and cost-efficiency in the Ethereum scaling ecosystem but also provides developers with the tools they need to innovate and operate trustlessly,\u201d said Akins.\n\nRelic Protocol enables access to the data on-chain thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, removing the need to trust traditional oracles. It stores historical data in a compressed format, allowing developers to prove certain past facts. For example, a user can verify Uniswap pricing for a specific token from a year ago \u2014 all within a smart contract \u2014 without needing to push that data on-chain from an oracle.\n\nThis could be a boon for applications like borrowing and lending markets. Historical price volatility data could be used to tweak lending parameters trustlessly, minimizing the need for governance involvement.\n\nThat\u2019s not possible today. Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, by design, depend on third-party data sources to access older data, due to the so-called \u201cBLOCKHASH\u201d operation in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe reason for the 256 block lookback period is largely pragmatic: Maintaining the hash of every block ever produced would require substantial and ever-growing storage requirements on every Ethereum node and would be detrimental to the system\u2019s scalability and performance.\n\nIf a smart contract needs access to data from blocks older than that, the workarounds available require trust assumptions and can be costly.\n\nEthereum\u2019s history has shown the status quo is not ideal. For instance, DeFi protocols have suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses due to oracle manipulation attacks.\n\nSimilar approaches\n\nOther teams have set out to tackle the same problem.\n\nAt the StarkWare Summit in San Francisco, Herodotus, a startup working on storage proof technology, today debuted an \u201con-chain accumulator\u201d which uses STARK proving and will also make historical Ethereum data accessible on Starknet.\n\nBy early October, the whole history should become verifiable, according to StarkWare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an innovation that is sorely needed to bring Ethereum in line with the principles of transparency and accessibility that are so central in blockchain communities,\u201d said Kacper Koziol, co-founder of Herodotus.\n\nStarkware president Eli Ben-Sasson noted that the work by Herodotus will boost layer-2 usability and transparency.\n\n\u201cWhen we started scaling on layer 2, we said to ourselves that this is going to lead to all sorts of out-of-the-box ideas that we can\u2019t yet envisage, and it\u2019s so exciting to see this happening,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nA ChainLight spokesperson noted Herodotus is also working on zkSync support.\n\nFairer airdrops\n\nOn the identity front, the Relic Protocol can facilitate the creation of an account\u2019s reputation based on its past interactions with the blockchain.\n\nThat can come in handy for prospective DAOs looking to distribute a governance token using an airdrop scheme. Currently, developers have to use an Ethereum archive node to take a snapshot in time and determine which accounts interacted with a given protocol or had a certain token balance.\n\nFrom that, they typically build a Merkel tree to determine how many tokens a given account qualifies for, and finally deploy an airdrop contract with that Merkel tree root. Users then connect and provide a Merkel proof to receive their tokens.\n\nTrust is required each step of the way; the archive node or the person deploying the airdrop contract could maliciously corrupt the data in a way that\u2019s hard to detect, ChainLight\u2019s chief technology officer Andrew Wesie said in a presentation last month.\n\nRelic saves those steps. \u201cInstead they just call into Relic to verify that the account should be eligible for the airdrop,\u201d Wesie said, who pointed to the use of a storage or transaction proof, for instance.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s really about taking something that used to require off-chain centralized trusted service and instead of bringing it on-chain and doing it in a way that is trustless,\u201d he said.\n\nChainLight envisions a world where the benefits of both Ethereum and zkSync can be seamlessly integrated, offering developers the best of both worlds, and without sacrificing decentralization. Through an open-source SDK, developers can access circuits and smart contracts.\n\nLike Herodotus, ChainLight has plans to extend support to more chains.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is not just enhancing options on zkSync Era to meet the differing needs of application developers, but it will open the path for new use cases to be created,\u201d Matter Labs\u2019 Akins said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Shiba Inu: How To Withdraw Crypto From Shibarium to Ethereum - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The Shiba Inu [SHIB] ecosystem is actively demonstrating its significance beyond being a mere meme coin. The dedication directed towards Shibarium, the layer-2 network, serves as evidence of this evolution. Despite facing heckles during its initial launch, it has steadily advanced over time, as evidenced by an increased adoption rate.\n\nHowever, some individuals remain confused about the mechanics of the layer-2 network. As Shibarium isn\u2019t yet compatible with all decentralized applications or exchanges, certain users might be interested in understanding how to transfer their assets back from Shibarium to Ethereum. This article aims to provide a step-by-step guide for the same.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium Records 100K Wallet Addresses Post Relaunch\n\nTransferring funds from Shibarium to Ethereum\n\nTo begin, it is essential to make sure that users possess an adequate amount of ETH in their accounts. For those planning to withdraw to Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to do so so that the associated gas fees are covered. The cost of gas fees can fluctuate based on the level of network congestion and demand. There are a total of seven steps to withdraw funds from Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium.\n\nTo start off, go to the official Shibarium website. Following this, select the Menu icon located at the top of the page. This action will assist in transitioning to the Bridge section. Please ensure that your wallet is already connected beforehand.\n\nOnce you are in the Bridge section, two options will appear: Deposit and Withdraw. Select Withdraw, then pick the token you intend to withdraw and input the desired amount.\n\nAn overview of the withdrawal procedure will be provided. This overview displays the withdrawn amount, the estimated time for the withdrawal to be completed, and the anticipated fee.\n\nTo facilitate the transition from Shibarium to Ethereum, it\u2019s necessary to initiate a cap request. This request enables assets to be transferred until the specified amount is reached. Users are advised to input a rounded figure in this step.\n\nYour transaction will appear as pending as it goes through three stages: initialized, checkpoint, and challenges.\n\nOnce the transaction reaches the final stage, it will enter the processing queue and might take up to seven days to be fully processed.\n\nThings to keep in mind\n\nShibarium employs a plasma bridge, which can result in a longer process. The plasma bridge functions as a security mechanism. It has regular checkpoints and exit challenges to guarantee the safety and accuracy of transactions. Consequently, withdrawals from Shibarium to Ethereum are not instant as they require some time to be fully completed. Lucie, a member of the SHIB community, elaborated on the same and said,\n\n\u201cPatience is Key: Why the wait? When moving from Layer 2 (L2) using a plasma bridge, delays are common. It\u2019s not just Shibarium\u2014this happens with all L2 solutions using plasma bridge.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Shytoshi Provides Last & Final Updates About Shibarium"

        "content": "Ethereum client Nethermind on Wednesday said it has released an update for validators clients and node operators to effectively update to the upcoming Holesky testnet. Meanwhile, Ethereum clients have started offering updates in response to the Holesky testnet launch on September 15, which marks a significant step in Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\n\nEthereum Client Releases Major Upgrade For Holesky Testnet\n\nEthereum execution layer client Nethermind released the v1.20.2 upgrade for the upcoming Holesky testnet launch on September 15 at 14:00 UTC. Holeskey testnet is set to replace the long-running Goerli testnet.\n\nadvertisement\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NethermindEth/status/1696806516584574997\n\nAccording to Ethereum developers, Holesky is the first long-standing, merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum testnet. Holesky will replace Goerli as a staking, infrastructure, and protocol-developer testnet.\n\nIn order to use Nethermind with this new chain, users need to run different configs for the Snap Synced node and archival mode setup. Then follow with running a consensus layer client that supports the Holesky network.\n\nEthereum core developer Tim Beiko earlier stated the popular Goerli testnet will eventually shut down as application developers\u2019 usage grew exponentially, making it less reliable for future upgrades.\n\nIn a recent Execution Layer Meeting, core developers revealed some testing updates from Devnet-8 and Holesky testnet. The Devnet-8 is the test network for the Cancun upgrade After the Shanghai upgrade, the Ethereum team is working on the Cancun upgrade, bringing account abstraction, enhancing scaling, and improving storage effectiveness.\n\nRead More: ETH Price Prediction As Surprise Rally Breaks $1,700, Climbing $2k Next?\n\nETH Price Rises 5%\n\nEthereum is mostly deflationary after the Merge and Shanghai upgrades, moving between $1500 and $2000. Despite selloffs by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, ETH price hasn\u2019t moved much.\n\nETH price jumped 5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1720. The 24-hour low and high are $1639 and $1734, respectively. Furthermore, trading volume has increased by more than 150% due to Grayscale\u2019s victory against the U.S. SEC.\n\nAlso Read:"

        "content": "Ethereum has rapidly become the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. With its recent transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model and its expanded capabilities, Ethereum\u2019s future looks bright. This guide provides a data-driven Ethereum price prediction for the short, medium and long-term.\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015. Like Bitcoin, it uses a blockchain to store transaction records. But Ethereum\u2019s key innovation was enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on its blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain serves as a secured public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform that acts as \u2018gas\u2019 to power transactions and run smart contracts.\n\nSome key aspects of Ethereum include:\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThese are applications that run exactly as programmed without risk of downtime or third-party interference.\n\nDecentralized platform\n\nEthereum operates via a global peer-to-peer network, avoiding centralized control.\n\nProgrammable blockchain\n\nDevelopers can use Ethereum to build and deploy decentralized applications of all kinds.\n\nProof-of-stake consensus\n\nEthereum has transitioned to a more efficient proof-of-stake system called Casper that requires less energy.\n\nThese features make Ethereum extremely versatile and a promising platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, dApps and much more.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum Price\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been explosive, but not without volatility. Here are some factors that affect ETH prices.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Trends\n\nLike most cryptos, Ethereum price depends heavily on trends in the overall crypto market. Bitcoin\u2019s price actions in particular have a ripple effect on altcoins.\n\nGas Fees and Transaction Costs\n\nEthereum gas fees rising during times of network congestion reduces usage and can suppress price. Efforts like scaling solutions aim to lower transaction costs.\n\nMainstream Adoption\n\nWith increasing real-world Ethereum usage cases in DeFi, NFTs etc. mainstream adoption is rising, leading to higher demand and prices.\n\nCompetition\n\nWhile Ethereum is the dominant smart contract platform currently, competition from projects like Solana, Cardano etc. can potentially erode its market share and affect ETH prices.\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulatory crackdowns or increased clarity on crypto/Ethereum can both positively and negatively impact prices by affecting investor sentiment.\n\nTechnology Upgrades\n\nRecent Ethereum developments like the Merge upgrade to proof-of-stake or ETH 2.0 implementating sharding may improve capabilities and affect value over time.\n\nBurning Ether\n\nBurning ETH taken out of circulation through EIP-1559 helps reduce supply and may gradually increase the value of remaining Ether.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nEthereum launched in 2015 at an initial price of around $0.30. Here is a look at key price developments since then.\n\n2015-2017 \u2013 The Early Days\n\nAfter launch, Ethereum traded in the $1-$15 range till early 2017. As crypto markets gained steam in 2017, Ethereum shot up to $380 by June.\n\nSeveral factors drove growth:\n\nIncreasing developer adoption with global Ethereum hackathons held in 2017. Hundreds of projects were built on Ethereum.\n\nMainstream coverage of Ethereum as a revolutionary technology in magazines like Forbes\n\nICO boom \u2013 projects raising millions via Ethereum-based ICOs bought Ether at inflated prices\n\nThis growth was unsustainable long-term and by September 2018, ETH had fallen to around $170. But immense developer interest and real-world usage potential was now apparent.\n\n2018-2020 \u2013 Building During the Bear Market\n\nIn the 2018-2020 bear market, Ethereum stayed afloat better than most altcoins, remaining above $100.\n\nMajor mileposts include:\n\nDespite market conditions, steady progress continued on Ethereum 2.0 upgrades like Beacon Chain, proof-of-stake, and sharding.\n\nIncreasing DeFi (decentralized finance) dominance with Ethereum facilitating over 90% of activity and billions in value.\n\nLaunch of Ethereum-based Tether (USDT), the most used stablecoin. USDT transactions dwarfed payment coins.\n\nERC-20 standard became the de-facto for issuing new tokens. Most ICOs continued to launch on Ethereum.\n\nThis demonstrated Ethereum\u2019s real-world utility and helped prevent steeper declines.\n\n2021 \u2013 2022 \u2013 From Mainstream Mania To Manic Depression\n\n2021 marked a parabolic rise for Ethereum, breaking out beyond crypto circles into mainstream recognition. The parabolic rise also brought an abrupt peak, sending Ethereum prices crashing all throughout 2022 as the US Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to the highest levels in decades.\n\nKey factors driving this bull run:\n\nContinued DeFi growth, with the total value locked in DeFi rising from $20B to over $100B during 2021.\n\nNFT mania beginning in early 2021, with Ethereum hosting headline-grabbing sales like Beeple\u2019s $69 million digital art piece.\n\nEthereum network upgrades like Berlin hard fork and London\u2019s EIP-1559 built investor confidence.\n\nLarge companies like Visa and JP Morgan began settling transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInstitutional investment rose with SEC allowing Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nThis perfect storm took ETH from under $800 in January 2021 to an all-time high of $4,800 in November 2021. In 2022 the crypto market endured a painful bear market, with Ethereum dropping below $1,000.\n\nHowever, a major milestone was reached in September 2022, with Ethereum completing The Merge upgrade to become a proof-of-stake blockchain. This reduced Ethereum inflation and carbon footprint.\n\nWhile sentiments remain low currently, The Merge was a huge technological leap cementing Ethereum\u2019s lead in blockchain development. The stage is potentially set for the next bull market.\n\nRecent Ethereum Price Performance\n\nUnlike Bitcoin which found a local bear market bottom in November 2022, Ethereum set a local low in mid-June at around $878 per ETH. An almost immediate bounce took Ether over double from the low to $2,000, but retested $1,000 before the year ended. Throughout 2023 while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recovered, Ethereum\u2019s rally has been relatively muted.\n\nIn August 2023, Ethereum once again retested $1,500, possibly putting in a lower low before the start of a more substantial rally or collapse.\n\nShort Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023\n\nSince the 2022 local bottom, Ethereum has been forming an Ascending Triangle pattern. This is predominantly a bullish pattern, but can occasionally appear in a bear market before the final move in a sequence, ultimately breaking down.\n\nTargets based on the measure rule put an immediate upside breakout around $3,800 per ETH, while a breakdown would send Ether back down to $871 for a double possible double bottom or new low. With only a few months left in 2023, trajectories will be limited based on time.\n\nMedium Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024 \u2013 2025\n\nBased on historical 4-year market cycles and Elliott Wave Principle patterns, Ethereum appears to be at a critical junction, where it could retrace further and break down from a large rising wedge structure, or could rally and fill out the upper portion of the pattern one more time.\n\nThe black-colored wave scenario puts ETHUSD at $10,000 between 2024 and 2025. Meanwhile, the red-colored corrective wave scenario suggests Ether will reach around $440 during a C-wave of continuation.\n\nLong Term Ethereum Price Prediction for 2030 and Beyond\n\nIf Ethereum establishes itself as the primary platform for decentralized apps and finance by 2030, its utility could be immense. Based on a long-term linear mean, Ethereum could fluctuate between $20,000 and nearly $100,000 per ETH by the year 2030 arrives.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions by Experts\n\nHere what some industry experts and analysts forecast for Ethereum:\n\nPopular analyst Benjamin Cowen is conservative in his Ethereum price prediction, claiming that \u201cEthereum has the potential to eventually achieve $10,000 to $15,000 per ETH in the next five to ten years.\u201d He cautions that scaling needs to be achieved without diluting ETH\u2019s value.\n\nRealVision CEO Raoul Pal predicts ETH at $20,000 by 2025. CertiK CEO Ronghui Gu forecasts Ethereum at $30,000 to $50,000 by 2030. Justin Bennett sees ETH potentially reaching $40,000 if bullish sentiment returns.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction FAQs\n\nHere are some common questions about Ethereum price predictions:\n\nWhat was Ethereum\u2019s lowest price?\n\nEthereum hit record lows between $0.4 to $0.7 in 2015 and 2016 during its earliest days. Its recent low was around $800 in June 2022.\n\nWhat was Ethereum\u2019s highest price?\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time high price was $4,891 reached in November 2021. It also briefly exceeded $4,600 in the same month.\n\nHow high can Ethereum realistically go long-term?\n\nBased on expert forecasts and models, Ethereum potentially could reach over $100,000 by 2030, and even $500,000+ in the 2050 timeframe as a bull case scenario if it achieves global adoption.\n\nCan Ethereum drop to zero?\n\nWhile unlikely, the possibility that Ethereum drops to near zero can\u2019t be ruled out entirely. Competition, failure to scale sufficiently, or critical bugs in the codebase are threats.\n\nWhy is Ethereum price volatile?\n\nAs a relatively new asset class, Ethereum is prone to high volatility. Speculation, hype cycles, and changing investor sentiment amplify price swings.\n\nWhen will Ethereum\u2019s price stabilize?\n\nEthereum price volatility should stabilize significantly once it achieves full-scale mainstream adoption as a blockchain platform, which could happen within the next 5-10 years.\n\nWill Ethereum go up in 2023?\n\nThe most likely scenario based on market trends is Ethereum rising gradually throughout 2023, although price will remain volatile in the short-term.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: The crypto market experienced a slight uplift, courtesy of Grayscale\u2019s triumph over the SEC. While some investors cashed in their profits, a majority of the cryptocurrencies continued to reflect bullish tendencies. Ethereum is now under the microscope, with many wondering if it will hit the $2,000 mark before January 2024.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price UP?\n\nAfter consolidating briefly around the $1,650 mark, Ethereum leaped towards $1,750, registering a remarkable increase of more than x% in just 24 hours. While some profit-booking did take place, the price has now stabilized around $1,705. The rally can be attributed to Grayscale\u2019s successful lawsuit against the SEC, which has reignited the flame of hope for wider cryptocurrency acceptance.\n\nWhat is Grayscale Investments?\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Grayscale Investments is not a new player on the block. Established by Barry Silbert in 2013, it has been a giant in the digital currency asset management space. As of my last update in September 2021, Grayscale was recognized as one of the dominant institutional holders of Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Ethereum reach $2,000?\n\nThe million-dollar question: Will Ethereum climb to $2,000? All signs seem to lean towards a positive trajectory. If Ethereum can consistently hold above the $1,700 price level, we might witness a steady climb towards the coveted $2,000 mark. This optimism stems from Ethereum breaking through a significant medium-term resistance, generally seen as a bullish sign. However, like any financial forecast, there are caveats. Should Ethereum fall below $1,680, the scenario could change, dragging it down to a range between $1,600 and $1,650.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "BINANCE BUZZ: There\u2019s been a lot of news over the past week on the big U.S. crypto exchange \u2013 some of it good, some not so good, some neutral. The overarching theme is that the company expanded rapidly in recent years, and now it\u2019s facing intense scrutiny from regulators, having to retrench in some business lines and regions, while pivoting in others. Binance this week cut ties with five sanctioned Russian banks listed on the exchange\u2019s peer-to-peer service for transferring funds in rubles. The move came just days after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance was enabling peer-to-peer trades of rubles for digital tokens, frequently involving banks on Western blacklists \u2013 a popular method for Russians to transfer money abroad. Binance said it was discontinuing its crypto-backed debit card in Bahrain and Latin America, where it has been available for less than a year. According to Reuters, Mastercard decided to end the programs. Then on Tuesday, Binance announced it had launched a new crypto-based program Send Cash that will allow users in nine Latin American countries to transfer money directly into friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 bank accounts in Colombia and Argentina. In Belgium, Binance has been ordered to cease operations by the country\u2019s local regulator, but customers can continue using the exchange via a Polish entity. On the trading side, Binance announced that, starting Wednesday, it would offer \u201cT+3\u201d daily options contracts allowing traders to bet on the BNB token over a three-day period. The BNB token has been volatile this year, falling recently to a one-year low (get update on this). Market observers have long speculated that Binance might attempt to prop up the token\u2019s value by selling bitcoin (BTC), but exchange CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has said it wasn\u2019t the case. Binance and Zhao were sued by the SEC in June, accused of offering unregistered securities to the general public allowing for commingling of customer funds, along with other violations of securities laws. ByteTree, a research firm, wrote this week that Binance was \u201cin the crosshairs,\u201d adding that its share of global crypto exchange trading volume has slid to about 45%, from 64% six months earlier."

A wallet connected to Robinhood includes 122,076 BTC (equal to $3.3 billion), 34.1 trillion Shiba Inu tokens ($277.8 million), 4.9 million LINK tokens ($29.7 million), and 2.6 million AVAX tokens ($29.6 million), according to the on-chain analytics firm.\n\nDespite growing in the crypto space, Robinhood has had trouble maintaining high trading volumes. The company's cryptocurrency revenue fell in the second quarter from $38 million in the first quarter to $31 million. This modification in trading activity comes after the company recently added new functionality to its wallet product in response to user requests. Notably, custody services and support for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin swaps are now available in Robinhood's wallet.\n\nInitial versions of the Robinhood Wallet supported the Polygon and Ethereum networks and included tokens such as COMP, MATIC, SHIB, SOL, UNI and the USDC stablecoin."

This individual seems to have a knack for making poor choices when it comes to perpetual contracts, and their recent moves have left many in the crypto world utterly baffled.\n\nString of disastrous investments\n\nThis particular investor has seen their Ethereum long positions go up in smoke not once but twice during recent market downturns. The losses? A jaw-dropping $5.1 million. Most people would probably take this as a sign to step back and rethink their approach. Not this investor. In a bewildering move, they have decided to go long on Ethereum yet again, this time diving in at an entry price of $1,717.\n\nRolling dice once more\n\nWhat is truly perplexing is that Ethereum's current market value is teetering around $1,704.75. This means our audacious investor is already staring down the barrel of another loss. What is the game plan here? Are they hoping for a miraculous market turnaround, or are they simply throwing caution to the wind?\n\nWhile Ethereum's market has been holding steady, this investor's puzzling actions have not gone unnoticed. Market watchers and crypto pundits are scratching their heads, trying to make sense of it all. Is this a case of overconfidence, or perhaps a lack of understanding of the inherent risks?\n\nIgnoring basic principles can lead to catastrophic financial setbacks. Whether this investor is an eternal optimist or just lacks trading acumen, their actions serve as a lesson to us all: have a well-thought-out strategy and prepare for every possible scenario."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation just pulled the curtain back on its latest innovation: the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification, or EELS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEELS has been in the works for over a year and aims to replace the Yellow Paper as the go-to guide for Ethereum's inner workings. But unlike its predecessor, EELS is not stuck in the past. It is fully up-to-date with all the latest forks and offers a user-friendly approach that is geared toward programmers.\n\nWhat is EELS? It provides a complete snapshot of the Ethereum protocol at every fork, including the ones still on the drawing board. This is a big deal because, until now, Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have only ever suggested changes.\n\nThey have not given developers a full picture of how those changes fit into the existing framework. EELS solves this problem by offering a comprehensive, easy-to-follow guide that could become the new gold standard for Core EIPs.\n\nWhy users should care about EELS\n\nIf you are wondering why EELS is such a big deal, let us break it down for you: this is not just another update, it is a shift in how Ethereum will be developed moving forward. Imagine the process of building a house, where a blueprint is scattered across a dozen different documents. That is what Ethereum development has been like up until now. EELS changes all that by providing a single, unified blueprint that is both up-to-date and easy to read.\n\nEELS is set to become the main resource for Ethereum developers. It offers a clearer, more efficient roadmap for innovation and stands to make Ethereum more robust and transparent than ever. So, whether you are a developer, an investor or just a crypto enthusiast, keep your eyes on EELS. It is going places, and it is taking Ethereum with it."

        "content": "A popular crypto trader says that a key indicator is now flashing bullish for the smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 139,800 followers on the social media platform X that the weekly Gaussian channel is signaling ETH is likely entering a bull cycle after crossing the $1,700 price level.\n\nGaussian channels are momentum indicators that can be used to identify price reversals.\n\n\u201cETH/USD [Weekly] Gaussian gone green\u2026\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,704 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) using his version of the logarithmic growth curves (LGC), which attempt to forecast Bitcoin\u2019s macro highs and lows while filtering out medium-term volatility and noise.\n\nLooking at his chart, Bitcoin\u2019s current price in the $27,000 range puts BTC about halfway between the upper and lower bounds of his LGC range, which he calls a \u201cbuy zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful of getting too clever. Yes, there may be some price consolidation in the shorter-term but sensible speculation, built on the longer-term trend and actually establishing positions, still has price in the investor\u2019s BTC LGC buy zone.\u201d\n\nHis chart suggests that the LGC lower bound will increase to $50,000 by 2026.\n\nAccording to the trader, the lower bound of the LGC has reliably held up as Bitcoin\u2019s market bottom. He also says that Bitcoin\u2019s logarithmic moving average divergence (LMACD) indicator has similarly traced BTC\u2019s market bottom. The LMACD indicator is designed to reveal changes in an asset\u2019s trend, strength and momentum.\n\n\u201cThe monthly MACD [LMACD = logarithmic scale] is a long-term indicator. Combined with the LGC [logarithmic growth curve] it has served BTC investors well.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $27,303 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The recent price drop from the $1,741 mark may indicate that a large number of wallets are dropping ETH now and are continuing to do it as ETH is sitting at the current price mark.\n\nHowever, citing similar situations in the past, Santiment stated that when traders begin to dispose of their cryptos at lower values, the chances of a price rebound grow higher.\n\n\ud83e\udee1 #Ethereum is currently sitting at $1,700, and $ETH is standing out amongst top caps as the asset traders are growing most impatient with.

Some believe that this could have been Buterin redistributing his crypto riches to protect them against possible hacks. The second version assumed that Buterin could cash out these $5 million.\n\nDormant whale awakes after two years\n\n@lookonchain tracker of \"Smart Money\" wallets, who regularly shares data on the transactions they make and how much money they lose or earn, announced that a few hours ago, a whale that had remained dormant for two years had awakened and deposited 6,087 ETH to Binance.\n\nThis is quite a large amount in fiat, too, since it is worth $10.23 million. Now, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,715 after the recent price fall. It is quite likely that this whale may be either selling at a loss or he could be moving funds to Binance, expecting the ETH price to rebound soon and only then make a sale on Binance.\n\n"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is up 5% after breaking consolidation but could lose ground covered amid growing overhead pressure.\n\nEthereum price must hold above $1,630 support or risk falling back to consolidation with Grayscale victory effect fading.\n\nRipple price\u2019s tether to 200-day EMA at $0.5251, exposes XRP to the risk of a 7% dip.\n\nAfter prolonged consolidation, the market found impulse when Grayscale secured a victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices rallied, along with the broader market. It did not take long, however, before traders started cashing in on these gains to quench their profit appetite after a longstanding \"inactionable\" market characterized by shrinking volatility.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin traders exercise caution ahead of US Core PCE Price Index release\n\nBitcoin price readies for next move\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price sits on the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,175. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows falling momentum and BTC could head lower, potentially revisiting the immediate support at $25,999.\n\nIn a dire case, the slump could send Bitcoin price to the psychological $24,000 level, constituting a 10% drop from current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if sidelined bulls or late buyers come in, Bitcoin price could forge north, shattering the resistance confluence between the 50- and 100-day EMA that rejected the August 29 intra-day high of $28,142. A strong breach above this roadblock would clear the way for BTC to test the supply zone at around $29,170.\n\nIf the order block fails to hold as a resistance, the psychological $30,000 would be an area of interest, with robust seller momentum expected around the $30,385, an overlay between two supply zones where aggressive selling behavior is expected. For a confirmed uptrend, however, BTC must record a decisive daily candlestick close above $31,439.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF has a 75% chance of approval in 2023, analysts say\n\nEthereum price could lose the $1,630 support level\n\nEthereum (ETH) price rallied almost 7% following the Grayscale announcement, but like BTC, profit-taking is already underway. This is indicated by a falling RSI. If bears continue having their way, ETH could extend south after losing the $1,701 support level. The next support level at $1,630 could provide a subsequent entry point for bulls, but failure could see the proof-of-stake (PoS) token slide lower to find support around $1,552 potentially.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, Ethereum price could extend north if sidelined investors come in. The ensuing buying pressure will likely send ETH past the resistance confluence between the 200- and 50-day EMA at $1,774 and $1,776, respectively, before a confrontation with the 100-day EMA at $1,800.\n\nIn the highly bullish case, a foray past the psychological $2,000 is likely, with Ethereum price likely to tag the $2,008 resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum is eyeing $1500 support with A-B-C drop\n\nRipple price tethered to 200-day EMA\n\nRipple (XRP) price must break its tether to the 200-day EMA at $0.5251 for the next move. The remittance token has been consolidating along this level since August 18. The RSI momentum indicator suggests the price could fall, possibly dipping into the demand zone between $0.5040 and $0.4600. A decisive daily candlestick close below the mean threshold at $0.4800 would increase the odds for a continued downtrend, potentially sending XRP down 10% to $0.4191.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a move north may see Ripple price breach the 100- and 50-day EMAs at $0.5646 and $0.5813, respectively. A sustained uptrend could see XRP confront the $0.6840 level, but in a highly bullish case, the move north could send the payments token to the August 19 highs around $0.8193.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price risks decline to $0.41, amidst developments in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit"

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights ETC price action challenges the secondary resistance trendline with a bounceback from $15.\n\nA breakout rally will elevate the ETC price to challenge the overhead resistance trendline close to $19.\n\nClosing below $14.64 will plunge the ETC price to a new 52-week low, close to $12.44.\n\nETC price trend maintains constant multi-contact support at the $14.50 mark, providing a bounce pad for the last 14 months. However, the ETC price action displays a solid overhead selling with lower high formations, leading to a strong resistance trendline.\n\nMoreover, the fall back to $14.50 leads to a secondary resistance trendline to keep the minor bullish outgrowth in check.\n\nFollowing the recent bounce back from $14.50, the recovery rally finds additional bullish momentum with the Grayscale legal win. With a 6.23% jump on Tuesday, challenging the resistance, the ETC price reached $16.96.\n\nHowever, the extensive selling at the secondary resistance trendline pushes the ETC price down by 5.09%. Evaporating the additional sentimental gains, the ETC price reverses from the trendline.\n\nSupporting a comeback in ETC price from the $14.50 bounce pad, the MACD and RSI indicators present a bullish signal. The underlying sentiments improve with a bullish crossover in MACD and a hike above the halfway line in RSI.\n\nCurrently, the ETC price forms a doji candle, trading at $16.05 with an intraday growth of 0.19%. This projects a possibility of a prolonged uptrend, potentially breaking above the secondary trendline.\n\nOn an optimistic side note, the trendline breakout will pump the ETC price substantially to reach the overhead resistance trendline close to $19.\n\nOn the flip side, a fall below the $14.50 mark will plunge the ETC prices to $12.65."

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nAs the end of August approaches, leading cryptocurrencies look set to close the month at a lower price than when they entered it. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down around 6.1% in the previous 30 days. Meanwhile, Ethereum was down roughly 8.3% and XRP had lost nearly 25% of its value.\n\nAll three suffered from a significant price crash on August 17. Despite a strong rally that was felt across crypto markets on Tuesday (Aug. 29), it was short lived and none of them fully recovered from their mid-month losses.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the top cryptocurrencies\u2019 prospects going into September.\n\nCan Bitcoin Reclaim $30,000 by the End of September?\n\nHistorically, September has not been a good month for Bitcoin. Out of 13 of them, only four have seen the cryptocurrency appreciate in value. And every year from 2017 onward, BTC has closed the month at a lower price than when it started. Will 2023 buck the trend of recent years?\n\nFor Bitcoin traders, $30,000 represents a critical symbolic milestone, yet the cryptocurrency has only briefly traded above the $30,000 mark a few times this whole year, and it remains a difficult ceiling to break through.\n\nIn a recent analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s 20-day moving averages, the crypto analyst Eric Krown errs on the side of a more bearish forecast. But, in general, he anticipates another sideways month for Bitcoin, which he expects to trade within the $26,000 to $28,000 range for most of September.\n\nHowever, Krown made his initial prediction for the month before Tuesday\u2019s rally. In a later video on Wednesday, he discussed the potential for a bearish breakout if it shows sustained momentum in the coming days.\n\nAccording to Krown, should BTC manage to stay above $27,200, it could go on to climb as high as $31,000 or $32,000 in the coming weeks.\n\nETH On Track to Outperform BTC\n\nJust as BTC has barely broken above $30,000 all year, ETH has had similar trouble holding ground above $2,000.\n\nYet if the cryptocurrency manages to break through that barrier in September, it may be on track for a major rally. Moreover, so far in the second half of 2023, ETH has outperformed BTC. And as the analyst Ibrahim Ajibade recently argued, if it breaks above $2,000, this trend is likely to continue.\n\nOne important fact that Ethereum price analysts often consider when making forecasts is the level of Bitcoin Dominance, i.e., the value of Bitcoin as a proportion of the total crypto market capitalization.\n\nAfter peaking at 52% at the end of June, Bitcoin dominance has steadily fallen for the last two months and currently stands at just below 50%.\n\nCommenting on this trend in a recent video, the analyst and trader known as CryptoWorld Josh noted that the Bitcoin dominance rate is showing signs that it could break down and fall even further. If this happens, he said that ETH could significantly outperform BTC.\n\n\u201cIf we do end up seeing a confirmed break below around 47.5%, [\u2026] that is where we could see a possible altcoin season and much bigger gains in the altcoin market compared to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted that this could still take some time: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that that will not happen for at least the next month,\u201d he remarked.\n\nXRP Price Tied to 200-Day EMA\n\nAs with other leading cryptos, XRP has closely tracked its moving averages in recent months.\n\nExponential moving averages (EMAs) are a set of widely observed technical indicators in the world of cryptocurrency trading. They represent the average closing price of an asset over a given time period, adjusted for its volatility.\n\nAt present, XRP\u2019s 200-day EMA suggests a slight increase from its current price of $0.528\n\nto around $0.6 by the end of September.\n\nHowever, should it break with this long-term pattern, it could drop to a range of between $0.5040 and $0.4600, the crypto analyst Lockridge Okoth noted recently. He added that any movement below $0.4800 would increase the odds for a continued downtrend, potentially sending the price of XRP down as much as 10%.\n\nConversely, Okoth observed that bullish momentum may see the price of XRP surge as high as $0.8 per token, a high point the cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t seen since July.\n\nOther Cryptos to Watch in September\n\nAlongside the more established coins, it\u2019s always worth keeping a tab on new cryptocurrencies, which can often see quicker gains than bigger coins.\n\nWith that in mind, here are two new tokens to watch in September.\n\nWall Street Memes Set for Tier-1 Exchange Debut at the End of the Month After $25m Raise\n\nOne cryptocurrency lots of traders have been talking about in recent months is Wall Street Memes (WSM), which has seen over $25 million invested into its presale.\n\nInspired by the Wall Street Memes subreddit, WSM has managed to amass the largest presale event of the summer thanks to an active community of supporters and viral social media strategy.\n\nWith an online following that numbers over a million, WSM brings together all the things that have propelled more established memes coins like DOGE to their current heights: strong community engagement, eye-catching design, and a total disregard for Wall Street and its traditional financial markets.\n\nWhile analysts are divided on what will happen to the price of BTC, ETH or XRP in the next month, one thing is for certain: At the end of September, WSM will be listed on exchanges, where many commentators believe it will rise well above its low presale price of just $0.0337.\n\nIn fact, the development team behind WSM is aiming for a $1 billion market capitalization once the token hits the open market. This would represent a 15x return on investment for early investors.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nSonik Coin Also Turning Heads as Stake-to-Earn Meme Coin Raises Nearly $900K\n\nSonik Coin (SONIK) is another new meme coin that has exploded onto the scene faster than anyone could have anticipated.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, SONIK has now raised nearly $900,000 in its presale. That means the project is almost halfway toward its presale goal of just over $2 million.\n\nSONIK\u2019s fundraising efforts were lighting fast from the beginning. But fueled by a red hot crypto market and surge of bullish sentiment, the new token has accelerated its path toward $2 million in recent days.\n\nAt its current pace, SONIK is on track to hit its target within the next five days. However, until then, early investors still have a chance to purchase tokens for just $0.000014 each.\n\nOnce the presale is finalized, the team behind Sonik Coin are targeting a market capitalization of $100,000. And given the pace with which the initial coin offering (ICO) has unfurled so far, their ambition to be the fastest zero-to-one-hundred-million market cap meme coin may just be realized.\n\nFor reference, a $100 million market cap would see presale participants multiply their investment nearly fifty times over!\n\nBut, given SONIK\u2019s built-in staking mechanism, they might not be in a rush to sell their tokens. Of the total supply, 40% of all Sonik Coins are reserved as rewards to people who opt to hold and stake instead.\n\nVisit Sonik Coin Presale"

The ruling by the Federal Court on Tuesday is seen as a clearing the path for a spot bitcoin ETF by the Grayscale. However, overall sentiments remain volatile for the traders.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in red on Thursday as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but remained above $27,000-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, declined more than a per cent to breach below $,1700 mark again. Price action in the altcoins was on the lower side during the early trade.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has stabilized its price above the $27,000 threshold, as the markets self-corrected following rapid expansion caused by Grayscale\u2019s victory against the US SEC yesterday, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"This ruling, though, has cultivated a sense of cautious hope within the market regarding an impending verdict on the Bitcoin spot ETF within the United States.

Solana dropped more than 4 per cent, while Polkadot tanked 3 per cent. Polygon and Tron shed 2 per cent each. Among the gainers, Toncoin jumped about a per cent, while Dogecoin posted mild gains.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly lower, falling to $1.08 trillion-mark, as dropped as much as a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes tanked more than 45 a per cent to $29.74 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has traded sideways with downward pressure in the last 24 hours. Investor sentiment, however, continued to climb and jumped 3 points since yesterday; currently in the neutral zone with a score of 52/100.

It unlocks all the opportunities of popular EVM-compatible networks ti the developer communities of WASM-compatible languages. Besides cross-ecosystem compatibility, the new development makes Arbitrum Nitro operations faster and cheaper.\n\nWASM developers can build dApps on Arbitrum Nitro as Stylus launches in testnet\n\nArbitrum Stylus, a programming environment for WebAssembly languages, goes live in testnet on Arbitrum Nitro. With this instrument, millions of C, C++ and Rust developers can deploy their dApps and tokens on Arbitrum (ARB) ecosystem blockchains without changing their codebases.\n\nArbitrum Day is here! \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udde1\n\n\n\nCongrats to the @offchainlabs team for the monumental achievement of Stylus.\n\n\n\nWe are excited to educate our community on this breakthrough, and hold discussions in the forum as the #ArbitrumDAO will have to vote soon on upgrading the ecosystem with\u2026 https://t.co/PDctYQ5Qbb \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) August 31, 2023\n\nThe novel instrument offers a new level of composability and modularity: with Arbitrum Stylus, a Solidity developer can easily call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. Also, for instance, a token contract written in Rust can be deployed to the EVM chain.\n\nArbitrum representatives stressed that this release is a landmark milestone in terms of blockchain accessibility as there are only 20,000 Solidity developers in the world, while millions are working on WASM languages:\n\nAt the heart of Stylus is EVM+: bringing the best of both EVM and WASM worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++. All without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling, it\u2019s the floor.\n\nA major addition to the Arbitrum (ARB) stack was unveiled on Arbitrum Day (Aug. 31); Arbitrum One launched in mainnet two years ago, while Arbitrum Nitro kicked off on Aug. 31, 2022.\n\n$20,000 bounty campaign kicks off at ETHGlobal\n\nThe new technical design allows non-EVM dApps to be operated faster and cheaper. Per the estimations of the Offchain Labs team, Arbitrum Stylus allows for 10x improved computation and 100x improved memory usage.\n\nThis, in turn, paves the way for previously unseen use cases for the blockchains of the Arbitrum (ARB) ecosystem:\n\nCryptography libraries can now be deployed as custom precompiles, permissionlessly. RAM-intensive generative art libraries, bringing existing games written in C++ on chain, and compute-heavy AI models all become more accessible.\n\nTo introduce new development to the global Ethereum (ETH) community, Offchain Labs starts a $20,000 bounty program. It will go live at ETHGlobal in New York on Sept. 22, 2023.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Arbitrum Stylus will be audited by the Trail of Bits Web3 cybersecurity team, Offchain Labs statement goes."

        "content": "Uniswap delegates have passed a preliminary vote to consider multichain deployment for Uniswap v2.\n\nLaunched three years ago, Uniswap v2 has only ever been deployed on Ethereum.\n\nUniswap Foundation says the proposal will protect users on other blockchains from unsafe forks.\n\nThe Uniswap community has passed a vote to expand the second version of its decentralised exchange, called Uniswap v2, on other blockchains apart from Ethereum that has been its home since its launch in May 2020.\n\nUniswap\u2019s plan for a multichain deployment strategy for Uniswap v2 is partly to protect users from unsafe forks \u2014 copycat versions of its protocol that have been deployed across different blockchains.\n\nThe vote, which began last week, is an off-chain temperature check poll \u2014 a preliminary vote used by decentralised autonomous organisations to gauge initial sentiment for a proposal within the community.\n\nIt ended on Wednesday with almost unanimous approval as 98% of votes cast by participants were in favour of the proposal.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nDespite passing almost unanimously, the proposal was criticised within the community.\n\n\u201cI feel this initiative comes too late, the optimal time would have been in 2021,\u201d said a DAO member with the pseudonym kfx, who warned the rollout may cause liquidity issues in the long run and hurt the rollout of the upcoming fourth version of the exchange.\n\nThose in support of the proposal say it is \u201cbetter late than never\u201d and that a multichain Uniswap v2 deployment will help capture market share from unsafe copycats.\n\nNOW READ: Uniswap Asia lured Chinese investors with parties, dancers, and an airdrop \u2014 it was all fake\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe proposal will move to an on-chain execution vote following this initial temperature check approval. This second vote could begin on September 1 unless delegates raise objections after this first vote. Uniswap v2 will be deployed on other blockchains if the second vote passes.\n\nUniswap v2 remains a popular automated market maker-style decentralised exchange and the proposal says users of other blockchains besides Ethereum will benefit from having a canonical version of the protocol.\n\nThe proposal says these benefits include full-range liquidity for token swaps and the fact that the Uniswap v2 smart contract is one of the most secure on Ethereum.\n\nThe hitch-free nature of this governance process is in contrast to the fiery debates that characterised the first few Uniswap v3 multichain deployment votes. Uniswap v3 is an upgrade of v2 launched in May 2021.\n\nEarly Uniswap v3 cross-chain deployment votes saw disagreements among delegates as venture capital investors tried to sway the outcome to their benefit.\n\nThe Uniswap proposal\n\nAs of July, Uniswap v2 has accumulated a total trading volume of $1.45 trillion since its launch in May 2020, according to data from a Dune dashboard. The upgraded v3 is not far behind with $972 billion.\n\nUniswap\u2019s multichain deployment strategy has only focused on its v3 DEX but focus appears to be shifting to the previous version.\n\nNOW READ: Uniswap\u2019s v4 gives devs powerful \u2018hooks\u2019 tool but there\u2019s a catch \u2014 more risk\n\nUniswap Foundation\u2019s governance lead Erin Koen inked the proposal, arguing that the lack of a multichain deployment for Uniswap v2 has allowed copycats to thrive on other blockchains.\n\nSome of these copycat forks contain modified codes that are unsafe for users and could lead to losses whereas Uniswap v2 is \u201camong the most battle-hardened contracts on Ethereum,\u201d the proposal stated.\n\nSeveral Uniswap forks with modified codes have been hacked in the past. Uranium Finance, a Uniswap fork deployed on the BNB Blockchain, was hacked for $50 million in April 2021.\n\nTo avoid future issues and hacks, the proposal calls for Uniswap v2 to be deployed on all chains that already have Uniswap v3.\n\nThe proposal stated that the combination of both versions of the Uniswap DEX will provide better execution for token swaps. It also added that Uniswap v2 will be able to draw liquidity from unsafe copycats.\n\n\u2018Better late than never\u2019\n\nKoen\u2019s proposal drew mostly favourable comments from community members who participated in the forum discussion stage of the governance process.\n\nThe only criticism came from DAO member kfx who said that deploying v2 on chains that already have Uniswap v3 will cause liquidity fragmentation \u2014 a problem that occurs when liquidity for trading is spread too thinly among different platforms.\n\nNOW READ: Uniswap taps Wormhole for bridge deal in win for Jump Trading and defeat for a16z\n\nRather than deploy Uniswap v2 on other blockchains, kfx instead recommended that the focus should be on the launch of Uniswap v4.\n\nThose who support the proposal, like crypto research company and Uniswap contributor GFX Labs, said the plan is \u201cbetter late than never.\u201d\n\nOthers also stated that the proposed move would stem the tide of fake copycats, especially on newer chains like Coinbase\u2019s Base.\n\nEarlier in August, Koen warned that there was a non-canonical version of Uniswap v3 on Base. This fake copycat modified part of the protocol\u2019s code to divert trading fees to the entity that deployed it on the Coinbase blockchain.\n\nUniswap Foundation advised DeFi developers and traders on Base to be wary of the non-canonical version.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "A major victory for the cryptocurrency industry was achieved on August 30, 2023, when a US federal court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against UniSwap, a decentralized exchange platform that allows users to swap any ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThe SEC had alleged that UniSwap violated the federal securities laws by facilitating the trading of unregistered securities, such as tokens issued by initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The SEC also claimed that Uniswap\u2019s governance token, UNI, was itself a security that should have been registered with the agency.\n\nHowever, the court ruled that the SEC failed to prove that UniSwap or UNI met the criteria of the Howey test, which is used to determine whether an asset is a security or not. The court also stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are commodities and not securities, as they are not backed by any central authority or issuer.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision is a significant boost for the cryptocurrency industry, as it provides more clarity and certainty on the legal status of digital assets in the US. It also reaffirms the distinction between centralized and decentralized platforms and recognizes the innovation and potential of DeFi.\n\nUniswap\u2019s founder, Hayden Adams, celebrated the victory on Twitter, saying that \u201cthis is a huge win for UniSwap and the whole crypto community. We are grateful for the support of our users, developers, and partners who believe in our vision of a more open and fair financial system.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s director of enforcement, Gurbir Grewal, announced on August 30 that the agency would focus on the \u201cmost significant\u201d cases of fraud and manipulation involving digital assets, and that it would not target DEXs or their users for merely listing or trading tokens that may be deemed as securities.\n\nAdams praised this approach as \u201cbased\u201d, a slang term that means admirable or courageous, and said that it would foster innovation and experimentation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. He also argued that DEXs are not responsible for the quality or legality of the tokens that are traded on their platforms, and that users should exercise due diligence and research before investing in any project.\n\n\u201cDEXs are permissionless protocols that enable anyone to create and trade any ERC20 token. They do not perform any vetting, endorsement, or promotion of the tokens that are listed. Users are solely responsible for their own actions and decisions,\u201d he wrote. Adams added that Uniswap, the leading DEX by trading volume and liquidity, has implemented several measures to protect users from scam tokens, such as displaying warnings, requiring manual token imports, and removing default token lists.\n\nHe also encouraged users to report any suspicious or fraudulent activity to the SEC or other relevant authorities, and to use tools such as Etherscan or DeFi Pulse to verify the legitimacy and security of the tokens they trade. Adams concluded his tweet by saying that he hopes the SEC\u2019s stance will encourage more developers to build on top of Uniswap and other DEXs, and to create innovative and valuable products and services for the DeFi community.\n\nThe market also reacted positively to the news, as UNI surged by more than 4.70% in the following hours, reaching a new all-time high and currently trading above $4. Bitcoin and Ethereum also gained momentum, breaking above $27,000 and $1,700 respectively.\n\nFirstMate raises $3.75 million in Dragonfly-led Round\n\nFirstMate, a startup that provides AI-powered solutions for maritime logistics, announced today that it has raised $3.75 million in a seed round led by Dragonfly Capital. Other investors include Y Combinator, Naval Ravikant, and several angel investors from the shipping industry.\n\nThe company, which graduated from Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2021 batch, aims to streamline the complex and fragmented processes involved in global trade. FirstMate\u2019s platform uses machine learning and computer vision to automate tasks such as vessel tracking, cargo inspection, and document verification. The platform also provides data-driven insights and recommendations to help shippers optimize their operations and reduce costs.\n\nFirstMate\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said that the company was born out of his own frustration with the inefficiencies and lack of transparency in the maritime sector.

        "content": "Recent reports suggest that Only fans' parent company, Fenix International Limited, has disclosed its Ethereum holdings. The information emanated from a financial disclosure that Fenix invested $19.9 million in ETH. Moreover, the CEO, Leonid Radvinsky, is stated to have added to the Ethereum holdings.\n\nThe surge of institutional investors joining decentralized finance has generated a lot of discussions and traction in the financial sector. Organizations seek to invest in the crypto industry due to the potential of the imminent projects to generate massive capital gains. The new entrant, Bitcoin Spark, has managed to amass retail and individual investors.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nThe debate circulating Ethereum's capability of being a solid investment that will generate massive returns for investors never seizes. Having its digital currency, ETH, the crypto is stated to have an enormous surge in the coming years. Ethereum is among the safest long-term investments that entrepreneurs can seek as they diversify their portfolios. However, Bitcoin Spark\u2019s potential suppases that of Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Spark Attracts Institutional Investors\n\nThe development of digital currency depends on promising platforms willing to offer scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. The new bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin Spark, has created a frenzy in blockchain and traditional finance markets. Investors seek such opportunities to enter the ecosystem as these projects tend to perform well in the long run.\n\nTo provide security to investors, the project has been audited by three prominent leading auditing firms: Cognitos, Vital Block, and Contract Wolf. Bitcoin Spark is considered the new era of improved consensus mechanisms that will promote equality and incentivize ledger technology development through a validation process. For this reason, the platform aims to be the best Bitcoin alternative in the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe network has its gas token, referred to as BTCS. The platform rewards users who actively participate in activities engaging in the network's operations. For instance, validators are rewarded in BTCS tokens for participating in confirming new blocks and providing processing power to the network.\n\nBitcoin Spark has a similar number of token supply to that of Bitcoin's 21 million. The tokens have been allocated to launch supply (4.55 million), averaging 21.66%, and mining rewards (16.45 million), averaging 78.33%. Community members can continue to mine BTCS for not less than 120 years.\n\nThe ongoing Bitcoin Spark's presale has been a roaring success. As the project looks to start phase 4 of its ICO, the retail token price will increase. Currently, the ICO phase three is winding up and this might be the last time BTCS tokens retail at low prices.\n\nIn the final touches of the third ICO phase, crypto whales have joined the bandwagon. Investors seeking to participate in the project can purchase BTCS at $2 and earn a 12% bonus. Not even another imminent presale project has offered such incredible perks to its community members. Moreover, the audacious investors who purchased the token in the third stage will have 560% capital gains during the launch period set to occur on November 30th.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "title": "Cardano to be Bigger than Bitcoin and Ethereum? Hoskinson Reveals Why ADA is Primed to Explode - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSpeaking during an event at the end of August, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the popular blockchain Cardano, gave some insight into the future of the network. The foundational speech, titled \u2018The Future of Cardano Governance in the Age of Voltaire,\u2019 was delivered at the opening of Rare Evo, a prominent blockchain and crypto conference in Denver, Colorado.\n\nHoskinson highlighted the importance of Cardano as a leader in the blockchain space, saying that \u201cthe other two big guys, Ethereum and Bitcoin, have recused themselves\u201d. He emphasized that both Bitcoin and Ethereum refused to have on-chain governance. He mentioned that in the case of Bitcoin, this anarchy meant that people had to rely on everything the initial founder did.\n\nThis makes changes to the original infrastructure impossible, and any changes imposed on the blockchain result in a fork, rendering the forked network useless for purists. It also implies relying on the original developer to get all aspects right on the first try, an almost unattainable feat.\n\nThe fundamental idea behind the blockchain is to establish a system that functions without the need for trust among participants. However, as per Hoskinson, Ethereum doesn\u2019t even attempt to incorporate on-chain governance. This absence of governance efforts permits the platform\u2019s founder to uphold an enduring dominant position without checks.\n\nCardano Aims to Change the Way We Live\n\nUnlike Ethereum, for example, Cardano\u2019s endgame is to achieve full decentralization and to operate through user consensus and voting rather than being controlled by a single party. He acknowledged that this idea might seem intimidating to some but emphasized its necessity to drive positive change and move away from the traditional top-down hierarchy. He admitted that \u201cit takes [power] away from people,\u201d which is why many shy away from true decentralization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano\u2019s stability record stands out, with zero downtime since its launch in 2017, spanning almost 6 years. This accomplishment can be attributed to its engaged community, which has established nearly 3,200 stake pools and is currently staking around 23 billion ADA. These efforts contribute to both decentralization and the blockchain\u2019s security. In contrast, certain other blockchains, including Solana, have faced network outages, and even tech giants like Amazon and Google have experienced downtime.\n\nThe co-founder of Ethereum highlights that Cardano\u2019s strength comes from its decentralized nature, emphasizing his belief that the blockchain will encompass a purpose beyond mere monetary functions.\n\nHe envisions Cardano to be the \u201cbiggest cryptocurrency in the world,\u201d adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to become more than a cryptocurrency; I think it\u2019s going to become the backbone of a new digital nation, a new society, a place where we can finally trust each other again.\u201d\n\nCardano would be a platform encompassing voting, money, and \u2018every dimension and aspect\u2019 of our digital lives.\n\nThough technical challenges are still being worked on, Hoskinson says these can be overcome, as the true challenge lies within the social changes to leverage Cardano to make the world more equitable and fairer for all. While Hoskinson has a bold vision for Cardano, the transition to a fully decentralized governance will make or break the whole ecosystem."

        "title": "What Is an Ethereum Faucet? Best Ethereum Faucets to Look Into - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "The crypto industry is not so new anymore. Hundreds of millions of users have decided to start investing in at least 1 cryptocurrency, and the profits surely are not too late to the party.\n\nIf you consider the market fluctuations and you have basic crypto knowledge, you can build an investment plan that will bring you some earnings in the near future.\n\nBut how can you earn your first crypto, based on which you will earn more? Is buying the only way, or are there more things to discover?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cyes, of course there is more\u201d. And in this article, we will talk about another truly intriguing way to earn crypto without investing: Ethereum faucets.\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum Faucet?\n\nAn Ethereum faucet is an online platform that function like a reward system for the platform\u2019s users. Usually, Ethereum faucets are programmed to share small amounts of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy do you get rewarded?\n\nYou don\u2019t just earn crypto rewards by accessing an Ethereum faucet. However, the ETH rewards keep on coming while you perform various tasks the platform requires you to. Usually, you might be required to watch some videos, click on ads, complete CAPTCHAs or surveys, or even play short and engaging games.\n\nEthereum faucets usually reward users with small amounts of ETH, but being consistent might help you earn more with every completed task. For instance, some platforms might have daily rewards ranging from 0.01 ETH to 0.1 ETH, also depending on how many tasks you complete.\n\nEthereum faucets are a great option especially for those who are just starting their journey in the crypto industry. Considering that you do not have to invest in order to earn crypto, you will not have too much to lose if the rewards you win drop in value afterward. And if the value increases, you will just end up with a surprising reward that you can use in various ways, such as staking, trading, lending, or just holding.\n\nOther Types of Faucets\n\nThere is one more pretty popular type of faucets, called testnet faucets. They basically have the same goal \u2013 offering free tokens to specific users.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that a testnet faucet rewards developers who need free testnet funds to test various transactions on a platform they build. Some of the most popular Ethereum testnet faucets include Sepolia Testnet and Goerli Testnet.\n\nTestnet faucets do not work with real coins or tokens. Instead, they offer users some testnet funds that have no value and cannot be traded. The main purpose of such funds is to help developers test projects\u2019 features. For instance, a developer that works on a platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain will be able to access such a faucet and get some free testnet ETH to test how a type of transaction works on the platform.\n\nHow Do Ethereum Faucets Work?\n\nEarning crypto while completing simple tasks can be pretty fun. But where do Ethereum faucets get the crypto for rewards from?\n\nUsually, crypto faucets receive funds from sponsors and advertisers who are looking for various places where they can promote their projects, products, or services. The crypto faucet platform gathers the funds from such projects and distribute them to faucet users.\n\nMore advanced Ethereum faucets use smart contracts to automate the reward distribution. Smart contracts are self-executing parts of code that once introduced in a project, will not require further human verification.\n\nHow to Use an Ethereum Faucet?\n\nConsidering that they are recommended for newcomers, Ethereum faucets are not that hard to use. But let\u2019s take the process step by step:\n\nSet up a crypto wallet \u2013 There are plenty of crypto wallets available on the market, but some of them still are the most popular and widely-used. When choosing a wallet to use for your digital assets, look for one that supports the cryptocurrencies you aim to buy, earn, or trade. If not, you will be required to have multiple wallets;\n\nCreate an account \u2013 Once you have a wallet, you should find a profitable Ethereum faucet. There, you can sign up to start earning ETH;\n\nComplete tasks \u2013 After you set up your Ethereum faucet account, you can start completing different tasks in order to win small crypto rewards;\n\nWithdraw your rewards \u2013 Once you complete a specific number of tasks, you may end up with a more significant amount of ETH in your faucet account. However, keep in mind that the withdrawal limit differs from one platform to another, and to be able to withdraw your rewards, you might have to complete a remarkable number of tasks.\n\nEthereum Faucets \u2013 Pros and Cons\n\nPros of Ethereum Faucets\n\nYou can earn free crypto with little to no effort.\n\nEthereum faucets do not limit users. You can earn as much as you want on the same platform.\n\nYou can also learn new things on Ethereum faucets. This will help you have a better view of the whole industry when you have enough crypto to start trading.\n\nYou can help many newly launched crypto projects increase their popularity.\n\nCons of Ethereum Faucets\n\nEarning significant amounts of ETH may take pretty much time.\n\nYou have to choose the Ethereum faucet wisely, as there also are fraudulent platforms that can affect you and leave you with no rewards whatsoever.\n\nYou are required to complete pretty repetitive tasks. If you are easily distracted by such activities, Ethereum faucets might not be the right option for you.\n\nThe amount of crypto earned might not be equal to the energy consumed to get those rewards.\n\nTop Ethereum Faucets\n\nFreeEthereum.com\n\nFreeEthereum.com might be one of the most popular Ethereum faucets available at the moment. Launched in July 2020, the platform allows users to earn ETH rewards for completing various tasks, such as taking quizzes or clicking on links and ads.\n\nThe platform allows users to win up to $300 worth of ETH coins every hour through a game that implies rolling a series of numbers. Depending on the number you end up on, you get a specific reward, 0.16866345 ETH being the biggest one.\n\nPotential Rewards (depending on the number generated)\n\n0-9,885 \u2013 0.00000017 ETH ($0,00028);\n\n9,886-9,985 \u2013 0.00001687 ETH ($0.028);\n\n9,986-9,993 \u2013 0.00016866 ETH ($0.28);\n\n9,994-9,997 \u2013 0.00168663 ETH ($2.8);\n\n9,998-9,999 \u2013 0.01686635 ETH ($28);\n\n10,000 \u2013 0.16866345 ETH ($300).\n\nMain Features\n\nInstant withdrawal \u2013 FreeEthereum.com allows its users to withdraw their rewards instantly once they reach a minimum withdrawal amount;\n\nReferral program \u2013 The platform has developed a referral program where you can invite your friends to complete tasks in order to earn some ETH themselves. Once you refer a friend, you will be able to get up to 50% of what they are earning on FreeEthereum.com;\n\nFree promotions \u2013 Although users can roll the numbers only once an hour, they still can win ETH in other ways while waiting for another hour to pass. For instance, they can follow the project on Twitter and get free promo codes that will allow them to play the game quicker or will offer extra rolls without waiting.\n\nEthereum-Faucet.org\n\nEthereum-Faucet.org is a crypto faucet that allows users to win ETH rewards by solving CAPTCHAs and participating in lottery events.

        "content": "As the crypto market exhibits volatility and innovations like Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) spring up, Bitcoin Spark price prediction presents critical revelations, shedding new light on the general Ethereum network and setting the stage for intriguing developments.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS): Intriguing Technology and ICO\n\nBuilt on Ethereum, Bitcoin Spark fronts a Proof-Of-Process (PoP) blockchain technology that forms the foundation of its innovative ecosystem. PoP represents a PoS and PoW amalgamation striving to achieve a unique approach to validate and secure transactions within the network. PoP utilizes advanced algorithms to harness the computational power of devices connected to its network by enabling individuals to rent out their processing power for tasks demanding significant computational resources. This approach enhances security by empowering many validators and facilitates fair distribution of rewards regardless of a miner\u2019s processing power.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark application plays a central role in realizing the potential of PoP. As a user-friendly ticket to the BTCS ecosystem, the application empowers users to engage in mining and earn rewards. The seamless technology integration and rich utility positions Bitcoin Spark as a solution that appeals to all users, whether novice or experienced in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nBTCS\u2019 innovation sets Bitcoin Spark apart in the competitive crypto landscape, offering a glimpse into blockchain technology\u2019s future of reshaping traditional paradigms. With a smart contract audit and KYC certification, BTCS meets compliance requirements regarding security, stability, and transparency.\n\nBitcoin Spark is rapidly gaining momentum, with its ICO surging in phase three with a remarkable price point of $2.00, accompanied by an attractive 12% bonus for investors. This rising ICO has captured the crypto community\u2019s attention, drawing interest from individuals seeking to become part of this innovative ecosystem. You can imagine buying Bitcoin at $1 before its meteoric rise as the project gears to launch at $10, offering a 560% ROI.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Network?\n\nThe Ethereum Network is a decentralized platform that lets people create smart contracts and dApps. It serves as a foundation for multiple innovative applications and decentralized solutions, contributing significantly to the growth of the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIt started in 2015, thanks to Vitalik Buterin, who envisioned blockchain technology beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin. The network is like a global computer comprising many computers (nodes) that confirm transactions. Ethereum has its currency, Ether (ETH) used for transactions and smart contracts. A notable ETH feature is smart contracts following set rules and can work by themselves when trigger conditions are met. ETH network harbors DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs, where code and contracts govern organizations instead of people.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nThe Ethereum network is always improving, recently moving full-scale to PoS from PoW for better scalability, energy efficiency, and security. Bitcoin Spark price prediction foresees an Ethereum future that holds several exciting developments and challenges as the network evolves and adapts to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and decentralized technologies.\n\nBeyond Ethereum 2.0, the Ethereum Foundation and the community are likely to continue researching and developing new technologies to further enhance the network\u2019s capabilities, including improvements in privacy, security, and user experience. As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, regulation, governance, and compliance issues become more important. The Ethereum community will need to navigate these challenges while continuing to innovate and collaborate.\n\nBased on on-chain data, Bitcoin Spark price prediction notes an inherent risk for ETH price falling below $1,500, with other analysts forecasting it could be worse and might fall below $1,000 if it fails to maintain its $1,500 support. A 600 ETH worth $1M+ transfer by Vitalik Buterin to Coinbase corroborates this fact, as analysts believe he was cashing out in anticipation.\n\nFurther reading on Bitcoin Spark (BTCS):\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "The Merge of Ethereum - krungsri.com",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based technology that manages and stores data in a manner similar to the better-known Bitcoin, but which has its own native coin1/ called Ether, or ETH, a type of cryptocurrency that may be used to pay for services and transaction fees. Ethereum also differs from Bitcoin by providing users with additional programming capabilities that may be coded to execute automatically once certain conditions are met. The possibilities offered by these \u2018smart contracts\u2019 are one factor underpinning interest in Ethereum and driving efforts to extend its capabilities and improve the efficiency of its operations. Most recently, this has led to \u2018the Merge\u2019, an event that has marked a major change in how the Ethereum blockchain operates.\n\n\n\nBlockchain Trilemma\n\nWithin the realm of digital assets, blockchain technology should be developed to optimize all 3 of these characteristics simultaneously within a blockchain network, which include:\n\nDecentralization: The ability to operate in the absence of middlemen and other types of intermediations, i.e., eliminating the need for a central authority. Security: The ability of the system to deter threats and maintain cybersecurity. A secure blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and the confidentiality of sensitive information. Scalability: The ability of a blockchain network to handle a growing number of transactions and users without compromising its performance.\n\nHowever, investors and blockchain gurus alike agree that at least up to the present day, it has been impossible to fully satisfy all three requirements simultaneously, the challenge that has been named the \u2018blockchain trilemma\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the current shape of the digital asset landscape, most blockchain networks meet at most only two of these three requirements. Improving one aspect often comes at the cost of another. Although Ethereum was both secure and decentralized3/ , it had previously failed to meet the requirement for scalability. However, this weakness has been addressed by the Merge of Ethereum, which has formed part of the move to upgrade the network\u2019s capabilities and to ensure that the blockchain trilemma is resolved by achieving the perfect balance between scalability, security, and decentralization.\n\n\n\nWhat is The Merge of Ethereum\n\nPrior to the Merge, to verify transactions and to record data, account balances, and smart contracts coded and operating on it, the Ethereum Mainnet (i.e., the live Ethereum blockchain deployed for daily use) was based on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. However, the use of a PoW mechanism carries with it significant problems with regard to scalability, and so to overcome these difficulties, a decision was made to switch to a Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm instead. The transition from a PoW to a PoS consensus algorithm occurred in two major phases: (i) the creation of a separate yet parallel network alongside the Mainnet called \u2018the Beacon Chain\u2019 that uses the PoS mechanism; and (ii) the process of merging the Beacon Chain with the existing Mainnet, also known as 'The Merge'.\n\nThe Beacon Chain was developed as a separate layer of the Ethereum blockchain. In the initial phase of the switch to the PoS consensus algorithm, the Beacon Chain operated in parallel with the Mainnet, allowing developers to test the system and to deal with problems as and when they arose, without this impacting the functionality of the existing Ethereum network itself. Once it was clear that the Beacon Chain was operating as designed and that use of the PoS mechanism would not generate problems for users on the Ethereum blockchain, it was then possible to integrate the two layers.\n\nThe Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain have been successfully integrated\u2014this is The Merge of Ethereum\u2014and so the Ethereum blockchain now fully operates on a PoS rather than a PoW consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the success of the Merge, the Ethereum network is now looking at implementing a new method of storing data called sharding, which may be used on blockchains. Under this system, the network is split into separate smaller self-managing units called shards, which in the Ethereum network can be connected using the Beacon Chain, with the goal that 64 shard chains will operate simultaneously. The result of this will be to allow the Ethereum network as a whole to process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly cutting processing time and costs and dramatically extending the network\u2019s scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin, the Russian programmer behind ETH and the Ethereum blockchain, spoke about how Ethereum might solve the blockchain trilemma at Ethereum 2022 (EthCC), an annual conference devoted to its namesake technology that in 2022 was held in Paris between 19 and 22 July . At the conference, Buterin outlined the details of how upgrades to the Ethereum network would enable it to meet all three of the main requirements for a comprehensive blockchain solution. At that point, the Merge was more than 90% complete, with just some work on Testnet remaining to be completed5/. It was later announced that as of 20:42 Thailand time on 15 September 2022, the Merge of Ethereum had been successfully completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing The Merge to completion\n\nIn the recent past, one criticism leveled at cryptocurrencies has been their voracious energy consumption, a situation that many believed was only likely to worsen in the future. In particular, the demands placed on power supplies by the cryptocurrency industry escalated sharply over 2018-2022, and estimates place the industry\u2019s total global power consumption at 120-240 TWh annually. This is a significant amount of electricity, and in addition to being in excess of the total national demand of major economies such as Argentina and Australia, cryptocurrencies are estimated to account for 0.4-0.9% of global energy demand.10/ Alongside other blockchains, Ethereum was guilty of profligate energy consumption, and prior to the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain is estimated to have used 46.31-93.98 TWh of electricity annually,11/ an astounding amount that resulted in a carbon footprint12/ of 11,016,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).13/\n\nProblems with some blockchains\u2019 excessive energy consumption originate in the use of the PoW consensus algorithm. This contributes somewhere close to 100 TWh annually to global energy demand, a figure that is itself comparable to the entire annual electricity consumption of Colombia or the Czech Republic, and so this was a major driver of the desire to transition the Ethereum network to the PoS mechanism. The total electricity demands generated by using PoS systems to verify transactions come to just 0.0026 TWh per year, or something like 0.01% of the PoW total (i.e., this represents a 99.99% energy saving). In terms of estimated overall consumption, the Merge should thus result in the Ethereum blockchain going from using as much electricity as a mid-sized economy to using as much as a small US town containing around 2,100 households.14/ The collapse in energy usage associated with the PoS systems stems from the fact that rather than being selected through a race to the first correct answer, the system employs a semi-random selection process to find Validator,15/ who adheres to the blockchain regulations to verify transactions. As a result, there is only one validator per block.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described above, the Merge was undertaken with the aim of increasing Ethereum\u2019s scalability and of reducing the congestion on the network that was being generated using the PoW mechanism. The upgrade has also had the twin results of helping to bring Ethereum closer to meeting the three desired characteristics of the ideal blockchain, and of increasing the network\u2019s security. The latter is due to the transition to the PoS algorithm and the requirement that transaction validators stake 32 ETH16/ of collateral in exchange for the right to be considered as a validator. Participants are therefore incentivized to be much more careful about validating transactions correctly and accurately since otherwise, they run the risk of forfeiting their stake. At the same time, it is now easier to compete for a position as a validator since these are chosen randomly, rather than by solving hugely complex mathematical problems; in the latter situation, race conditions mean that PoW validators, or miners, are forced to make considerable upfront investment in high-end and quickly outdated machinery as they try to gain an edge over the competition, and this then functions as a significant barrier to entry. The net effect of these changes should therefore be to make it easier to become a validator, and with a deeper pool of validators available, the process will become more decentralized. Despite these positives, the Merge carried with it fears of possible risks to the Ethereum blockchain. (i) The transition from the PoW to PoS mechanism was a major change to the way in which the network operates and although this was thoroughly tested in advance, there was still a risk that the upgrade would result in an interruption to Ethereum services or the departure of some users. (ii) These changes should have the effect of increasing overall security but carrying out such a major overhaul of the network\u2019s technological plumbing opened up the possibility that security holes might be created, which could then be exploited by threat actors. (iii) Some worried that swapping over the consensus algorithm might impact the price of ETH, and given the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, it also was possible that this could affect prices for other coins built on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in the roughly 10 months between the completion of The Merge of Ethereum in mid-September 2022 and the present, these fears have not come to pass. Thus, there have been no interruptions to the operation of the Ethereum network and no security flaws have come to light that have resulted from the Merge. Rather, security has been improved. Moreover, those who hold ETH can participate as validators in the blockchain. As regards prices for ETH, these have fluctuated over the intervening period, but this has been as a result of market mechanisms, not as a consequence of the upgrade, and these have not had a noticeable impact on the prices of other cryptocurrencies. The next stage of Ethereum\u2019s development As described by Vitalik Buterin, The Merge of Ethereum was just one stage in the ongoing development of the Ethereum blockchain, and to continue extending the capabilities of the network, a series of further upgrades have now been scheduled. The Surge: This will increase the processing capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain. In general, the blockchain is limited to recording only around 15-20 transactions per second (TPS), but the upgrades that will be implemented during the Surge should vastly expand this, taking the cap to 100,000 TPS. The Surge is planned for the second half of 2023. The Scourge: This upgrade aims to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the network, partly by ensuring that platform users are protected against unwanted kinds of MEV17/ extraction. The Verge: This upgrade will increase the network\u2019s efficiency by optimizing storage on Ethereum through replacing \u2018Merkle trees\u2019 with the use of \u2018Verkle trees\u201918/ in the verification process. By reducing the quantity of data that each node needs to store and process, overheads should be cut by as much as 85%. The Purge: The removal of unnecessary data marks a pivotal phase for Ethereum, accomplished through the implementation of EIP-4444: Bound Historical Data in Execution Clients. This proposal seeks to assist in purging redundant blockchain data, resulting in reduced computational workload and shorter data transfer times. The Splurge: The final upgrade of the currently envisaged round of Ethereum will implement two EIPs: (i) to reduce the volume of ETH in circulation, EIP-1559 specifies mechanisms for burning ETH when this is generated from transaction fees; and (ii) EIP-4337: Account Abstraction will increase the network\u2019s flexibility and efficiency by using Verified Delay Functions (VDFs), which will then accelerate the verification of large transactions when these are processed on the network faster.\n\nMarket reactions to The Merge of Ethereum\n\nThe Merge was one of the most significant events to occur in the crypto space in 2022, following its successful completion, prices for ETH failed to rise, despite predictions from many investors that this would be the case. Rather, prices immediately dipped and then stabilized. This short-term decline was partly driven by rumors and misunderstandings surrounding the upgrade, with many believing that the Merge would result in the formation of a new blockchain, \u2018Ethereum 2.0\u2019, and a newly minted coin to go along with this, \u2018ETH2\u2019, though as has been shown above, neither of these claims were true. In addition, the Merge coincided with the latest \u2018crypto winter\u2019 and significant turbulence in the crypto world. Among the most important causes of the latter was the collapse of the FTX19/ cryptocurrency trading platform, which prior to its being declared bankrupt was after Binance the world\u2019s second largest crypto exchange. The value of ETH was thus impacted by the FTX scandal, losing over 30% of its value overnight; on 8 November 2022, ETH traded at USD 1,574.80 but only a day later, its value had slumped to USD 1,083.29.20/ The market for ETH then remained choppy through 2022, closing out the year at around USD 1,300.\n\nIn addition to troubles originating from these market-driven price swings, the regulatory authorities have also begun to take a closer interest in ETH and its exact legal status. Gary Gensler, Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that following the merge and the 2022 transition from the PoW to the PoS consensus mechanism and the introduction of staking, it was possible that ETH could henceforth best be regarded as a security, and in that case, it would come under the purview of the US SEC. In assessing the case for this, the SEC applied the \u2018Howey Test\u2019. For ETH, this required considering whether holders of the coin expected to earn profits from a common enterprise, or in other words, the test assessed whether holding ETH was a type of profit-seeking investment. The result of the SEC\u2019s assessment was that holders of ETH did indeed buy ETH exactly because they expected to earn a profit from doing so, and as such, ETH could be regarded as a type of security.21/ However, at around the same time, on 13 December, 2022,22/ the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (US CFTC) issued its indictment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of FTX, and in this, the CFTC clearly regarded ETH as a commodity, much like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This conflict over the status of ETH and whether it should be classified as a security or a commodity then generated considerable uncertainty in the investor community since if it is the former, ETH will be regulated by the SEC, whereas if it is the latter, it will be regulated by the CFTC. Following the disagreement between the regulatory authorities, the waters were perhaps muddied further by comments made in May 2023 by Dan Berkovitz, ex-general counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission, on the Unchained podcast, where Berkovitz stated that it is possible that from a legal perspective, ETH could fall within the scope of both the SEC and the CFTC.23/\n\n\n\nFollowing this period of volatility, demand for ETH benefited from a number of factors, including the decision by Google to offer blockchain node hosting,24/ for which Ethereum was the first blockchain to be chosen. Vitalik Buterin also announced that following the Merge, the next upgrade to be made to the Ethereum network would be the Scourge,25/ which would help to address problems with validators claiming additional fees for adding transactions to the blockchain. The Shanghai upgrade,26/ which was implemented at the start of April 2023, also allows validators to withdraw ETH that has been staked on the blockchain. These have then helped to improve perceptions of the Ethereum network and as such, prices for ETH have rallied; in the wake of the successful Shanghai upgrade, ETH prices broke through the USD 2,000 barrier for the first time in 8 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors and commentators are agreed that by expanding its transaction handling capabilities, beefing up its security, and slashing its energy overheads, the Merge has had major benefits for the Ethereum network and added to interest in the possibilities on offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKrungsri Research view: The Merge of Ethereum\n\nWithin the crypto world, the Merge was a major event on the 2022 calendar, and across the space, the success of the upgrade was closely tracked. This intense interest stemmed from the expectation that the Merge would achieve the difficult task of shifting the Ethereum blockchain into the sweet spot at the center of the blockchain trilemma, and by reducing problems with scalability, Ethereum would much better balance this with the other demands of security and decentralization.\n\nFrom the point of view of the banking and finance industry, this upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s capabilities brings with it significant benefits but also implies major impacts, too. With regard to the former, the Ethereum blockchain is already capable of supporting decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, and combined with the network\u2019s trustworthiness and decentralization, these offer an easy and convenient solution for processing a wide range of financial transactions. Moreover, because the smart contracts that are built on the Ethereum blockchain self-execute when specified conditions are met, this adds to efficiencies and reduces the risk that contracts can or will be amended after having been agreed.\n\nIn addition, the very sharp cuts in electricity consumption that the Merge has enabled will serve to provoke greater interest from investors attracted by the promise of digital assets and who are focused on the development of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Within the blockchain universe, the Ethereum network is thus establishing itself as a leader in the field and is the choice for a \u2018green blockchain\u2019 for those interested in this area, and by occupying this position, the network will appeal to investors looking to push forward with the development of the industry and the generation of benefits for stakeholders. More generally, blockchain technologies are finding an ever-growing range of applications across the economy, including in the real estate sector, where their use is allowing for asset tokenization and for simpler document storage and exchange; the arts and entertainments industry, where blockchains can be used to encode artists\u2019 rights, prevent copyright violations and ensure that payments are made directly to originating artists; and the health industry, where blockchains may be used to securely store patient records, easing bottlenecks created when individuals are seen in a number of different hospitals or clinics. Ultimately, blockchain technologies may be used to simplify and streamline work processes, and through this, reduce operating overheads. And with the introduction of PoS mechanisms on the Ethereum blockchain, this is now becoming an environmentally friendly option, too.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Since the beginning of the year, Circle and its USDC stablecoin have seen a decrease in dominance on the Ethereum blockchain reflecting a downsizing for the cryptocurrency pegged to the value of the dollar.\n\nIndustry leader Tether and its flagship product USDT have seen an opposite trend to USDC since January with several on-chain data points on the rise.\n\nThe hope for the industry\u2019s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization is that future updates and growth in the DeFi world can bring back investor interest.\n\nFull details below.\n\nThe dominance of the USDC stablecoin is descending on the Ethereum network: meanwhile, Tether (USDT) reinforces its hegemony\n\nThe USDC stablecoin of issuer Circle is having a really tough time with investors gradually abandoning the cryptocurrency in the Ethereum blockchain and moving to competitor USDT or directly into FIAT.\n\nAfter two years of fire in which throughout 2020 and 2021 the stablecoin won the market\u2019s respect by gaining more than $37 billion in market capitalization, here it is for much of 2022 and all of 2023 the trend has reversed sharply.\n\nAs of the end of February 2022 USDC has seen about $23.5 billion evaporate, equivalent to nearly 50% of its countervalue.\n\nBy contrast, since the beginning of the year, the amount lost amounts to $17 billion.\n\nThe reasons for that downward slide are many and range from the simple advent of the bear market that triggered trading seasons with low volumes and market and reduced investor presence to far more complex causes.\n\nCertainly there\u2019s the issue of Silicon Valley Bank\u2018s bankruptcy and USDC\u2019s depeg in March this year where the stablecoin had touched a spike the price of $0.88, recovering parity with the dollar in the following week of trading.\n\nEvents like these create distrust in the currency, especially after so many decentralized finance enthusiasts saw their savings burned with the crash of UST and the Terra/Luna ecosystem.\n\nIn contrast to USDC, those who have seen considerable success on the Ethereum network is Tether and its USDT stablecoin where we can see a $6.7 billion growth since the beginning of the year.\n\nPaolo Ardoino and Giancarlo Devasini\u2019s product has seen an incredible increase in interest from investors who prefer offshore channels for cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nOverall since 1 January 2023, USDC has reduced its share in Ethereum from 41.58% dominance to the current 33% while USDT has expanded from 32.34% to 52.86%.\n\nThe overtaking point where USDT became more popular than USDC on ERC-20 network came right at the depeg incident for Circle vaulting.\n\nExtensive use cases and future planning bode well for a USDC upswing\n\nAs Tether (USDT) grows and USDC loses ground on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, we can see how future expansion projects and new collaborations could lift the stablecoin\u2019s fortunes.\n\nA few days ago, Coinbase announced that it had acquired a minority stake with Circle Internet Financial, at the same time seizing an old joint partnership in the Centre Consortium.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange, which also made another big leap in August by launching the L2 Base blockchain in the mainnet, now wants to gain full control of USDC dominance and issuance.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s plan is to expand its dominance in every area of the crypto landscape by becoming the undisputed leader and overtaking main rival Binance, which had to drop support for BUSD a few months ago.\n\nThe intent is also to follow in the footsteps of payments giant PayPal, which recently launched its own stablecoin PYUSD in partnership with Paxos.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s entry into USDC will certainly bring a wave of new attention from institutional investors who, counting on the reliability and seriousness of the exchange, could devote a lot of capital to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn addition, Circle is planning to expand its presence on six other blockchains between September and October.\n\nThe names of the networks on which USDC will land have not yet been released, but rumors speak of a high probability for Polkadot, Near, Optimism, Cosmos, and Base.\n\nWhat is already in itself the stablecoin with the most use cases in the DeFi world has plans to move even further in this direction by becoming ever more of a benchmark for an economy based on dApp and smart contracts.\n\nAccording to this information, we can imagine a near future where both USDT and USDC will have a huge impact for cryptocurrency exchanges, where however the former will be used in off-shore channels and on centralized exchanges while the latter will find a home exclusively in decentralized finance.\n\nWe can already see how Circle\u2019s coin is more present as liquidity on DEXs such as Uniswap, where USDT plays a marginal role.\n\nUniswap v3: USDC liquidity of $593 million"

        "content": "A digital wallet associated with Robinhood, the United States-based portal allowing users to trade multiple instruments, including crypto without commission, is the fifth largest holder of Ethereum (ETH). According to Arkham Intelligence, an on-chain analytics platform, Robinhood controls 1.72 million ETH, worth $2.93 billion at current prices as of August 30.\n\nIt could not be immediately ascertained whether Robinhood directly owned these coins or if it custody them on behalf of clients.

The tracker shows that Robinhood only controls $1,720 of USDT but over $5.1 million of its primary competitor, USDC.\n\nThere is no apparent reason for this clear skew in stablecoin preference for USDC over USDT.\n\nUSDT enjoys the first-mover advantage and remains the world\u2019s most liquid stablecoin and the third-largest digital asset, ahead of USDC.\n\nOver $49 Billion Worth Of Ethereum Locked In The Beacon Chain\n\nWith over $2.93 billion of ETH, Robinhood trails other platforms, including Kraken and Binance. Among centralized exchanges, Binance is the largest holder of ETH, of which a big chunk belongs to clients.\n\nBinance controls multiple cold wallets that cumulatively hold billions of coins. Cold wallets are not connected to the internet and are often considered more secure.\n\nBeyond exchanges, the single largest wallet controlling ETH is the official deposit contract on the Beacon Chain, which holds 6% of all coins in circulation. Different validators, tasked with approving transactions on the proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain, have locked over 29.1 million ETH worth over $49 billion."

Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nDuring a persistent bear market, both Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) have experienced declines over the past month. Ethereum (ETH) faced competition from Cardano (ADA) in NFT floor prices, challenging its leadership. Meanwhile, Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a downturn since introducing penalties for Neutron halt validators. In contrast, VC Spectra (SPCT) continues to shine with substantial investor gains.\n\nBut the question remains: How does VC Spectra (SPCT) outperform competitors during these challenging market conditions?\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCardano Surpasses Ethereum (ETH) in NFT Floor Price Battle\n\nAs the bear market continues to undermine the prices of many tokens, Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by 7.70% from $1,790 on August 17 to $1,652 on August 28. The price drop raises concerns for Ethereum (ETH) as a market leader amid competition from platforms like Cardano (ADA).\n\nCardano\u2019s NFT floor price index soared 22% higher than that of Ethereum (ETH) on Stocktwits NFT in the past seven days. This shift indicates Cardano\u2019s (ADA) potential as a rising NFT trading platform, challenging the historical dominance of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price drop can also be attributed to suspicions of futures market liquidation. The price of Ethereum (ETH) recently plunged after weeks of consolidation, often tied to futures market liquidations. The Ethereum (ETH) price dip coincided with a notable reduction in Open Interest, suggesting a significant liquidation wave.\n\nCosmos (ATOM) Faces Slide After Neutron Validator Penalties\n\nExperiencing a 10.24% decline, Cosmos (ATOM) has seen its price drop from $8.10 on August 17, 2023, to $7.27 on August 28. While this dip aligns with the broader bearish trend in the crypto market, it also reflects a continuation of Cosmos\u2019 (ATOM) extended downward movement.\n\nThe price of Cosmos (ATOM) has dropped by 18.68% since August 1 from $8.94 to $7.27. Neutron, a blockchain designed for smart contracts in the Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystem, faced an unexpected halt on August 1.\n\nThe Cosmos (ATOM) leadership is currently deliberating on the next steps, pushing their initial proposal to slash Replicated Security validators. However, this development has not positively impacted Cosmos (ATOM), as the effects are expected to continue in the coming weeks.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): Profit Haven Amidst Market Challenges\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) experience declines, VC Spectra (SPCT) emerges as an investor favorite, delivering profits.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT), known for its innovation, offers investment management services using AI and expert analysis, seeking investment opportunities with high profit potential and minimum risk.\n\nThe heart of its innovation is the VC Spectra (SPCT) token, a BRC-20 standard token on the Bitcoin blockchain. Employing a deflationary model, VC Spectra (SPCT) provides dividends, buybacks, and access to exclusive pre-ICOs.\n\nAfter a successful private seed sale raising $2.4 million, VC Spectra (SPCT) enters Stage 3 of its public presale, surging 212.5% from its Stage 1 price of $0.008 to the current $0.025.\n\nNew Stage 3 VC Spectra (SPCT) investors anticipate a 32% profit in Stage 4, with the price reaching $0.033. In addition, the price of VC Spectra (SPCT) is projected to reach $0.08 by the public presale\u2019s end, promising a 220% profit for token buyers.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"

        "content": "Robinhood Markets, the commission-free brokerage, has broadened the capabilities of its crypto wallet by adding support for Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum swaps. This move extends Robinhood\u2019s reach beyond the Ethereum ecosystem, responding to user demand for more diverse asset coverage across various blockchain networks.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s user-centric expansion\n\nInitially launched for Apple devices in March, Robinhood\u2019s wallet was confined to supporting the Polygon and Ethereum networks, along with a select range of tokens like COMP, MATIC, SHIB, SOL, UNI, and USDC. The wallet\u2019s expansion was driven by user demand for broader asset coverage across different blockchain networks.\n\nThe wallet now allows select users to trade Ethereum for more than 200 different assets. Unlike other wallets, Robinhood\u2019s platform enables users to swap without holding Ethereum, as network fees are automatically deducted from their existing tokens. Android users can expect this functionality to be available later this year.\n\nFinancial and regulatory implications\n\nThe expansion comes on the heels of Robinhood\u2019s recent earnings report, which revealed a drop in crypto-related revenue from $38 million to $31 million in the previous quarter. By adding support for popular tokens like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Robinhood aims to boost its crypto business and enhance user engagement.\n\nEarlier in June, the platform delisted three crypto tokens\u2014Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC)\u2014following intensified U.S. regulatory actions against major cryptocurrency exchanges. Robinhood currently offers 18 different tokens, a relatively limited selection compared to crypto-native platforms like Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the zero-fee app intends to expand its crypto offerings in response to consistent customer requests for a more extensive set of coins and tokens.\n\nIn summary, Robinhood\u2019s decision to expand its crypto wallet to include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum swaps is a strategic move influenced by user demand, financial performance, and regulatory considerations. The expansion not only aims to boost Robinhood\u2019s crypto revenue but also positions the platform as a more versatile player in the competitive crypto market."

        "content": "Offchain Labs has launched Arbitrum Stylus, a novel tool designed to expand the programming languages available for smart contract development on Ethereum\u2018s Layer 2 network. This initiative aims to democratize access to Ethereum-compatible smart contract development by supporting languages that can be converted to WebAssembly (WASM), such as Rust, C, and C++.\n\nBefore the advent of Arbitrum Stylus, the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts was Solidity. The tool\u2019s introduction marks a significant shift, allowing developers to write smart contracts in languages they are already familiar with. According to Offchain Labs, this could potentially bring over 3 million Rust and C developers into the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem, which has largely been dominated by approximately 20,000 Solidity developers.\n\nSteven Goldfeder, CEO and co-founder of Offchain Labs, emphasized the importance of building an inclusive developer community. \u201cGrowing and building the most inclusive developer community is incredibly important to us,\u201d Goldfeder stated. He further noted that the wider language support and improved efficiency of Stylus could benefit projects in areas like social media or gaming that require high computational power.\n\nRachel Bousfield, tech lead at Offchain Labs, elaborated on the utility of Arbitrum Stylus. She indicated that the tool would significantly reduce friction for companies looking to bring their applications to the blockchain. For instance, a video game company that has already invested in C++ talent would find it easier to transition to blockchain technology.\n\nInteroperability and cost efficiency\n\nOne of the most compelling features of Arbitrum Stylus is its interoperability. Different coding languages can work in tandem, allowing for a seamless development experience. For example, a developer programming in Rust can import a Solidity interface and vice versa. This feature is enabled through Arbitrum Nitro, a significant tech stack upgrade to Arbitrum One that occurred in 2022.\n\nMoreover, Stylus promises to cut costs dramatically. According to Bousfield, Stylus could reduce computational costs by 10 to 100 times, depending on the task. This is achieved through the use of two virtual machines: one unmodified Ethereum Virtual Machine for Solidity contracts and a separate WASM virtual machine for other languages.\n\nCommunity feedback and future developments\n\nOffchain Labs has made the code and testnet for Arbitrum Stylus publicly available and is actively seeking community feedback. The team is also considering adding more programming languages to Stylus to further reduce fees. A date for a vote on whether the Arbitrum DAO will adopt Stylus has not been set, but indications suggest that the plan is to gather testnet feedback before submitting a proposal.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of Arbitrum Stylus by Offchain Labs marks a pivotal moment in the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. By broadening language support and offering cost-efficient solutions, Stylus has the potential to attract a diverse range of developers and projects, thereby enriching the blockchain landscape. With the tool\u2019s testnet already launched and community feedback being actively sought, the next steps for Arbitrum Stylus could set new standards in smart contract development."

        "content": "Home \u00bb De-Fi How to Bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum? A Guide to BTC-ETH Conversion Methods De-FiJournal How to Bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum? A Guide to BTC-ETH Conversion Methods Petar Jovanovi\u0107\n\nBridging Bitcoin to Ethereum refers to the process of transferring BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain onto the Ethereum blockchain. This allows Bitcoin holders to access the Ethereum network and participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on Ethereum.\n\nThere are two main methods for bridging BTC to Ethereum:\n\nWrapping BTC into an ERC-20 token via services like WBTC, RenBTC or tBTC Performing a native swap of BTC directly to ETH via DEXes like RocketXchange or Thorswap Using centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase to convert BTC to WBTC\n\nWrapping effectively locks up your BTC and mints a new ERC-20 token to represent your BTC on Ethereum. This allows your BTC to interact seamlessly with smart contracts and dApps on Ethereum.\n\nSwapping refers to exchanging your BTC for ETH directly by utilizing liquidity pools and exchange protocols. This converts your BTC to ETH so you can use the ETH natively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWrapping BTC into an ERC-20 Token\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), renBTC, and tBTC are three popular ERC-20 token protocols for wrapping BTC on Ethereum. Here\u2019s an overview of each:\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n\nWrapped Bitcoin is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. The process involves BTC being locked up in a custodial manner and WBTC tokens generated to represent that BTC on Ethereum.\n\nAnyone can initiate the minting process by sending BTC to WBTC\u2019s custodian, BitGo. BitGo will then verify the BTC and signal the minting of an equal amount of WBTC, which is sent to the user\u2019s Ethereum address.\n\nThe process is reversed when burning WBTC to unlock the BTC. WBTC is sent to a burning address, triggering BitGo to release the equal amount of BTC from custody.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f WBTC benefits:\n\nAllows BTC to be used in Ethereum DeFi apps for lending, borrowing, liquidity pools etc.\n\nPegged 1:1 to BTC, so maintains equal value\n\nBacked by full bitcoin reserves, providing transparency\n\nIntegration with major DeFi protocols like Compound, MakerDAO, Uniswap etc.\n\nStrong legal protections through custodian agreements\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nRequires KYC identity verification for minting/burning\n\nCentralized through BitGo custodianship\n\nRisk of mismanagement by custodian\n\nrenBTC\n\nrenBTC is an ERC-20 token that enables a decentralized, permissionless and trustless wrapping solution for BTC on Ethereum. It uses RenVM, a virtual machine, to facilitate the minting and burning of renBTC.\n\nTo mint renBTC, users send BTC to a RenVM Darknode. The Darknode will lock up the BTC and mint an equivalent amount of renBTC tokens to the user\u2019s Ethereum wallet.\n\nThe Darknodes earn fees for providing the minting service but also must stake Ren\u2019s native token, REN, as collateral to act honestly. If malicious activity is detected, the staked REN can be slashed.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f renBTC benefits:\n\nDecentralized, no KYC required\n\nNon-custodial, users maintain control of keys\n\nDarknodes provide security through staked collateral\n\nPermissionless access, anyone can mint/burn\n\nIntegrated with major DeFi apps and DEXs\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nComplex system reliant on Darknodes\n\nRequires overcollateralization with REN tokens\n\nLow liquidity and market cap relative to WBTC\n\ntBTC\n\ntBTC aims to bring Bitcoin to Ethereum in a decentralized, permissionless and trust-minimized manner. Users initiate minting by sending BTC to the tBTC protocol smart contracts.\n\nA group of participants called signers then facilitate the BTC to tBTC swap. Signers take custody of the BTC and mint tBTC on Ethereum to the user\u2019s address.\n\nTo provide security, signers must stake ETH as collateral. Additionally, \u201ckeepers\u201d monitor the system and can trigger slashing of signer bonds if they act maliciously.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f tBTC benefits:\n\nDecentralized, no KYC needed\n\nNon-custodial, users control private keys\n\nSigners and keepers provide security\n\nOpen access, anyone can integrate tBTC\n\nGrowing adoption on Ethereum DeFi platforms\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nComplex system with many moving parts\n\nSecurity dependent on collateral stakes\n\nLow market cap and liquidity relative to WBTC\n\nRead also:\n\nNative Swaps of BTC to ETH\n\nRather than wrapping BTC into a token, another option is to directly swap BTC for ETH using atomic swap protocols. This converts your BTC into ETH so you can interact natively with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPopular decentralized exchange protocols for trustless BTC to ETH swaps include THORChain and RocketXchange.\n\nTHORChain\n\nTHORChain is a decentralized liquidity network that facilitates native swaps between different blockchain assets using decentralized liquidity pools.\n\nTo swap BTC for ETH on THORChain:\n\nVisit app.thorswap.finance Connect your wallet containing BTC Select BTC as the input asset and ETH as the output asset Review swap details and submit the transaction Complete any wallet confirmation prompts\n\nYour BTC will be exchanged directly for ETH using THORChain\u2019s liquidity pools. The ETH can then be used seamlessly on Ethereum without any wrapping required.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f THORChain benefits:\n\nDirect swap of assets, no wrapping tokens\n\nNon-custodial, you hold private keys\n\nNo intermediaries or kyc\n\nFast, cross-chain trading\n\nGrowing liquidity pools and adoption\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nLimited coin availability compared to DEX aggregators\n\nComplex protocol reliant on validators\n\nSlashing risks if validators misbehave\n\nRocketXchange\n\nRocketXchange is a DEX aggregator that sources liquidity from both centralized and decentralized exchanges to provide the best swap rates across chains.\n\nTo use RocketXchange to swap BTC to ETH:\n\nVisit rocketx.exchange Connect wallet containing your BTC Select BTC as input asset and ETH as output asset Review estimated swap rates across multiple sources Execute swap through the best rate Confirm any wallet prompts to complete transaction\n\nRocketXchange will automatically direct your swap through the most optimal exchange rate for BTC/ETH. This provides trustless, no KYC swaps between the assets.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f RocketXchange benefits:\n\nSwaps assets directly, no wrapping required\n\nAggregates liquidity across CEXs and DEXs\n\nFinds best rates to optimize swaps\n\nIntuitive interface for easy swapping\n\nNon-custodial, users maintain asset control\n\n\u274c Drawbacks:\n\nReliant on external exchanges\n\nSwap execution can be complex\n\nLiquidity fragmentation across exchanges\n\nLimited coin availability\n\nUsing centralized exchanges\n\nAnother option for bridging Bitcoin to Ethereum is utilizing centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) as an intermediary. This involves first depositing BTC into a CEX account, trading the BTC for ETH on the exchange order books, and then withdrawing the ETH to an Ethereum wallet address you control.\n\nMajor exchanges like Binance, Coinbase , and Kraken allow seamless trading between BTC and ETH trading pairs. The ETH received can then be used natively on the Ethereum blockchain for transactions and dApps.\n\nAlternatively, some centralized exchanges like Binance support direct withdrawals of BTC as wrapped assets like WBTC on the Ethereum network. For example, you can deposit BTC to Binance, and then withdraw those funds as WBTC directly to your Ethereum wallet. This combines the speed and liquidity of a CEX with the interoperability of wrapped BTC in a single seamless transfer.\n\nThe benefits of bridging BTC to ETH via CEXs include fast settlement speeds, high liquidity, and simple user interfaces. However, centralization risks and lack of custody mean users must trust the exchange to facilitate the bridge properly. Decentralized bridges offer superior transparency and user control, but may have lower liquidity and slower swap execution.\n\nConclusion\n\nBridging Bitcoin to Ethereum can be accomplished through either wrapping BTC into an ERC-20 token or performing a direct atomic swap into ETH. WBTC, renBTC and tBTC are leading wrapping solutions, each with their own merits and tradeoffs. THORChain and RocketXchange allow trustless swapping of BTC into ETH without tokenization.\n\nThe optimal method depends on factors like the application you intend to use ETH for, importance of decentralization, and required transaction speed. But overall, BTC to ETH bridges greatly expand Bitcoin\u2019s potential use cases by bringing its liquidity and value onto the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem."

        "content": "Home \u00bb Journal Forget SOL \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Burning $ETH So Fast Solana Can\u2019t Keep Up Journal Forget SOL \u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Burning $ETH So Fast Solana Can\u2019t Keep Up Vignesh Karunanidhi\n\nBoth Ethereum ($ETH) and Solana ($SOL) have implemented mechanisms to \u201cburn\u201d or permanently remove tokens from circulation, thereby affecting their supply. Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 mandates that a portion of transaction fees on the network is used to purchase and subsequently burn $ETH.\n\nSolana, too, allocates 50% of its transaction fees to buy and burn $SOL tokens. While both projects aim to reduce token supply through burning, the extent and impact of these mechanisms differ significantly.\n\nThe Numbers: Comparing Fees, Burns, and Emissions\n\nFor a clearer picture, consider the year-to-date (YTD) data. Solana has generated approximately $9.72 million in transaction fees, resulting in about $4.86 million worth of $SOL being burned. Meanwhile, Ethereum has generated a staggering $1.64 billion in fees, with about $1.37 billion of this being used to buy and burn $ETH.\n\nThe real differentiator becomes visible when you look at token emission to pay network validators. Solana has emitted $374 million worth of $SOL, far outweighing the amount burned. Ethereum, in contrast, has an inflation figure of $714 million to pay its validators.\n\nExplosion in Meme Coin Market; How to find potential successors to $BONK, $PEPE, and $WIF?\ud83e\udd2b The key?

Seize the opportunity with ongoing presale prices! Plus, prepare for $NUGX\u2019s upcoming launch on major exchanges. Show more + Show less \u2013\n\nThe crux of the argument lies in the ratio of tokens burned to tokens emitted for validator incentives. For Ethereum, the Year-to-Date (YTD) burn amount is approximately 2 times greater than the YTD inflation caused by validator payments. Solana\u2019s YTD burn, on the other hand, is just 0.025 times its YTD inflation.\n\nThe data suggests that Ethereum\u2019s token economics are more geared toward reducing inflationary pressures than Solana\u2019s. Simply put, Ethereum is removing more tokens from circulation than it is introducing, whereas Solana is doing the opposite. This has critical implications for long-term holders, as it could indicate a more favorable supply-demand dynamic for $ETH compared to $SOL.\n\nWhen considered purely from the angle of token burns, emissions, and long-term economic viability, Ethereum appears to be a more balanced investment. Of course, numerous other factors should be considered in a comprehensive investment strategy. Nonetheless, based solely on current YTD data related to token burns and inflation, Ethereum comes out ahead.\n\nCheck NuggetRush ($NUGX) Sponsored: Invest Responsibly, Do Your Own Research.

        "title": "From Ethereum to Bitcoin Spark: How This New Cryptocurrency is reexploring the Game - Blockzeit",
        "content": "Technology has surged in users and real-world applications exponentially. From Web 1.0, when the internet was a hub for large chunks of information (Wikipedia), Web 2.0, where the users were the product as their information was taken and regulated to a certain degree, to the current Web 3.0 involving advanced decentralized finance.\n\nBlockchain technology has also had its inaugurations, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have played a pivotal role in creating awareness. Bitcoin has witnessed whales such as the Winklevii twins and Ethereum Donald Trump, who put money into the niche. Nevertheless, Bitcoin Spark is the new digital platform leading to swifter development in the crypto industry.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\n\nDeveloped by Vitalik Buterin and his compatriots, Ethereum is a blockchain network that seeks to amend challenges within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The platform launched smart contracts to allow programmers in DeFi to develop decentralized applications. The latest upgrade, ETH 2.0, has also generated attention as the platform transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Spark is considered a Blockchain Saviour\n\nBlockchain technology needs a network that proposes security, low transaction costs, and high efficiency. Bitcoin Spark is the new platform with all the traits required for the potential application in decentralized finance. The project aims to solve pertinent and paramount challenges, including lowering transaction costs, improving scalability, and applying a smart contract layer that vast developers can utilize to create layer-2 dApps. Bitcoin Spark will have a potent rate of attracting venture capitalists and individual investors.\n\nIn the Web3 community, platforms with diverse revenue sources always get massive attraction from potential Web3 clients. In this case, Bitcoin Spark aims to improve blockchain technology through its two-way income streams: decentralized processing power rental and advertisements. A small, unused space within the project\u2019s application and home website will be used for advertising, and brands will be required to pay for the slots in BTCS tokens, the native crypto asset of this new Web3 platform.\n\nBitcoin Spark team members will take 50% of the revenue from promotion for maintenance and upkeep. Advertisements will work on an elastic mechanism involving supply and demand, whereby the advertising fee will increase when the market is high. When demand plunges, the costs will reduce.\n\nThe platform also advocates for community policy that encourages partakers to vote against an advert that is vulgar and non-conforming with the required standards and terms of service. The team will also conduct a manual check-up on the advert to process the flag when the dispute reaches the consensus stage.\n\nMiners and validators will provide processing power to the network that individuals and organizations will use to solve intricate programming equations and render video. From this method, the team will take 3% of income.\n\nMining should be decentralized in cryptocurrency since it incentivizes the confirmation of new blocks and the generating of new coins. The mechanism, therefore, leads to improved security of a network. Bitcoin Spark aims to strengthen the mining capabilities of individuals in the ledger technology.\n\nThe incentive will work in a new mechanism peculiar to the industry called proof-of-process that integrates PoW and PoS. Moreover, the platform has a systematic tool that prevents unequal reward allocation based on stake size and raw processing power. It enhances the small scale and large partakers to earn in a linear method. Being on its last laugh of the ICO phase three, blockchain enthusiasts are acquiring BTCS at a cheaper rate of $2 with a 12% bonus. Once the next phase begins, the BTCS price will increase, and the bonus will subsequently reduce.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
