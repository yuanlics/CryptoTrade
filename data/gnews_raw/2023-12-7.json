        "title": "What Is Ethereum (ETH)? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is a blockchain supported by a decentralized network of computers all over the world. Established in 2015, Ethereum introduced the idea of smart contracts, which are bits of code written into the blockchain that can support various types of applications or even new cryptocurrencies. The native token of Ethereum is ether (ETH 0.73%), which is used to pay for certain activities on the network. Read on to learn what Ethereum is, what you can do with the Ethereum technology, whether ether is a good investment, and the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC 1.32%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? What is Ethereum? The basic idea of Ethereum is that it\u2019s a platform that can execute and verify application code without the need for a central authority. It does this through an implementation of blockchain technology run across a decentralized network. Blockchain is a concept used to secure data on a network. Basically, it ensures nobody changes the data on the network without authorization from the majority of people using it. A decentralized network means there\u2019s no single point of authority, like a corporation or government, that can make changes to the data on the network. Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake model to secure the blockchain. Network members must stake Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether, to verify blocks written to the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is also used to pay for work done on the blockchain. Some merchants and service providers will accept ether as payment.\n\nWhat can it do? What can Ethereum do? Ethereum and the concepts pioneered in its development form the backbone of many advancements in blockchain technology. Using smart contracts, which are bits of code written to the blockchain, has allowed people to build all sorts of applications, including: Stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce.\n\nA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce. Lending applications. You can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.\n\nYou can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can create a unique token that can\u2019t be replicated, called a non-fungible token, or NFT. The token can represent anything from a piece of art or a deed to a house. There are dozens of other ways to apply smart contracts and blockchain technology. Is it a good investment? Is Ethereum a good investment? If you\u2019re interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ether, is a good choice. Ethereum is the clear market leader in blockchain applications. Most new developments in decentralized finance or other uses for blockchain are built on the Ethereum network. That inherently gives ether value since it\u2019s needed to keep the network running and verifying the blockchain as well as paying for transactions on the blockchain. The shift to a proof-of-stake system from a proof-of-work system makes it more sustainable from an energy-use perspective. That opens the door for it to make advancements in processing speed, which can make smart contracts more broadly applicable. Ethereum has strong staying power (in the crypto world), so it\u2019s much more unlikely to provide the boom-or-bust results of other smaller currencies.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Ether and Bitcoin are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The currencies have a lot in common, but Ethereum builds on the underlying blockchain technology pioneered by Bitcoin\u2019s creator. The idea behind Bitcoin was to create a permissionless, decentralized digital currency. Its creator wanted a way to make payments that weren\u2019t backed by a central government or agency. As a result, Bitcoin is used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Ethereum had a much broader idea. The blockchain is used for all sorts of decentralized applications. While ether is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain, you can also have other cryptocurrencies built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin also use different protocols to secure their blockchains. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. Under this system, every computer on the network is working to solve a complex math problem to write the next block to the blockchain. Once a computer solves the problem, the other members of the network verify the solution (which takes much less work), and a new block attaches to the chain. Ethereum used the same system until September 2022. It now uses a proof-of-stake system that requires network members to hold ether to validate the next block in the blockchain. Validators are financially incentivized to verify correct data because they risk losing their stake if they\u2019re a bad actor. Transaction speeds are usually faster on the Ethereum network. Transaction costs can vary more widely on Ethereum based on how many people are actively trying to write new data to the blockchain, i.e., transaction volume. Both have their use cases where they excel, and either ether or Bitcoin could be a viable investment choice for someone interested in buying and holding crypto."

        "content": "Before transactions make it onto a block, they are added to a mempool, which is like a waiting room for transactions, before validators come in to organize them into a big group of transactions known as blocks. During this time, there are ways for third-party players to come in and organize these transactions in certain ways that could maximize some profits, known as Maximal Extractible Value (MEV)."

        "title": "Ethereum developers set roadmap for an eventful 2024 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) developers have outlined a comprehensive plan for the network\u2019s development in 2024, including significant upgrades and new proposals after their latest execution layer meeting on Dec. 8.\n\nA key focus is on the deprecation of the Goerli testnet, with a fork scheduled for early 2024. This move is part of the strategy to activate \u2018Dencun\u2019 on the Ethereum network in January, marking a significant advancement in its technological capabilities.\n\nDencun Activation\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will introduce a novel concept in transaction processing termed \u2018blob-carrying transactions.\u2019 In this context, \u2018blobs\u2019 is an acronym for \u2018Binary Large Objects\u2019. The primary purpose of these blobs is to refine the way Ethereum stores and retrieves data by reducing the amount of data that must be stored indefinitely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nConsequently, the transaction costs associated with data storage are expected to decrease, making overall transactions more economical. It is a critical step toward the long-term goal of danksharding, a planned scaling solution that breaks the network into smaller, parallel segments (shards) to increase capacity and efficiency.\n\nAnother notable development is the introduction of a new proposal aimed at enhancing the power of Execution Layer (EL) clients. The proposal, designed to counteract potential censorship in the mempool, would enable EL clients to override local builders using various heuristics.\n\nFor instance, clients could override when detecting transactions with excessively high fees pending for extended periods. However, adopting such heuristics has not yet been implemented broadly, with only Geth currently having an open pull request on the issue.\n\nIn terms of process updates, the development of a Meta Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for Dencun has been a significant milestone. This is complemented by a draft for a \u201cMeta EIP backfill,\u201d which aims to provide specifications for upgrades previously lacking Meta EIPs.\n\nThe discussion around Meta EIPs has been vital in simplifying access to fork specifications, although there is an ongoing conversation about their role and naming conventions, according to ETH developer Tim Beiko.\n\nPrague/Electra upgrade\n\nLooking forward, the Ethereum community is preparing for the Prague/Electra network upgrade. Among the proposals for this upgrade is EIP-6110, which proposes a new method for supplying validator deposits on-chain, replacing the older Eth1 bridge system.\n\nFuture upgrades may also include Verkle Tries on the Execution Layer and Data Availability Sampling (DAS) on the Consensus Layer, necessitating in-depth technical reviews and discussions.\n\nThe Ethereum community is encouraged to take an active role in shaping the future of the network by participating in these technical discussions and expressing their preferences for potential features in the upcoming upgrades through forums and GitHub threads.\n\nClient teams are set to review these proposals, with more detailed discussions planned for January. This planning forms part of the broader strategic development of the Ethereum network, reflecting the continuous efforts by the developer community to evolve and refine the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum developer community remains actively engaged in enhancing the network\u2019s capabilities, with a clear roadmap set for 2024. The upcoming developments and proposals highlight the network\u2019s ongoing commitment to innovation and responsiveness to community feedback."

        "title": "Solana Dominates Ethereum In Daily Active Wallets, SOL Back To $140? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), the fourth-generation blockchain, has staged a remarkable comeback, looking at on-chain metrics. Citing Artemis data, Step Data Insights on X noted that Solana\u2019s daily active wallets flipped Ethereum\u2019s, the pioneer smart contract platform. This development is when SOL prices have been ripping past resistance levels in the past few months.\n\nSolana\u2019s Resurgence Continues, Daily Active Wallets Flips Ethereum\n\nAccording to Step Data Insights, Solana\u2019s daily active wallets currently hover at around 400,000, slightly edging past Ethereum\u2019s. This spike in activity suggests that Solana is attracting a growing user base, and more people are keen to explore its ecosystems, comprising DeFi, NFTs, and other protocols.\n\nAdditional data from Artemis shows that Solana also eclipses Ethereum in the number of daily transactions. Although Ethereum leads in DeFi total value locked (TVL), Solana\u2019s low fee and scalable environment could explain why users opt for this high-performance network.\n\nOverall, the Solana recovery could triggered by recent favorable price action in Q4 2023. To quantify, Step Data Insights notes that SOL has risen by over 210% in the past three months. During this time, ETH\u2019s gains have capped.\n\nThe analytic platform states that the coin only rose by 39%. To illustrate, in the last three months, SOL rose from around $17 to peak at approximately $70. Meanwhile, ETH expanded from roughly $1,500 to peak at about $2,300, recorded on December 6.\n\nThis recovery points to increasing investor confidence. However, time will tell whether SOL will extend gains in the sessions. From the daily chart, prices have been moving horizontally for the better part of H2 November to early December 2023.\n\nThe immediate resistance line is at $70. With the SOL moving inside a bull flag, any upswing above November 2023 highs will be the building block for a possible leg-up that will lift SOL to April 2022 highs of $140.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Hopes, Firedancer Lifting Solana\n\nAltcoins, including Solana, have been racing higher as the crypto market recovers. Following a court ruling, SOL is relatively firm despite the FTX estate being permitted to liquidate the coin in the secondary markets to repay creditors.\n\nHopes of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the first Bitcoin ETF have also benefited Solana. However, the recent release of Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, on testnet has supported SOL.\n\nThe client will make the network more resilient and performant. Firedancer will go live in the H1 2024. Once it goes live, the new client is expected to improve Solana\u2019s reliability.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum whales held around 38% of the total supply at press time.\n\nETH\u2019s supply has continued to decline.\n\nThroughout the year, Ethereum [ETH] whales have consistently made strategic moves, and recent reports indicated a noteworthy increase in their holdings.\n\nEthereum whales gather more supply\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the percentage of Ethereum supply held by large investors, known as whales, has increased over the year. The data showed a growth from 32% in January to around 35%.\n\nFurther examination of whale holdings on Santiment also showed an increase.\n\nInitial observations of the chart showed a clear upward trend in the past few months. In August, the percentage of whale holdings stood at about 34%, but as of this writing, it was over 38%.\n\nAn important question thus arises: How has this surge in holdings affected the overall supply of Ethereum on exchanges?\n\nEthereum: Supply on Exchanges continues to decline\n\nThe Ethereum supply on exchanges has exhibited minimal fluctuation in the recent period. However, it has shown a significant decrease over the last six months.\n\nChart analysis showed a decline of nearly 1 million units between August and the present. As of this writing, the exchange supply was around 10.51 million.\n\nConnecting the dots between the trends in exchange supply and the holdings of Ethereum whales, one might infer that the accumulation by large investors has influenced the overall supply.\n\nThe reduction in supply on exchanges implied a decrease in liquidity, which could exert a positive influence on the price trend.\n\nETH uptrend comes to a halt\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily price trend showed a consistent accumulation by whales across various price ranges. Preceding this recent report, the chart indicated a continuous increase in the value of ETH over the past six days.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe uptrends resulted in around an 11% increase in value. However, at the time of this writing, there was a slight decline of almost 2%. Despite the decline, it has managed to maintain a stable price of around $2,200.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that if the percentage of supply held by these whales begins to diminish, it could signify capitulation. This is a crucial consideration, as a substantial release of volume onto exchanges might adversely impact the price trend."

The Bitcoin narrative continues to steer the ship, but a closer look reveals the total altcoin market cap playing catch-up.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Rises Above $2,300 \u2013 Can ETH Reach $3,500 by December 31?\n\nEther (ETH), the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last up close to 5% on Thursday and just hit fresh highs for the year in the mid-$2,300s.\n\nEthereum remains the dominant blockchain used by Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and broader web3 industries, accounting for around 70% of the crypto industry\u2019s $107 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per DeFi Llama, which refers to the total value of all crypto locked in smart contracts.\n\nEther has been pumping in recent weeks amid a broader resurgence in risk appetite across the crypto market that saw Bitcoin this week surge to fresh yearly highs above $44,000.\n\nThat pump has come amid optimism about expected near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and about a potentially imminent dovish monetary policy pivot from the US Federal Reserve, which could lead to a more favorable liquidity environment.\n\nBut with major asset managers like BlackRock also moving to create spot Ethereum ETFs, with the Ether supply having recent switched back to deflationary thanks to improving on chain activity and with Ether having substantially lagged Bitcoin\u2019s rally this year (ETH is up 96% year-to-date versus BTC\u2019s 164% gain), the case for strong near-term Ether price gains strong.\n\nRecent technical developments also support the case for further upside, with near-term price predictions likely to remain bullish as a result.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Can Ether (ETH) Reach $3,500 By December 31st?\n\n\n\nETH recently broke above and then found strong support at key long-term resistance in the $2,150 area.\n\nChart analysis shows that there aren\u2019t many key resistance levels now going all the way until 2022\u2019s highs in the $3,500 area, meaning quick potential upside of around 50% in the near future.\n\nWhether ETH could cover such distance to the upside prior to the 31st of December (i.e. in just over three weeks) seems unlikely but isn\u2019t be unheard of in ETH\u2019s price history.\n\nIn late July 2020, ETH rallied 57% in two week, followed by a more than 80% in the final week of 2020 and into the first week of 2021.\n\nThe last week of April into the first week of May 2021 then saw a more than 70% gain for ETH.\n\nWith technicals and fundamentals lining up at a typically strong time for the crypto market (i.e. a strong possibility of a santa rally), investors shouldn\u2019t bet against ETH hitting $3,500 this year.\n\nCrypto Alternatives to Consider\n\n\n\nWhile ETH offers strong upside potential for the weeks ahead, those looking to diversify into an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy should consider getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nMany of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nSee the 15 CryptocurrenciesDisclosure: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nCryptocurrency expert Evan Aldo recently talked about different digital currencies, giving us the lowdown on their current situations and where they might be headed. On The Paul Barron Network, the analyst said that further price movement could be influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s performance, suggesting that a Bitcoin surge to $48,000 or $50,000 could propel the altcoins to perform better.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nAldo talked about Ethereum, mentioning that even though its price in regular money (USD) went up, when compared to Bitcoin, it\u2019s not doing so great. He said that if Ethereum doesn\u2019t hold on to a certain level, it might drop even lower, possibly to around $2200. But, Aldo stays hopeful about Ethereum\u2019s future, thinking it might bounce back and reach a target just under $2400.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nThe analyst had good things to say about Avalanche, saying it has been doing well recently. He mentioned that if Avalanche can go above $30, it might shoot up to around $39. Aldo believes Avalanche has a good chance of hitting its all-time high within the next two years.\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nTalking about Chainlink, Aldo said that while it has gained a lot in the past, there could be better options out there. He thinks Chainlink still has potential, and if it breaks some important levels, it might reach around $20. Aldo pointed out positive signs, like good money flow in the 3-day chart and a possible change in trend on the monthly chart.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nAldo touched briefly on Solana, noting that it recently announced a $20 nationwide cell phone plan. While he recognized Solana\u2019s success, he also warned about potential sell-offs after big announcements and recommended keeping a close eye on key technical indicators. He discussed the potential price prediction for Solana, indicating a target between $75 and $80. Aldo pointed out positive technical indicators, such as trigger waves on the 6-hour chart and a potential breakout if Solana can maintain support at $62."

        "content": "Ethereum has powered back from recent bearish sentiment with a vengeance, displaying formidable strength as it approaches pivotal resistance levels. This steep rebound combined with extremely bullish on-chain activity signals Ethereum may be on the cusp of a major breakout rally over the next year.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum price has rebounded strongly and is heading towards a key resistance level\n\nToken shows extreme strength which points to a positive long-term outlook, potentially reaching a new all-time high soon\n\nNon-exchange Ethereum addresses have hit an all-time high of 54.6 million compared to 150 biggest exchange addresses at 5-year low of 9.3 million\n\nThis suggests retail traders are accumulating and whales are losing sell-off power\n\nAnalyst Michael van de Poppe predicts Ethereum could hit $3,000 in Q1 2024\n\nAfter a crushing crypto market downturn for most of 2022, Ethereum has been one of the standout performers in December. Its price has soared around 40% in a month, bouncing firmly off support despite broader asset market volatility. This resilience is underpinned by growing data that retail traders are fervently accumulating ETH while whales lose their sell-off capabilities.\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Santiment reports non-exchange addresses holding Ethereum have exploded to an all-time high of 54.6 million. At the same time, balances of ETH on centralized exchanges have plummeted to a 5-year low. This suggests everyday traders are stockpiling Ethereum in anticipation of higher prices while the largest wallet holders see their influence wane.\n\n???? #Ethereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June, 2022. The long-term trend of top non-exchange whale wallets getting richer, and top exchange whale wallets having less sell-off power, is a promising combo for a continued climb. https://t.co/h7ogbqPLWf pic.twitter.com/82plXmVn02 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 7, 2023\n\nThe technical chart also looks promising for Ethereum as it presses against formidable resistance around the $1,800 level. Well-followed analyst Michael van de Poppe expects this wall to crumble in early 2024, tweeting that Ethereum reaching $3,000 is a realistic possibility in Q1 next year if bullish momentum persists.\n\n#Ethereum starts to rally against $BTC. In the period prior to the #Bitcoin halving, 3-8 months before, it's the best period to allocate towards altcoins. Right now, we might be seeing the exact same on $ETH, which means that Ethereum is ready for $3,000+ in Q1. pic.twitter.com/9HPzTeIK6A \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 7, 2023\n\nOther experts highlight Ethereum\u2019s history of slow, steady growth eventually resulting in parabolic upside moves as justification for a pending supply shock. And positive sentiment continues swelling around ETH in comparison to the turmoil embroiling major centralized crypto institutions in 2022.\n\nOf course, nothing is guaranteed in the volatile world of cryptocurrency markets. However, Ethereum possesses fundamental advantages as the leading smart contract platform and clear technical and on-chain signals hinting at substantial upside. The stars may be aligning for Ethereum to power higher through 2023 into a fresh all-time high by early next year."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin All Jumped This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto winter is thawing, and some of the biggest tokens on the market have come to life in just the past week. There wasn't any major news out from the industry, but there seems to be a very big mood shift happening across crypto.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Bitcoin (BTC 1.35%) is up 13.6%, Ethereum (ETH 0.77%) has gained 12.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 4.20%) has popped 20.2% over the past seven days. And there doesn't seem to be any end in sight to the momentum.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere have been a number of catalysts for the crypto market lately. The bullish move in the stock market has been a very \"risk-on\" move which has typically translated to cryptocurrencies moving higher as well.\n\nAirdrops, or giving away tokens to wallets on the blockchain, have also added hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidity to the market, and that's pushing the values of the better-known tokens higher.\n\nCrypto can be a very sentiment-driven market, and traders are seeing a lot of reasons to be bullish right now with institutions and individuals pouring money into crypto after nearly two years of money flowing out of the industry. On top of that, interest rates are falling and growth investors are getting more bullish, which correlated with the rise in crypto in 2021.\n\nMore work ahead\n\nFor the momentum to continue, crypto needs to develop more use cases and ways to generate value than just trading. That's being done in a lot of areas including payments and decentralized financial products. But many tokens and airdrops are simply riding the hype cycle without knowing where long-term value is going to come from.\n\nI think the current state of crypto looks a lot like the fear of missing out and \"you only live once\" trading that happened during the pandemic. But this time around the market is much more well known, and bigger institutions are starting to get involved.\n\nWhat investors should be wary of is the market crashing again if the economy slows down and interest rates don't come down as fast as expected. This crypto rally isn't necessarily built on a solid footing of improving regulations and improved use cases; it's more about speculation.\n\nWhile I'm bullish on the future of the blockchain, I don't think these moves in some cryptocurrencies are sustainable. Many tokens have little use other than trading, and their long-term prospects ultimately may end in values falling and investors losing their money. There are more established tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have proven to be stores of value or a place where there's development, but I wouldn't take the rise in altcoins as a sustainable jump. After a great week and an even better month, it may be time to take some gains in crypto."

Last year, the dramatic collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST marked the beginning of the crypto winter.

        "content": "What Is Shiba Inu (SHIB)?\n\nShiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin (a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) that features the Shiba Inu\u2014a Japanese breed of hunting dog\u2014as its mascot. Shiba Inu is widely considered to be an alternative to Dogecoin; in fact, proponents of Shiba Inu tout it as \"the Dogecoin killer.\"\n\nShiba Inu and Dogecoin are meme coins, which are cryptocurrencies associated with some theme\u2014like the Shiba Inu in the case of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin\u2014but are often launched as a parody or inside joke rather than as a digital product that actually has utility. While Dogecoin was launched in December 2013, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an anonymous individual or group called Ryoshi.\n\nKey Takeaways Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin that features the Shiba Inu hunting dog as its mascot.\n\nIt is widely considered an alternative to Dogecoin and is touted as \"the Dogecoin killer\" by its supporters, a community calling itself the SHIBArmy.\n\nShiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an individual or group called Ryoshi.\n\nShiba Inu's price peaked more than tenfold on Oct. 29, 2021, giving it a market capitalization of $41 billion at the time. Even with a steep drop in market cap to $5.97 billion (as of Dec. 8, 2023), Shiba Inu still ranks in the top ten among all meme cryptocurrencies by this measure, second to Dogecoin.\n\nThe History of Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nThe guiding tenets of the Shiba Inu ecosystem are spelled out in a \"woof paper\" (presumably a play on the term \"white paper\"), available at the ShibaToken.com website.\n\nAccording to the paper, Shiba Inu was developed to answer a simple question: \"What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?\" Its founder, Ryoshi, attributes its origins to an \"experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building.\" According to Ryoshi, the power of collective decentralization can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could create.\n\nThe SHIBArmy's base of nearly 500,000 Reddit members embraces its founding principles, which are:\n\nThe project started from zero, with zero, in the spirit of creating something out of nothing\n\nIt was not founded from an existing community or preassembled team\n\nA professed love of Shiba Inu dogs\n\nBecause Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, it was created on and hosted by the Ethereum blockchain instead of its own blockchain. Ryoshi states in the paper that he chose to build the Shiba Inu ecosystem on Ethereum because it was already secure and well-established, and it allowed the project to stay decentralized.\n\nBlockchain Updates\n\nIn January 2023, the Shiba Inu community leadership introduced Shibarium, a layer two blockchain designed to run on top of Ethereum. It is supposed to reduce congestion, introduce staking into its ecosystem, lower gas fees, and provide a framework for decentralized applications and Web 3 expansion.\n\nThe Shiba Inu Ecosystem\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem consists of the following three tokens, with one to be added \"soon\" (as of Dec. 8, 2023):\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) : This is the project's foundational currency. Starting with a supply of about 1 quadrillion (equal to 1,000 trillion), Ryoshi locked 50% in Uniswap (for liquidity purposes) and then sent the other 50% to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for safekeeping. In May 2021, Buterin donated more than 50 trillion Shiba Inu coins worth over $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund in India when the nation was reeling from the Delta variant of the coronavirus.

In May 2021, Buterin donated more than 50 trillion Shiba Inu coins worth over $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund in India when the nation was reeling from the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Shortly thereafter, Buterin also \"burned\"\u2014or permanently removed from circulation\u201440% of Shiba Inu's total supply by moving it to a \"dead wallet.\" Leash (LEASH) : The second token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Leash represents the other end of the ecosystem's spectrum, with a total supply of only 107,646 tokens compared with the trillions of Shiba Inu tokens.

Shiboshis: Shiboshis are 10,000 Shiba Inu-generated non-fungible tokens (NFTs) written on the Ethereum blockchain, with different traits that make each Shiboshi unique and collectible.\n\nSHIB's Canine Terminology\n\nIn keeping with the dog theme, the aforementioned Shiba Inu woof paper uses canine terms to describe how returns can be generated from one's Shiba Inu tokens. On ShibaSwap, these tokens can be used to \"dig\" (provide liquidity), \"bury\" (stake tokens), and even \"fetch\" (exchange one token for another). Tokens used in these strategies generate \"Woof\" returns in the form of Bone tokens that are distributed to token pools known as \"Puppy Pools,\" according to the woof paper.\n\nFor cryptocurrency enthusiasts, part of the allure of meme coins is that they reject conventional protocols, and this unconventional approach may extend to the use of canine terms to describe return strategies. But they certainly seem to be a world away from staid investment terms such as return on investment and liquidity.\n\nHow to Get SHIB\n\nYou can purchase SHIB on several exchanges using their wallets, such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken, to name a few. You can also set up a MetaMask wallet and connect it to Shiba Swap, the exchange recommended (and created) by the Shiba Inu community.\n\nConcerns About Shiba Inu\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies is risky enough because of their massive volatility and lack of regulation. Investing in the altcoin/meme coin space presents an additional challenge because of a lack of differentiation and the fact that most of their value is based on trading by their followers. Here are some investing considerations for a potential investor in Shiba Inu.\n\nLow Per-Token Price\n\nEven after some impressive gains, Shiba Inu (SHIB) costs a fraction of a cent, so one can buy millions of SHIB tokens with a few hundred dollars. At its peak price of $0.00008845, $100 would have fetched over 1.1 million SHIB tokens. The amount of coins you can purchase can cause significant losses if SHIB's price ever tumbles, but the chance of tremendous gains also exists.\n\nLimited Utility and Use Case\n\nThough its adherents may point out that Shiba Inu-based NFTs are now available, and its Ethereum base and new Layer 2 blockchain should increase transaction speeds and scalability, as of Dec. 7, 2023, Shiba Inu has very limited utility and does not have a compelling use case as of the end of 2023 other than allowing non-fungible tokens.\n\nVolatility\n\nShibu Inu's price experiences wide fluctuations, but the cryptocurrency is much less expensive than others on the market, so they are actually quite small. For example, from Jan. 1, 2023, to Dec. 7, 2023, SHIBs highest and lowest prices had a difference of $0.0000099.\n\nThis appears very low, but losses multiply with the amount purchased or held\u2014bsince you can buy a tremendous amount of SHIB, at scale, losses could be huge. If you had purchased 10 million SHIB at its 2023 high ($0.00001562496), you would have paid $156.25. On Dec. 8, 2023, you'd still have been waiting for gains, as SHIB's price was $0.00001006 at one point, a value of $100.60 for your 10 million SHIB. Imagine if you had purchased a one billion SHIB ($15,624.96 at the highest price) hoping for gains. Your SHIB would have been worth $10,060.00 on Dec. 8, 2023\u2014a loss of $5,564.96.\n\nSome trades have become the stuff of investing legend, such as George Soros' wager against the British pound in 1991 or the short subprime mortgages trade by John Paulson from 2007 to 2009. In terms of sheer percentage gains, a purported trade in Shiba Inu by an unknown trader puts even those legendary trades in the shade. The trader bought about 70 trillion SHIB tokens for approximately $8,000 in August 2020. One year later, that stake accounted for about 13% of SHIB's total circulation of 550 trillion and gained a staggering value of $5.7 billion.\n\nHow Much Is 1 Shiba Coin Worth? One SHIB was worth about $0.000010017 on Dec. 8, 2023. As of that date, the coin had never reached a value of more than $0.00008845.\n\nIs Shiba Inu a Good Investment? Whether or not SHIB is a good investment depends on your investing goals, risk tolerance, strategy, personal preferences, and outlook.\n\nWhich Crypto Will Boom In 2024? It is difficult to tell which cryptocurrency, if any, will experience a boom. The space constantly undergoes changes and reacts, almost explosively, to the news.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nShiba Inu is a cryptocurrency which, at its creation in 2021, had no use or value. By the end of 2023, it was being traded in large volumes to take advantage of microscopic price movements and used as a payment method. Shiba Inu is continuously being developed and improved by a dedicated community to have utility and use cases, so there is a distinct possibility that it will remain one of the more popular cryptocurrencies on the market.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nEthereum experienced significant growth in 2023, with a year-to-date high of approximately $2,385, marking a 97% rise in value.\n\nThis surge, however, presents a dichotomy when viewed through the prism of Bitcoin. Using Bitcoin as a reference point, Ethereum saw a decline of 25%, positioning it only 6% higher than the year-to-date lows.\n\nThe Bitcoin-Ethereum ratio stands at 0.0544, indicating an exchange rate of roughly 18 Ethereum per Bitcoin. This figure contrasts starkly with the cycle\u2019s low in September 2022, when the ratio was 12 Ethereum for 1 Bitcoin.\n\nThe data highlights Ethereum\u2019s impressive performance when measured in USD while hinting at a less favorable trend when compared to Bitcoin. Evaluating all assets, including Ethereum, could redefine what constitutes a \u2018good year\u2019 for cryptocurrency investments if Bitcoin were to ascend to a global currency status."

        "content": "A new report by investment firm VanEck lays out 15 projections for the cryptocurrency landscape 2024. The report dives into the key possibility of whether Ethereum can dethrone Bitcoin.\n\nContradictory to the notion, the report mentioned that Ethereum will fall short of \u201cflipping\u201d Bitcoin next year despite robust gains.\n\nThe analysis sees Bitcoin retaining its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitcoin may also attract state-level support from countries like Argentina. The report also points to Bitcoin\u2019s clear regulatory status and higher energy consumption. This is forecast to attract interest from quasi-state entities in regions such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin From \u201cSatoshi Era\u201d on the Move: Here\u2019s Where It\u2019s Headed\n\nAs the fifth country to sponsor Bitcoin mining at the state level, Argentina, through its state-owned energy giant YPF, is signaling interest in mining digital assets.\n\nEthereum outlook is still strong\n\nDespite the outlook, Ethereum is expected to outrun mega-cap tech stocks massively. VanEck believes Ethereum will surge post-halving when Bitcoin miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half. This historically triggers a renewed Bitcoin price surge, with profits flowing into altcoins afterward.\n\nHowever, despite beating major stocks, Ethereum won\u2019t overtake Bitcoin, as speculation of \u201cflippening\u201d suggests. While some likelihood of ETH becoming more valuable in daily trade volume exists, Bitcoin is still seen as maintaining its market cap lead.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu To 1 Cent?

        "title": "2 Reasons Why An Ethereum Mega Bull Run Is Inevitable - NewsBTC",
        "content": "While the recent Bitcoin and crypto momentum is cooling off, Ethereum (ETH) rejects lower lows, especially against Bitcoin (BTC). Taking to X on December 8, decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher DefiIgnas shared insights that suggest ETH could be on the verge of a rally that would potentially see the second most valuable coin usurp BTC\u2019s current position as the best-performing asset.\n\nReasons That Might Drive Ethereum Bulls\n\nThe researcher observed that ETH is down 24% versus BTC in 2023. However, multiple fundamental indicators show that this is about to change. First, DefiIgnas noted that crypto investors are increasingly drawn to discounted Grayscale Ethereum Trust (GETH), which has been rallying over the past few months, outperforming Ethereum spot prices.\n\nGETH surged by 298% in the past few months, while ETH only rose by around 100% in the same period. As GETH share prices increased, its discount with spot ETH decreased. This means more capital indirectly flowed into ETH, leading to higher demand.\n\nBesides GETH rising, the researcher remains bullish on Ethereum because of the recent developments surrounding the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The crypto community expects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize multiple products, including those proposed by Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIn DefiIgnas\u2019 assessment, once the spot Bitcoin ETF goes live, likely in early 2024, all \u201cattention, narrative, and speculation\u201d will shift toward the agency approving the first spot Ethereum ETF. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has already applied with the SEC to issue the first spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe expected activation of the Cancun upgrade in H1 2024 will also likely support Ethereum prices. Over the years, Ethereum has integrated multiple upgrades. This includes shifting to proof-of-stake (PoS) from proof-of-work (PoW) and overhauling their fee auction mechanism, introducing ETH burning.\n\nHowever, with Cancun, the goal is to directly enhance the main net\u2019s capabilities by activating several proposals, including EIP-4844 proto-dank sharding, which aims to reduce gas fees associated with rollups. This update will further cement Ethereum\u2019s quest to significantly increase on-chain scalability and reduce gas fees over the years.\n\nETH Looks Firm, Resistance At November Highs\n\nAt spot rates, ETH is firm versus BTC, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. How prices react in the days ahead remains to be seen.\n\nEven so, if there is confirmation of the December 7 gains, ETH might extend gains. In that case, it can break above the current consolidation as bulls aim to break above November 2023 highs of around 0.058 BTC.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The asset has claimed a fresh high for 2023 amid the renewed interest.\n\nETH Claims 19-Month High\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum has climbed above the $2,350 price level for the first time since May 2022, marking a fresh 2023 high and its highest price level in 19 months. At the time of writing, the asset\u2019s price continues to climb, trading at $2,363.51, representing a 5.55% gain in the past 24 hours per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nIn an X post on Thursday, December 7, crypto analytics firm Santiment Feed implied that the recent spike in ETH\u2019s price would continue amid increased accumulation by non-exchange whales.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June, 2022.

Together, these whales have accumulated nearly 82k ETH.\n\nWill ETH Climb Higher?\n\nAs recently reported by DailyCoin, analysts like \u201cDuo Nine\u201d have tipped ETH to clinch the $3k price point. Ali Martinez, another prominent analyst, has also argued that the $2k price point could serve as a strong support level for ETH as over 43 million holders bought at the level and were unlikely to sell there.\n\nAt the time of writing, the asset\u2019s four-hour candle price chart suggests that it is firmly in an uptrend. However, a break of its higher low of around $2,233.35 may give investors pause, indicating a short-term trend change or the beginning of a chart pattern formation.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour candle chart.

Traders are at liberty to continue betting on ETH longs, provided the blue MACD line holds above the red signal line.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum indicator should generally be moving higher above the neutral area, to reinforce the prevailing bullish thesis.\n\nAlthough several factors may influence Ethereum price in December, including the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative, declines are likely to be minimal as the sell-side pressure weakens.\n\nFor now, it would be prudent for traders to watch out for two key levels; if the resistance at $2,400 gives in and support at $2,300 holds. The first scenario could spread FOMO across the market, with more holders buying in speculation for the next move to $3,000 and then to $3,550.\n\nIn the second scenario, Ethereum could retest support at $2,300 and springboard strongly with a comeback strong enough to blast through $2,400. However, the technical structure could change if a stronger correction pushes Ethereum price to retest $2,100 before making another recovery attempt.\n\nEthereum price is slightly overbought according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily time frame. If bulls don\u2019t present a stronger case, bears could overrule their reign for a correction to $2,100 and $2,000, respectively.\n\nRecommended for you: Cardano Price As Pump Setup Triggers, Is ADA Going To $1 In December?\n\nEthereum Open Interest Soars To $8B\n\nThe open interest (OI), which monitors the flow of money in and out of a futures or options market, has been growing consistently since June 2022, according to Coinglass data.\n\nAs IO increases it suggests that new money is coming into the derivatives market than the money flowing out. Moreover, Ethereum price rising along with the OI, confirms a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nThe Ethereum open interest currently slightly below $8 billion is back at pre-Terra crash levels in 2022 and suggests the market is slowly easing into the bull run following a lengthy bear run.\n\nRelated Articles"

When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights ETC price action displays a strong bullish trend giving a range breakout.\n\nWith a remarkable breakout rally, the ETC price prepares for a jump to $25.\n\nThe uptrend can reach the $30 mark, if the ETC Price sustains momentum.\n\nMaking a bullish comeback in December, the Ethereum Classic price blazes up this Winter season. Ready to extend the 38% year-to-date growth, the ETC price lights up a breakout rally as it drinks up the increased momentum thanks to the recovery phase in the overall market.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum prices shooting higher above $40K and $2.2K, Ethereum Classic is ready to spread its wings and rise higher. Turning the ETC price prediction more bullish, the buyers are lining up to pay the premium for ETC tokens.\n\nSource \u2013 Tradingview\n\nWith the slow but gradual rise in the ETC price gaining momentum, the trend analysis marks a strong comeback. Making a rounding bottom pattern in the daily chart, the recovery rally plans a trend continuation to start 2024 at higher levels than 2023.\n\nThe recent bounceback within the continuation pattern finds an increase in the trading volume, reflecting a rise in demand. Further, the ETC price gives a bullish breakout as it crosses the long-term barrier at $20.\n\nWith a moonshot rally at high speed, Ethereum Classic has jumped by 16.26% in the last seven days to form consecutive bullish candles. Moreover, the ETC price trades at $21.52 with an intraday growth of 5.87%, forming a solid bullish engulfing candle.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD: The MACD and signal lines give a bullish crossover signal in the daily chart, with the revival of positive histograms. Therefore, the momentum indicator supports the extension of the breakout rally.\n\nEMA: The golden crossover in the 50D and 200D EMA marks a trend reversal in the ETC price and signals entry opportunities for new buyers.\n\nWill ETC Price Reach $30?\n\nWith the eye-catching breakout of the $20 barrier, Ethereum Classic is ready to start a bullish breakout rally. Further, the rising sentiments lead to an increased capacity of investors to take risks fueling the altcoin market rally.\n\nUnder such supporting conditions, the ETC price gives a breakout rally and may shortly cross the $25 mark. If the uptrend exceeds the $25 mark, then the altcoin may start 2024 at levels greater than $30.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum Classic fails to sustain the momentum, it may fall below $20 to test $17."

        "content": "Market analyst Cryptoes is looking out for a fresh XRP uptrend in the long run, as data suggests XRP has continued to outperform Ethereum (ETH) in 2023 despite recent trends.\n\nTaking to X, Cryptoes shared combined charts detailing XRP\u2019s price movements on a weekly timeframe, and Ethereum\u2019s price movements within the same timeframe. The period of interest spans January 2023 through December 2023.\n\nCryptoes called attention to XRP\u2019s price action throughout this year, which has been primarily encouraging. However, the recollection was necessary amid the waning optimism among XRP investors, as the crypto asset fails to capitalize fully on the recent Bitcoin uptrend.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP Outperforms Ethereum\n\nData from Cryptoes\u2019 chart suggests that XRP has appreciated 116% this year. XRP began January 2023 on a bullish standing, following three consecutive months of decline from October to December 2022.\n\nThe cryptocurrency closed January 2023 at $0.4057 amid a 19.68% increase. This increase ended its monthly losing streak. XRP has continued to register intermittent upswings and declines since then. As of press time, the asset changes hands at $0.6330.\n\nAccording to Cryptoes\u2019 disclosure, Ethereum has also recorded a similar bullish year, but its rate of growth has slowed in comparison to XRP\u2019s. Data from the chart suggests that Ethereum has appreciated 91% since the start of 2023.\n\nDespite XRP\u2019s substantial price upsurge this year, Cryptoes pointed out that the asset still has a long way to go before it can catch up to Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Notably, ETH boasts a market cap of $270.5 billion, while XRP\u2019s market cap stands at $34 billion.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA Potential Fresh Uptrend\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is nearly eight times XRP\u2019s. At the current figures, XRP would need to soar 706% from its current price to a value of $5.08 to hit Ethereum\u2019s market cap. While most market watchers have discussed the possibility of this surge, it remains uncertain.\n\nCiting the current realities, Cryptoes disclosed that he was looking out for a fresh and long-term uptrend for XRP. The Crypto Basic recently revealed that XRP witnessed a similar dull performance at the start of the bull run in 2017. However, the asset eventually outperformed Bitcoin and other tokens.\n\nXRP is up 4.68% over the past week, while ETH has rallied 9.8%. However, interest in XRP remains on the high side, with trade volume seeing a 19% surge in the last 24 hours to $1,936,448,897."

Discover SCENE\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum still gaining in recent days, gaming-centric tokens are broadly continuing pace\u2014with buzzy tokens tied to the Ronin and Beam networks leading the charge among large-cap projects.\n\nRON, the token of gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain network Ronin, has popped 21% over the last 24 hours to a current price of $1.75, continuing a recent surge in value for the token that\u2019s led to a 67% weekly gain and sizable 197% jump in the last 30 days per data from CoinGecko.\n\nRonin\u2019s rise has been tied in large part to rising adoption linked to Pixels, a popular blockchain game that recently migrated to the network from Polygon. Ronin active users jumped after the Pixels launch, plus Axie Infinity\u2014the monster-battling game that originally launched the network\u2014has also seen rising momentum lately amid the improving crypto market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBEAM, meanwhile, is the Ethereum-based token of Merit Circle\u2019s Beam gaming network, which is based around an Avalanche subnet. On Wednesday, Merit Circle announced that it would integrate the upcoming Immutable zkEVM network into the Beam ecosystem, with tools that play nice with the gaming-centric Ethereum scaling network.\n\nPrior to the announcement, BEAM climbed to a new all-time high price\u2014and then rose even higher once the news came out, hitting a new peak just above $0.017 overnight. BEAM has settled slightly to a current price of about $0.0162. It\u2019s up about 6% on the day, but 78% over the past seven days and 238% on the month.\n\nMerit Circle\u2019s own MC token is also up 11% on the day to $1.67, while Axie Infinity\u2019s AXS governance token is up 3% to $7.30 and the SLP in-game rewards token surged nearly 17% to $0.0034.\n\nOther notable gaming gainers include Immutable\u2019s IMX token, up 6% today to $1.47 with a 16% weekly gain, while Gala Games\u2019 GALA token is up 6% today above $0.03. GALA has now jumped about 25% over the past week, and 60% in the last 30 days.\n\nMuch like meme coins, gaming tokens tend to be more volatile than leading coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. That means when the market is green, they tend to show sharper gains\u2014though the opposite is typically true when the market is sinking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin is up 16% this week to a current price of about $43,600, pushing its 30-day jump to nearly 26%. Ethereum has just about kept pace, up 15% this week to a current price of $2,339 and marking a 30-day pump of 26%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "A dormant Ethereum whale has resurfaced, moving their 39,260 ETH worth approximately $87.5 million. According to data from Lookonchain, this Ethereum whale with almost $90 million in ETH recently woke up and decided to move its mountain of digital assets to an exchange.\n\nAlthough it is unclear the motive behind this transfer, it appears to be to take profit on a 670% gain over the past five years.\n\nEthereum Whale Moves 39,260 ETH To Crypto Exchange\n\nThe crypto market has had another flurry of price increases in the past few days, with Coinmarketcap\u2019s Fear & Greed Index now pointing to an extreme greed of 81. Ethereum hasn\u2019t been left out of the price gains, and the crypto is currently up by 11% in a 7-day timeframe.\n\nAmidst the price gain, a social media post by on-chain analysis tracker Lookonchain shows that a whale recently deposited 39,260 ETH worth $87.5 million to the crypto exchange Kraken. Further details from on-chain data show that the coins were acquired around June to August 2017.\n\nDuring this period, the whale address received 47,260 ETH acquired at an average price of $240 and worth $11.34 million in total at the time. However, the account has remained largely inactive since then, sitting on unrealized profit as Ethereum continued to grow in price. But now, the coins have made their way into Kraken.\n\nThe massive transfer of funds from a whale\u2019s wallet to an exchange typically signals them cashing out some or all of their holdings. In this particular case, the whale would make a profit of approximately $78 million if they decided to sell all their holdings on the exchange.\n\nAn early $ETH whale appears to be selling ETH again after being dormant for 5 years. The whale deposited all 39,260 $ETH($87.5M) to #Kraken 30 mins ago. The whale received 47,260 $ETH($11.34M) at ~$240 from June to August 2017. If sold the whale would make a profit of ~$78M. pic.twitter.com/v0PI4LNTKO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023\n\nETH price succumbs to sell pressure | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nTrend Of ETH Profit Taking Increasing?\n\nA massive transfer of funds naturally leads to speculation within the crypto community, and there seems to be an increasing trend of large ETH holders taking profits. Other social media posts from Lookonchain over the past few days have shown similar cases of large wallets sending their ETH to exchanges.\n\nFor instance, a recent post showed the movement of ETH in wallet addresses belonging to defunct exchanges FTX and Celsius. FTX deposited 3,143 ETH worth $7.2 million on Coinbase, while Celsius sent 7,500 ETH worth $17.2 million to address \u201c0xc450.\u201d\n\nGalaxy Digital followed suit, depositing 9,179 ETH worth $20.9 million to Binance. According to Whale Alerts, 16,944 ETH worth $38.14 million also made its way to Coinbase from a private wallet.\n\nEven though Ethereum briefly touched $2,300 yesterday, it would seem the recent transfer to exchanges has had an effect on the price of ETH, as the crypto is trading at $2,269 at the time of writing, down by 1.5%.\n\nThe crypto market remains largely unpredictable, but it would be prudent to wait to see if the crypto approaches and rebounds at the $2,200 resistance level. At the same time, a strong blast above $2,300 could signal bulls are still in control.\n\nFeatured image from StormGain, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Soars To Over $2,300 \u2013 Is $3,000 Next? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The market performance of Ethereum has been steadily rising since October, marking a positive and long-lasting trend. Increased buying activity has been the main driver of this positive momentum that has persisted over time, pushing the cryptocurrency beyond the vaunted $2,000 resistance mark and igniting a continuing rally.\n\nThe value of Ethereum has sharply grown as a direct result of this increased demand and market optimism, with its sights set on breaking through the crucial resistance region at $2,300. This upward trend serves as another evidence of the increasing investor trust and general bullishness surrounding Ethereum, thereby solidifying its place in the changing cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum Hits 18-Month Highs, Targets $3,000\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, is rising quickly and has reached levels not seen in the previous 18 months. With a market valuation of $285 billion, ETH is now trading 5.7% higher at $2,375 as of the time of publication. Some speculators have even shared $3,000 price predictions for ETH amid the latest market breakout.\n\nEthereum\u2019s approaching resistance level poses a huge challenge to buyers of the altcoin, including the fixed barrier at $2.5K, which has frequently shown to be a significant roadblock. But if the market is able to recapture this critical area, Ethereum may go on to reach the $2.5K \u2013 or even $3.000 \u2014 in the future.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,358 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAs Ethereum breaks down further obstacles, investors and market watchers are keeping a close eye on the situation. A notable indication of the increased interest from institutional investors is the eagerness with which major players like VanEck, BlackRock, and Grayscale are awaiting clearance for Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAccording to Santiment, an on-chain data service, Ethereum has reached $2,349, its highest price since June 2022. The amalgamation of the positive long-term trend indicating a rise in wealth for the leading non-exchange whale wallets and a decrease in sell-off power for the leading exchange whale wallets presents a propitious situation for a steady upward trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Non-Exchange Holdings Surge To 55M ETH\n\nA recent tweet from Santinment highlights some intriguing variations in Ethereum\u2019s wallet mechanics. Exchange wallets saw a five-year low of 9.3 million ETH, while top non-exchange wallets are building up to a record 54.6 million ETH. This move points to upward trends, with wealth building through non-exchange transactions and decreased selling pressure.\n\nOver the course of two months, a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator grew, pointing to a possible overvaluation of Ethereum at this point. Given the current characteristics of the market, even if buyers seem to be in charge and overall sentiment is bullish, there is a significant likelihood of a brief corrective phase that involves consolidation and higher volatility in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent ACDE meeting provided information about the impending Dencun fork of Ethereum, which is set to occur in January 2024. The Goerli network testnet fork was well-prepared for by development teams, opening the door for a larger Goerli shadow network fork in the coming weeks.\n\nACDE#176 happened earlier today: we discussed the state of Dencun, timelines for testnets, and how to approach planning the following network upgrade \u26d3\ufe0f Agenda: https://t.co/ATVLQ7f9Xp\n\nStream: https://t.co/tDM0tDKxC5 Recap below \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/PhGBkYxhYN \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023\n\nBy using proto-danksharding, Dencun is expected to greatly increase data availability for layer-2 rollups. This improvement should result in lower rollup transaction costs, which will eventually help end customers.\n\nDencun\u2019s overall effects include rollups that increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability, gas fee optimization, improved network security, and the deployment of several housekeeping upgrades.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price surges to surpass the $2,300 milestone, speculation intensifies about the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to reach the next significant threshold of $3,000. The recent upward trajectory reflects the market\u2019s confidence in Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology and its role in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Experiences a Massive Surge in Gas Fees: Here\u2019s Why - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum median gas price has surged to 55.3 Gwei this month, almost doubling in a month and reaching its highest point since mid-May this year.\n\nEthereum is trading at 2,230, up 10% over the last week and 81.3% over the last year, remaining the second most popular crypto after Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Increase\n\nAs revealed by an analysis on Dune, Ethereum gas fees have surged over the last month. In October 2023, Ethereum experienced a notable reduction in gas fees, reaching a new low. The decline was attributed to decreased activity in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various Telegram bots.\n\nMajor gas spenders, including industry giants like Binance and Coinbase and Layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, reduced their spending by 30% in mid-October.\n\nHowever, on December 1, the introduction of the Buterin Cards NFT collection triggered a 13% increase in gas fees on the Ethereum network. Transactions associated with this collection accumulated fees totaling 318.31 ETH in the past 24 hours, equivalent to $665,670.\n\nNotably, within three hours, transactions linked to the Buterin Cards NFT project contributed to over 13% of the total Ethereum network gas fees, surpassing fees from the Uniswap universal router address and Tether\u2019s public address, according to data from Etherscan.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Have Been Fluctuating\n\nA substantial decrease in Ethereum gas fees occurred following the network\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism implemented through Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIt shifted away from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model, introducing staking and resulting in a noteworthy 99.9% reduction in energy consumption.\n\nEthereum\u2019s gas fees have consistently mirrored the demand on the network throughout its history. Notably, during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom in 2017 and the decentralized finance (DeFi) explosion in 2020, Ethereum experienced unprecedented congestion. The heightened demand during these periods resulted in a significant surge in gas fees, forcing users to pay sometimes exorbitant amounts to guarantee fast processing of their transactions."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair from Binance offers a glimpse into Ethereum's current market position \u2013 a position that, while seemingly bearish, may hold the seeds for a future rally against the digital gold that is about to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chart presents a downtrend with Ethereum losing ground to Bitcoin, reflected by the downward slope of the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (black line) moving averages. This suggests that, in the short to medium term, Ethereum has been underperforming compared to the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThis underperformance can be linked to a subdued period for key Ethereum market drivers, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With these sectors facing a downturn, Ethereum's price has not had the catalysts that could propel it forward, especially in comparison to Bitcoin, which often acts as a \"safe haven\" within the crypto market during times of uncertainty.\n\nHowever, the development activity within Ethereum's ecosystem tells a different story. Despite the lack of immediate market drivers, the consistent work being done on the platform could be laying the groundwork for a strong rebound.\n\nFor traders, the ETH/BTC chart is a vital tool for tracking market sentiment and volatility. A declining ETH/BTC ratio could indicate a period of risk-off sentiment where investors flock to Bitcoin's relative safety. Conversely, a rising ratio might signal a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to bet on Ethereum's growth prospects, which might also hint at the potential surge of altcoins in general.\n\nGiven the current chart trends, investors and traders may look for signs of stabilization or reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio as indicators of Ethereum's resurgence. Such a turnaround could be precipitated by a revival in the DeFi and NFT markets or by new developments and upgrades within the network."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) has more room to run even after recording triple-digit gains so far this year.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 230,500 followers on the social media platform X that the Ethereum (ETH) rival could go up by double digits in the coming days.\n\nWhen paired against Bitcoin, Bluntz says that Solana has formed a bullish setup. The strategist, who applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, says that the Solana/Bitcoin pair (SOL/BTC) has completed a bearish five-subwave pattern and is on the cusp of a move that could result in a gain of over 41%.\n\nAccording to the Elliott Wave theory, subwaves can be used to identify potential turning points in the market. A three-wave pattern is labeled as A, B and C while a five-wave pattern is labeled as 1,2,3,4 and 5.\n\n\u201cI think Solana is about to rip again.\n\nMost important chart I\u2019ve been tracking is SOL/BTC and looks like a nice clean A-B-C done with five subwaves within the C. SOL/USD pair is about to rip another 40% or so again in the coming days in my opinion.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading at $63.59, a 536% gain from its price of $9.99 recorded at the start of the year, while SOL/BTC is trading for $0.00142.\n\nTurning to Bitcoin (BTC), Bluntz says that the flagship crypto asset looks bullish and could reach a price of around $90,000 once a five-wave pattern is completed.\n\n\u201cBTC [is] well and truly going parabolic now. Has all the characteristics of a wave-3 underway.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the trader notes that the top crypto asset by market cap appears narrative proof on the macroeconomic scale.\n\n\u201cBest part about BTC is it has a bullish narrative for literally whatever happens macro-wise. Rate cuts in \u201824? No worries, BTC pumps because it\u2019s a risk-on asset. More rate rises in \u201824? No worries, BTC pumps because [it\u2019s] deflationary, ultra sound money, flight to quality, digital gold, blah blah blah.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,930 at time of writing, a fractional gain during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Amid the price action, Solana NFTs are also seeing substantially more trading volume\u2014even higher than on Ethereum.\n\nSOL popped as high as $73.85 early Friday, marking a new 19-month peak for Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency. While still far from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021, SOL has seen a dramatic rebound from falling to almost $8 in late 2022.

        "content": "2023 proved to be a rollercoaster ride for XRP (XRP), one of the biggest crypto altcoins.\n\nThis gripping journey was significantly influenced by a series of both positive and negative market-altering events, primarily revolving around the protracted legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAmidst regulatory uncertainties and legal challenges, XRP defied the odds to showcase an impressive surge in its price throughout the year. Surpassing the performance of Ethereum (ETH), XRP\u2019s remarkable ascent underscored the enduring allure of this popular altcoin among investors.\n\nXRP may be on the verge of \u2018new, long-term uptrend\u2019\n\nIn a December 6 analysis post, a popular X account that conducts crypto technical analysis (TA), Cryptoes, revealed something that not many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have noticed.\n\nIndeed, Cryptoes said that XRP has been outperforming Ethereum in 2023. As shown in his TradingView chart, the crypto token gained more than 116% this year, or $0.33, compared to the 91.9% surge seen in ETH.\n\nXRP vs ETH \u2013 2023 performance.

Cryptoes confirmed the user\u2019s assessment.\n\nThis formation consists of a rounded bottom (the \u201ccup\u201d) followed by a consolidation period and a smaller upward move (the \u201chandle\u201d). Technical analysts usually view this pattern as bullish, signaling a potential trend reversal and indicating that an asset\u2019s price may experience a significant upward breakout after the handle formation.\n\nAt the time of writing on December 7, XRP\u2019s price was changing hands at $0.64, down 0.4% on the day. The cryptocurrency gained more than 4.7% over the past week, but its monthly performance sits at -10.8%.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe airdrops keep coming.\n\nThe team behind Starknet, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling network, plans to allocate over 1.8 billion STRK tokens to community members and stakeholders, according to an announcement made Friday by the Starknet Foundation.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation did not give a timeline for the airdrops, stating only that the first phase of the giveaway will begin \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome 900 million STRK tokens have been allocated to \u201creward past and future contributions by users and community members.\u201d What exact criteria will dictate which Starknet users will receive those tokens, and how many, has not yet been announced.\n\nNow that the news is out, we might as well tell you more! Starknet is about each of you. Every user, builder and member of our community \u2013 existing and future \u2013 is a critical piece to building our network into the future of decentralisation for generations to come. The success\u2026 \u2014 Starknet Foundation (@StarknetFndn) December 8, 2023\n\nA further 900 million STRK will go towards user rebates, the Starknet Foundation said. Planning for that initiative is still underway, but it appears it will recoup the cost of some amount of network transaction fees for Starknet users.\n\nBeyond those 1.8 billion tokens, the blockchain\u2019s overseers also intend to distribute an additional 50 million STRK tokens to incentivize decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Starknet. These tokens will be directly, indirectly, and retroactively distributed to Starknet DeFi users, according to the Starknet Foundation.\n\nStarknet community members were quick to celebrate the announcement, hailing it as a major boon for the blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$Stark is about the community, 1.8B tokens for the community, 50M token for Defi chads.. multipliers incoming..! \u2014 BMS (@bloomstarbms) December 8, 2023\n\nAnd they have good reason to be in high spirits: similar airdrops made by other blockchain projects have flooded crypto users with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free tokens in recent weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, a similar airdrop by Solana-based DeFi platform Jito put $225 million worth of freshly minted JTO tokens in the hands of users and community members. Late last month, an airdrop for DeFi oracles network Pyth gave away $77 million worth of PYTH tokens.\n\nAirdrops have become an increasingly popular way for crypto projects\u2014and recently, DeFi projects in particular\u2014to attract a larger user base and encourage loyalty among existing community members.\n\nStarknet, which uses zero-knowledge rollups to make on-chain Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper, has already seen tremendous growth this year. This spring, the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) increased ten-fold, from $1.45 million to over $10 million. Since then Starknet\u2019s TVL has tripled again, to $33.84 million at writing, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Fri 08 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin has long played the role of the undisputed leader, paving the way for its crypto brethren. But, as in any good epic tale, a challenger arises: Ethereum. As we approach the end of 2023, we might be witnessing the dawn of a new era, where the altcoin is no longer content to follow but aims to compete. Is it the season of altcoins? In this financial ballet, Ethereum sketches a daring dance to catch up with the Bitcoin giant. Let\u2019s analyze this captivating plot together.\n\nCrypto ETH: The Phoenix of Altcoins?\n\nYesterday, a remarkable event occurred: Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency reached a new annual high of $2,312, demonstrating resilience worthy of a phoenix.\n\nWith a 10.28% progression in one week, Ether is no longer the timid younger sibling following in its elder\u2019s footsteps. Against a still-dominating Bitcoin, this crypto seems to whisper a promise: \u201cNothing is played out yet.\u201d This meteoric rise, although impressive, asks a burning question: how high can Ether go in this frenzied race?\n\nETH, like a maestro, has masterfully directed its dance around a graphical triangle, signaling a bullish target of $2,780. This geometric figure is not just a crypto trader\u2019s whim; it is a strategy, a meticulously planned plot.\n\nThe Ichimoku indicators, with their colorful curves, seem to play a harmonious melody, supporting this ascent. But beware, every story has its twists. If ETH falls below its protective cloud, this dream of $2,780 may vanish, reminding us that falls are always possible.\n\nETH: The New Hero?\n\nSo, are we witnessing the emergence of a new hero in this crypto saga? Ethereum, with its current configuration, seems to have all the trumps to hit its target. But in this world where caution is queen, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is as unpredictable as a stormy ocean.\n\nThe question remains: Can Ethereum, strengthened by its ascent, truly reach $2,780 before the end of the year, and in this odyssey, can it redefine the rules of the game established by Bitcoin?\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s rise is more than just a market fluctuation; it is a true digital odyssey, redefining the dynamics of power in the world of cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, Ether, with its recent performance, prompts deep reflection on the future of altcoins. Is it a mere resurgence, or are we witnessing the dawn of an era where altcoins, led by Ethereum, play a leading role? The future, albeit encrypted, looks thrilling. In a world where surprise is the only constant, one thing is certain: the crypto realm will continue to mesmerize, astonish, and perhaps, overturn established titans.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

According to the analysis firm, the whale received 47,260 ETH, worth $11.34 million, from June to August 2017. The whale\u2019s average cost per coin was around $240. Since 2017, ETH\u2019s price has gone up by around 838%.\n\nLookonChain notes that the whale wallet transferred 39,260 ETH, worth $87.5 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken on Dec. 5, 2023. If the whale sells its holdings, it would make a profit of around $78 million.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum NFT Market Booms: Transaction Volume Hits $34 Million\n\nAn early $ETH whale appears to be selling ETH again after being dormant for 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe whale deposited all 39,260 $ETH($87.5M) to #Kraken 30 mins ago.\n\n\n\nThe whale received 47,260 $ETH($11.34M) at ~$240 from June to August 2017.\n\n\n\nIf sold the whale would make a profit of ~$78M. pic.twitter.com/v0PI4LNTKO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023\n\nWill the Ethereum whale sell?\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nThe movement of assets to exchanges is bearish, given that it increases the chances of being sold. The whale may sell its Ethereum (ETH) holdings while booking profits. The wallet in question has made a profit of $78 million already.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin Wants to Redesign the Network\n\nWhen Ethereum (ETH) reached its all-time high of $4878.26 in November 2021, the whale\u2019s holdings were worth around $230 million. Analysts anticipate a bull market for the cryptocurrency sector in 2024. ETH and other assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), may hit new all-time highs next year. Hence, the whale\u2019s holdings could surge in value over the next few months. Therefore, the wallet might not sell its holdings just yet.\n\nSome analysts expect ETH to hit a price of $10,000 in the next bull run. In such a scenario, the whale\u2019s holdings could be worth around $472.6 million. It is unlikely that the investor, or group of investors, would want to miss out on an opportunity to make almost half a billion dollars.\n\nIt is also possible that the wallet is simply reorganizing its holdings and is temporarily keeping its Ethereum (ETH) in an exchange. The ETH may find its way back into a hard wallet soon."

This audit demonstrates the network\u2019s commitment to security and data integrity.\n\nYou might also like: Cardano may rally; FTX Token and Borroe Finance register gains\n\nBorroeFinance\u2019s innovation lies in its ability to provide immediate funding to web3 players using their recurring incomes, royalties, and subscriptions as collateral.

This has slowed the rate of ETH issuance. Alongside increasing ETH burnt via EIP1559 due to growing network activity, the ETH supply has become deflationary again.\u201d\n\nEthereum began burning part of ETH from gas fees after the London hard fork in 2021.

        "content": "Ethereum experienced a modest dip during the early hours of Thursday, a development that, quite frankly, was long overdue.\n\nEthereum, in tandem with Bitcoin and numerous other cryptocurrencies, has undergone a remarkable surge in recent times.\n\nHowever, in the interest of fostering a healthy market, a revival of value is essential. The initial upward trajectory in the market has transitioned into a phase of consolidation or a mild pullback.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nShould consolidation be the path ahead, it is probable that we'll witness a period of sideways movement lasting several days. This period offers an opportune window for investors to identify favorable entry points. When a market experiences an abrupt ascent, it is prudent to exercise caution and avoid chasing trades. Alternatively, one might consider the potential for a substantial pullback, an occurrence that could provide substantial value. The $2100 level emerges as a point of interest in this context, as it carries a certain \"market memory\" due to its previous role as a significant resistance level. Consequently, one can reasonably anticipate robust support if Ethereum approaches this threshold.\n\nThe Bottom?\n\nBeneath this pivotal level lies the $1925 zone, which I regard as the termination point of the current trend. This level coincides with the presence of the 50-Day EMA and signifies a former area of substantial support. Only when Ethereum breaches this juncture would legitimate concerns regarding its market trajectory come into play. However, it is imperative to keep a vigilant eye on Bitcoin's performance before making any investment decisions, as Ethereum traditionally mirrors Bitcoin's movements. Despite the prevailing speculation suggesting Ethereum may need to catch up to Bitcoin, implying the potential for a more pronounced upward movement when the cryptocurrency market rallies again, I maintain a decidedly bullish outlook for Ethereum.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum's recent correction is not a sign of inherent weakness but rather a necessary step to establish a more sustainable foundation for future growth. The market's ability to attract fresh capital and maintain healthy price levels hinges on this process of consolidation or mild retracement. As cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and ever evolving, it is crucial for investors to navigate with prudence, strategically assessing entry points and heeding the broader context of the digital asset landscape. While volatility persists, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain promising, with the $2100 and $1925 levels serving as key waypoints to monitor in the journey forward.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Ethereum NFT assets are unique digital assets that are created, bought, sold, and owned on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are a type of cryptographic token that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item, whether it be a piece of artwork, music, video, collectible, virtual real estate, or any other digital or physical\n\nEthereum NFT assets are unique digital assets that are created, bought, sold, and owned on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are a type of cryptographic token that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item, whether it be a piece of artwork, music, video, collectible, virtual real estate, or any other digital or physical object. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum itself, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and unique, each with its own distinct characteristics and value.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest blockchain platform after Bitcoin, has gained significant popularity and adoption for hosting NFTs due to its ability to support complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). NFTs on Ethereum are based on the ERC-721 token standard, although other standards like ERC-1155 are also used for creating NFTs.\n\nOne of the key features of Ethereum NFTs is their immutability and traceability. Each NFT has a unique identifier and a record of its ownership history stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that the ownership and authenticity of an NFT can be easily verified, and no one can counterfeit or duplicate it. The decentralized nature of the blockchain also eliminates the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities to oversee transactions, making it more transparent and secure.\n\nI am very bullish on Web3 gaming. The fact that we can own our game assets (NFT) is huge. Vitalik was inspired to create Ethereum for the similar reasons. When you own your game, you are the part of it, and that is what all players dream. But it\u2019s just the start \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Singer (@Singer953) February 5, 2023\n\nCreating and owning Ethereum NFT assets usually involves utilizing decentralized applications, often referred to as NFT marketplaces. These platforms allow creators to mint or create NFTs by uploading their digital assets, specifying their desired properties, and generating a unique token. Once minted, these NFTs can be bought, sold, or traded on various marketplaces using Ethereum or other compatible cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe value of Ethereum NFT assets is largely determined by factors such as rarity, demand, uniqueness, and the reputation of the creator. Collectors and enthusiasts are often willing to pay significant amounts of money for rare or highly sought-after NFTs. The ownership of an NFT is typically represented by a digital wallet address, and the transfer of ownership is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain through a series of transactions.\n\nEthereum NFTs have gained significant attention and media coverage due to high-profile sales and unique use cases. Artists, musicians, and celebrities have embraced NFTs as a means to monetize their digital creations directly, without relying on traditional intermediaries. NFTs have also been used for virtual real estate, in-game items, digital fashion, and even tokenizing physical assets such as real estate or artwork.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability limitations have led to high transaction fees and congestion during periods of high activity, which can pose challenges for widespread adoption and usage of NFTs. Efforts are being made to address these issues through network upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum NFT assets are unique digital tokens representing ownership or authenticity of specific digital or physical items. They are created, bought, sold, and owned on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum NFTs have gained popularity for their ability to provide verifiable ownership and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, revolutionizing the way digital assets are valued, bought, and sold.\n\nAlso read: Your Ultimate Guide To Ethereum Assets\n\nUse Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets\n\nEthereum NFT (Non-Fungible Token) assets have a wide range of use cases across various industries and domains.

Here are some of the key advantages of Ethereum NFT assets:\n\n1. Ownership and Authenticity: NFTs provide a robust and verifiable system for proving ownership and authenticity of digital or physical assets. Each NFT has a unique identifier and a record of its ownership history stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that the ownership and provenance of an asset can be easily traced and verified, mitigating the risk of fraud or counterfeit.\n\n2. Scarcity and Exclusivity: NFTs enable the creation of unique digital assets or limited editions, ensuring scarcity and exclusivity. This scarcity drives the value of NFTs, as collectors and enthusiasts seek rare and unique items. NFTs allow creators to assign specific attributes or properties to each asset, making them one-of-a-kind or part of a limited set.\n\n3. Direct Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Ethereum NFTs facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Traditional markets for art, collectibles, and other assets often involve complex intermediaries, such as galleries, auction houses, or licensing agencies. NFTs enable creators to sell their assets directly to buyers, streamlining the transaction process and reducing associated fees.\n\n4. Monetization and Revenue Streams: NFTs provide new avenues for creators and artists to monetize their digital creations. By tokenizing their work as NFTs, creators can sell their assets directly to buyers, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. This allows artists to retain more control over their work and generate revenue from the primary and secondary sales of their NFTs.\n\n5. Programmability and Smart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality enables programmability and automation of various functions associated with NFTs. Smart contracts can be used to set royalty fees, ensuring that artists receive a percentage of the proceeds whenever their NFTs are resold. Additionally, smart contracts can include additional functionalities like unlocking additional content or features based on certain conditions or events.\n\n6. Interoperability and Standards: Ethereum NFTs adhere to standardized token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155, ensuring interoperability across different applications, platforms, and wallets. This means that NFTs created on one platform can be easily transferred, traded, or integrated with other platforms and services, enhancing liquidity and utility.\n\n7. Transparency and Auditability: NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized and transparent ledger. The ownership history, transaction details, and metadata associated with each NFT are publicly accessible and cannot be altered. This provides transparency and auditability, instilling trust in the authenticity and ownership of NFT assets.\n\n8. Fractional Ownership and Liquidity: NFTs can be fractionalized, allowing multiple investors to own a fraction of an asset. This enables broader access to high-value assets that were previously out of reach for individual investors. Fractional ownership also enhances liquidity, as these fractions can be traded on secondary markets, enabling investors to buy and sell smaller portions of an asset.\n\n9. Global Reach and Accessibility: Ethereum NFT assets are not limited by geographical boundaries. Anyone with an internet connection and an Ethereum wallet can participate in buying, selling, or trading NFTs. This global reach opens up new markets and opportunities for creators, collectors, and investors worldwide.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while Ethereum NFT assets offer many advantages, there are also challenges and considerations to be aware of, such as scalability issues, high transaction fees during peak demand, and environmental concerns related to energy consumption. As the technology continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial for the sustainable growth and long-term viability of Ethereum NFTs.\n\nAlso read:How Has Ethereum Network Improved The Adoption Of Crypto Projects\n\nFuture of Ethereum NFT Assets\n\nThe future of Ethereum NFT assets holds significant potential for further innovation, growth, and adoption. Here are some key aspects that shape the future of Ethereum NFT assets:\n\n1. Enhanced Scalability: Ethereum has been facing scalability challenges, resulting in high transaction fees and network congestion during periods of high activity. To address this, Ethereum is undergoing a major upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade aims to improve scalability through the implementation of a more efficient consensus mechanism (Proof of Stake) and the introduction of shard chains. By increasing the network\u2019s capacity, Ethereum 2.0 will support a larger volume of NFT transactions and foster wider adoption.\n\n2. Improved User Experience: User experience is a critical aspect for the mass adoption of NFTs. Efforts are being made to simplify the process of minting, buying, and selling NFTs, making it more accessible to users with minimal technical knowledge. User-friendly interfaces, better wallet integration, and streamlined transaction processes will contribute to a more seamless and intuitive experience for creators, collectors, and investors.\n\n3. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Interoperability between different blockchain networks is becoming increasingly important for NFTs. Projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and others are working on cross-chain solutions that enable NFTs to move seamlessly between different blockchains. This interoperability will expand the reach of NFT assets, connect various ecosystems, and increase liquidity by allowing assets to be traded on multiple platforms.\n\n4. Integration with Physical Assets: The convergence of NFTs with physical assets holds great potential. By tokenizing physical assets, such as real estate, luxury goods, or artwork, NFTs can enable fractional ownership, liquidity, and easier transfer of value. NFTs can serve as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, facilitating trust, provenance, and verification of ownership for real-world assets.\n\n5. Enhanced Utility and Functionality: NFTs are not limited to representing ownership of art or collectibles. In the future, NFTs can have programmable features and additional utility. For example, NFTs can unlock access to exclusive content, grant special privileges in games or virtual worlds, or serve as digital identity representations. The integration of smart contracts and additional functionalities will expand the use cases and value proposition of NFT assets.\n\n6. Tokenization of Intellectual Property: NFTs have the potential to revolutionize intellectual property rights and ownership. Creators can tokenize their intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights, and sell or license them as NFTs. This can create new revenue streams for creators and simplify the management and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\n7. Environmental Sustainability: As the popularity of NFTs grows, concerns regarding the environmental impact of the energy consumption associated with blockchain networks, particularly Ethereum, have emerged. The Ethereum community is actively working on addressing these concerns by transitioning to more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and exploring layer-two scaling solutions. These efforts aim to make Ethereum and NFTs more environmentally sustainable in the long run.\n\n8. Regulatory Landscape: As NFTs continue to gain prominence, regulatory frameworks will likely evolve to address legal and compliance aspects. Governments and regulatory bodies may introduce guidelines or regulations to ensure investor protection, prevent fraud, and address issues related to copyright infringement or money laundering. The establishment of clear and favorable regulations can provide a stable and predictable environment for the growth of NFT assets.\n\nIn summary, the future of Ethereum NFT assets looks promising with advancements in scalability, user experience, interoperability, integration with physical assets, utility enhancements, intellectual property tokenization, sustainability efforts, regulatory frameworks, and the continuous innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. As these developments unfold, Ethereum NFTs are expected to become more accessible, valuable, and integral to various industries, unlocking new possibilities for creators, collectors, and investors worldwide."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price squashed the bearish pressure with a strong rebound and is now heading towards the pivotal resistance\n\nThe token displays extreme strength, which forecasts a positive outlook in the long term, aiming to form a new ATH at the earliest\n\nThe crypto markets appear to have flipped over their bearish claws as the bulls have gained immense strength. The majority of cryptos have been maintaining a steep upswing since the start of the month, which indicates the markets are progressing towards a strong bull run. As the Bitcoin price sustains above $43,000, the Ethereum price is also on the verge of marking new yearly highs close to $2400.\n\nEthereum has been considered one of the most reliable cryptos on the market and is known for its slow and steady pace. The rising momentum of the markets and specifically the ETH price may have compelled retail traders to accumulate more. Moreover, they are reportedly holding the tokens away from the exchanges as the exchange volume is constantly depleting.\n\nAs per the data from Santiment, the non-exchange addresses held have now marked new highs.\n\nThe rise in the volume of non-exchange addresses, which has hit an ATH of 54.6 million compared to the 150 biggest exchange addresses, marking a 5-year low at 9.3 million, suggests the whales are probably losing sell-off power. As retail traders are getting stronger with this move, a fine rise in the price is expected in the coming days.

This suggests that traders opted to secure profits after the largest crypto's breakout from $38,000 a week ago, said CoinDCX Research Team.On the flip side, ETH witnessed a 5% upswing over the same period, reaching $2,372, marking its highest level since May 2022. This upward movement also positively influenced the prices of other ETH-related cryptocurrencies, positioning them as the top performers of the day. Ethereum's upsurge is credited to heightened institutional interest and the hopeful anticipation of an ETF approval by the SEC, CoinDCX added.\"From a technical standpoint, BTC is currently situated at the $44,000 resistance level. The overall momentum remains positive, with no clear signals of a reversal or bearish trend. Minor pullbacks and corrections are considered healthy for the current scenario,\" CoinDCX said.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"The current phase of sideways correction is good for building steam for the next leg-up. If this trend continues, analysts predict the next stop for BTC will be $46,000.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $8 billion, 10.77% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $65.78 billion, which is 88.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency , fell to $848 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.65%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.91% to $28.25 billion."

        "content": "Fri 08 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nHas Ethereum become more centralized? The crypto community is sounding the alarm. Indeed, censorship is starting to gain ground on this very popular blockchain. Currently, 4 out of 5 of the largest \u201cblock builders\u201d on the network are filtering transactions sanctioned by the U.S. government. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nAn Increasingly Centralized Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin was recently subjected to a public lynching while presenting the new Ethereum roadmap. Why attack such a Web3 icon in this way? In fact, he talked about a possible use of the UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) approach to revise ETH staking. The blockchain he co-founded is so lacking in decentralization that it will have to borrow more innovative and decentralized concepts from other projects.\n\nMore than 72% of Ethereum\u2019s block builders are \"censoring\" transactions sanctioned by U.S. govt OFAC, data shows, underscoring how \u201ccredibly neutral\u201d blockchains have become more centralized as a result of MEV @skesslr reports $ETHhttps://t.co/BIPGuze7LX \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) December 7, 2023\n\nIn a detailed report focused on \u201cEthereum\u2019s \u2018censorship\u2019 problem,\u201d CoinDesk highlighted the disappointment of some researchers and users of the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain. The reason: censorship is starting to make its mark on this network.\n\nAccording to the results of a study conducted by Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, 72% of the blocks of data displayed on MEV-Boost are currently being censored. As a reminder, MEV-Boost is the intermediary software powering the validators writing blocks on the Ethereum network.\n\n72%, that\u2019s really alarming considering that Ethereum block builders only filtered 25% of transactions in November 2022.\n\nAmong the 5 largest block builders of Ethereum, only \u201cTitan Builder\u201d disapproves of this practice. Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, founder of Gnosis Chain, sounded the alarm by stating:\n\n\u201cIf Titan started to censor tomorrow, Ethereum would be censored by more than 90%. So we\u2019re only one constructor away from strong censorship on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nOFAC in Action\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) appears to be behind all this commotion. Indeed, by targeting Tornado Cash, with a lawsuit to boot, this branch of the U.S. Treasury Department has, in a way, put pressure on Ethereum block builders. It\u2019s important to note this very important fact: Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based \u201cprivate mixing\u201d program that allows traceless transactions.\n\nAfter OFAC decided to close down the tunnel through which stolen cryptos by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, as well as funds fueling terrorist organizations like Hamas or countries sanctioned by the United States such as Iran and Russia, transits. By adding the computer code of Ethereum-based Tornado to its blacklist, the U.S. regulator would have achieved its intended goals.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "In the end, Ethereum's market is at a crossroads, influenced by its recent breakout, correlation with Bitcoin, bond market dynamics, and the broader economic environment.\n\nDuring Wednesday's trading session, Ethereum exhibited fluctuating behavior, signaling a period of consolidation as the market heads into the latter half of the week.\n\nThis pattern comes after a notable breakout, suggesting that the market might be adjusting after recent gains.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum's movements are often influenced by Bitcoin, which is currently exhibiting a similar market stretch.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nA critical focus for Ethereum traders is the $2100 level, which previously acted as a resistance barrier and now may serve as a potential support level. The concept of \"market memory\" is particularly relevant here, as past resistance levels often transform into support in future market movements. While the general sentiment leans towards buying, finding value in the market is crucial for making informed investment decisions.\n\nThe anticipation is that Ethereum might eventually target the $2500 level. However, this progression requires careful market observation, particularly regarding the bond market. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have shown a heightened sensitivity to changes in interest rates, making the 10-year yield a significant factor to consider. Crypto investments require an influx of speculative capital, often referred to as \"hot money,\" to drive prices upward. This characteristic makes cryptocurrencies an investment on the extreme end of the financial spectrum \u2013 offering high potential returns but equally significant risks.\n\nFOMO and the Death of Crypto Traders\n\nInvestors and traders in the crypto market need to approach with caution, particularly in terms of position sizing. The allure of quick gains can often lead to impulsive decisions, characterized by \"Fear of Missing Out\" (FOMO) trades, which have been the downfall of many in the crypto space. Patience and identifying value are key strategies in navigating this volatile and unpredictable market.\n\nCurrently, the perceived \"floor\" of the market for Ethereum is around the $1925 level, which is the base of the previous consolidation area and coincides with the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average. This level might act as a critical juncture for determining Ethereum's future movements.\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's market is at a crossroads, influenced by its recent breakout, correlation with Bitcoin, bond market dynamics, and the broader economic environment. Investors are advised to stay vigilant, focusing on value and patience rather than succumbing to impulsive trading strategies. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in ascertaining Ethereum's trajectory in the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is making very strong moves hitting levels not seen in the last 18 months. As of press time, ETH is trading 5.61% up at a price of $2,375 with a market cap of $285 billion. Amid the recent price breakout, some investors have already been sharing ETH price targets of $3,500.\n\nTraders in the cryptocurrency market are currently grappling with apprehensions of a potential bull trap. Although Bitcoin has momentarily halted its momentum, the spotlight shifts to Ethereum and various altcoins, which are experiencing significant upward surges once again.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Non-Exchange Wallets Accumulate\n\nOn-chain data shows a contrasting behavior between non-exchange and exchange wallets. The top 150 non-exchange wallet addresses are holding an all-time stash of Ethereum at 54.6 million ETH. On the other hand, the exchange wallet holdings have dropped to a 5-year low at 9.3 million ETH.\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reports that Ethereum has climbed to $2,349, marking its highest level since June 2022. The encouraging combination of the long-term trend showing an increase in wealth for the top non-exchange whale wallets and reduced sell-off power for the top exchange whale wallets suggests a promising scenario for a sustained ascent.\n\nAll Eyes on Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nDuring the recent ACDE meeting, developers highlighted that Ethereum is on track to execute the Dencun fork of the Goerli testnet in January 2024, pending smooth progress. The majority of teams are prepared to conduct the testnet fork test, and plans are in place for a more extensive Goerli shadow network fork in the coming weeks.\n\nACDE#176 happened earlier today: we discussed the state of Dencun, timelines for testnets, and how to approach planning the following network upgrade \u26d3\ufe0f Agenda: https://t.co/ATVLQ7f9Xp\n\nStream: https://t.co/tDM0tDKxC5 Recap below \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/PhGBkYxhYN \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023\n\nDencun is set to significantly boost data availability for layer-2 rollups through proto-danksharding. This enhancement is likely to lead to a decrease in transaction costs for rollups, ultimately benefiting end users. The overall impact of Dencun includes the improvement of Ethereum\u2019s scalability through rollups, optimization of gas fees, enhancement of network security, and implementation of various housekeeping updates.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is recommending users who depend on Goerli for stable testnet environments to initiate the migration process in advance. While Goerli staking is permissionless, the exit of validators associated with client and testing teams, holding a substantial majority stake, introduces potential stability concerns. Simultaneously, teams are preparing to utilize this transition period to test aspects such as delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass-slashings."

Behavior analytics tool Santiment observes that Ether and altcoins are on a tear even as BTC momentum fades.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support\n\nEthereum and altcoins blast off\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is up almost 5%, with the daily price updates flashing green alongside its peers in the altcoin category against Bitcoin (BTC) price, which is showing red.\n\nBTC versus ETH and altcoins\n\nAccording to Santiment, the capital is flowing away from Bitcoin and into Ethereum and altcoins amid fears that \u201cthe market may be in a bull trap at the moment.\u201d\n\nFor the layperson, a bull trap in crypto trading refers to a false signal indicating a market in a temporary uptrend is going to continue upward. However, the trend quickly reverses, leading to a decline. Oftentimes, this decline leads to lower prices compared to when the bull trap commenced.\n\nNevertheless, the on-chain behavior analytics tool acknowledges that if the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) continues, it could in fact be the driving force for Bitcoin price hitting the desirable $50,000 psychological level.\n\nIt is the same FUD, however, that has the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren saying, \u201cthere is a new threat out there, it is crypto and we cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\n\"There's a new threat out there, it's crypto. We can't allow that to continue.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth Warren was given her marching orders yesterday...pic.twitter.com/WvwlZZ8zrb https://t.co/re9kdMCO2z \u2014 Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) December 7, 2023\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said, \u201cI have always been deeply opposed to crypto and Bitcoin [in particular],\" adding, \"If I were the government I would close it down.\u201d\n\nThe assertions by the two renowned personalities only serve to inspire more enthusiasm among crypto proponents.\n\nIt should be noted that in the absence of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval just yet, and the fact that the BTC halving event is months away, there is no driving force in the market as of now, save for speculation.\n\nThis speculation has metamorphosed into FOMO, the fear of missing out, as investors continue to front run the approvals. With this perspective, Bitcoin price is bullish on a big-picture perspective, with the capital overflows benefiting altcoins.\n\nTo put this in perspective, apart from BTC and Ethereum, the total market capitalization of other altcoins is likely to breach through an 19-month-long downtrend that prompted a decline in market capitalization since May 2022.\n\nTotal altcoins market capitalization, excluding Ethereum"

        "content": "December holds promising prospects for Celestia, Ethereum, and VC Spectra in the crypto space. Forecasts signify success in the coming weeks.\n\nBy Advertiser, in Crypto \u00b7 08 Dec 2023, 08:01 \u00b7 0 Comments\n\nAs the year concludes, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the rise of three major players: Celestia (TIA), Ethereum (ETH), and VC Spectra (SPCT). In the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies, these entities have garnered attention for their potential to shape the end-of-year dynamics in the crypto market.\n\nAlthough new to the market, VC Spectra (SPCT) raised $2.4 million in their seed sale. Does that make it the best crypto to invest in? Keep it here to find out more.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\n\u25cf Celestia (TIA) Set for a 6.68% increase to $11.13 since the Mainnet launch.\n\n\u25cf Ethereum (ETH) emerges as a leader in market capitalization with a projected 5.04% rise.\n\n\u25cf VC Spectra (SPCT) maintains an upward trajectory with an 862.5% increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Trading Activity in the Aftermath of Celestia (TIA) Mainnet Launch\n\nOn October 31, 2023, Celestia (TIA) was effectively launched on Mainnet Beta, with the codename Lemon Mint, signifying the introduction of the inaugural modular data availability network.\n\nThe launch of Celestia presents an exciting chance for ambitious developers to explore new frontiers. The modular stack encourages developers to innovate and build unique applications, leveraging the expansive blobspace, such as on-chain gaming.\n\nFollowing the launch, the price of Celestia (TIA), which was at $2.3158 on October 31, immediately shot to $2.5460, signifying a 9.94% increase. However, in the subsequent days, market fluctuations triggered a drop in Celestia\u2019s (TIA) price, albeit slightly to $2.3408 by November 7, 2023.\n\nBy December 1, the price had significantly risen to $7.0976, marking a 67.02% increase since the Celestia Mainnet launch. Celestia\u2019s (TIA) price was $9.45 on December 6, reflecting a 47.43% increase since November 30, when the price was $6.41. Analysts forecast a further 7% surge in the next week, projecting a value of $11.13 from the closing price of Celestia (TIA) $10.43 on December 5. This makes Celestia (TIA) a top crypto to buy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's Next for Ethereum? A Look at the Projected 5.04% Price Surge\n\nEthereum (ETH) mirrors the prevailing bullish trend in the cryptocurrency industry, demonstrated by a significant surge of 12% within the past week. During this period, the price of Ethereum (ETH) increased from $2052.56 on November 30 to $2293.84 on December 5.\n\nNotably, cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez has contended that any Ethereum price prediction surpassing the $2,000 mark could represent an opportune \"prime buying moment\" for this digital asset. This assertion is based on reports from Finbold on December 4, revealing that traders significantly acquired Ethereum (ETH) at this particular price level.\n\nSo, what is the current Ethereum price prediction?\n\nAs of December 6, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,289.41, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 7 days when the price was $2,060.49 on November 30. The Ethereum price prediction suggests a further 5.2% uptick in the next week, from its current price of $ $2,289.41projecting a value of $2,407.53 for Ethereum (ETH).\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 5 Triumph: VC Spectra (SPCT) Exhibits 862.5% Surge Attracting More Investors\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) operates as a decentralized hedge fund, offering a unique model that rewards users with quarterly dividends and buybacks. VC Spectra (SPCT) provides users exclusive opportunities, including access to fresh Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in seed and private sales and voting rights. These benefits make it the ideal crypto for beginners.\n\nAt the core of this ecosystem is the SPCT, a BRC-20 standard token that facilitates decentralized trading and asset management. Further, it covers transaction fees on the VC Spectra (SPCT) platform. Notably, the SPCT token operates on the Bitcoin blockchain and employs a deflationary approach, incorporating a burn mechanism to gradually reduce token circulation. VC Spectra (SPCT) began with a successful seed/private sale, amassing $2.4 million, followed by a public presale.\n\nCurrently, in Stage 5, VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) price is $0.077 and boasts a remarkable 862.5% increase since Stage 1 of its public presale. This success underscores the growing prominence of decentralized hedge funds and the traction gained by VC Spectra (SPCT) in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra"

As the market unveils new opportunities, discover a rising star \u2013 VC Spectra (SPCT). This innovative entrant, revolutionizing the crypto investment landscape, promises unique benefits. Join the journey as we explore what sets VC Spectra apart in this ever-evolving digital frontier.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s recent surge, caution is advised as a significant dormant holder transferred $90 million to Kraken, raising concerns about potential negative impacts on ETH price predictions and signaling bearish trends.\n\nBNB\u2019s market sentiment is lackluster, with a 4% price drop to $231 on December 5. Investor hesitancy persists, reflecting uncertainties around initiatives and contributing to a bearish BNB price prediction of $209 by the end of 2023.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) impresses with a $2.4 million seed sale, an 862.5% surge in its public presale to $0.077, and a unique decentralized hedge fund model on the Bitcoin blockchain. A top altcoin for 2023, offering dividends and exclusive ICO access.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Caution as Dormant Holder Triggers Concerns\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) recent 8% surge within a week, reaching $2,235 on December 5, there are emerging bearish signals for Ethereum that warrant caution among investors.\n\nNotably, a significant Ethereum (ETH) holder, dormant for five years, recently transferred nearly $90 million worth of the cryptocurrency to Kraken, a move often associated with intentions to sell for stablecoins or other assets.\n\nThis sizable movement could exert selling pressure on the market, potentially impacting the ETH price prediction negatively. Additionally, the historical context of this wallet\u2019s transactions, seemingly unrelated to exchange cold storage, raises concerns about the motivation behind the transfer.\n\nConsidering the market dynamics and the potential ripple effect of such a substantial move, investors may need to closely monitor developments to assess the broader impact on the Ethereum price prediction.\n\nWhile short-term gains have been promising, these recent movements underscore the need for vigilance in the face of potential bearish trends for the ETH price prediction. Analysts are bearish on Ethereum, their ETH price prediction suggests that ETH could reach $2,061 by the end of 2023.\n\nBNB Struggles Despite Binance Labs Developments\n\nDespite recent positive developments in Binance Labs and BNB Chain\u2019s accelerator program, the market sentiment for BNB has been lackluster. Over the past month, the BNB coin price has experienced a notable decline, dropping by 4% and reaching $231 on December 5.\n\nThis BNB coin price downward trend may indicate that despite efforts to foster innovation and incubate early-stage projects, investors and traders are not currently responding favorably to the BNB ecosystem.\n\nThe new \u2018founder track\u2018 introduced in the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program, while ambitious, has yet to translate into a positive market sentiment for BNB.\n\nFactors influencing the price drop could include broader market conditions, concerns about the competitive landscape, or uncertainties regarding the success of the incubated projects. Analysts\u2019 BNB price prediction suggests that the BNB coin price could reach $209 by the end of 2023.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): Revolutionizing Crypto Investment Landscape\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, investors seeking promising opportunities beyond Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) should turn their attention to VC Spectra (SPCT). In its private seed sale, VC Spectra (SPCT) successfully raised a staggering $2.4 million, setting the stage for its public presale.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s public presale, currently in progress, has witnessed overwhelming demand, surpassing investors\u2019 expectations. SPCT reached an altcoin price of $0.077, marking an 862.5% increase from its initial price.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s innovative approach as a decentralized hedge fund distinguishes it in the market. Investors engaging with SPCT gain quarterly dividends and buybacks, benefiting directly from the fund\u2019s profitable investments.\n\nSPCT, a BRC-20 standard token built on the Bitcoin blockchain, serves multiple functions within the VC Spectra platform. Beyond being a means of exchange and decentralized trading, it facilitates asset management and covers transaction fees. The token\u2019s deflationary nature, driven by a burn mechanism, strategically reduces circulation over time, enhancing its long-term value.\n\nFor those considering late entries into the crypto sphere, VC Spectra presents a unique opportunity. With access to exclusive new ICOs in seed/private sales, voting rights, and a robust utility-driven ecosystem, SPCT stands out as more than just a financial asset.\n\nAs the public presale progresses through its stages, investors keen on diversifying their portfolios should closely follow VC Spectra (SPCT) for potential gains and participation in one of the top altcoins in 2023.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is experiencing a significant surge in its price, sparking interest and speculation within the crypto community.\n\nThis recent price hike, with Ethereum trading above $2,300, represents a staggering 96.5% increase year to date. This article explains the reasons behind this remarkable growth, unpacking the factors contributing to the bullish momentum.\n\nInstitutional Interest and the Promise of an ETF\n\nA key driver behind Ethereum\u2019s price surge is the growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) acknowledgement of Grayscale Investment\u2019s application to convert its Ethereum trust into an ETF has played a significant role.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision, a response to a court order, has not only fueled traders\u2019 interest since November 1 but has also led to Ether\u2019s price reaching a six-month high above the $2,000 resistance.\n\nThe involvement of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, further bolsters this trend. BlackRock\u2019s filing for a spot Ether ETF on November 9 sent Ether\u2019s price skyrocketing, a clear indication of the impact of institutional engagement.\n\nWith seven spot Ether ETFs currently pending with the SEC, the anticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in early 2024, and the likelihood of an Ether ETF following suit, are significant factors contributing to ETH\u2019s current price strength.\n\nEthereum Network\u2019s Revenue Growth and DeFi Ecosystem\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is also a critical factor in this surge. The network has seen a boost in daily fees and revenue, reaching a 180-day high in both categories on December 7.\n\nThis increase in network fees and revenue, up by 178.2% in the past 30 days to $2.92 billion annualized, mirrors Ether\u2019s price growth. The rise in Ethereum\u2019s network fees has resulted in the network becoming deflationary again.\n\nThe last time Ethereum network emissions were inflationary was on November 8, showing sustained activity growth for the past 30 days. If this trend continues, Ether\u2019s coin supply is projected to contract by -0.47% a year, further driving its value.\n\nMacroeconomic Factors and Market Dynamics\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s current market position appears robust, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader economic factors that could influence its price. Future rate hikes and potential U.S. crackdowns on the crypto sector might exert downward pressure on Ether\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, factors such as the approval of a spot Bitcoin or Ether ETF, positive regulatory clarifications, and a strong U.S. economy could serve as catalysts for further price growth.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum\u2019s price surge occurs amidst a period of Bitcoin dominance in the crypto market. As Bitcoin maintains its dominance, there is often a shift in investor focus to altcoins and other cryptocurrencies. This dynamic is currently playing out, with the ETH/BTC pair showing significant strength and potential for further growth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price surge is a result of a confluence of factors, including growing institutional interest, developments in its DeFi ecosystem, and the broader economic landscape.\n\nWhile the future of Ethereum\u2019s price is subject to various macroeconomic and market-specific variables, its current trajectory highlights the growing significance and maturation of the cryptocurrency in the global financial landscape.\n\nAs the crypto community eagerly watches ETH\u2019s movements, it\u2019s clear that the cryptocurrency is not just a digital asset but a barometer of the evolving financial world."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: After A 10% Surge, Experts Predic - TronWeekly",
        "content": "In a notable development, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a substantial surge, surpassing the $2,250 resistance level. Experts are now anticipating a bullish trend for ETH, projecting a potential ascent towards the $2,500 mark.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Positive Momentum Persists\n\nMaintaining its positive trajectory akin to Bitcoin, Ethereum has sustained its upward movement above the $2,120 threshold. The cryptocurrency extended its rally, breaching key resistance levels at $2,200 and $2,250, prompting a surge in activity from bullish investors and propelling the price beyond $2,300.\n\nAlthough a new multi-month high was established at approximately $2,316, the current market scenario sees a correction in gains. The price has dipped below the $2,300 level and is currently undergoing a test of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, measured from the $2,188 swing low to the $2,316 high.\n\nNotably, Ethereum is presently trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Additionally, an observable bullish trend line is taking shape, offering support around the $2,250 mark on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nFacing resistance in the vicinity of the $2,320 zone, Ethereum\u2019s immediate hurdle is the $2,350 level. A decisive breakthrough above this resistance could propel the price towards the $2,420 level, with subsequent resistances standing at $2,450. Further gains have the potential to trigger a surge towards the $2,500 level.\n\nHowever, should Ethereum encounter difficulty in surpassing the $2,320 resistance, a downside correction may ensue. Initial support on the downside is identified near the $2,265 level, followed by key support at $2,250 and the aforementioned bullish trend line. The latter coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move.\n\nIn the event of a more pronounced decline, Ethereum\u2019s primary support lies around $2,200, corresponding to the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A breach below $2,200 raises the possibility of an extended decline, with the key support level at $2,120. Falling below this level could expose Ethereum to a potential move towards the $2,080 range in the near term."
