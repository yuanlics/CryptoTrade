        "title": "How Many Ethereum Are There? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "There are about 120.2 million Ethereum coins in circulation at the time of writing. The supply of Ethereum has been changing quite a bit over the years, as it initially displayed consistent growth, but entered a slightly deflationary trend in September of 2022 after Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with The Merge upgrade.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explain the Ethereum supply and how it is expected to change over time. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, supply dynamics are very important and can have a massive impact on long-term price movements.\n\nEthereum supply explained\n\nWhen talking about Ethereum\u2019s tokenomics, it\u2019s important to understand that there is no upper limit to the amount of ETH that can exist. Therefore, the max supply of Ethereum is technically infinite. This is different from a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, where the protocol has a clearly defined limit of how many coins can exist (21 million BTC in the example of Bitcoin)\n\nHowever, Ethereum having a theoretically unlimited maximum supply doesn\u2019t mean that you should be concerned about massive inflation in the Ethereum supply. In fact, the supply of ETH has been gradually decreasing for about a year now.\n\nAs we can see on the Ethereum supply chart, the Ethereum supply was growing between launch and September of 2022, although the rate at which new coins were being issued was gradually decreasing. For example, in June 2016, around 30,000 ETH was entering circulation through block rewards on a daily basis. By June 2022, three months before The Merge, only around 13,000 ETH was entering circulation each day.\n\nOn the chart, we can clearly see that the ETH supply growth peaked in September of 2022, when Ethereum adopted its new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nGrowth of the ETH supply from July 2015 to August 2023. Image source: Etherscan\n\nAnother important aspect of the Ethereum supply to understand is that each ETH coin can be broken down into a very large amount of smaller units. The smallest unit of ETH is called wei, named after Chinese computer engineer and cryptography expert Wei Dai.\n\nWei is similar to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest denomination, satoshi. Each ETH coin can be broken down into 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one quintillion) wei. Here\u2019s what the different denominations are called:\n\nName Number of wei wei 1 kwei 1,000 mwei 1,000,000 gwei 1,000,000,000 twei 1,000,000,000,000 pwei 1,000,000,000,000,000 Ether 1,000,000,000,000,000,000\n\nThe move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has had a big impact on the Ethereum supply\n\nAfter the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the Ethereum protocol needs to issue much fewer ETH coins to ensure that the network is secure \u2014 simply put, staking is a much less resource-intensive process than mining.\n\nBefore the move to Proof-of-Stake in September of 2022, around 13,000 ETH was being issued per day to provide incentives to Ethereum miners. Meanwhile, the new Proof-of-Stake system only has to issue about 1,600 ETH to adequately incentivize stakers and ensure that the network remains secure. After the transition to PoS, there has been about an 87.7% drop in the amount of new ETH coins that enter circulation each day.\n\nThere is another crucial aspect to Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics called EIP-1559. EIP-1559 is an upgrade that was activated on the Ethereum network in August of 2021. The upgrade reworked Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee market. After EIP-1559, the base ETH transaction fee paid for each transaction is burned (removed from circulation forever), while users retain the option to include tips to validators in order to have their transactions prioritized.\n\nEssentially, EIP-1559 means that the more demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum network, the more ETH is being burned. Since the move to Proof-of-Stake, enough ETH has been burned through EIP-1559 to reduce the overall supply of ETH, even though about 1,600 ETH are being created each day.\n\nThe combination of factors that is contributing to the reduction of the ETH supply is often called the Ethereum triple halving.\n\nBased on trends since The Merge, 674,000 ETH will be issued in the next year, while 996,000 ETH will be burned. This would mean a 322,000 ETH reduction in the Ethereum supply.\n\nEstimated yearly ETH issuance and burn based on trend since The Merge. Image source: ultrasound.money\n\nIf you want to track detailed information about the ETH supply, we recommend you check out the platform ultrasound.money. It offers an Ethereum supply chart, tracks trends in changes to the ETH supply, and provides real-time tracking of how much ETH is being burned through EIP-1559.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWe can expect the supply of Ethereum to continue decreasing gradually, provided that demand for Ethereum transactions remains high. Since Ethereum is easily the largest blockchain platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that the majority of users looking to engage in DeFi, stablecoins, NFTs, blockchain gaming and other use cases will continue to have Ethereum as their first option.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Ethereum, make sure to check out our article exploring if Ethereum is a good investment or not.\n\nEthereum supply FAQs\n\nHow many Ethereum are there?\n\nCurrently, there are about 120.2 million Ethereum coins in circulation. However, we can expect the amount of Ethereum to gradually decrease over time due to the EIP-1559 burn mechanism.\n\nIs there a max supply of Ethereum?\n\nNo, there is no max supply of Ethereum. Theoretically, an infinite amount of ETH could exist, but only a limited of ETH is issued each day and ETH coins are also constantly being burned through EIP-1559.\n\nHow much Ethereum is left?\n\nSince there is no maximum supply of ETH, the Ethereum protocol will never run out of new ETH coins to create.\n\nHow many Ethereum are destroyed?\n\nBased on current trends, around 996,000 Ethereum coins are destroyed each year through the EIP-1559 burn mechanism.\n\nWho has the most ETH in the world?\n\nCurrently, the most ETH is held by the Beacon Deposit Contract, which holds more than 29 million ETH (over $50 billion)."

        "content": "Can you Make Money with Ethereum?: Guide\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies can be a lucrative venture, but it\u2019s important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making any financial decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, many investors wonder if it\u2019s worth putting their money into this digital asset.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the long-term investment potential of Ethereum and provide insights into how you can make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso read: Worldcoin\u2019s Surge Causes Optimism to Dethrone Arbitrum in Daily Transactions\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThis unique feature sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThey automatically execute when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and making transactions more efficient and secure.\n\nThe potential use cases for Ethereum are vast and extend beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nThe platform can be used for a wide range of applications. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, gaming, and even social media.\n\nThe demand for Ethereum is expected to grow exponentially. Most likely due to more industries recognizing the benefits of blockchain technology and smart contracts.\n\nThe long-term investment potential of Ethereum\n\nWhen considering Ethereum as a long-term investment, it\u2019s important to look at several factors that contribute to its potential growth:\n\nAdoption and Use Cases\n\nEthereum\u2019s versatility and widespread adoption make it an attractive investment option. As the platform continues to grow, the demand for Ethereum and its native token, Ether (ETH), is likely to increase.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to support a wide range of industries contributes to its long-term investment potential.\n\nThe Shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nEthereum is in the process of transitioning from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient and secure proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nThis upgrade, known as Ethereum 2.0, aims to address the scalability and environmental concerns associated with PoW.\n\nBy staking Ethereum, individuals can participate in the network\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by validating transactions. This transition is expected to drive demand for Ethereum as more individuals and institutions participate in staking activities.\n\nNetwork upgrades and improvements\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly evolving, with regular upgrades and improvements being implemented to address scalability, security, and usability concerns.\n\nUpcoming upgrades, such as the London hard fork, aim to reduce transaction fees and improve the overall user experience.\n\nThese improvements contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nMarket dominance and liquidity\n\nAs the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has established itself as a dominant player in the crypto market.\n\nThis market dominance translates to increased liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Ethereum tokens.\n\nHigher liquidity enhances the overall stability of the asset and provides investors with more opportunities to enter or exit positions.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin \u2018Oversold\u2019 For The 1st Time Since 2020\n\nHow to Make Real Money With Ethereum\n\nNext, let\u2019s explore some strategies that can help you make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nBuy and hold (HODL)\n\nOne of the simplest and most popular strategies is to buy and hold cryptocurrencies for the long term.\n\nThis strategy, often referred to as \u201cHODLing,\u201d involves purchasing Ethereum tokens and holding onto them. You do this with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time.\n\nBy taking a long-term perspective, investors can potentially benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStaking Ethereum\n\nPeople can participate in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism and earn passive income by staking their Ethereum tokens.\n\nIn return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional Ethereum tokens. The amount of passive income earned through staking depends on factors such as the amount of Ethereum staked and the overall network participation.\n\nParticipating in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has gained significant attention in recent years, and Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement.\n\nDeFi platforms built on the Ethereum network offer a range of financial services. These include lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, by participating in DeFi protocols, individuals can earn interest on their Ethereum holdings, provide liquidity to earn fees or engage in arbitrage opportunities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with DeFi before participating.\n\nTrading Ethereum\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nFor individuals with trading experience and a deep understanding of market dynamics, actively trading Ethereum can be a profitable endeavor.\n\nDay trading or swing trading Ethereum involves buying and selling the cryptocurrency within short time frames to take advantage of price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, this strategy requires careful analysis, technical skills, and risk management to be successful.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that trading cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and losses are possible.\n\nHow Much Can You Make with a $100 Investment in Ethereum?\n\nThe potential returns on a $100 investment in Ethereum depend on various factors, such as the entry point, market conditions, and the holding period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced significant volatility in the past, with periods of both rapid growth and sharp corrections.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nHowever, a $100 investment made at a favorable entry point could potentially grow substantially over time.\n\nFor example, if an individual had invested $100 in Ethereum in early 2020 when the price was around $150, their investment would have grown to approximately $13,333 by mid-2021 when the price reached $2,000. This represents a significant return on investment.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky, and investing in Ethereum or any other digital asset carries the potential for loss. It\u2019s important to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds that you can afford to lose.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity due to its versatile platform, potential for widespread adoption, and ongoing network improvements.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum requires careful consideration and an understanding of the associated risks.\n\nBy adopting strategies such as buying and holding, staking, participating in DeFi, or trading Ethereum, individuals can potentially make real money with this cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, conduct thorough research, and make informed investment decisions based on your risk tolerance and financial goals."

        "content": "Arkham Intelligence said on Aug. 30 that the trading app company Robinhood holds the fifth-largest account on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe intelligence platform previously identified Robinhood as the owner of the third-largest Bitcoin address, which holds 118,300 BTC ($3 billion).\n\nOn Twitter/X, Arkham said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also identified [Robinhood] as the owner of the 5th largest ETH wallet, holding $2.54 [billion] of ETH.\u201c\n\nThat address begins with 0x40B\u2026 and holds 1.5 million ETH ($2.54 billion). It also holds more than 100 ERC-20 tokens, collectively worth $177.1 million. Those numbers bring Robinhood\u2019s total holdings for all Ethereum-based tokens above $2.71 billion.\n\nArkham noted that the address holds funds in custody on behalf of Robinhood users. Robinhood\u2019s trading model requires the company to back user balances at a 1:1 ratio in line with regulations set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe four Ethereum addresses larger than Robinhood\u2019s account include Ethereum\u2019s beacon deposit contract, a wrapped Ether contract, and addresses belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken and Binance.\n\nThe beacon deposit contract is by far the largest of those addresses. With more than 29 million ETH ($49.7 billion), it accounts for one-quarter of the entire Ethereum supply.\n\nRobinhood has addresses on other chains\n\nArkham\u2019s data additionally shows that Robinhood holds funds on numerous other exchanges, including Avalanche ($29.83 million), Polygon ($1.40 million), Arbitrum ($395), and BNB Chain ($203). The funds that Robinhood holds on each of those blockchains are not entirely made up of the chain\u2019s native token.\n\nIn total, Robinhood holds $7.39 billion of crypto in those addresses as of Aug. 30. The company\u2019s earlier quarterly results indicated that it held $11.5 billion of assets related to user cryptocurrency safeguarding obligations on June 30. It is unclear whether this change is due to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices or actual changes in the amount of crypto in each of Robinhood\u2019s addresses.\n\nSo far, Robinhood has only confirmed to CryptoSlate that it owns the $3 billion Bitcoin address. This article will be updated as Robinhood provides more information.\n\nThe news comes alongside an announcement from Robinhood stating that it will extend wallet support to Bitcoin and Dogecoin and add Ethereum swaps.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are likely setting the stage for a big move to the upside.\n\nCrypto trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe suggests to his 665,600 followers on the social media platform X that the digital assets market is following a historical pattern before Bitcoin (BTC) halving events.\n\nHe says that just like in the past investor sentiment and altcoins are currently reaching cycle lows 10 months before the next BTC halving event, which is expected on April 20, 2024, and he believes just like in the past altcoins will soon turn bullish.\n\n\u201cEvery rally is getting sold into, as people want to get out of the markets and tend to disbelief the markets have already started in a new bull cycle. Until the real move happens and people don\u2019t get a chance to get into their positions. That\u2019s why positioning is super important to do that in an early stage, which is when you start to take a look at price levels.\n\nWe\u2019re 10 months prior to the Bitcoin halving. The period where sentiment is the lowest and altcoins are usually swimming around their cycle lows. Bitcoin dominance is peaking, and will not peak to that level anymore in this cycle. It happened in 2015, ten months prior to the halving. It happened in 2019, ten months prior to the halving. It happens in 2023, ten months prior to the halving.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the Bitcoin dominance chart is flashing bullish for altcoins as the the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) are starting to act like resistance just like they did months before Bitcoin\u2019s 2020 halving event.\n\n\u201cA clear rejection at the 200-Week MA and EMA and looking to continue the fall, while altcoins are slowly picking up in their BTC pairs as a new cycle starts. While nobody expects it.\u201d\n\nHe also says that several altcoin projects, like Ethereum and blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK), have continued to develop during the bear market, setting the stage for massive rally events when the bull cycle takes off.\n\n\u201cAre projects still developing and did something change on that perspective? Well. The good part is that many fraudulent projects are washed out of the markets, while the good ones are constantly building further. Ethereum has swapped towards PoS (proof-of-stake) and is getting Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) based on futures in a month maximum. Chainlink has developed CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) and I\u2019m not even mentioning all the other progress in DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and more.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,733 at time of writing, up 5.1% in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "In laying out the bull case for ether on Wednesday, Fidelity\u2019s digital assets subsidiary said dapps built on Ethereum are \u201ccapable of things that could not be done on Bitcoin\u2019s network due to Ethereum\u2019s superior programmability.\u201d\n\nResearchers who compiled the report said investors could view ether (ETH) as an \u201caspiring\u201d form of money.\n\nEther, they wrote, will \u201clikely face significantly more headwinds than bitcoin to become widely accepted as a form of money.\u201d\n\nWhy? Unlike bitcoin (BTC), which has a hard cap of 21 million, ether technically has \u201cunlimited supply parameters\u201d \u2014 even though there is a fee burning mechanism. It was introduced by upgrade EIP-1559 in August 2021 and has led to deflationary periods for ether.\n\nThere\u2019s uncertainty relating to future upgrades to Ethereum and the number of the tokens in circulation on an untethered schedule, according to the report. And the cumulative effect has been that ether\u2019s supply has a slew of obstacles before it can be \u201creliably consistent to that of other store of value assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems unlikely that any other digital asset could improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good because bitcoin is viewed by some as the most secure, decentralized, sound digital money to this point, and any \u201cimprovement\u201d would require tradeoffs,\u201d the report said.\n\nFidelity acknowledged that Ethereum\u2019s use of smart contracts, which unlocks a whole new layer of programmability, is ether\u2019s \u201ctrue differentiating factor.\u201d\n\nThe other thesis Fidelity discussed behind ether\u2019s value was its potential to generate yield through staking.\n\nThe act of staking ether on the network has changed dramatically since the Shapella upgrade in April 2023.\n\nFidelity said the payout structure for validators attesting to the blocks of each epoch and for block proposals proffer incentives to stake the maximum of 32 ETH. The base reward is proportional to validators\u2019 effective balance.\n\nThe report also pointed out that base reward is inversely proportional to the number of validators.\n\n\u201cThe rationale for this issuance formula is to ensure enough validator participation because higher yields are paid if the validator set is small, while also guaranteeing that unexpectedly high issuance will not occur if many validators participate,\u201d the report said.\n\nThis balance, Fidelity argued, has allowed Ethereum to sustain yield payouts. Plus, there are forms of yield paid out by users including MEV and tips, which supplement the network\u2019s payout burden.\n\nFidelity\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that increased activity on Ethereum does in fact drive block space demand, which in turn, generates cash flow for token holders.\n\nBut, the report said there remain \u201ccomplex, nuanced\u201d factors, including protocol and scaling upgrades, that make Ethereum\u2019s future uncertain for investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Can any Layer-1 blockchain overtake Ethereum? | KrASIA - KrASIA",
        "content": "Is Ethereum the king of Layer-1 blockchains?\n\nYour perspective on blockchain technology is likely to shape your answer, but one fact remains indisputable: Ethereum hosts an unparalleled ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s preeminent position has not gone uncontested, with numerous competitors hoping to take its place. Consider this: over half of the top 20 cryptocurrencies, based on market capitalization, are native tokens of L1 blockchains, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and BNB Smart Chain. The emergence of alternative L1 blockchains was a key theme during the 2017 and 2021 adoption cycles, when Ethereum grappled with congestion issues due to its limited blockspace, prompting users to migrate to other L1 blockchains with higher capacities and lower fees.\n\nYet, years later, Ethereum remains de facto the top L1 blockchain, while some alternatives have begun to resemble virtual \u2018ghost towns\u2019 due to stagnant or declining user counts.\n\nNevertheless, new L1 blockchains have been introduced over time, such as Aptos and Sui, to relative success. Both blockchains command a combined valuation of over USD 12 billion at the time of writing. More L1 blockchains are expected to launch at similar valuations, and some of them could rival Ethereum in due time.\n\nOverview of L1 blockchains\n\nWith more alternative L1 blockchains emerging, a question looms large: can any of them overtake Ethereum? Unpacking this question requires a review of the history of L1 blockchains and analyzing them against Ethereum.\n\nThe genesis of most L1 blockchains, including Ethereum, finds its roots in Bitcoin\u2019s limitations. Bitcoin\u2019s original purpose was to be a trustless, peer-to-peer electronic cash system. When bitcoins became gradually recognized as a legitimate asset class, developers sought to emulate it by creating digital currencies atop Bitcoin. But this was largely unsuccessful due to the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language and social layer. Frustrations of these developers led to the introduction of Ethereum as a solution.\n\nLike Bitcoin, early-stage Ethereum prioritized decentralization over scalability. As adoption grew, the network quickly hit throughput limits. This was exemplified by instances like the 2017 boom in initial coin offerings (ICOs), when the demand for blockspace far exceeded the network\u2019s capacity. Clogged for hours, Ethereum\u2019s gas fees, which are paid to conduct transactions on the blockchain, skyrocketed. A simple token transfer cost as much as USD 150 at one point.\n\nEthereum\u2019s scalability issues paved the way for other L1 blockchains to emerge. During the ICO boom, blockchains like EOS, Tezos, and Cardano raised hundreds of millions of dollars, promising the development of faster L1 architecture. Many cited Ethereum\u2019s low transactions per second and other limitations when raising funds.\n\nState of the market\n\nMany L1 blockchains have been launched since Ethereum\u2019s inception, but the latter has retained its place as the leader, based on market capitalization. How has Ethereum maintained its lead, and what drives its high valuation?\n\nCheaper, faster L1 blockchains win out\n\nAccording to Metcalfe\u2019s Law, users drive value, as network value is assumed to grow superlinearly to the number of users. Active user counts are difficult to assess due to the lack of anti-sybil systems and the ease of generating new addresses at will. Nonetheless, active addresses can provide a reasonable estimate of each L1 blockchain\u2019s user count.\n\nEthereum has less active users than \u2018cheaper\u2019 blockchains like Tron, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon despite its higher valuation, suggesting that user count and network value do not necessarily correlate with one another. Some other networks, such as Polkadot and Cardano, also have low active user counts, yet are valued comparatively higher, supporting this viewpoint.\n\nDevelopers, developers, developers\n\nDevelopers serve as an additional gauge of network health, as they contribute value by maintaining and enhancing the protocol layer, in addition to building applications on L1 blockchains.\n\nAccording to a report by Electric Capital, Ethereum has the highest aggregate of total active developers, though Polkadot, Cosmos, and Solana also possess notable developer counts, which could stem from them utilizing programming languages that differ from Ethereum\u2019s Solidity language.\n\nLiquidity\n\nLiquidity is crucial for L1 blockchains because it directly impacts their functionality. By stabilizing prices and enabling efficient price discovery, it empowers users to engage in trading, transactions, and network involvement.\n\nTherefore, liquidity signifies volume of tradable assets, and is typically measured using metrics such as total value locked (TVL), trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), count of trading pairs, and more.\n\nEthereum has a clear lead in terms of liquidity, with its TVL market share hovering stably around 60% since the summer of 2022, after Terra collapsed.\n\nEthereum leads, but not without asterisks\n\nWhile other factors exist, Ethereum\u2019s predominance likely stems from its liquidity and capital flows, noting its weaker position in some aspects such as user adoption rates. This may suggest that the market places significant importance on capital. The following subsections delve into the factors behind the metrics discussed above, including active user count, liquidity, and developer activity.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization, as a fundamental characteristic of blockchains, yields benefits such as improved censorship resistance, network resilience and security, among others. It instills users with the confidence to store and transact value, with higher degrees of decentralization equating to higher value attributed to an L1 blockchain.\n\nWhile decentralization can seem abstract, it can be gauged using several factors:\n\nNumber of nodes and node distribution: Nodes participate in a network to maintain its blockchains and, depending on their type, validate and relay transactions. Spreading nodes out across geographies and organizations reduces the influence of single actors, improving network resilience and security. The Nakamoto coefficient is a useful gauge, quantifying the nodes needed to achieve a majority and thereby safeguard a blockchain. A higher coefficient typically signifies stronger decentralization, though this single metric may overlook certain nuances.\n\nNodes participate in a network to maintain its blockchains and, depending on their type, validate and relay transactions.

A higher coefficient typically signifies stronger decentralization, though this single metric may overlook certain nuances. Token holder distribution: When the majority of tokens is held within a small number of wallets, owners could have the authority to dictate the development of an entire network. This could deter users from transacting on the network.\n\nWhen the majority of tokens is held within a small number of wallets, owners could have the authority to dictate the development of an entire network. This could deter users from transacting on the network. Governance model: Off-chain governance involves decision-making outside the blockchain through community coordination, while on-chain governance embeds governance directly into the protocol, enabling automated, token-based voting on changes. The impact varies. Off-chain governance is less affected by the concentration of token holders but is prone to political centralization and potentially faces high barriers to participation.\n\nOff-chain governance involves decision-making outside the blockchain through community coordination, while on-chain governance embeds governance directly into the protocol, enabling automated, token-based voting on changes. The impact varies. Off-chain governance is less affected by the concentration of token holders but is prone to political centralization and potentially faces high barriers to participation. Client diversity: Running more nodes could improve network resilience, but if a network is run only on a single client, a client bug can threaten the entire blockchain.\n\nRunning more nodes could improve network resilience, but if a network is run only on a single client, a client bug can threaten the entire blockchain. Culture: A community culture with strong values can help defend a blockchain against centralization-related risks and threats, such as Bitcoin\u2019s defense against app development in 2014. It\u2019s an underrated but pivotal aspect of decentralization.\n\nNetwork effects\n\nNetwork effects encompass various dimensions in the context of L1 blockchains. One example is the interplay between users and developers, reminiscent of Web2 platforms. User growth attracts developers, leading to new apps and use cases, thereby attracting more users, thus perpetuating the cycle.\n\nSuch effects can also manifest in other ways, including the choice of programming language. Ethereum\u2019s Solidity is a popular language, which can cultivate a larger pool of Solidity developers, fostering a bigger community and simplifying collaboration, hiring, and issue resolution. These factors could bolster innovation cycles by drawing in developers and expediting app launches.\n\nCapital network effects are crucial, especially within financial applications. They tend to emerge on networks with substantial market size and liquidity. Stakeholder support bolsters these effects. Examples include Coinbase\u2019s deposit and withdrawal features, Circle\u2019s USDC issuance, and Fireblocks\u2019 custody support.\n\nLindy effect\n\nGiven the nascency of digital assets and lack of historical data, the Lindy effect could be used to evaluate the success of L1 blockchains. It\u2019s a model that theorizes the lifespan of non-perishable things, such as blockchains, is correlated to their current age. It is, in some ways, applicable: L1 blockchains that survive a myriad of challenges, such as technical issues, hacking attempts, market volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and competition, and still retain their users, are likely better positioned to thrive in future cycles.\n\nThis model suggests that mature L1 blockchains that have hitherto stayed relevant have better odds of eventually overtaking Ethereum.\n\nHysteresis\n\nHysteresis describes how systems, once set on a path, persist, making them harder to deviate the longer their trajectory stays unchanged. For example, Ethereum\u2019s initial use of proof-of-work before transitioning to a proof-of-stake model facilitated widespread participation and token distribution. This type of distribution is incredibly difficult for new networks to replicate. Another example is FTX, despite its negative impact on the Solana ecosystem over the past few years. FTX\u2019s affiliation helped propel Solana into the mainstream and become a leading L1 blockchain and ecosystem.\n\nViewed in this context, Ethereum\u2019s leadership isn\u2019t necessarily the result of technical superiority, but a culmination of its history, momentum gained over the past decade, and compounded effects generated of its own volition.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nL1 blockchains may differentiate themselves by offering superior architecture or catering to specific niches. This could involve scalability, transaction costs, consensus mechanisms, privacy features, or specialized tools for specific industries. For example, Solana is committed to a monolithic blockchain architecture to maximize the benefits of composability and liquidity effects. Aptos and Sui offer Move as a more secure and intuitive programming language, which could make them more appealing to developers who want to minimize the occurrence of code bugs.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nA blockchain\u2019s monetary policy could be a cornerstone for its success. It dictates how the native cryptocurrency of a blockchain is issued, distributed, and potentially burned, influencing both its scarcity and value proposition. A clear, consistent, and transparent monetary policy can foster trust among participants, attract investors, and stabilize the network\u2019s economic environment.\n\nMoreover, it determines the incentives for validators or miners, thereby impacting the security and functionality of blockchains. A well-balanced monetary policy can promote growth, adoption, and stability, differentiating a blockchain and improving its long-term viability.\n\nLayer-2 blockchains\n\nAlternative L1 blockchains are not the only way to scale anymore. Rollups became a key aspect of Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap in October 2020. Since then, they have gradually garnered market share from other blockchains. Arbitrum and Optimism\u2014both optimistic rollups\u2014have more active users and TVL than most L1 blockchains. Coinbase\u2019s optimistic rollup, Base, has also been gaining traction.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, optimistic, zero-knowledge, and application-specific rollups all constitute integral components of the Ethereum ecosystem. When viewed holistically, the hurdle to overtake Ethereum becomes significantly higher.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nDetermining whether another L1 blockchain can overtake Ethereum is an exercise fraught with potential folly. The technology landscape, especially in a nascent field like crypto, is in constant flux and rife with uncertainties. The question also implies zero-sum thinking, suggesting that one L1 blockchain\u2019s win is another\u2019s loss. It may be more prudent to heed the words of Warren Buffett, who aptly stated: \u201cForecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster \u2026 they tell you nothing about the future.\u201d\n\nIt seems likeliest that Ethereum will retain its leading position for the foreseeable future. It stands out in terms of decentralization and its ecosystem is pioneering a myriad of frontier technologies such as scaling and privacy solutions, zero-knowledge applications, and more.\n\nAmong the alternative L1 blockchains, Solana is seemingly the most promising contender. Its monolithic architecture is meaningfully different from Ethereum\u2019s, and it is the only other network with multiple validator clients. Its community, hardened by recent events, is one of the most vibrant and ardent. Concurrently, its ecosystem teems with innovation, giving rise to solutions such as xNFTs, compressed NFTs, state compression, the Solana Mobile Stack, and more.\n\nThis article was adapted based on a feature originally written by Steven Shi and published on Amber Labs\u2019 Substack.

        "title": "Reshaping real world assets with tokenization and original Ethereum's vision: AMA with Mattereum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "\"I'm pretty disappointed with the way Ethereum has gone since its launch,\" said Vinay Gupta, founder of Mattereum and former coordinator of Ethereum's initial release, during Cointelegraph's AMA session. \"The idea was that we could use blockchain to govern infrastructure in the real world. There was this idea that we could tokenize real-world assets and get these new efficient economies, just better use of capital globally to provide people with bare goods, bare services with less waste and inefficiency. But that didn't happen.\"\n\nWith Mattereum which focuses on asset tokenization Gupta wants to go back to Ethereum's roots and address the original problem. \u201cWe\u2019re not inventing fractional ownership from scratch. Big publicly traded companies like IBM, Google or Meta offer similar options as stocks available to everyone.\n\nWhat we're doing is using the efficiency of blockchain to apply this fractional ownership concept to much smaller things, much cheaper and lighter. This brings the benefits of fractional ownership governance down to the point where you can start dealing with individual cars, homes, or works of art, rather than at the scale of power grids, airplanes, or utilities that serve hundreds of millions of users every day on the Internet,\" Gupta said.\n\nHe identified unreadiness in regulation as one of the factors that led Ethereum to off-track, which became a priority for Mattereum to solve. \"Working with lawyers and convincing them to support our cause proved to be a lengthy process. It took us four years to complete our first transaction and six years to reach a point of being able to securitize. As a result, it's now possible to legally gain control of almost any asset in most countries in a completely legal way. This means that we can go back to an earlier vision of Ethereum and fully implement it,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to explaining that tokenization can significantly reduce the time spent on legal and paperwork, Gupta shared his vision on the other benefits that it could bring to the world: 'Tokenization takes ultra-powerful tools from high finance and makes them accessible as a means of replacing massive mortgages and credit card debt. It changes the current debt-based relationships in society to an equity-based economy and the idea of \"we own this thing, we cooperate together.\"\n\nIn this case, I expect a level of social transformation and revolution much greater than what happened with the invention of credit cards and debt. Moreover, co-owned societies are much more benign and friendly.\u201d\n\nRegarding other possible changes due to blockchain mass adoption, Gupta envisions an economic democracy revolution and the integral role of DAOs in it. He anticipates DAOs to become as popular as social media platforms with \u201cgovernance geeks managing their portfolio\u201d. \"I believe such a transformation is necessary and inevitable if we intend to democratize the world,\" he claimed.\n\nGupta views Mattereum as a backend powerhouse similar to how Amazon assisted in launching thousands of businesses worldwide. He elaborated: \u201cAnyone can bring a deal to Mattereum to examine the possibilities and limitations and then to secure and fractionalize it as Mattereum Asset Passports. So If any company with specific expertise wants to make assets transactionable or create companies with backend transactions, they can reach us.\u201d\n\nMattereum Asset Passports, which Gupta mentioned, are NFTs that prove the value of physical objects. They come with a built-in legal layer, providing a warranty claim mechanism that addresses liability. Gupta provided more details on Mattereum\u2019s flagship Asset Passports: \u201cWe put on chain with our customers legally binding promises from different third parties about the goods being sold. If any of those promises are inaccurate the third parties have to pay.\n\nIt's important to note that it\u2019s the third parties who are providing risk management in the deal and bear the costs. They\u2019re putting up money which could be in on-chain escrow contracts to guarantee that the buyer will not be defrauded. That\u2019s how we get trustworthy oracles to prove all the assets on chain are legitimate.\u201d\n\n\"I truly believe that moving from a debt-based economy to an asset-based economy and implementing a fully transparent financial infrastructure will solve many of the world's political problems,\" Gupta said, summing up the AMA session. \u201cIt is still possible to implement Ethereum's original vision. However, it requires a massive bridge, which Mattereum can become. I envision Mattereum as a fundamental part of the financial infrastructure for the entire planet, much like Swift or Visa\u201d, he added.\n\nLearn more about Mattereum"

        "content": "Ethereum has introduced the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification (EELS), a Python-based reference implementation for its execution client, designed to make core components more readable and clear. EELS provides complete snapshots of the protocol at each fork, making it easier to follow.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n* Ethereum unveils EELS, a Python-based reference implementation for its execution client.\n\n* EELS aims to be a more programmer-friendly successor to the Yellow Paper.\n\n* The project has been in development for over a year and is backed by ConsenSys' Quilt team and the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthereum has publicly introduced the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification (EELS), a Python reference implementation designed to make the core components of an Ethereum execution client more readable and clear. Developed over more than a year, EELS is intended to be a \"spiritual successor to the Yellow Paper\" and is focused on \"readability and clarity.\"\n\nBackground and Context\n\nThe EELS project comes on the heels of significant upgrades to the Ethereum network, notably the Shapella upgrade. Shapella, which went live on April 12, 2023, followed \"The Merge\" and enabled validators to withdraw their stake from the Beacon Chain back to the execution layer. It also introduced new functionalities to both the execution and consensus layers. The Shapella upgrade was first tested on the Sepolia testnet and was a collaborative effort that combined changes to the execution layer (Shanghai), consensus layer (Capella), and the Engine API.\n\nWhat is EELS?\n\nEELS is an \"execution layer reference implementation in Python\" that is \"up to date with mainnet.\" It can \"fill and execute state tests\" and \"follow mainnet.\" The project aims to provide complete snapshots of the protocol at each fork, making it easier to follow than EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and production clients, which often mix multiple forks in the same code path.\n\nTechnical Features\n\nEELS is \"just regular Python\" and can be tested like any other Python library. It supports the entire \"ethereum/tests\" suite and also includes a selection of \"pytest\" tests. The project does not implement peer-to-peer networking and requires a production client to sync blocks.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nWhile EELS is still \"a bit rough around the edges,\" it aims to become the \"default way to specify Core EIPs\" and the \"first place EIP authors go to prototype their proposals.\" Those interested in contributing can join the \"#specifications\" channel or pick an issue from the project's repository.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of EELS marks a significant step in Ethereum's ongoing efforts to make its execution layer more accessible and understandable. By providing a Python-based, readable, and testable reference implementation, EELS aims to serve as a valuable resource for both developers and researchers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Popped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have rallied sharply this week, but that rally cooled off over the last 24 hours. Tuesday's jump was driven by Grayscale's win over the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court, which could pave the way for more crypto ETFs, but the rally hasn't lasted.\n\nBetween noon ET on Tuesday and 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the value of Bitcoin (BTC 1.14%) fell 2.7%, Ethereum (ETH 0.47%) was down 1.9%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 0.53%) dropped 2.1%. But the cryptocurrencies are up 2.9%, 1.4%, and 2.2% over the past week, so there has been a rally overall.\n\nSo what\n\nThe court's ruling yesterday that the SEC must review the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust application to convert into an ETF could pave the way for more Bitcoin ETFs. And that could open up more crypto ETFs for Ethereum or even Dogecoin.\n\nWhat the judge's ruling doesn't guarantee is that any ETFs will actually be approved. The SEC just needs to review the application and treat it like any other Bitcoin ETF application, which hasn't yet been approved. So, it's back to a waiting game for investors.\n\nWhat we have seen is repeated wins for the crypto industry in court. The Ripple ruling in July paved the way for cryptocurrencies to be regulated more like commodities rather than securities, and now trading options may be opening up via ETFs.\n\nIt's not clear when there will be a final ruling on a Bitcoin ETF or if an answer on what's a commodity and what's a security will be coming, but this was seen as a positive sign for the industry.\n\nNow what\n\nThe bounce in values on Tuesday is what's reversing today. There was at least some hope that this would lead to more ETFs and more certainty for the industry, but as the market has processed the ruling, it's clear that's not what happened.\n\nThat said, the court being more friendly to the crypto industry should be an incremental positive long term. Trading has all but dried up for most cryptocurrencies, and that's left the industry in an uncertain place. The regulatory uncertainty hasn't helped, but if that gets answered, there's billions of dollars of investment that's gone into companies building on the blockchain. That's where the real innovation will take place that could cause values to increase.\n\nFor now, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic when there's a positive ruling, but the bounce doesn't last long because there's no fundamental change in the market. That's what's holding values back and why we get the pop and then the slow drop of the last 36 hours. Expect that trend to continue until there's regulatory clarity, which at this rate could still be years away."

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson has taken center stage to promote Cardano\u2019s prowess over its rivals.\n\nThe founder claimed Cardano will surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum by transcending beyond its cryptocurrency status.\n\nHoskinson could be looking too far ahead into the future as Cardano grapples with regulatory uncertainty and issues with its infrastructure.\n\nCharles Hoskinson never misses a chance to champion Cardano\u2019s superiority over established rivals like Ethereum and Bitcoin, often provoking their communities.\n\nAs the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network steadily establishes itself as a solid player in the crypto industry, particularly through its achievements in the DeFi sector, the rowdy founder is once again tooting his horn, boldly claiming that Cardano will become the top crypto project in the world.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s Bold Claims\n\nIn his keynote address at Rare Evo 2023, Charles Hoskinson shared several ambitious assertions about Cardano, its decentralization, and the broader crypto industry. During his speech, Hoskinson confidently stated that Cardano, currently the third-largest blockchain project, is poised to surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum because he believes it has higher scalability and interoperability.\n\nBacking his assertions with achievements from this year, Hoskinson highlighted Cardano\u2019s remarkable growth, with its DeFi TVL growing by 200%, the launch of scalability and interoperability solutions like Mithril and Hydra, and native assets exceeding 8 million on the network. In a more lighthearted tone, Hoskinson also playfully mentioned that Crypto data aggregator Messari is writing \u201cnice stuff about the network,\u201d implying that things look good.\n\nIn addition to its extensive list of achievements, Hoskinson proposed that Cardano could transcend beyond its cryptocurrency status and evolve into the foundation of a new digital nation. However, for this vision to materialize, the POS network has to substantially expand its user base and navigate its ongoing regulatory troubles.\n\nAs the Cardano Founder\u2019s visionary claims continue to echo, it\u2019s important to delve deeper into the question.\n\nWill Cardano Become the Top Crypto Project?\n\nWhile Charles Hoskinson confidently asserts that Cardano possesses superior scalability and interoperability compared to its more established counterparts, the network still struggles with challenges that hinder its compatibility with other projects in the industry.\n\nThis is because Cardano is fundamentally different from most blockchain projects. It dons a different smart contract environment, transaction model, and signature scheme, making it very hard to communicate with other blockchain networks in the industry, and is the reason why its DeFi ecosystem is smaller compared to other networks.\n\nTo bridge this gap, the POS network relies on third-party developer solutions like Wanchain\u2019s bi-directional cross-chain bridges to tap into DeFi ecosystems built on other networks. At press time, Cardano\u2019s DeFi ecosystem comprises 24 protocols, starkly contrasting Ethereum\u2019s titanic count of 897 unique protocols.\n\nInteroperability merely scratches the surface of the challenges in Cardano\u2019s current infrastructure. However, Cardano\u2019s vibrant developer ecosystem is actively working to develop new solutions and help propel the network beyond its rivals.\n\nThe Voltaire-era\u2019s community-driven governance holds much promise for the network and could ultimately bring Hoskinson\u2019s vision to fruition.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nADA exchanged hands at $0.2785 at press time with a daily trading volume exceeding $329 million.\n\nRecent Santiment data named Cardano the industry\u2019s top dev platform at press time, eclipsing competitors Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nCharles Hoskinson believes that by the summer of 2023, Cardano could surpass Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every other cryptocurrency in decentralization.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCardano is actively vying to cement its position as the top cryptocurrency project in the industry. The network has shown remarkable growth this year and is determined to stay consistent with its results. The network could become the best if it maintains its momentum.\n\nCardano\u2019s new accomplishment may not be as impressive as it seems:\n\nCardano Celebrates 1.3M Stakers, but Is It Good as It Seems?\n\nA newly launched network has outperformed Cardano, but is comparing the two fair?\n\nCardano DeFi TVL Slips Below Base Chain as ADA Declines"

        "content": "Espresso co-founder Jill Gunter recalls Ethereum\u2019s ICO token heyday, when she first tried to buy into a token sale.\n\nComparing the experience to the ruthlessly competitive efforts to acquire Taylor Swift tickets, Gunter felt compelled to \u201ckeep putting in higher and higher fees to try and get my transaction actually accepted.\u201d\n\nGunter says it was then that she realized that the nodes running Ethereum were operated by \u201cactual humans,\u201d who could insert their own transactions and front-run the crowd. \u201cOr, they were just asking for astronomically high fees in order to get your transactions into the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that this was a fair, decentralized system,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat are the dynamics at play here?\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Chase Chapman on the On the Other Side podcast (Spotify/Apple), Gunter delves into the complexities and pitfalls of Ethereum\u2019s transaction environment.\n\nThe ICO token sale, Gunter says, was her first interaction with maximum extractable value, or MEV. It\u2019s a buzzword, Gunter explains, that describes the value that participants operating the system can extract from it by ordering transactions in a way that favors them.\n\nNaive crypto users might imagine transactions entering a waiting room and then getting picked up in an orderly manner, Gunter says. In reality, she explains, certain network participants can insert transactions between multiple sets in order to capture arbitrage between two decentralized orders or frontrun a transaction if it\u2019s set at an unfavorable price.\n\n\u201cYou as a user,\u201d Chapman adds, \u201care now having to deal with, basically, miners who should be relatively neutral but are no longer neutral because they\u2019re playing this weird meta game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean that they should be neutral?\u201d Gunter asks. \u201cPart of the reason why this works is because there\u2019s this game theoretic around this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are these surprise dynamics that then we have to figure out,\u201d she says. \u201cAs the architects of these systems, how do we want to approach this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen crop up are all kinds of approaches to mitigate the negative effects of MEV, this notion of extractable value from smart or clever ordering of transactions.\u201d\n\nGunter mentions the example of specialized actors who build blocks and order transactions in a way that makes \u201cmaximal economic sense,\u201d performed independently from nodes in a process called proposer builder separation (PBS).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interaction that happens between the builder and the proposer now, and this is actually the case for how most Ethereum transactions work today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lied to all of these years\u201d\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive, Gunter says, \u201cbecause you might hear, \u2018Oh, there are these specialized players who are just taking all the value.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the idea is to figure out how to make the system as efficient as possible, Gunter says, and then determine ways to redistribute that value back to users while combating monopolistic tendencies.\n\n\u201cWhen I first found out about this, my mind was blown,\u201d Gunter says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I have no idea how anything works.\u2019 I\u2019ve been lied to all of these years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually that nefarious, rest assured, but this is indeed again, how most of Ethereum actually does function today.\u201d\n\nGunter acknowledges, \u201cthere are no perfect solutions to this that we\u2019ve come up with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have this decentralized open source financial infrastructure that we\u2019re building,\u201d Gunter says. She contrasts the open transparency of Ethereum development with the \u201cWall Street Flash Boys dynamic,\u201d where no one knew that a few specialized firms were secretly frontrunning the stock market for years. It was this phenomenon that inspired the name of MEV mitigating organization, Flashbots.\n\n\u201cI am very glad and grateful that all of this research is going on and that these issues are being addressed and discovered out in the open.\u201d\n\nChapman observes the double edged sword nature of transparency in blockchain. \u201cSo many things in the crypto ecosystem are so transparent that sometimes it feels like we have way more problems than anyone else does.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut really we just know. We can all see everything. All our shit is out in the open and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018that is not great.\u2019 And I think that does push us forward.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Shiba Inu [SHIB] ecosystem is actively demonstrating its significance beyond being a mere meme coin. The dedication directed towards Shibarium, the layer-2 network, serves as evidence of this evolution. Despite facing heckles during its initial launch, it has steadily advanced over time, as evidenced by an increased adoption rate.\n\nHowever, some individuals remain confused about the mechanics of the layer-2 network. As Shibarium isn\u2019t yet compatible with all decentralized applications or exchanges, certain users might be interested in understanding how to transfer their assets back from Shibarium to Ethereum. This article aims to provide a step-by-step guide for the same.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium Records 100K Wallet Addresses Post Relaunch\n\nTransferring funds from Shibarium to Ethereum\n\nTo begin, it is essential to make sure that users possess an adequate amount of ETH in their accounts. For those planning to withdraw to Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to do so so that the associated gas fees are covered. The cost of gas fees can fluctuate based on the level of network congestion and demand. There are a total of seven steps to withdraw funds from Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium.\n\nTo start off, go to the official Shibarium website. Following this, select the Menu icon located at the top of the page. This action will assist in transitioning to the Bridge section. Please ensure that your wallet is already connected beforehand.\n\nOnce you are in the Bridge section, two options will appear: Deposit and Withdraw. Select Withdraw, then pick the token you intend to withdraw and input the desired amount.\n\nAn overview of the withdrawal procedure will be provided. This overview displays the withdrawn amount, the estimated time for the withdrawal to be completed, and the anticipated fee.\n\nTo facilitate the transition from Shibarium to Ethereum, it\u2019s necessary to initiate a cap request. This request enables assets to be transferred until the specified amount is reached. Users are advised to input a rounded figure in this step.\n\nYour transaction will appear as pending as it goes through three stages: initialized, checkpoint, and challenges.\n\nOnce the transaction reaches the final stage, it will enter the processing queue and might take up to seven days to be fully processed.\n\nThings to keep in mind\n\nShibarium employs a plasma bridge, which can result in a longer process. The plasma bridge functions as a security mechanism. It has regular checkpoints and exit challenges to guarantee the safety and accuracy of transactions. Consequently, withdrawals from Shibarium to Ethereum are not instant as they require some time to be fully completed. Lucie, a member of the SHIB community, elaborated on the same and said,\n\n\u201cPatience is Key: Why the wait? When moving from Layer 2 (L2) using a plasma bridge, delays are common. It\u2019s not just Shibarium\u2014this happens with all L2 solutions using plasma bridge.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Shytoshi Provides Last & Final Updates About Shibarium"

Holeskey testnet is set to replace the long-running Goerli testnet.\n\nadvertisement\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NethermindEth/status/1696806516584574997\n\nAccording to Ethereum developers, Holesky is the first long-standing, merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum testnet. Holesky will replace Goerli as a staking, infrastructure, and protocol-developer testnet.\n\nIn order to use Nethermind with this new chain, users need to run different configs for the Snap Synced node and archival mode setup. Then follow with running a consensus layer client that supports the Holesky network.\n\nEthereum core developer Tim Beiko earlier stated the popular Goerli testnet will eventually shut down as application developers\u2019 usage grew exponentially, making it less reliable for future upgrades.\n\nIn a recent Execution Layer Meeting, core developers revealed some testing updates from Devnet-8 and Holesky testnet.

This includes claims that Ethereum/Buterin are financially beholden to Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang Group, which has close ties to China\u2019s government.\n\nButerin\u2019s personal interest in all things Chinese is well documented, including his efforts to learn the language and his commitment to issuing a Chinese-language version of the Ethereum white paper in January 2015, six months ahead of the blockchain\u2019s mainnet launch on July 30.\n\nBut Ethereum almost didn\u2019t make it to that launch date. As detailed by Dr. Xiao Feng\u2014vice-chairman and executive director of China Wanxiang Holding Co, Ltd\u2014he first encountered Buterin over WeChat messages in December 2014. They hit it off well enough that they agreed to meet face-to-face in Shanghai in April 2015, during Buterin\u2019s three-month stay in the city.\n\nXiao said he and Buterin met \u201coften\u201d to discuss blockchain matters \u201cand of course, how Wanxiang could work together with Ethereum to promote the developments and applications of blockchain technology in China.\u201d\n\nButerin showed up for one of these meetings looking particularly haggard, which Xiao learned resulted from a \u201cnight-long meeting\u201d that centered on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s bare financial cupboard. Concerns were mounting that Ethereum\u2019s mainnet launch might not happen due to its developers\u2019 inability to fund their operations.\n\nRecognizing the \u201chuge pressure\u201d Buterin was under, Xiao said he had the idea that \u201cif we could actively fund the development of Ethereum at this critical moment, we would not only become a major participant in this revolutionary project, but we could also leverage this opportunity to guide and implement Wanxiang\u2019s blockchain strategic planning.\u201d\n\nXiao proposed donating US$500,000 to the Ethereum Foundation in the name of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs (WBL), a company that didn\u2019t exist then. The donation would actually be made by DataYes, a Wanxiang subsidiary founded in 2013 to provide data and investment management solutions for financial services entities.\n\nBut Xiao\u2019s generosity didn\u2019t stop there. He also pledged that Wanxiang \u201cwould continue to fund the foundation over the next year, so that the developers could focus on their work to help the Ethereum mainnet go live as scheduled.\u201d\n\nWhile Xiao\u2019s $500k \u2018donation\u2019 was later converted into over 416,000 ETH tokens\u2014currently worth nearly $700 million\u2014there\u2019s never been any public breakdown of what Xiao/Wanxiang received in exchange for their additional funding of the Foundation.\n\nThe ties that blind\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Buterin made an impression on Xiao. Buterin was named WBL\u2019s \u2018chief scientist\u2019 when the firm launched in the second half of 2015. A 2016 Facebook post cited Buterin as one of WBL\u2019s co-founders, along with Xiao and Bo Shen, co-founders of the Bitshares decentralized exchange.\n\nShen was instrumental in connecting Xiao and Buterin, with Buterin staying at Shen\u2019s Shanghai home for a month during Buterin\u2019s stay. Both Shen and Buterin were listed among the original general partners of Fenbushi Capital, a Wanxiang-funded, blockchain-focused venture capital group announced at the same time as Xiao\u2019s Foundation funding.\n\nButerin announced he was stepping down from an active role at Fenbushi in January 2018, although the fund\u2019s website continues to list him as serving in an advisory capacity. Shen remains at Fenbushi to this day.\n\nAnother blockchain-focused Wanxiang offshoot, Hashkey Capital, is run by former Wanxiang investment manager Deng Chao. Deng claims to have been the one who convinced Xiao to make that original $500,000 donation to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nHashkey has invested hundreds of millions in blockchain projects, with Deng singling out Ethereum as an area of particular interest. \u201cSince 2015 we\u2019ve been interacting a lot with the developer community, especially in the case of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the same year that WBL was launched, the first Wanxiang Global Blockchain Summit was held in Shanghai. To help kickstart the event, Xiao said, \u201cWanxiang worked closely with the Ethereum community to widely promote cutting-edge blockchain topics on a global scale.\u201d\n\nIn May 2016, Xiao and eight colleagues joined Buterin for a stateside \u2018blockchain expedition\u2019 that started in San Francisco. Later that year, Xiao convinced the Foundation to move its Ethereum Developers Conference to Shanghai by offering to sponsor the entire event, with the added bonus of revenue from ticket sales and other sponsorships going directly to the Foundation.\n\nSharing is caring\n\nThe X/Twitter personality known as TruthLabs claims to have identified close ties between digital wallets belonging to Wanxiang and those of Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation. While the legitimacy of these claims has been disputed, that\u2019s just one of Ethereum\u2019s inherent mysteries, resulting from the controversial premine that preceded its mainnet launch.\n\nA quick \ud83e\uddf5showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nAround 10% of the circulating ETH supply\u2014roughly 12 million tokens\u2014was allocated to Ethereum Foundation members and early project contributors. Buterin alone reportedly received 553,000 ETH through this \u2018friends and family\u2019 distribution.\n\nEthereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) proved equally problematic. Despite 60 million tokens up for grabs\u2014roughly half of today\u2019s total ETH supply\u2014the Foundation showed little interest in establishing any real guardrails to prevent individual buyers from carving off more than the stated cap of 12.5% of the pie.\n\nIn the end, all that was required to participate in this cattle call was an email address and a willingness to exchange BTC tokens for ETH. According to Nansen data, the result was that 100 of the 8,800 wallets that took part in the ICO held 40% of the available ETH. \u2018Decentralization\u2019 at its finest.\n\nIn April 2018, securitization lawyer Preston Byrne analyzed the ICO and found that the BTC \u201cflowed in with the mathematical precision of a power function, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for two weeks straight.\u201d This metronomic pattern led Byrne to conclude that the bulk of the tokens were likely sold \u201cto one person or, more likely, a handful of close associates working in concert.\u201d\n\nTruthLabs has claimed that Wanxiang was used as a conduit for members of the Chinese government to purchase large amounts of ETH via the ICO. If true, combined with Wanxiang\u2019s significant investments in Ethereum-based infrastructure projects, China would have a truly outsized influence over the blockchain\u2019s future.\n\nIts critical that I drive home two points: 1. CCP is $ETH's biggest whale, masked behind Wanxiang and others. 2. Wanxiang was perfectly positioned to wear the Mask.\n\nHQ'd in Chicago, tied in to Biden & Bush. Blockchain Partnerships with MIT, IBM, UBS, Microsoft, and more. \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023\n\nThat is all the more concerning given Ethereum\u2019s recent transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to one based on proof-of-stake. To serve as a \u2018validator\u2019 under the new regime, one must lock up a stake of 32 ETH worth around US$60,000, well out of the reach of most rank-and-file users.\n\nHowever, individuals, entities, and nation-states linked to Wanxiang could easily clear this hurdle. And with validators in charge of deciding which transactions make it into the next block on the chain, the opportunity for skullduggery becomes all too apparent.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ICO was quickly followed by a deluge of similar token sales. Enticed by the ease of creating new token projects on Ethereum, scammers preyed on the public\u2019s growing interest in 2017\u2019s artificially inflated digital asset price bubble.\n\nIronically, Wanxiang\u2019s Xiao spoke out against ICOs in early 2018, calling for a prohibition on trading tokens immediately after their initial public sale. For what it\u2019s worth, that opinion was expressed only after China formally prohibited ICOs as an illegal fundraising mechanism in late-2017.\n\nCan you premine copper?\n\nWanxiang is considered one of China\u2019s largest \u2018non-state-owned\u2019 conglomerates, although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has ensured it has a say in the operation of all domestic companies through the presence of so-called Party Committees on private firms\u2019 boards of directors. Over two-thirds of private companies now formally acknowledge the presence of Party Committees implementing \u201ccorporate governance with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\n\nWanxiang founder Lu Guanqiu was a delegate to the Chinese National People\u2019s Congress through the late 90s, after which he was promoted to full NPC deputy. Following his death in 2017, the CCP publicly lauded Lu for having \u201calways actively accomplished all that is advocated by Party committees and governments at all levels.\u201d The CCP expressed its confidence that \u201cpeople at Wanxiang\u201d\u2014 currently led by Lu\u2019s son Lu Weiding\u2014will \u201calways listen to the Party and follow the Party.\u201d\n\nFormed in 1969, Wanxiang Group originally made its name in auto parts, but its rapid rise led to a diversification into insurance, banking, asset management, and\u2014controversially\u2014importing minerals from North Korea.\n\nWanxiang reportedly enjoys an exclusive importation contract with North Korea\u2019s Hysean Youth Mine, a major source of copper. Wanxiang has also partnered with North Korea on the Hyejung Mining Joint Venture Co, entitling Wanxiang to all underground mineral resources\u2014including copper, tungsten, and molybdenum\u2014in Yanggaang Province.\n\nOther Chinese companies that have been caught importing minerals from North Korea\u2014including Hongxiang Industrial\u2014found themselves facing harsh U.S. economic sanctions. But Wanxiang somehow managed to dodge this bullet, despite sources claiming its dealings with the North Korean regime dwarf that of Hongxiang\u2019s.\n\nWanxiang\u2019s North Korean connections aren\u2019t so out of step with that of Ethereum, given the fact that Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u2018crypto\u2019 hackers used the blockchain\u2019s Tornado Cash coin mixer to wash their stolen tokens clean.\n\nDon\u2019t forget Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith\u2019s ill-fated trip to North Korea in defiance of U.S. government warnings that visiting Pyongyang to educate local officials on how to evade U.S. sanctions was a no-no. Griffith ultimately got 63 months in prison for that escapade.\n\nAnd yet, Buterin refused to see his comrade as guilty of anything, claiming that Griffith didn\u2019t give North Korea \u201cany kind of real help in doing anything bad.\u201d This raises all sorts of questions as to what else Buterin might be willing to let slide in the name of expanding Ethereum\u2019s reach and adoption.\n\nStealing fire and raising hell\n\nWanxiang\u2019s apparent \u2018get out of sanctions free card\u2019 recently came under fire following complaints by some members of Congress regarding the unfriendly stance the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted toward most blockchain projects\u2014with the notable exception of Prometheum Ember Capital LLC.\n\nPrometheum made headlines in May when the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved the company\u2019s application to serve as a special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD). While it had yet to actually commence its operations, Prometheum claimed to have developed a model under which all the digital assets it traded would be registered securities. This stood in stark contrast to the likes of SEC whipping boy Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), which claims to this day that none of the assets on its exchange are securities.\n\nThe anti-SEC faction in Congress\u2014primarily on the Republican side of the aisle\u2014raised holy hell when they learned that Prometheum had entered into a \u2018strategic partnership and joint development agreement\u2019 with Wanxiang in 2018. Prometheum later claimed that the joint development of blockchain trading software was halted in October 2021, but Wanxiang continues to hold a 20% stake in Prometheum.\n\nWanxiang\u2019s involvement and deceased founder Lu\u2019s ties to the CCP prompted a group of Republicans\u2014including House Financial Services Committee chairman Patrick McHenry\u2014to write letters demanding transparency from both FINRA and the SEC regarding the process that resulted in Prometheum\u2019s SPBD approval.\n\nIt probably didn\u2019t help that in early 2018, Wanxiang struck a \u2018strategic cooperation\u2019 pact with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to \u201cadvance scientific and technological research and development.\u201d This occurred almost simultaneously with Gensler becoming a blockchain-focused professor at MIT. For what it\u2019s worth, Gensler was already on record saying ETH was an unregistered security. Was Wanxiang hoping to change his mind?\n\nThe obligatory Hunter Biden reference\n\nEven before Prometheum got under Republicans\u2019 skin, Fox News questioned a July 2014 meeting at the White House with then-Vice President Joe Biden, Wanxiang America President Pin Ni, and Wanxiang Resources Co. president Youhong Han.\n\nThat meeting followed Wanxiang\u2019s February 2014 purchase of Fisker Automotive, a failing U.S. luxury electric vehicles manufacturer. The deal involved converting an abandoned manufacturing facility in Delaware, Biden\u2019s home state.\n\nBiden\u2019s controversial son Hunter purchased a Fisker vehicle in early 2014, but it proved a lemon. This seems to have come up for discussion during the White House meeting with the Wanxiang executives because a week later, Pin Ni emailed Hunter to say, \u201cIt would be our honor to get your Fisker fixed.\u201d Hunter replied that he\u2019d already sold the car back to the dealer, prompting Pin Ni to say he\u2019d \u201cmake sure your next Fisker will exceed the expectation.\u201d\n\nWhile Fox appears convinced that the Biden connection is the reason Wanxiang has never faced sanctions for its North Korean dealings, it\u2019s worth remembering that despite those North Korean mineral dealings surfacing just one month before Donald Trump was elected president, Der Donald also took no action against Wanxiang during his four years in office.\n\nThe middle blockchain kingdom\n\nEthereum\u2019s Chinese connection is by no means limited to Wanxiang. An archived version of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website shows a trio of individuals bearing the official designation of \u2018Chinese Partner.\u2019 (No other nation is afforded this perk.) Of these three partners\u2014Jerry Liu, Bin Lu, and Houwu Chen\u2014two appear to have worked at China\u2019s Alibaba Group. Lu was an Alibaba developer, while Liu\u2019s title was Senior Product Expert.\n\nWhile China has a notoriously antagonistic attitude towards all things \u2018crypto,\u2019 this summer saw the Hong Kong-based Bank of China International Holdings (BOCI)\u2014the global investment unit of the mainland\u2019s People\u2019s Bank of China\u2014issue RMB200 million worth of tokenized securities on Ethereum.\n\nTransacting via ETH on the mainland remains technically off-limits, but the BOCI\u2019s move was viewed as a means of boosting Hong Kong\u2019s growing embrace of digital assets. It may also signal a new favoritism for Ethereum by the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2014which formerly employed Wanxiang\u2019s Xiao in its Shenzhen Special Economic Zone branch.\n\nIn August, Wanxiang offshoot Hashkey became one of the first exchanges to receive a Hong Kong license, allowing retail investors to trade select digital assets. A member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council expressed the hope that this could lead to \u201cinterconnected\u201d virtual asset trading between Hong Kong and mainland China in the not-too-distant future.\n\nNightmare fuel: an Ethereum-based internet\n\nXiao has likened Ethereum to the Highlander of blockchains in that there can be only one. Last December, Xiao gave a speech at the 2022 Global Blockchain Summit in which he predicted: \u201ca scenario where a blockchain protocol stack will converge around the Ethereum network, like what happened with the Internet in the 20th century.\u201d\n\nXiao explained how the early internet consisted of disconnected protocols that eventually \u201cmerged into the TCP/IP protocol stack \u2026 The current multi-chain phenomenon of blockchain is similar to the era when Internet protocols had not yet been not \u2018unified.\u2019\u201d\n\nXiao declared that \u201camong all blockchain protocols, only Ethereum has the architecture of acting as that blockchain protocol stack from the base layer to layer-1s, layer-2s and even layer-3s \u2026 according to the Ethereum Foundation, within 10 years, transactions on the Ethereum network will be able to reach 10 million transactions per second.\u201d\n\nXiao predicted that all existing blockchain protocols would \u201cgradually be prompted and influenced by industry players to merge into a single unified protocol stack. Other public chains interconnected with Ethereum may act as side chains, or shards and partitions of the Ethereum network, as we strive to achieve an ideal world of interoperability and interconnectivity in the universe of blockchain.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Ethereum will be the only blockchain game in town, with other chains relegated to minor appendages of this unwieldy Rube Goldberg machine. However, if Xiao based his transaction forecasts on the habitually unrealized fantasies of the Ethereum Foundation, he\u2014and any nation-states that might be betting on a single horse in this race\u2014are bound to be disappointed.\n\nWhile Ethereum contents itself with imagining what might be possible in 2032, the BSV blockchain continues to set new transaction records in the here and now. BSV blockchain handled a record 128 million transactions in a single 24-hour period this month and did so on a sturdy base layer, requiring none of the rickety and proprietary on-/off-ramps without which Ethereum can\u2019t function.\n\nAnd despite Xiao\u2019s assertions, BSV blockchain remains the only blockchain with the scaling capacity to handle the dramatic increase in the number of transactions that a transition to Web3 will demand\u2014and do so on a cost-effective basis\u2014and will thus leave Ethereum in the dust.\n\nPerhaps crucially, the BSV blockchain also lacks Ethereum\u2019s apparent deference to a single country. Anyone who still hypes Ethereum\u2019s commitment to decentralization should wonder why that commitment doesn\u2019t seem to apply on a geopolitical basis.\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of group\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

The idea [is] that a darling of the last cycle would do very well. I shared this chart of the beginnings of ETH vs. SOL, and I still think SOL probably does more or less the same. The cheering got pretty loud for this one.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $21.28 at time of writing, up 3.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe analyst is also bullish on Phemex\u2019s yet-to-be-launched utility token for the crypto derivatives exchange platform. He points to the strong performances of other exchange tokens to support his thesis on the upcoming altcoin.\n\n\u201cThere is actually one token I am bullish on that is not even out yet but can be mined. Phemex has a token coming out this quarter and my thesis is simple: look at other exchange tokens.\u201d\n\nLastly, the analyst says he is bullish on crypto gambling platform Rollbit\u2019s native token RLB.\n\n\u201cYep, getting a lot of flack for my negative posts but [the] only things I am bullish on long term are Bitcoin and ETH, and the new projects yet to come to market.\n\nRollbit token is an exception.\u201d\n\nRollbit is trading for $0.19 at time of writing, up 7.8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "OnlyFans' Parent Company Faces Ethereum Losses After Investing $19M in 2022\n\nFenix International Limited Faces Ethereum Losses After Investing\n\nWhile 2022 proved to be a prosperous year for content creator platform OnlyFans, it wasn't necessarily the same for Ethereum, as highlighted in a recent financial statement.\n\nFenix International Limited, the parent firm of OnlyFans, said that it had owned Ethereum (ETH) worth more than $19 million throughout the year. But by the end of November 2022, this holding's value had fallen to almost $11.4 million, a considerable loss.\n\nThe corporation acknowledged its diversification into digital assets, primarily Ethereum, in a 48-page strategic statement. Despite the value impairment, the corporation insisted that it was still free to sell these crypto holdings.\n\nIn a notable move last year, OnlyFans introduced Ethereum-based NFTs for creators to use in their profile images. This initiative aimed to empower creators and mark the platform's initial exploration into the role of NFTs.\n\nDue to the overall decline in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum's value declined throughout the reporting period, but OnlyFans had a prosperous year in terms of revenue and growth. From $4.8 billion in 2021 to $5.6 billion in 2022, the platform's revenue increased dramatically. Additionally, there were 47% more creators on the platform, and there were 27% more subscribers overall.\n\nDespite the financial setback related to Ethereum, OnlyFans' overall performance underscores the ongoing evolution and potential of digital content creation platforms."

        "content": "BINANCE BUZZ: There\u2019s been a lot of news over the past week on the big U.S. crypto exchange \u2013 some of it good, some not so good, some neutral. The overarching theme is that the company expanded rapidly in recent years, and now it\u2019s facing intense scrutiny from regulators, having to retrench in some business lines and regions, while pivoting in others. Binance this week cut ties with five sanctioned Russian banks listed on the exchange\u2019s peer-to-peer service for transferring funds in rubles. The move came just days after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance was enabling peer-to-peer trades of rubles for digital tokens, frequently involving banks on Western blacklists \u2013 a popular method for Russians to transfer money abroad. Binance said it was discontinuing its crypto-backed debit card in Bahrain and Latin America, where it has been available for less than a year. According to Reuters, Mastercard decided to end the programs. Then on Tuesday, Binance announced it had launched a new crypto-based program Send Cash that will allow users in nine Latin American countries to transfer money directly into friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 bank accounts in Colombia and Argentina. In Belgium, Binance has been ordered to cease operations by the country\u2019s local regulator, but customers can continue using the exchange via a Polish entity. On the trading side, Binance announced that, starting Wednesday, it would offer \u201cT+3\u201d daily options contracts allowing traders to bet on the BNB token over a three-day period. The BNB token has been volatile this year, falling recently to a one-year low (get update on this). Market observers have long speculated that Binance might attempt to prop up the token\u2019s value by selling bitcoin (BTC), but exchange CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has said it wasn\u2019t the case. Binance and Zhao were sued by the SEC in June, accused of offering unregistered securities to the general public allowing for commingling of customer funds, along with other violations of securities laws. ByteTree, a research firm, wrote this week that Binance was \u201cin the crosshairs,\u201d adding that its share of global crypto exchange trading volume has slid to about 45%, from 64% six months earlier."

        "content": "10 August, Singapore: Ethereum Singapore 2023, which will bring together builders, developers, and communities to grow the thriving Ethereum ecosystem, is all set to raise its curtains on 10 September. The 3-day event is supported by community partners including the Ethereum Singapore Meetup Group, and sets the stage to spotlight Web3\u2019s potential for good with real use cases from local non-profit organizations. It is expected to draw over 2000 developers from around the world.\n\nThe theme of the event \u2018Infinite Garden City\u2019 reflects Singapore\u2019s identity as a city in a garden and mirrors the vision of Ethereum as an infinite garden for all that organically evolves with the support of people that nurture the space.\n\nIt aims to cultivate local impact in the non-profits and public goods space and seed the future of talents while showcasing how local communities can come together to create a vibrant tapestry of Singapore's Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSingapore has been the global poster child for efficiencies in transportation, infrastructure, and healthcare. We\u2019re excited to spotlight another side of Singapore which is its beating heart - our local communities. Ethereum Singapore 2023 will be an opportunity for the Ethereum community to come down and tackle problems while devising meaningful solutions in the non-profit space and show the world the possibilities to use tech for good,\u201d says Qing Ze Hum, Lead of Ethereum Singapore 2023.\n\n\u201cSince the first Ethereum conference that was hosted in 2015, the Singapore community has grown into an Asian powerhouse, attracting all kinds of new Dapps, innovation and funding interests, and talent into the country. Come 2023, we are very optimistic about what the next 5 years will bring with this developer-focused conference,\u201d says Shaun Djie, Founder of Ethereum Singapore Meetup Group. Founded in 2016, the community has grown to over 9,000 members with the goal to engage and expand the Ethereum ecosystem in Singapore.\n\nThe event will be split into thematic spaces including decentralized finance, infrastructure, security, layer 2s, builders, and students, each serving as a community hub while being a hotpot of incredible ideas and action. From beginner workshops on how to get started participating in the Ethereum ecosystem, to inspiring and technical talks on advanced topics such as privacy, scaling, and zero-knowledge technology, it will appeal to technology enthusiasts and businesses whichever growth stage they are in.\n\nAn open-source hackathon titled \u2018Hack for Good' will solve challenges outlined by local non-profit and social enterprises and consist of quadratic funding wherein participating organizations will vote for their favourite projects and pick winners. All of this will culminate into an open-source playbook that will be published globally to serve as an inspiration for people wanting to do this with their local communities too.\n\nTo register and receive Ethereum Singapore 2023 updates visit https://go.ethereumsingapore.com/cointelegraph-press.\n\nAbout Ethereum Singapore\n\nEthereum Singapore aims to spotlight and harness Web3 for good.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation just pulled the curtain back on its latest innovation: the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification, or EELS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEELS has been in the works for over a year and aims to replace the Yellow Paper as the go-to guide for Ethereum's inner workings. But unlike its predecessor, EELS is not stuck in the past. It is fully up-to-date with all the latest forks and offers a user-friendly approach that is geared toward programmers.\n\nWhat is EELS? It provides a complete snapshot of the Ethereum protocol at every fork, including the ones still on the drawing board. This is a big deal because, until now, Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have only ever suggested changes.\n\nThey have not given developers a full picture of how those changes fit into the existing framework. EELS solves this problem by offering a comprehensive, easy-to-follow guide that could become the new gold standard for Core EIPs.\n\nWhy users should care about EELS\n\nIf you are wondering why EELS is such a big deal, let us break it down for you: this is not just another update, it is a shift in how Ethereum will be developed moving forward. Imagine the process of building a house, where a blueprint is scattered across a dozen different documents. That is what Ethereum development has been like up until now. EELS changes all that by providing a single, unified blueprint that is both up-to-date and easy to read.\n\nEELS is set to become the main resource for Ethereum developers. It offers a clearer, more efficient roadmap for innovation and stands to make Ethereum more robust and transparent than ever. So, whether you are a developer, an investor or just a crypto enthusiast, keep your eyes on EELS. It is going places, and it is taking Ethereum with it."

        "content": "Arkham: Robinhood Wallet Identified as Major Holder of Ethereum Worth $2.54B and Bitcoin Worth $3.3B\n\nArkham Intelligence Has Identified Robinhood As A Large Holder Of Ethereum And Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrency data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence has identified Robinhood as a significant holder of both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), shedding light on the platform's expanding involvement in the crypto landscape.\n\nWhile Robinhood's ownership of the third-largest Bitcoin wallet drew previous attention, Arkham revealed that the company also possesses the fifth-largest Ethereum wallet, securing a substantial $2.54 billion worth of ETH.\n\nArkham clarified the rationale behind the sizable holding by emphasizing that the money in Robinhood's Ethereum wallet is being maintained in safekeeping for user balances. A wallet connected to Robinhood includes 122,076 BTC (equal to $3.3 billion), 34.1 trillion Shiba Inu tokens ($277.8 million), 4.9 million LINK tokens ($29.7 million), and 2.6 million AVAX tokens ($29.6 million), according to the on-chain analytics firm.\n\nDespite growing in the crypto space, Robinhood has had trouble maintaining high trading volumes. The company's cryptocurrency revenue fell in the second quarter from $38 million in the first quarter to $31 million. This modification in trading activity comes after the company recently added new functionality to its wallet product in response to user requests. Notably, custody services and support for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin swaps are now available in Robinhood's wallet.\n\nInitial versions of the Robinhood Wallet supported the Polygon and Ethereum networks and included tokens such as COMP, MATIC, SHIB, SOL, UNI and the USDC stablecoin."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is up 5% after breaking consolidation but could lose ground covered amid growing overhead pressure.\n\nEthereum price must hold above $1,630 support or risk falling back to consolidation with Grayscale victory effect fading.\n\nRipple price\u2019s tether to 200-day EMA at $0.5251, exposes XRP to the risk of a 7% dip.\n\nAfter prolonged consolidation, the market found impulse when Grayscale secured a victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices rallied, along with the broader market. It did not take long, however, before traders started cashing in on these gains to quench their profit appetite after a longstanding \"inactionable\" market characterized by shrinking volatility.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin traders exercise caution ahead of US Core PCE Price Index release\n\nBitcoin price readies for next move\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price sits on the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,175. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows falling momentum and BTC could head lower, potentially revisiting the immediate support at $25,999.\n\nIn a dire case, the slump could send Bitcoin price to the psychological $24,000 level, constituting a 10% drop from current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if sidelined bulls or late buyers come in, Bitcoin price could forge north, shattering the resistance confluence between the 50- and 100-day EMA that rejected the August 29 intra-day high of $28,142. A strong breach above this roadblock would clear the way for BTC to test the supply zone at around $29,170.\n\nIf the order block fails to hold as a resistance, the psychological $30,000 would be an area of interest, with robust seller momentum expected around the $30,385, an overlay between two supply zones where aggressive selling behavior is expected. For a confirmed uptrend, however, BTC must record a decisive daily candlestick close above $31,439.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF has a 75% chance of approval in 2023, analysts say\n\nEthereum price could lose the $1,630 support level\n\nEthereum (ETH) price rallied almost 7% following the Grayscale announcement, but like BTC, profit-taking is already underway. This is indicated by a falling RSI. If bears continue having their way, ETH could extend south after losing the $1,701 support level. The next support level at $1,630 could provide a subsequent entry point for bulls, but failure could see the proof-of-stake (PoS) token slide lower to find support around $1,552 potentially.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, Ethereum price could extend north if sidelined investors come in. The ensuing buying pressure will likely send ETH past the resistance confluence between the 200- and 50-day EMA at $1,774 and $1,776, respectively, before a confrontation with the 100-day EMA at $1,800.\n\nIn the highly bullish case, a foray past the psychological $2,000 is likely, with Ethereum price likely to tag the $2,008 resistance level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum is eyeing $1500 support with A-B-C drop\n\nRipple price tethered to 200-day EMA\n\nRipple (XRP) price must break its tether to the 200-day EMA at $0.5251 for the next move. The remittance token has been consolidating along this level since August 18. The RSI momentum indicator suggests the price could fall, possibly dipping into the demand zone between $0.5040 and $0.4600. A decisive daily candlestick close below the mean threshold at $0.4800 would increase the odds for a continued downtrend, potentially sending XRP down 10% to $0.4191.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a move north may see Ripple price breach the 100- and 50-day EMAs at $0.5646 and $0.5813, respectively. A sustained uptrend could see XRP confront the $0.6840 level, but in a highly bullish case, the move north could send the payments token to the August 19 highs around $0.8193.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price risks decline to $0.41, amidst developments in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit"

        "content": "Uniswap delegates have passed a preliminary vote to consider multichain deployment for Uniswap v2.\n\nLaunched three years ago, Uniswap v2 has only ever been deployed on Ethereum.\n\nUniswap Foundation says the proposal will protect users on other blockchains from unsafe forks.\n\nThe Uniswap community has passed a vote to expand the second version of its decentralised exchange, called Uniswap v2, on other blockchains apart from Ethereum that has been its home since its launch in May 2020.\n\nUniswap\u2019s plan for a multichain deployment strategy for Uniswap v2 is partly to protect users from unsafe forks \u2014 copycat versions of its protocol that have been deployed across different blockchains.\n\nThe vote, which began last week, is an off-chain temperature check poll \u2014 a preliminary vote used by decentralised autonomous organisations to gauge initial sentiment for a proposal within the community.\n\nIt ended on Wednesday with almost unanimous approval as 98% of votes cast by participants were in favour of the proposal.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nDespite passing almost unanimously, the proposal was criticised within the community.\n\n\u201cI feel this initiative comes too late, the optimal time would have been in 2021,\u201d said a DAO member with the pseudonym kfx, who warned the rollout may cause liquidity issues in the long run and hurt the rollout of the upcoming fourth version of the exchange.\n\nThose in support of the proposal say it is \u201cbetter late than never\u201d and that a multichain Uniswap v2 deployment will help capture market share from unsafe copycats.\n\nNOW READ: Uniswap Asia lured Chinese investors with parties, dancers, and an airdrop \u2014 it was all fake\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe proposal will move to an on-chain execution vote following this initial temperature check approval. This second vote could begin on September 1 unless delegates raise objections after this first vote. Uniswap v2 will be deployed on other blockchains if the second vote passes.\n\nUniswap v2 remains a popular automated market maker-style decentralised exchange and the proposal says users of other blockchains besides Ethereum will benefit from having a canonical version of the protocol.\n\nThe proposal says these benefits include full-range liquidity for token swaps and the fact that the Uniswap v2 smart contract is one of the most secure on Ethereum.\n\nThe hitch-free nature of this governance process is in contrast to the fiery debates that characterised the first few Uniswap v3 multichain deployment votes. Uniswap v3 is an upgrade of v2 launched in May 2021.\n\nEarly Uniswap v3 cross-chain deployment votes saw disagreements among delegates as venture capital investors tried to sway the outcome to their benefit.\n\nThe Uniswap proposal\n\nAs of July, Uniswap v2 has accumulated a total trading volume of $1.45 trillion since its launch in May 2020, according to data from a Dune dashboard. The upgraded v3 is not far behind with $972 billion.\n\nUniswap\u2019s multichain deployment strategy has only focused on its v3 DEX but focus appears to be shifting to the previous version.\n\nNOW READ: Uniswap\u2019s v4 gives devs powerful \u2018hooks\u2019 tool but there\u2019s a catch \u2014 more risk\n\nUniswap Foundation\u2019s governance lead Erin Koen inked the proposal, arguing that the lack of a multichain deployment for Uniswap v2 has allowed copycats to thrive on other blockchains.\n\nSome of these copycat forks contain modified codes that are unsafe for users and could lead to losses whereas Uniswap v2 is \u201camong the most battle-hardened contracts on Ethereum,\u201d the proposal stated.\n\nSeveral Uniswap forks with modified codes have been hacked in the past. Uranium Finance, a Uniswap fork deployed on the BNB Blockchain, was hacked for $50 million in April 2021.\n\nTo avoid future issues and hacks, the proposal calls for Uniswap v2 to be deployed on all chains that already have Uniswap v3.\n\nThe proposal stated that the combination of both versions of the Uniswap DEX will provide better execution for token swaps. It also added that Uniswap v2 will be able to draw liquidity from unsafe copycats.\n\n\u2018Better late than never\u2019\n\nKoen\u2019s proposal drew mostly favourable comments from community members who participated in the forum discussion stage of the governance process.\n\nThe only criticism came from DAO member kfx who said that deploying v2 on chains that already have Uniswap v3 will cause liquidity fragmentation \u2014 a problem that occurs when liquidity for trading is spread too thinly among different platforms.\n\nNOW READ: Uniswap taps Wormhole for bridge deal in win for Jump Trading and defeat for a16z\n\nRather than deploy Uniswap v2 on other blockchains, kfx instead recommended that the focus should be on the launch of Uniswap v4.\n\nThose who support the proposal, like crypto research company and Uniswap contributor GFX Labs, said the plan is \u201cbetter late than never.\u201d\n\nOthers also stated that the proposed move would stem the tide of fake copycats, especially on newer chains like Coinbase\u2019s Base.\n\nEarlier in August, Koen warned that there was a non-canonical version of Uniswap v3 on Base. This fake copycat modified part of the protocol\u2019s code to divert trading fees to the entity that deployed it on the Coinbase blockchain.\n\nUniswap Foundation advised DeFi developers and traders on Base to be wary of the non-canonical version.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

NFT means non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are generally created using the same type of programming used for cryptocurrencies. In simple terms these cryptographic assets are based on blockchain technology. They cannot be exchanged or traded equivalently like other cryptographic assets. Like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The term NFT clearly represents it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. Physical currency and cryptocurrency are fungible, which means that they can be traded or exchanged for one another.

Join us to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and cybersecurity expertise in a single transformative program.\n\n\n\nNFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. Key Features of NFT - Digital Asset - NFT is a digital asset that represents Internet collectibles like art, music, and games with an authentic certificate created by blockchain technology that underlies Cryptocurrency.\n\nUnique - It cannot be forged or otherwise manipulated.\n\nExchange - NFT exchanges take place with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on specialist sites. Cryptopunks is a notable example of an NFT. It enables you to buy, sell and store 10,000 collectibles with proof-of-ownership.\n\nHistory of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) As sometimes happens with innovative technology, NFTs did not just come out of the blue and become popular overnight. It leads to the question of when the first NFT came into existence. According to some, Colored Coins, which was initiated in 2012, has the honor of being the first NFT. In the words of investor Andrew Steinworld, he said that one might argue that the Colored Coins were the NFT that first came into existence. Colored Coins exhibited a major leap in the capabilities of Bitcoin, however, they had a downside too. They could represent only some values if their worth is agreed upon by everyone. The scripting language of Bitcoin did not enable this type of behavior within the network it is in. Some argue that \u201cQuantum\u201d NFT by Kevin McCoy minted on the Namecoin Blockchain on 2nd May 2014 is the first rightful owner of an NFT title. A project called \u201cCryptoKitties\u201d by Dapper Labs on Ethereum was the implementation of NFTs widely recognized as the first of its kind. When the 2017 crypto boom happened, those digital cats were priced at 600 Eth (or USD 172k) and mainstream attention was drawn globally. Since then, ample NFT projects have come up with a huge amount of success. What is Blockchain? Blockchain refers to a method of documenting data that ensures its security and integrity. This makes it impossible or difficult to modify, cheat or hack the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital documentation of transactions that is disseminated and replicated across a network or computer systems that uses blockchain technology Blockchain and Fungibility These are two concepts that can be related closely but also can pose some difficulties when combined. Fungibility pertains to a commodity or asset\u2019s ability to be exchanged easily for another similar unit without any difference in quality or value. Blockchain technology, however, creates a transparent and immutable record of transactions and ownership. For instance, if a certain cryptocurrency is involved in an unlawful activity, it may be told to be non-fungible or tainted, which means that it cannot be used interchangeably with other units of the same cryptocurrency. This leads to a loss of liquidity or value for the asset that is affected. However, a lot of solutions are currently being developed, like mixing privacy or services-focused cryptocurrency, to address this problem and to ensure fungibility while preserving the security and fungibility of blockchain technology. How Does NFT Work? Now that you've taken your initial steps in understanding what an NFT is, you should continue on and learn about how an NFT works. The majority of NFTs reside on the Ethereum cryptocurrency's blockchain, a distributed public ledger that records transactions.\n\nNFTs are individual tokens with valuable information stored in them.\n\nBecause they hold a value primarily set by the market and demand, they can be bought and sold just like other physical types of art.\n\nNFTs' unique data makes it easy to verify and validate their ownership and the transfer of tokens between owners.\n\nExamples of NFT The NFT world is relatively new to people. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today: A Digital Collectible\n\nDomain Names\n\nGames\n\nEssays\n\nSneakers in fashion line\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program What is NFT Used For? People interested in Crypto-trading and people who like to collect artwork often use NFTs. Other than that, it has some other uses too like: Digital Content - The most significant use of NFTs today is in digital content. Content creators see their profits enhanced by NFTs, as they power a creator economy where creators have the ownership of their content over to the platforms they use to publicize it. Gaming Items - NFTs have garnered considerable interest from game developers. NFTs can provide a lot of benefits to the players. Normally, in an online game, you can buy items for your character, but that\u2019s as far as it goes. With NFTs, you can recoup your money by selling the items once you\u2019re finished with them. Investment and Collaterals - Both NFT and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) share the same infrastructure. DeFi applications let you borrow money by using collateral. NFT and DeFi both work together to explore using NFTs as collateral instead. Domain Names - NFTs provide your domain with an easier-to-remember name. This works like a website domain name, making its IP address more memorable and valuable, usually based on length and relevance. Even celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Shawn Mendes, and Jack Dorsey are taking an interest in the NFT by releasing unique memories and artwork and selling them as securitized NFTs. NBA Top Shot Is a Hot NFT Use Case One of the most popular non-fungible tokens in recent days is NBA Top Shot, a partnership between Dapper Labs (makers of the CryptoKitties game) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). The NBA licenses individual highlight video reels, among other content, to Dapper Labs, and they digitize the footage and make it available for sale to consumers. Each reel shows a video clip, such as a famous player's basketball dunk, some featuring different angles and digital artwork to make them unique. Even if someone made a perfect copy of the video, it can be instantly recognizable as a counterfeit. The venture has already generated $230 million in sales, and the company just also received $305 million in funding from a group that includes Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant. These video reels are selling at high prices. Among the most popular: LeBron James \u201cCosmic\u201d Dunk: $208,000\n\nZion Williamson \u201cHolo MMXX\u201d Block: $100,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cFrom the Top\u201d Block: $100,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cThrowdowns\u201d Dunk: $100,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cHolo MMXX\u201d Dunk: $99,999\n\nSteph Curry \u201cDeck the Hoops\u201d Handles: $85,000\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo \u201cHolo MMXX\u201d Dunk: $85,000\n\nLeBron James \u201cFrom the Top\u201d Dunk: $80,000 These unique NBA moments are minted and released into the marketplace via \u201cpack drops.\u201d The most common sell for only nine dollars, but more exclusive packs can sell for much more. Now that you\u2019ve understood what is NFT used for, and the various ways you can benefit from it, let\u2019s take a look at how it is specifically different from other forms on cryptocurrency. NFTs vs. Crypto and Fiat currencies. What's the Difference? NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are a kind of cryptocurrency that represents a one-of-a-kind digital asset or unique piece of artwork. Fiat and cryptocurrencies are mainly used for transactional purposes and are fungible, which means each unit can be interchanged. Being created on blockchain technology, NFTs allow the transfer of ownership and transparent ownership. They allow artists to monetize their creations made digitally and thus have gained huge popularity. Crypto and fiat currencies, on the other hand, are used mainly as a store of value or medium of exchange. While there are certain similarities, the unique features of NFTs make them different from traditional currencies. What is an NFT Marketplace? It is a marketplace that is a public Blockchain platform. Though it is in its early stages, this marketplace is gaining popularity and inspiring businesses and developers to construct a marketplace. Benefits of Non-Fungible Tokens There are several advantages of NFTs, some of these include: NFTs can be invested in by anyone as it is accessible to all and sundry. An NFT can be more efficiently and easily transferred among people around the globe.\n\nA blockchain secures NFT ownership. The digital signature of ownership can make the ownership of an investor quite secure. The ownership also gets transparent due to the blockchain technology.\n\nNFTs provide the scope for learning more about blockchain technology. The investors can do so while making their portfolios diverse and allocating a small amount of tokenized assets.\n\nWhy Are NFTs Becoming Popular? NFTs have actually been around since 2015, but they are now experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to several factors. First, and perhaps most obviously, is the normalization and excitement of cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain frameworks. Beyond the technology itself is the combination of fandom, the economics of royalties, and the laws of scarcity. Consumers all want to get in on the opportunity to own unique digital content and potentially hold them as a type of investment. When someone buys a non-fungible token, they gain ownership of the content, but it can still make its way over the Internet. In this way, an NFT can gain popularity \u2014 the more it\u2019s seen online, the more value it develops. When the asset is sold, the original creator gets a 10 percent cut, with the platform getting a small percentage and the current owner getting the rest of that revenue. Thus, there is potential for ongoing revenue from popular digital assets as they are bought and sold over time. Authenticity is the name of the game with NFTs. Digital collectibles contain distinguishing information that make them distinct from any other NFT and easily verifiable, thanks to the blockchain. Creating and circulating fake collectibles doesn\u2019t work because each item can be traced back to the original creator or issuer. And, unlike cryptocurrencies, they can\u2019t be directly exchanged with one another (like baseball cards in real life) because no two are the same. Are NFTs Mainstream Now? So, with all the fuss made over NFTs, is it accurate to say that they\u2019re now mainstream? This article makes a strong case for believing that NFTs are now baked into the public consciousness. It doesn\u2019t hurt that a number of high-profile celebrities have ventured into NFT waters. While perhaps it may be premature to say \u201cYes, NFTs are definitely mainstream now,\u201d if they continue on this trajectory, 2022 could be the year where we know that NFTs are here to stay. What\u2019s Worth Picking Up at the NFT Supermarket? One can consider a variety of unique digital assets based on personal preferences and interests at the NFT supermarket. Digital art is a popular category that includes unique pieces made by upcoming and well-known creators. Collectibles can be picked up too. These range from one-of-a-kind in-game items to virtual trading cards. Recent times have also seen sports-related NFTs like game highlights or limited edition player cards gain popularity. One can also explore virtual gaming and real estate assets that allow the buyers to trade and own game items or digital land. It is of utmost importance to conduct research on the value and authenticity of an NFT before purchasing it. This is due to the fact that the market is still evolving and is subject to volatility. Properties of NFT NFTs cannot be divided into smaller parts while retaining their inherent qualities. This distinguishes them from fungible tokens like a pound note, which can be subdivided into pence.\n\nWhen an entity mints NFT, it can sell to a new entity that can become the owner of that NFT. But, depending on a specific set of circumstances, smart contract rules may be utilized to restrict or stop further token transfers.\n\nThough an NFT has specific properties when it is created, those properties can be updated over time through smart contracts when certain conditions are met; this is akin to a \u2018pass the parcel\u2019 game where a parcel loses a layer of wrapping every time the music pauses. Applications of NFT NFTs applications can be found in several industries, such as gaming, art, sports and music. The creators of the art world are enabled to monetize their art created digitally and provide a unique record of ownership for collectors that is verifiable. In the same way, NFTs can be used to trade and create virtual assets in the gaming industry, including virtual real estate and in-game items. NFTs can be beneficial to the music industry by creating one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, while in sports, they can offer fan experiences and limited-edition memorabilia. Besides these, NFTs can also be used to verify and authenticate the ownership of physical assets like real estate and luxury goods.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program How is an NFT Different From Other Cryptocurrencies? Although NFTs are created using the same kind of programming language as other cryptocurrencies, that's where the similarity ends. Other Cryptocurrency NFT\n\nCryptocurrencies are \u201cfungible\u201d; they can be traded or exchanged for one another. They\u2019re also equal in value.\n\n\n\nFor example, one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin, or one Dollar is always equal to one Dollar.\n\nEach NFT acts as a digital signature that makes it impossible for them to be exchanged for or equal to one another.\n\nFor example, The Last Supper is a painting of a kind and cannot be exchanged with another painting.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Which One is Better? Ethereum and NFTs Ethereum blockchain makes it possible for NFTs to work for several reasons: Trading NFTs, without needing peer-to-peer platforms, can take significant cuts as compensation.\n\nAll Ethereum products share the same \"backend\", making NFTs portable to buy on one product and sell it on another effortlessly.\n\nOnce a transaction is confirmed, it's impossible to manipulate the data to forge the ownership.\n\nEthereum never goes down, which means your tokens will always be available to sell.\n\nPenguin Communities Pudgy Penguin is a popular non-fungible token community, a cryptocurrency subcategory representing ownership in a unique asset: 8,888 penguins on the Ethereum blockchain, organized into one collection. Pudgy Penguin is just one of many communities out there that offer benefits and other advantages to members, such as having a membership on a shared Discord server or gaining access to a private Telegram channel that lets you talk with other owners. Many NFT projects have their own communities, where members can collaborate, share ideas, and support or buy each other\u2019s projects or art. How to Buy NFTs? Having understood what NFTs are used for and its specific advantages over other cryptocurrencies, you might want to venture into buying NFTs. If so, you will need to acquire some essential items before you do it: You\u2019ll need a digital wallet that allows you to store your NFTs and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThen you need to purchase some cryptocurrency depending on what currencies your NFT provider accepts, most likely Ether. You can use platforms like OpenSea, Coinbase, Kraken, PayPal, etc., to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made your cryptocurrency purchase, you can move it from the exchange to your wallet. Bear in mind, that many exchanges charge a small percentage of your crypto purchase transaction as fees.\n\nPopular NFT Marketplaces Once you\u2019ve got your wallet ready, all you need to do is to buy NFT. Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are: Rarible - Rarible is a democratic marketplace that allows artists and creators to issue and sell NFTs. It enables holders to weigh in on features like fees and community rules. OpenSea - To get started, all you need to do is create an account on the official website of OpenSea and browse NFT collections and discover new artists. This platform is famously known as a vast collection of rare digital items and collectibles. Foundation - On this platform, artists need to receive from or send an invitation from fellow creators to post their art. This community\u2019s exclusivity boasts higher-caliber artwork, assuming the demand for NFTs remains at current levels or even increases over time. NFT Use Cases Popular NFT use cases include Event ticketing\n\nGaming\n\nSupply chain\n\nArt and collectibles\n\nWeb3 identification\n\nMusic\n\nVirtual real estate\n\nFood and drink\n\nDecentralized finance loans\n\nFashion NFT Scams With the growing popularity of NFTs the potential for fraud and scams is also growing. Scammers use various methods to cheat buyers. These include using false information to sell NFTs, making fake NFTs and conducting auctions without any intention of delivering the NFTs. These scams can make buyers lose a lot of money. Creating fake NFTs or \u201cmimic NFTs\u201d is one of the most common scams. In this, a digital file similar to NFT is created, but it has no ownership or value and is then sold for a large amount of money. Scammers also use false information, such as fake reviews or celebrity endorsements to create a false sense of value and authenticity. Another scam involves scammers conducting auctions without delivering the NFTs. To safeguard themselves, buyers should research the authenticity of the NFT and the seller and buy only from reputed sellers and marketplaces. How are NFTs Reinventing the Digital World? NFTs are transforming the digital world by providing a way to verify ownership and authenticate digital assets by forging new pathways for investors, creators and collectors. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent anything from music to digital art to in-game items and virtual real estate. One of the most important advantages of the NFTs is that the digital creators get to monetize their work which was difficult to do before. NFTs provide a way of creating verifiable ownership and scarcity, making digital art and other digital assets more collectible and valuable. Moreover, NFTs can potentially transform the gaming market by making a new market for virtual assets. Players can now sell, trade and buy virtual items with ownership that is verifiable. This enables new economic systems within games and new forms of gameplay. Furthermore, NFTs can create new opportunities in the music industry by enabling artists to monetize their work apart from traditional channels. NFTs can represent concert tickets, unique digital collectibles and even ownership rights of songs. NFTs are transforming the digital world by offering new methods of monetizing and authenticating digital assets. They can create new markets and opportunities across multiple industries by making them fast-evolving technology.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program How Does the Future of NFT Look Like? NFT has enhanced media exposure and special perks for aspiring artists on social media. Recently, Jack Dorsey, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter, with his very first and famous tweet, \"just setting up my twttr,\" and Vignesh Sundaresan, famously known as \"Metakovan,\" bought 69.3 million dollars worth of NFT art on Beeple. Owing to its increasing popularity, people are now willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for NFTs. Like David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain, many experts in the crypto industry say that around 40% of new crypto users will use NFTs as their entry point. As a result of its growing popularity, NFT could represent a more significant part of the digital economy in the future."

        "content": "The crypto industry is not so new anymore. Hundreds of millions of users have decided to start investing in at least 1 cryptocurrency, and the profits surely are not too late to the party.\n\nIf you consider the market fluctuations and you have basic crypto knowledge, you can build an investment plan that will bring you some earnings in the near future.\n\nBut how can you earn your first crypto, based on which you will earn more? Is buying the only way, or are there more things to discover?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cyes, of course there is more\u201d. And in this article, we will talk about another truly intriguing way to earn crypto without investing: Ethereum faucets.\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum Faucet?\n\nAn Ethereum faucet is an online platform that function like a reward system for the platform\u2019s users. Usually, Ethereum faucets are programmed to share small amounts of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy do you get rewarded?\n\nYou don\u2019t just earn crypto rewards by accessing an Ethereum faucet. However, the ETH rewards keep on coming while you perform various tasks the platform requires you to. Usually, you might be required to watch some videos, click on ads, complete CAPTCHAs or surveys, or even play short and engaging games.\n\nEthereum faucets usually reward users with small amounts of ETH, but being consistent might help you earn more with every completed task. For instance, some platforms might have daily rewards ranging from 0.01 ETH to 0.1 ETH, also depending on how many tasks you complete.\n\nEthereum faucets are a great option especially for those who are just starting their journey in the crypto industry. Considering that you do not have to invest in order to earn crypto, you will not have too much to lose if the rewards you win drop in value afterward. And if the value increases, you will just end up with a surprising reward that you can use in various ways, such as staking, trading, lending, or just holding.\n\nOther Types of Faucets\n\nThere is one more pretty popular type of faucets, called testnet faucets. They basically have the same goal \u2013 offering free tokens to specific users.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that a testnet faucet rewards developers who need free testnet funds to test various transactions on a platform they build. Some of the most popular Ethereum testnet faucets include Sepolia Testnet and Goerli Testnet.\n\nTestnet faucets do not work with real coins or tokens. Instead, they offer users some testnet funds that have no value and cannot be traded. The main purpose of such funds is to help developers test projects\u2019 features. For instance, a developer that works on a platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain will be able to access such a faucet and get some free testnet ETH to test how a type of transaction works on the platform.\n\nHow Do Ethereum Faucets Work?\n\nEarning crypto while completing simple tasks can be pretty fun. But where do Ethereum faucets get the crypto for rewards from?\n\nUsually, crypto faucets receive funds from sponsors and advertisers who are looking for various places where they can promote their projects, products, or services. The crypto faucet platform gathers the funds from such projects and distribute them to faucet users.\n\nMore advanced Ethereum faucets use smart contracts to automate the reward distribution. Smart contracts are self-executing parts of code that once introduced in a project, will not require further human verification.\n\nHow to Use an Ethereum Faucet?\n\nConsidering that they are recommended for newcomers, Ethereum faucets are not that hard to use. But let\u2019s take the process step by step:\n\nSet up a crypto wallet \u2013 There are plenty of crypto wallets available on the market, but some of them still are the most popular and widely-used. When choosing a wallet to use for your digital assets, look for one that supports the cryptocurrencies you aim to buy, earn, or trade. If not, you will be required to have multiple wallets;\n\nCreate an account \u2013 Once you have a wallet, you should find a profitable Ethereum faucet. There, you can sign up to start earning ETH;\n\nComplete tasks \u2013 After you set up your Ethereum faucet account, you can start completing different tasks in order to win small crypto rewards;\n\nWithdraw your rewards \u2013 Once you complete a specific number of tasks, you may end up with a more significant amount of ETH in your faucet account. However, keep in mind that the withdrawal limit differs from one platform to another, and to be able to withdraw your rewards, you might have to complete a remarkable number of tasks.\n\nEthereum Faucets \u2013 Pros and Cons\n\nPros of Ethereum Faucets\n\nYou can earn free crypto with little to no effort.\n\nEthereum faucets do not limit users. You can earn as much as you want on the same platform.\n\nYou can also learn new things on Ethereum faucets. This will help you have a better view of the whole industry when you have enough crypto to start trading.\n\nYou can help many newly launched crypto projects increase their popularity.\n\nCons of Ethereum Faucets\n\nEarning significant amounts of ETH may take pretty much time.\n\nYou have to choose the Ethereum faucet wisely, as there also are fraudulent platforms that can affect you and leave you with no rewards whatsoever.\n\nYou are required to complete pretty repetitive tasks.

You can imagine buying Bitcoin at $1 before its meteoric rise as the project gears to launch at $10, offering a 560% ROI.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Network?\n\nThe Ethereum Network is a decentralized platform that lets people create smart contracts and dApps. It serves as a foundation for multiple innovative applications and decentralized solutions, contributing significantly to the growth of the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIt started in 2015, thanks to Vitalik Buterin, who envisioned blockchain technology beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin. The network is like a global computer comprising many computers (nodes) that confirm transactions. Ethereum has its currency, Ether (ETH) used for transactions and smart contracts. A notable ETH feature is smart contracts following set rules and can work by themselves when trigger conditions are met. ETH network harbors DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs, where code and contracts govern organizations instead of people.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nThe Ethereum network is always improving, recently moving full-scale to PoS from PoW for better scalability, energy efficiency, and security. Bitcoin Spark price prediction foresees an Ethereum future that holds several exciting developments and challenges as the network evolves and adapts to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and decentralized technologies.\n\nBeyond Ethereum 2.0, the Ethereum Foundation and the community are likely to continue researching and developing new technologies to further enhance the network\u2019s capabilities, including improvements in privacy, security, and user experience. As the Ethereum ecosystem grows, regulation, governance, and compliance issues become more important. The Ethereum community will need to navigate these challenges while continuing to innovate and collaborate.\n\nBased on on-chain data, Bitcoin Spark price prediction notes an inherent risk for ETH price falling below $1,500, with other analysts forecasting it could be worse and might fall below $1,000 if it fails to maintain its $1,500 support. A 600 ETH worth $1M+ transfer by Vitalik Buterin to Coinbase corroborates this fact, as analysts believe he was cashing out in anticipation.\n\nFurther reading on Bitcoin Spark (BTCS):\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Lido 101: A complete guide to Ethereum's liquid staking solution - OKX",
        "content": "Have you ever wanted to earn staking rewards without the constraints of locking up your assets? If so, Lido might be the answer. It's emerging as the go-to liquid staking solution, witnessing a rise in adoption with over $14 billion in staked tokens by August 2023.\n\nLido's approach aims to democratize rewards for even modest deposits and provides unparalleled utility without the traditional constraints of asset lock-ups.\n\nIn this article, we'll take a deep dive into Lido's ecosystem, Lido DAO, and Lido staked tokens, while also exploring liquid staking.\n\nWhat is Lido?\n\nLido is an Ethereum-centric platform designed to transform how we approach staking. Unlike the traditional staking method where assets are locked in and might remain dormant, Lido provides a dynamic avenue where staked assets stay active.\n\nWhen users stake their ETH on Lido, they receive 'stETH' tokens, which represent their staked assets on a 1:1 basis. This mechanism makes sure assets aren't just sitting idle; they're actively participating in the ecosystem, accruing value, and contributing to network security.\n\nWhat is liquid staking?\n\nTraditional staking, especially in Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, usually requires committing tokens for a set period, effectively immobilizing them in return for fixed rewards. While this model provides stability, it restricts the liquidity and utility of the staked assets. Liquid staking, as championed by Lido, challenges this norm.\n\nInstead of constraining assets, it transforms them into fungible tokens (like stETH), which can be traded, used as collateral, or engaged in various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This fluidity amplifies the utility of staked assets, allowing holders to gain staking rewards while leveraging them for other rewarding opportunities.\n\nLido's innovative approach hasn't gone unnoticed. Leading blockchain staking providers, especially from platforms like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, have supported Lido. Such endorsements point to Lido's potential in redefining staking tactics and its pivotal role in enhancing the broader PoS landscape.\n\nHow do double-dipped yields work?\n\nIt may sound like a tempting dessert, but double-dipped yields offer something even sweeter; they can simultaneously earn staking rewards while tapping into other lucrative DeFi opportunities.\n\nLido offers the ability for users to earn staking rewards without locking away their assets in a static state. It provides a unique blend of asset growth through staking rewards and fluidity, ensuring assets aren't idly lying dormant but are actively engaged in DeFi activities. How's that possible? Through a new class of tokens known as stTokens.\n\nThese aren't your ordinary tokens. They represent staked assets on Lido, acting as a liquid proxy for the underlying asset. stETH serves as a liquid stand-in for Ethereum (ETH) staked on Lido, bLUNA is staked (Luna) tokens, and stSOL is staked Solana (SOL) on Lido.\n\nThe DeFi advantage of stTokens\n\nThe DeFi ecosystem thrives on liquidity and versatility, and stTokens are custom-built for this environment. Here\u2019s why they stand out:\n\nLiquidity: While your underlying assets are staked and securing their respective networks, the stTokens (like stETH, bLUNA, or stSOL) can be freely traded or used in various DeFi protocols.\n\nInteroperability: Many DeFi platforms recognize stTokens. This means you can use them as collateral, engage them in yield farming, or leverage them in other financial strategies.\n\nContinuous rewards: Holding onto stTokens doesn\u2019t halt your staking rewards. The value of these tokens increases over time, reflecting the staking rewards you earn from the underlying assets.\n\nWhat are the staked Lido tokens, stETH, bLUNA, and stSOL?\n\nstETH (Lido staked Ether)\n\nAsset represented: Ethereum (ETH)\n\nPlatform: Lido\n\nFunction: For every Ethereum token staked through Lido, users receive an equivalent amount of stETH. This token is a dynamic representation of the staked ETH, reflecting its value and accumulated rewards over time. With stETH, users can participate in the DeFi ecosystem without withdrawing or un-staking their original Ethereum assets.\n\nbLUNA (bonded Luna)\n\nAsset represented: Luna\n\nPlatform: Terra\n\nFunction: bLUNA is a liquid representation of staked Luna tokens. When Luna is staked, users receive bLUNA, which can then be used within the Terra ecosystem and other DeFi platforms. It allows users to gain staking rewards and simultaneously use bLUNA for various financial strategies.\n\nstSOL (Lido staked Solana)\n\nAsset represented: Solana (SOL)\n\nPlatform: Lido\n\nFunction: Similar to stETH, holders are rewarded with an equivalent amount of stSOL for every Solana token staked on Lido. This token captures the essence of the staked SOL, granting users liquidity and enabling active participation in the DeFi sphere without un-staking their Solana assets.\n\nBalances and the role of oracles in Lido\n\nThe balance of staked tokens, such as stETH, isn't static. As users earn staking rewards, these balances need periodic updating to reflect the accrued rewards.\n\nThis is where oracles come into play. Oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information. In the context of Lido, oracles monitor the rewards generated by staked assets and relay this data back to the platform.\n\nLido then uses this information to adjust the balances of staked tokens in users' wallets. Oracles are the bridge between the blockchain and the real-world data of staking rewards, ensuring users see accurate, up-to-date balances for their staked assets.\n\nWhat is the Lido DAO (LDO) token?\n\nLido DAO, or the Lido Decentralized Autonomous Organization, oversees a liquid staking service built for the Ethereum ecosystem. This service allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) tokens transparently, without the need for custody, reinforcing the stability of the broader Ethereum landscape.\n\nWhy a DAO?\n\nThe dynamic nature of Ethereum requires a flexible system. In its quest to stay ahead of Ethereum's evolving ecosystem, Lido finds its most optimal structure in a DAO. This structure helps to keep Lido agile, making necessary adjustments in response to any changes in Ethereum's protocol.\n\nLido, being a DAO, also benefits from the transparent management of accumulated fees. These funds cater to developmental and insurance costs, making sure allocations align with the community's best interests.\n\nKey roles of Lido DAO\n\nInitialization of Lido: This involves the deployment of protocol smart contracts, defining fees and other protocol metrics, and facilitating the secure and efficient creation of staking rewards.\n\nAdaptation: The Lido DAO is responsible for seamlessly adapting Lido's mechanism in alignment with Ethereum 2.0 updates. This includes the transparent management of funds and revising staking services as needed.\n\nStakeholder involvement: Through the Lido DAO, decisions regarding incentives for contributors, the allocation of node operators, and the monitoring of voting parameters are streamlined, all with the goal of optimal staking services.\n\nThe Lido DAO continually engages in active voting, assessing parameters like node operator additions and their corresponding validator numbers. These decisions can be observed in real time, underscoring the transparency that defines Lido.\n\nIntroducing the LDO token\n\nLido's mission with its DAO is to democratize decision-making, aiming for a trustless staking service that emphasizes community-driven growth and sustainability. The LDO token is central to this mission, fostering decentralized ownership and facilitating a governance structure where every voice counts.\n\nOwning LDO tokens is akin to sitting at Lido's decision-making table. LDO holders can vote on any of the subjects affecting Lido.\n\nThe LDO holder's vote is directly proportional to their LDO holdings. Those with more LDO tokens possess a more influential voice in the voting process. The LDO voting mechanism can be enhanced and modified, just like other facets of the DAO.\n\nHow does Lido compare with other staking solutions?\n\nHere's how Lido compares to other staking solutions. While exploring other platforms, it's important to do your due diligence before you decide which platform to stake on.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nLike Lido, Rocket Pool also offers its own token, rETH, representing the amount of ETH staked in the system. It also serves as a source of staking rewards. Rocket Pool offers:\n\nPros\n\nDecentralized staking: A decentralized approach for ETH 2.0 staking.\n\nNode operator network: Uses a network of individual node operators.\n\nOpen-sourced smart contracts: Uses audited, open-sourced contracts to enhance security.\n\nCons\n\nRisk: Users entrust their Ethereum to Rocket Pool's validators, risking potential loss if those validators act maliciously.\n\nCentralization concerns: Despite its decentralized claim, Rocket Pool relies heavily on a limited number of validators, leading to potential centralization if few validators control a significant stake.\n\nHigh fees: There are reports from users that fees can go as high as 20% on rewards.\n\nStakeWise\n\nStakeWise is a staking service provider for Ethereum, offering pooled and solo staking options. With a non-custodial system, it gives users control over their Ethereum. When users stake with StakeWise, they receive sETH2 tokens, which can be used across the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem.\n\nPros\n\nsETH2 tokens: Users receive these tokens upon staking, and they're usable across the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\n\nNon-custodial system: Users retain Ethereum control without relying on a third party.\n\nSolo staking option: For those holding 32 ETH or more, solo staking allows staking without running one's own node. It's beneficial for non-technical users with enough ETH.\n\nCons\n\nRisk of counterparty involvement: There's potential exposure to counterparty risks.\n\nFee structure: The platform charges higher fees than some alternatives.\n\nFrax Ether\n\nFrax Ether launched in 2022, and its appealing functionalities have quickly won over crypto natives. The platform operates within its own Frax ecosystem to enhance yield and streamline the staking experience.\n\nPros\n\nCommunity control: Operates in a decentralized manner, driven by the Frax holder community.\n\nStability: Being a stablecoin, Frax provides an avenue for those wishing to sidestep market volatility.\n\nEfficiency and popularity: It has streamlined the liquid staking system and rapidly gained substantial traction.\n\nCons\n\nMarket adoption: Frax Ether faces challenges in market risk and mainstream adoption.\n\nUser friendliness: Its interface can be complicated for those new to staking.\n\nFor Ethereum staking service providers, Lido stands out for its simplicity, safety, and efficiency. Its significant liquidity provides flexibility within the DeFi ecosystem, distinguishing it as a noteworthy choice for those interested in ETH staking. However, its fees are relatively high compared to some other platforms.\n\nThe final word\n\nLido's pioneering take on liquid staking means assets are no longer tied down but actively flourishing within the broader DeFi landscape. By introducing stETH and other stTokens, Lido replicates the staked assets and keeps them agile, allowing users to integrate with various DeFi protocols seamlessly.\n\nLido isn't just a theoretical endeavor; it's secured the backing of major staking providers across platforms like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. This widespread acknowledgement showcases Lido's transformative potential for staking methods, suggesting its foundational role in sculpting the PoS universe's future.\n\nWhile traditional staking offers security, Lido bridges the gap between stability and liquidity. The dual advantage of earning staking rewards while diving into other DeFi prospects makes Lido a significant contender in redefining staking's ethos. Lido's approach could set the standard, demonstrating that assets can be secure and versatile in an ever-evolving decentralized finance landscape.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "title": "GBTC Victory Opens Door for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum ETFs - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin price popped sharply on Tuesday after the US appeals court ruled that the SEC acted arbitrarily when it rejected Grayscale filing to convert GBTC into an ETF. The decision ignited a major crypto comeback, with the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies soaring to over $1.09 trillion.\n\nThe ruling on Grayscale is important because the SEC is currently reviewing other spot Bitcoin ETFs by the likes of Invesco, Blackrock and WisdomTree. This decision will come as soon as this week. As I wrote on Tuesday, the SEC could decide to approve, reject, or delay the ETF proposals.\n\nI believe that the SEC will seek more time to review these proposals and the court ruling on Grayscale case. Ultimately, however, I suspect that the agency will be forced to accept these proposals.\n\nFor one, the recent proposals offer some improvements compared with the initial ones. For one, they include a surveillance clause that helps to prevent market manipulation in the ETF. Also, gold ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust have always existed and I see no big difference between BTC and gold.\n\nThe other important takeaway to consider is that companies could seek to launch more crypto ETFs if a Bitcoin fund is listed. The most obvious candidates for these funds are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Litecoin.\n\nThese three coins are extremely similar to Bitcoin since they all emerged from their forks. Unlike most other coins, BCH, BSV, and Litecoin are all proof-of-work coins that have no staking features. The SEC does not view them as financial securities.\n\nThe only challenge with some of these coins, especially Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash is that they tend to have low daily trading volume. As such, they might prove to be unprofitable for ETF companies.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF could also be launched since it is the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. It is also the second most liquid coin in the industry, one that helps power most sectors like DeFi and NFTs.\n\nThe challenge for Ethereum is that it transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) into a proof-of-stake (PoS) network after the merge. As a result, by combining with the Beacon Chain, it initiated staking in its platform. Therefore, the SEC likely sees it as a security, which could make its approval challenging. Other coins with potential for ETFs are Tron, Cardano, and Polygon."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe team behind decentralized Bitcoin infrastructure provider Interlay today unveiled the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of its BOB (\"Build on Bitcoin\") solution.\n\nBOB, which comes on the heels of last month\u2019s launch of Interlays\u2019 Bitcoin DeFi Hub, is billed as a Bitcoin Layer-2 network that introduces Rust smart contracts compatible with Bitcoin libraries such as Lightning and Ordinals.\n\nWith the full support of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the developers see BOB as a go-to platform for fostering innovation, experimentation, and the development of novel decentralized applications atop Bitcoin's robust foundation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur goal is to enable builders to create truly decentralized applications and innovate on top of Bitcoin\u2019s existing stack, including Lightning, Ordinals and Nostr,\u201d Interlay co-founder Alexei Zamyatin said in a statement. \u201cThereby, BOB bets on enabling builders from Ethereum and other ecosystems to quickly bring their DeFi, NFT and other web3 products to Bitcoin\u2019s 300 million users.\u201d\n\nInterlay, which to date has raised a total of $9.5 million in venture funding, has previously also experimented with tokenized Bitcoin, helping to develop a cross-chain bridge to Polkadot.\n\nThe BRC-21 token standard\n\nNotably, the release includes a demonstration application that implements BRC-21, a novel Bitcoin standard proposed by the Interlay team in May this year amid the hype surrounding the sudden emergence of the Ordinals protocol. The latter allows for the inscribing of digital content, such as art, onto the Bitcoin blockchain and uses the BRC-20 token standard.\n\n\u201cBRC-21 is a standard that uses the BRC-20 format of representing assets on Bitcoin to trustlessly bridge tokens from other chains to Bitcoin, for example decentralized stablecoins like DAI that live on Ethereum,\u201d Zamyatin told Decrypt. \u201cOn the Bitcoin side, the standard introduces \u2018mint\u2019 and \u2018redeem\u2019 operations that are verified by customized indexers.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the mint and burn logic of the protocol, paired with the cryptographic verification of Bitcoin transactions, allows any ERC-20 token on Ethereum to be bridged to Bitcoin as a BRC-21 token in a fully trustless manner, without the need for any trusted oracles or custodians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to Rust and EVM smart contracts, the release of BOB's MVP also features Interlay's trustless Bitcoin bridge and an integrated Bitcoin light client that utilizes cryptographic verification of the Bitcoin main chain.\n\nZamyatin added that there is also some logic that is necessary on the \u2018connected\u2019 chain, such as Ethereum, including \"a smart contract to lock/unlock bridged assets and a BTC-Relay\u2014a Bitcoin light client implemented as a smart contract that tracks the BTC main chain and can verify BTC transactions.\"\n\nAccording to Interlay, this functionality enables developers to establish trustless BTC, Ordinals, and BRC swaps, along with other Bitcoin primitives like hashrate markets.\n\nThe upcoming full-release timeline will incorporate compatibility with Ethereum, an innovative Bitcoin peg mechanism building upon Interlay's existing trustless BTC bridge, and Bitcoin rollup mechanisms.\n\n\u201cWe are working to have the mainnet live with launch partners, tooling and infrastructure before the Bitcoin halving. A public testnet for builders to start testing is scheduled for before Christmas this year,\u201d Zamyatin told Decrypt.\n\nUpgrades are \u2018necessary\u2019 for mass adoption of Bitcoin\n\nEfforts like Ordinals have raised the ire of some Bitcoin maximalists, who argue that as a tried-and-tested protocol that has been running for over a decade without any major security flaws, the Bitcoin blockchain should not be used for experiments because it could destabilize the network and erode public confidence in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. The Interlay co-founder, however, told Decrypt he firmly believes that we need to unlock more use cases for Bitcoin than just \u201chodling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do not provide people with tools to use Bitcoin for more than investment and remittance in a decentralized manner, we are basically pushing them to use centralized providers or less secure networks,\u201d Zamyatin said. \u201cFinancial freedom means different things for different people and I think it is ignorant to claim that \u2018stacking sats\u2019 and \u2018hodling\u2019 are the sole purposes of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Layer-2s are the most promising path to enable experimentation without major changes to Bitcoin, which should act as the most secure and decentralized settlement layer for applications and layers built around and on top of it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe changes necessary to enable trustless Layer-2s need to be carefully evaluated and tested. I am not suggesting to rush an upgrade but an upgrade is definitely necessary if we want to see Bitcoin adopted globally,\u201d argued Zamyatin.\n\nThe Interlay co-founder went on to say that he is a Bitcoin \u201cmaxi\u201d himself, having spent the last eight years working on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI love what Bitcoin is and what it stands for,\" said Zamyatin, adding that he disagrees with \"cult-like maximalism and tribalism.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that Bitcoin \u2018is better than everything else at everything,\u2019\" he added. \"Ignorance is the death of innovation.\u201d\n\nDrawing parallels, he noted that once-dominant corporate giants like IBM, Kodak, Yahoo, Nokia, and Xerox had failed to realize that innovation is needed to survive and paid the ultimate price.\n\n\u201cI and many, many others do not want this to happen to Bitcoin,\" said Zamyatin. \"One could say Bitcoin is in the early stages of a renaissance.\""

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Daily Transaction Fees Drop to Lowest in 8 Months - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Ethereum has printed its lowest transaction fees for the year.\n\nThe protocol has been recording massive transaction counts without congestion struggle.\n\nEthereum transaction fees have reached their lowest levels since December in terms of usage. Just this weekend, the cost of executing transactions on the world\u2019s largest programmable blockchain and the parent platform of the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH), has dropped to 1,719 ETH which is valued at approximately $2.8 million.\n\nAccording to historical data from South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, this is the lowest single-day total since December 26th. Compared to the year-to-date high of 16,720 Ethereum reported on May 5th, the figure shows a massive plunge of 89%.\n\nUnlike leading digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) which uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Ethereum leverages a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm that uses validators instead of miners to create and verify a new block for transactions. These validators help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH each.\n\nUsually, they receive a portion of the transaction fees; validators get either the priority fee or the tip that users sometimes add to the base fee to entice validators so that they prioritize their transactions.\n\nThe primary base fee is burned to help reduce the Ethereum circulating supply. Markedly, the significant decline in total daily fee is evidence of low network usage. This is because fees are usually dependent on the amount of activity happening on the network, especially the number of pending transactions.\n\nThere are speculations that these new fees may be as a result of the growing popularity of the ETH Layer-2 scaling solutions which is a long-term positive development for the network.\n\nUtilization of Ethereum Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nDavid Lawant, head of research at FalconX, pointed out that ETH Layer-1 fees have gone down by 25% compared to the average of the year since Friends.tech launched on Base on August 10th. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the decline is in sharp contrast to the times when the success of early Non-fungible token (NFT) application CryptoKitties or the latest Yuga Labs NFT drop would commonly temporarily clog the Ethereum network.\n\nLawant appreciated how the app was able to successfully gain meaningful traction without impacting any congestion on the underlying network. This milestone came on the heels of the latest development of ETH L2 swing solutions. Specifically, Friend.tech was designed on top of Coinbase Base which utilizes the Optimism Stack.\n\nGenerally, L2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum and Base are crucial to scaling Ethereum.\n\nIn the process, it reduces the potential of congestion and helps keep transaction cost on the main network under control. IntoTheBlock data shows that number of daily transactions on Optimism Mainnet hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of almost 900,000 transactions on August 15th.\n\n\u201cAs competition between L2s grows, it becomes clear that Ethereum benefits,\u201d IntoTheBlock added. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently trading at $1,645.92, having gained 0.40% in the past 24 hours per data from Marketcap.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Immediately after Ethereum spiked on August 29, a whale bought 8,000 ETH at $1,709, spending 13.66 million USDC. ETH prices continue to rise, trading at around $1,740 when writing.\n\nThe coin may post even more gains in the sessions following a shift in trader sentiment after a favorable appellate court ruling in the case pitting Grayscale, the issuer of several trusts, including the Bitcoin Trust, versus the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Grayscale Catalyst\n\nThe United States District of Columbia Court of Appeals faulted the SEC for not allowing Grayscale to convert the billions worth of over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin Trust to a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The SEC has already approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF that doesn\u2019t track the price of Bitcoin directly.\n\nIn their argument, Grayscale asserts that measures implemented to ensure that prices aggregated for the Bitcoin index used to guide the Bitcoin Futures ETF are safe. As such, the same could be applied in guaranteeing the credibility of data streams used as input for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nGrayscale added that their surveillance sharing agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) should effectively flag and stamp out any attempt to manipulate Bitcoin prices.\n\nWill The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF?\n\nFollowing this development, it is likely that the SEC will approve a Bitcoin spot ETF in the coming months. However, nothing is guaranteed, as the asset manager still needs to complete a process controlled by the regulator.\n\nThis DOES NOT automatically mean GBTC is immediately converting into an ETF. It just means \u2014 as the court states \u2014 that the SEC failed to explain why it approved Bitcoin futures ETPs and not the Grayscale\u2019s proposed product. There is a process ahead\u2026 \u2014 Sonali Basak (@sonalibasak) August 29, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, several firms have applied for an Ethereum futures ETF. As of early August, six entities, including Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale, wanted to offer these products to investors. The SEC has yet to approve any Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nIt is unclear whether the SEC will proceed and allow the market to trade an Ethereum derivative this year. However, if the regulator is satisfied with all applications and green light them depending on their filing dates, Volatility Shares Ethereum futures ETF would be the first to hit the market as early as October 12.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin is trending higher after finding support at around $25,800. The expansion of BTC prices has benefited altcoins, and Ethereum is firm, breaking out. Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, ETH prices have broken above last week\u2019s resistance at $1,700.\n\nThe surge in ETH\u2019s price as of August 29 displays rising trading volumes, and the associated breakout bar is also wide-ranging. This could suggest that ETH buyers are engaged, and the coin may surge even higher in the days ahead. Looking at price action, the whale bought the breakout, around the $1,700 round number, and is currently in the money.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of Input Output (IOHK), has sparked a strong belief that Cardano (ADA) will not only emerge as a dominant player but also surpass the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAt the recent Rare Evo 2023 event in Denver, Hoskinson laid out his vision for Cardano, citing its scalability, interoperability, and potential to reshape societal infrastructure. However, amidst this optimism, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen warns of a potential \u201cdepression phase\u201d for Cardano\u2019s price, urging investors to trade carefully. In this post, we will delve into all these aspects, from Charles Hoskinso to Benjamin Cowen.\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s Conviction: Cardano as the Future Leader\n\nHoskinson\u2019s keynote address at Rare Evo 2023 reflected his belief that Cardano possesses the fundamental qualities required to become the world\u2019s most trusted and valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nHoskinson argues that decentralized governance empowers individuals to create remarkable outcomes. With an emphasis on scalability and interoperability, Hoskinson envisions Cardano as more than just a cryptocurrency; he envisions it as the pioneer of a new digital society where trust and transparency reign supreme.\n\nCurrent Price Action: A Glimpse into ADA\u2019s Trajectory\n\nCurrently, Cardano is trading at $0.26 below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. Moreover, candlesticks form in the lower Bollinger Bands with an RSI of around 40. Overall, technical indicators suggest consolidation in the next few months with a strong support of around $0.23.\n\nCheck out our latest ADA prediction with detailed insights and technical and fundamental analysis that help you to make investment-related decisions. Despite Hoskinson\u2019s conviction, Cardano has yet to establish itself as the frontrunner because it is the eighth-largest digital asset based on market cap. On the contrary, Benjamin Cowen suggests a bearish phase.\n\nThe \u201cDepression Phase\u201d: Benjamin Cowen\u2019s Perspective\n\nContrasting Hoskinson\u2019s enthusiasm, Benjamin Cowen, a respected crypto analyst, presents a more cautious perspective. Cowen suggests that Cardano might enter a \u201cdepression phase,\u201d drawing parallels between ADA\u2019s potential trajectory and historical market patterns.\n\nHe points to the possibility of a deeper correction, with Cardano\u2019s price potentially plummeting further. Cowen\u2019s analysis harkens back to the bearish trends observed in the Nasdaq during 2002-2003, highlighting the potential for ADA\u2019s price to decline significantly before finding stabilization.\n\nIs Cardano Worth Buying Now?\n\nAfter analyzing these contrasting viewpoints, you must consider a cautious approach for Cardano. Hoskinson\u2019s vision for Cardano as a transformative force in the cryptocurrency world is compelling. However, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and Cowen\u2019s warnings about a potential \u201cdepression phase\u201d cannot be denied, especially in this extended bearish phase.\n\nInvestors must consider multiple factors before making a decision. Cardano\u2019s current market position, technological developments, adoption rate, and potential competitors all play a role in determining its future trajectory. While ADA\u2019s current price might seem attractive, given Hoskinson\u2019s aspirations, you can also consider ADA for long-term investment."

        "content": "With Shibarium\u2019s popularity growing with new users registered daily, a Shiba Inu team member influencer has disclosed detailed steps on how to withdraw digital assets from Shibarium to Ethereum.\n\nHow-To Guide For Shibarium To Ethereum Withdrawals Unveiled\n\nShiba Inu marketing strategist Lucie released a three-part guide on Tuesday, August 29 in an X (formerly Twitter) post to help Shibarium users learn how to transfer their digital assets from the Shibarium network to Ethereum.\n\nFollowing its relaunch a few days ago, Shibarium has been steadily growing and gaining new users regularly. The mainnet had previously recorded over 100,000 addresses days after its public launch.\n\nWith new users swarming the network, Lucie has deemed it essential to provide detailed information to users who do not know how to navigate transactions between Shibarium and Ethereum.\n\nIn the guide posted by Lucie, she illustrated several important steps to withdraw from Shibarium to Ethereum. She stated that users should have or fund their wallets with enough Ethereum tokens, ETH, to cover gas fees that would be charged during the transaction.\n\nLucie urged users to be patient during their transaction process. She clarified that it\u2019s not uncommon for transactions to be slow since L2 solutions utilizing a plasma bridge often have delays. Hence, users who are performing their transactions should not be flustered by a long waiting time.\n\nShe also explained that most delays occur due to security checks and verifications which are important to safeguard user\u2019s information and ensure that all transfers within the network are safe.\n\n\u201cDelays stem from security checks, exit challenges, confirmations, bridge mechanics, high demand, and network updates. These ensure safe transfers amidst network intricacies,\u201d Lucie stated.\n\nAccording to Shibarium Lead Developer, Shytoshi Kusaka, withdrawals on the layer 2 network\u2019s bridge have been sluggish, taking 45 minutes to 3 hours to complete a transaction.\n\nDespite the slow pace in withdrawals, Shiba Inu\u2019s price has been on an uptrend since the launch of the Shibarium mainnet. The cryptocurrency is currently growing to be one of the trendiest meme coins after Dogecoin.\n\nThe SHIB ecosystem is also running new projects which has caught the interest of many crypto investors and may push its price higher. CEO of the Stock Dork, Adam Garcia, and CEO of Moneyzine.com, Jonathan Merry, have also predicted considerable growth for the doggy cryptocurrency. They stated that the Shiba Inu token is expected to reach $0.01 with the support of the Shibarium mainnet and its burn mechanism.\n\nSHIB price still holding steady above $0.000008 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from DiarioBitcoin, chart from Tradingview.com"

In this guide, we\u2019ll explore the potential benefits and risks of investing in Ethereum, and provide you with expert opinions to help you make an informed decision.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized blockchain platform, is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement and has fueled the development of numerous decentralized apps (dApps). Its market cap is one of the highest in the cryptocurrency market and the second largest cryptocurrency making it a popular choice for investors looking to buy Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin.
