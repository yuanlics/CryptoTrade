        "title": "Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has brought more centralization to the blockchain - crypto.news",
        "content": "JPMorgan Chase &. Co. has shed light on how the Ethereum network decentralization has decreased significantly since the Merge event and Shanghai upgrade went live.\n\nThe rise of staking and centralization\n\nSince implementing the Merge and Shanghai upgrades, Ethereum has seen a substantial uptick in staking activities.\n\nStaking, a process where users lock up their crypto assets to support network operations, has its merits. According to a CoinDesk report citing JPMorgan research, this surge in staking activity comes at a cost: centralization.\n\nTraditionally, many in the crypto community prefer decentralized liquid staking platforms like Lido over their centralized counterparts.\n\nLido\u2019s approach included adding more node operators to ensure no single entity controlled a significant portion of staked Ether (ETH). The aim was to address centralization concerns.\n\nHowever, centralization remains a risk. A concentration of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or even collude to create an oligopoly, potentially undermining the interests of the broader Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest crypto, has become more centralized since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. And JPMorgan is highlighting concerns over a decline in staking yields.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nThe menace of rehypothecation\n\nAnother highlight from the report is rehypothecation. This complex term refers to the practice of reusing liquidity tokens as collateral across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols simultaneously.\n\nDeFi encompasses lending, trading, and other financial activities carried out on the blockchain.\n\nThe problem arises when a staked asset\u2019s value sharply declines or faces a security breach or protocol error.\n\nIn such scenarios, rehypothecation could trigger a cascade of liquidations, jeopardizing the stability of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the report points out that the increase in staking has diminished the appeal of Ethereum from a yield perspective.\n\nThis shift is especially noticeable amid rising yields in traditional financial assets. The total staking yield has fallen from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to approximately 5.5%.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the research data presented in December following Ethereum\u2019s Merge upgrade in September 2022 reveals a significant reduction in the network\u2019s energy consumption, akin to the energy usage of entire countries such as Ireland and Austria.\n\nThis decrease in power consumption positively contributes to environmental sustainability, aligning with broader global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint associated with blockchain technologies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s core developers have introduced an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-7514) as part of the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for activation in October 2023.\n\nThis proposal aims to slow down the rate of Ether staking. The intention is to provide the Ethereum community with more time to devise a practical reward scheme for stakers on the network.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAs of the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $1,629, representing a 3.4% decline on the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 40.4.\n\nThe price of ETH is struggling to maintain the $1600 level after facing rejection at the $1700 resistance level. A failure to hold the $1600 level could potentially lead to a further decline to the $1500 level.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Sun\u2019s actions have raised eyebrows as he has withdrawn millions from Lido Finance without selling.\n\nA mysterious connection has emerged as another entity has swiftly reshuffled ETH assets on Huobi.\n\nButerin, in contrast, has opted for smaller transfers, maintaining an air of enigma.\n\nIn a startling twist of events, two prominent figures in the blockchain space, TRON founder Justin Sun and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have recently made headlines by orchestrating Ethereum (ETH) transfers from their well-known digital wallets.\n\nJustin Sun Withdraws $37.7M in Ethereum from Lido Finance\n\nJustin Sun initiated a substantial withdrawal from Lido Finance, totaling 23,000 ETH, equivalent to a staggering $37.7 million. The entirety of this significant sum was then transferred to a new destination, identified as address 0x454. Remarkably, despite this sizable transaction, Sun chose not to liquidate his ETH holdings.\n\nIntriguingly, another address associated with HTX (Huobi) conducted a withdrawal of 42,999 ETH from Binance shortly after Sun\u2019s ETH deposit into Binance, subsequently reallocating these assets to Lido for staking purposes.\n\nThis recent development marks another instance of Justin Sun\u2019s impactful financial maneuvers. Two days prior, on October 5, Sun withdrew another substantial tranche of 19,000 ETH, totaling $32.8 million, from Lido Finance, subsequently depositing these funds into Binance.\n\nButerin\u2019s Modest $1.64M Transfer Amid Crypto Cleaning\n\nBefore these actions, Sun had made a notable deposit of 5,000 ETH, equivalent to $9.2 million, into Huobi at an ETH price of $1,841 on August 12, 2023, just before the cryptocurrency market experienced a decline, resulting in ETH prices plummeting by more than 14%.\n\nIn contrast, Vitalik Buterin executed a comparatively modest transfer involving 1,000 ETH with a value of $1.64 million, directed towards address 0x556 on the same day. It\u2019s worth highlighting that Buterin has consistently deposited a cumulative total of 2.6 thousand ETH, equivalent to $4.2 million, into Bitstamp and Paxos through this specific address since September 17.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s repeated withdrawals and deposits of significant amounts of ETH may be part of a strategic move to capitalize on market fluctuations.\n\nWith notable amounts of ETH being moved by both Sun and Buterin, there\u2019s potential for these actions to affect Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThese high-profile Ethereum transactions, involving influential figures like Justin Sun and Vitalik Buterin, underscore the dynamic nature of crypto. They shed light on the strategic moves of key players within the industry, potentially influencing market sentiment and investor behavior.\n\nTo learn more about Ether ETFs and their potential impact on institutional crypto adoption, read here:\n\nAre Ether ETFs Initiating an Institutional Surge in Crypto?\n\n\n\nAre you curious about the recent challenges facing the ETH burn mechanism amidst growing interest?

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has gained around 35% in 2023 so far. But its attempts to break above $2,000, a psychological resistance level, have witnessed strong bearish rejections multiple times.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

In 2023, the same line is near $2,000, enforcing itself again as a selling area and, thus, pressuring ETH\u2019s price lower.\n\nStronger U.S. dollar, Bitcoin\n\nA strengthening United States dollar has dampened demand for Ethereum in recent months, thus reducing its ability to close decisively above $2,000.\n\nThe prevailing negative correlation between top cryptocurrencies and the dollar has been the main culprit. In 2023, in particular, the weekly correlation coefficient between Ether and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been consistently negative, as shown below.\n\nETH/USD and DXY weekly correlation coefficient chart.

In this case, ETH\u2019s price can drop to $1,465 and $1,560 in October 2023, depending on the breakdown point.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin proposes two-tier model to address 'centralization challenges' in Ethereum staking - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s founder, Vitalik Buterin, unveiled an innovative proposal this week aimed at refining the platform\u2019s staking mechanism.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Ethereum\u2019s continued evolution is crucial for its vast user base, and these proposed changes aim to bolster decentralization, efficiency, and security.\n\nA Decentralized Vision for Staking\n\nThe primary concern addressed in Buterin\u2019s proposal revolves around the limitations of the current staking system.\n\nNotably, he pinpoints decentralization issues surrounding the selection process for node operators across various staking pools and identifies inefficiencies in the current Layer 1 (L1) consensus mechanism.\n\nPresently, the constraints of solo staking combined with issues surrounding liquid staking mean that the platform can only process between approximately 100,000 to 1 million BLS signatures per slot.\n\nA further complication arises from the need for accountability in signing, which demands a participation record for each signature. If Ethereum scales up globally, using full danksharding for storage might still fall short, with a mere 16 MB per slot accommodating around 64 million stakers.\n\nDrawing inspiration from models implemented by Rocketpool and Lido, Buterin suggests adopting a two-tiered staking system. In this structure, Node Operators and Delegators emerge as central figures.\n\nTo rectify this, Buterin suggests a two-tiered staking model:\n\nA high-complexity slashable tier with frequent activity but limited participants (around 10,000). A low-complexity tier, where members engage sporadically and face minimal or no slashing risk.\n\nThis model would involve the modification of the validator balance cap and implementing a balance threshold to categorize validators into these tiers.\n\nButerin elaborates on potential roles for small-stakers:\n\nRandom selection of 10,000 small-stakers for each slot who sign off on their slot\u2019s head. If divergences arise between the staker and node operator choices, it triggers an error, prompting community intervention.\n\nA system where a delegator declares their online presence, offering to serve as a small-staker for a set duration. For a node\u2019s message to be acknowledged, it needs endorsement from both the node and a randomly picked delegator.\n\nAn approach in which delegators signal their availability, and subsequently, chosen delegators confirm their online status. These delegators can then publish inclusion lists for block validation.\n\nThe roles envisioned for small-stakers are characterized by their sporadic participation and non-slashable nature. Importantly, these roles tackle the significant issue of a potential 51% node operator majority attempting transaction censorship.\n\nButerin also contemplates these solutions in the context of staking pool features. He suggests protocols allowing validators to designate two staking keys: a persistent key and a temporary one, which, when combined, influence the block finalization process.\n\nThe Implications\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t just technical fixes; it\u2019s a vision for Ethereum\u2019s future. By decentralizing the staking process further and integrating safety nets, he aims to:\n\nEmpower those lacking resources for solo staking, granting them meaningful participation avenues. Reduce the transaction processing load on Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer, making it easier for all to run a validating node.\n\nBy diffusing the staking process and embedding safeguards, the objectives are clear: to empower those who traditionally lack the means for solo staking by offering them a meaningful way to participate and alleviate the transaction processing strain on Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer. This ensures a more accessible platform for everyone intending to run a validating node.\n\nThe proposed refinements underscore the pressing need for minimal, strategic protocol modifications, all pointing towards a balanced, decentralized, and high-functioning Ethereum network."

        "content": "Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency, but a platform for decentralized applications. Ethereum allows developers to create smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain. Smart contracts can enable a variety of use cases, such as decentralized finance, gaming, identity management, and more. But what makes Ethereum so powerful and unique? And what are the risks and challenges that it faces? In this article, we will explore the potential and the pitfalls of Ethereum, and why it is more than just a digital currency.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain that supports smart contract functionality. It was launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer who envisioned a platform that could go beyond the limitations of Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which is mainly designed for peer-to-peer payments, Ethereum allows developers to build and deploy any kind of application that can run on the blockchain. These applications are called decentralized applications, or DApps.\n\nDApps are powered by smart contracts, which are pieces of code that define the rules and logic of the application. Smart contracts are stored and executed on the Ethereum network, which consists of thousands of nodes (computers) that validate transactions and maintain consensus. By using smart contracts, DApps can operate without intermediaries, censorship, or downtime. This makes them more transparent, efficient, and secure than traditional applications.\n\nSome examples of DApps that run on Ethereum are:"

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Proposes Tweaks to Improve Decentralization and Reduce Consensus Overhead - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, has proposed changes to the network's staking model aimed at improving decentralization and reducing the consensus layer's computational burden. The proposal includes the introduction of a two-tiered staking system involving node operators and delegators. Buterin suggests that these changes could significantly reduce the number of signatures required for consensus, thereby making it easier for more people to participate in the network's validation process.\n\nVitalik Buterin , the founder of Ethereum, has recently proposed a series of changes aimed at improving the network's staking model. The primary objectives are to enhance decentralization and reduce the computational burden on the consensus layer. The proposal comes as Ethereum faces challenges related to centralization risks and the sheer number of signatures required for consensus. Buterin's proposal could potentially revolutionize the way staking and consensus are approached on the Ethereum network, making it more accessible and efficient.\n\nIn the current Ethereum staking model, there are two types of participants: node operators and delegators. Node operators are responsible for running nodes and providing collateral, usually in the form of ETH. Delegators, on the other hand, contribute some amount of ETH but are not required to participate in any other way. This two-tiered staking model has been popularized by staking pools like Rocket Pool and Lido, which offer liquid staking tokens (LSTs). However, Buterin identifies two main issues with this system. First, there is a centralization risk in the mechanisms for choosing node operators, which are either not very decentralized or have other flaws. Second, the Ethereum Layer 1 verifies approximately 800,000 signatures per epoch, a number that could increase, thereby adding a significant computational load to the network.\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin suggests that delegators should have a more meaningful role in the network. He outlines two classes of solutions: delegate selection and consensus participation. In the delegate selection model, delegates could choose which node operators they want to support, thereby having a \"weight\" in the consensus. This would give them more power and make the network more decentralized. In the consensus participation model, delegators could be given a lighter role in the consensus process, which would act as a check on node operators. This would allow more people to participate in the network's validation process without taking on the full responsibilities and risks of being a node operator.\n\nButerin also provides concrete implementation ideas for these solutions. One such idea is to allow each validator to specify two staking keys: a persistent staking key (P) and a quick staking key (Q). These keys could be used in various ways to improve the consensus mechanism and reduce the number of required signatures. For example, the protocol could require both the node and a randomly selected delegator to sign off for a message from a node to count.\n\nIn conclusion, Buterin's proposal aims to achieve two main objectives. First, it seeks to empower those who do not have the resources or capability to solo-stake to participate meaningfully in the network. Second, it aims to reduce the number of signatures required for consensus to around 10,000, thus aiding decentralization and making it easier for more people to run a validating node. These changes could be implemented at different layers, including within staking pool protocols or as part of the Ethereum protocol itself, offering a flexible approach to improving the network's staking model.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Taking a step back for a broader perspective, there is a significant amount of liquidity accumulated below us, accompanied by rejection wicks to the upside.\n\nAdditionally, Open Interest (OI) has reached its peak, which historically has signaled a local top in the past five out of five instances. The overall direction seems clear in my opinion, but the key question is how far the price will drop. It is important to remember that the long-term outlook is still bullish, and breaching $24,800 is not anticipated. I believe we may test the mid-range, and if it holds, we could experience an early bottom. However, there is also the possibility of a swift dip below $26,000 (but remaining above $24,800), which could present an excellent opportunity for a low-risk, high-reward entry once again.\n\nNo change to my idea shared below.

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAshley Prosper, an XRP community member, highlighted factors from the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit that might affect Ethereum.\n\nThe Ripple lawsuit emphasized the nature of XRP\u2019s blind sales and lack of buyer knowledge.\n\nRipple\u2019s programmatic sales were less than 1% of global XRP trading.\n\nDiscussions around Ethereum\u2019s early sales are growing, with concerns about concealed major investments.\n\nEthereum\u2019s early sales are making waves in the cryptocurrency community, drawing insights from recent SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit developments. Ashley Prosper, a prominent member of the XRP community, has shed light on five elements derived from the Ripple lawsuit, suggesting potential repercussions for Ethereum should the SEC decide to delve deeper into its past ICO dealings.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Spotlight: Ripple\u2019s Court Insights\n\nThe court\u2019s findings in the Ripple lawsuit emphasized several critical factors regarding Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP:\n\nThe nature of these sales was likened to blind bid/ask transactions, with buyers unaware if their funds were directed to the blockchain firm.\n\nSuch sales accounted for a mere sliver, less than 1%, of the global XRP trading activity.\n\nRipple, during these transactions, did not make any commitments or offers, primarily because the company lacked knowledge of the identities of those buying XRP on exchanges.\n\nA significant number of these buyers remained oblivious to Ripple\u2019s very existence.\n\nThese XRP sales didn\u2019t follow any contracts with clauses like lockup provisions or explicit statements of purpose.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Sales: A Subject of Contention\n\nAdding fuel to the Ethereum sales discourse was former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff. He presented the inherent difficulty in pinpointing the exact number of Ethereum ICO buyers. His insights stirred debates and led to suspicions that some major players, or \u201cwhales\u201d, could be concealing their Ethereum positions.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the Ripple lawsuit\u2019s findings with Ethereum\u2019s historical sales opens a Pandora\u2019s box of questions and potential regulatory scrutiny. Should the SEC choose to probe Ethereum\u2019s past based on these Ripple precedents, Ethereum might find itself in a regulatory maze, raising concerns for its investors and stakeholders in the crypto industry."

        "content": "Binance, the leading crypto exchange platform, recently released its eleventh proof-of-reserve (POR) report detailing its holdings of users\u2019 cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe exchange holds 385 digital assets, including XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu, and other notable cryptocurrencies.\n\nBinance XRP Holdings\n\nAs per the official report, Binance claims to safeguard its customers\u2019 XRP tokens at a one-to-one ratio. Specifically, the ratio of XRP in users\u2019 net balances compared to Binance\u2019s net holdings stands at 104.15%.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn other words, XRP investors have entrusted 2,629,459,187 XRP tokens to Binance, while the exchange holds 2,738,661,519 XRP. Based on XRP\u2019s market price, the figures translate to Binance holding over $1.43 billion XRP in relation to users\u2019 deposits of $1.37 billion XRP.\n\nNotably, Binance\u2019s XRP in this eleventh report indicated a slight increase compared to the tenth series report. In September, The Crypto Basic disclosed that Binance XRP was at 103.82%. Compared to the current 104.15%, it implies that XRP on the exchange grew by at least 52 million.\n\nAlso, Binance\u2019s August report indicated it held 2.8 billion XRP, valued at approximately $1.75 billion, since XRP traded above $0.6 during the period. Interestingly, Binance has maintained a consistent XRP holding of over 2.5 billion XRP since it began publishing the POR reports.\n\nBitcoin Portfolio\n\nLike XRP, Binance POR suggested it holds the largest market cap, crypto Bitcoin, in a 104.67% ratio to customers\u2019 deposits. In particular, the exchange keeps 616,394 BTC worth over $17 billion against users\u2019 deposits of 588,879 BTC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile users\u2019 assets increased by 708 BTC since September, Binance\u2019s overall Bitcoin holding dropped by 1,732 BTC or $48,068,299\n\nEthereum Portfolio\n\nOn the other hand, Binance\u2019s ratio of Ethereum portfolio to customer deposits increased by over 2% in the past 30 days. The exchange holds over 4.109 million ETH worth $6.73 billion. In contrast, customers have deposited 3.83 Ether tokens worth $6.27 billion.\n\nNotably, the exchange\u2019s Ethereum holding improved by 17,186 ETH since the last report.\n\nShiba Inu Portfolio\n\nMeanwhile, Binance\u2019s eleventh POR report shows a reduction in its trillion units holding of the dog-themed sensational crypto Shiba Inu. According to the report, Binance\u2019s Shiba Inu holding stands at 76,895,594,975,813 (76.8 trillion) against 74,623,682,522,683 (74.6 trillion) from customers.\n\nHowever, The Crypto Basic reported that Binance held 75,476,904,308,962 SHIB for users in September. The reduction signifies Shiba Inu enthusiasts have withdrawn 853,221,786,279 (853 billion) SHIB off the exchange in the past 30 days.\n\nLitecoin and MATIC Portfolios\n\nOn the other hand, Binance\u2019s portfolio of Polygon (MATIC) tokens to customers\u2019 net balances dipped more than 2.5% from 119.86% to 117.16%. Meanwhile, the eleventh POR indicated the exchange\u2019s Litecoin (LTC) portfolio improved by 1% since the last report.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that no external auditor has independently verified Binance\u2019s proof-of-reserve. Emphatically, the exchange clearly stated that the POR reports result from \u201cself-verification.\u201d"

        "content": "The network participation rate on Ethereum increased to 90% as Devnet-9 closes in on completion.\n\nThe Dencun testnet could launch before November ends.\n\nEthereum [ETH] developers had their usual All Core Developers Consensus (ACD) call on 5 October. From the meeting, they decided the timing for the Devnet-10 launch could happen earlier than initially projected.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOnce the block generator clears the way\n\nAlthough the ACDC call #119 focused on the Dencun upgrade, the developers considered discussing the health and status of the latest developer Testnet Devnet-9 as a priority, alongside Devnet-10.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Devnet-9 launched on 29 September, as a way to improve the network participation rate on the blockchain. The network participation rate is defined as the percentage of validators actively carrying out their duties on the network.\n\nDuring the meeting, the developers noted that the network participation rate was impressively high at 90%.\n\nHowever, Barnabas Busa, a DevOps Engineer for the Ethereum Foundation, mentioned that there were a few bugs with Devnet-9, especially in the execution layer. For context, the execution layer is the part of the network responsible for validating the state in the block header.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation seemed to be working on fixing the bug as Geth developer Marius van der Wijden said that he was working on updating the block generator for the execution layer.\n\nNext, on the agenda was the Devnet-10, which is primarily to check the next maximum epoch churn limit in EIP-7514. EIP-7514 is designed to slow down the growth of the active validator set by tracking the soaring levels of staked ETH.\n\nDencun Testnet is set before November\n\nAt the time of writing, Santiment showed that the number of validator deposits was 1026. This was a notable decrease from the highs registered some weeks back. Therefore, the decline means that the objectives for Devnet-10 may already be set in motion.\n\nAs expected, Ethereum\u2019s development activity has started to rise again. The Development Activity means the code committed by developers toward upgrades on a network. Over the past month, the metric tumbled. So, the slight rise implies that developers were starting to get back to polishing the network.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs per Devnet-10, Parithosh Jayanthi, another DevOps Engineer at the Foundation mentioned that it could launch as early as next week. The Berlin-based developer, however, mentioned that the timeframe could be subject to the quickness of solving outstanding bugs and issues. Busa also weighed in on the matter saying,\n\n\u201cI would like to see all clients being able to participate and no more bugs on Devnet-9 before we proceed with the larger test. We should have a very stable, like 100% participation, before we move on.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Dencun final upgrade the cal chairman Tim Beiko restated that the public Testnet would happen before Ethereum\u2019s Instabul conference in mid-November called Devconnect."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nUnveiled in May 2022, the novel Ethereum (ETH) proposal is set to enable the creation of a completely new type of tokens with previously unseen functionalities. Familiar assets on Ethereum (ETH) and other EVM blockchains will be upgraded to small decentralized applications.\n\nBringing executable scripts to Ethereum (ETH) tokens: What is ERC-5169?\n\nThe ERC-5169 proposal is set to introduce a new function called scriptURI() to help locate executable scripts linked to tokens. As such, cryptocurrency tokens will be able to have advanced functionality thanks to third-party scripts from their issuers. Web3 researcher and educationist Stacy Muur shared a breakdown of the novel concept on her X.\n\nUnderstanding #ERC5169: A Simple Breakdown for Non-Techies\n\n\n\nTL;DR: @ERC5169 is a proposal for a new kind of contract interface on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nThis interface adds a new function called scriptURI() to help locate executable scripts linked to tokens.\n\n\n\nWhy should we care?\n\n\n\nImagine\u2026 pic.twitter.com/zLoAiUtEpJ \u2014 Stacy Muur (@stacy_muur) October 6, 2023\n\nThe new proposal is based on Uniform Resource Identifier or URI. When creating cryptocurrency tokens, their issuers will be able to link specific code logic to them. Once the token is created and pegged to a script, token holders will be able to access and use the linked script by calling the scriptURI function.\n\nDuring this process, scripts can be located in various storages, both centralized and decentralized to ensure maximum flexibility and composability in DeFi:\n\nIt could be on decentralized platforms like IPFS, on GitHub, or even regular cloud storage. The point is to give flexibility while ensuring authenticity\n\nOnce this standard is approved and implemented, it will pave the way for many use cases. First, users will be able to run mini applications using nothing but a single token and an associated script.\n\nAlso, developers can use this concept to create browser add-ons or automated security instructions, the researcher added.\n\nNew token experiences for Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem\n\nThe experience of using token-script designs with URI can be compared to the usage of \"smart keys\" while opening doors:\n\nThink of an office door that only opens for employees with a special token. Once an employee gets the token, they instantly know how to open the door because the instructions (script) are linked right in the token\n\nHowever, a number of security challenges come with the introduction of ERC-5169 tokens. All involved parties should be sure that only the issuer can control the script pegged to this or that token.\n\nIt should be accomplished via using \"permanent\" storage for scripts or by protecting it via some multi-signature mechanisms, the researcher concluded."

Over the past two months, this specific address has deposited a substantial 4,400 ETH into Bitstamp, totaling approximately $7.23 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per Lookonchain , this address received a significant influx of 70,000 ETH from a wallet labeled \u201cVb3\u201d and is widely believed to be connected to Vitalik Buterin himself.\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, the firm reported another notable transaction involving Buterin\u2019s wallet. He moved around $1 million worth of Ethereum to Coinbase, mirroring a similar move made in August when he sent 600 ETH to the same destination, presumably for selling purposes.\n\nEthereum Remains Stable\n\nInterestingly, these transactions have not exerted any notable influence on Ethereum\u2019s market price, as the price has remained relatively stable. This stability can be partially attributed to a broader trend. Recent data from Santiment indicated a substantial withdrawal of 110,000 ETH from centralized exchanges (CEXes) on Wednesday marking the most significant Ethereum outflow from CEXes since August 21.\n\nAs a result, Santiment reported that the total Ethereum supply on exchanges has plummeted to its lowest point in over 5.5 years, whereas the non-exchange ETH supply has surged to a historic high of 115.88 million ETH.\n\nThat said, Ethereum demonstrated remarkable resilience after a challenging week. Over the past 24 hours, it has swiftly rebounded by roughly 1.24% and was trading at $1,641 at press time."

        "title": "Ethereum Inflation? ETH Supply Has Grown by $47 Million in 30 Days - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum fans widely hyped last year\u2019s merge as a decisive event that would permanently establish ETH as \u201cultrasound money.\u201d Ethereum\u2019s historic transition from proof of work to proof of stake last September reduced ETH issuance by 90%; many so-called Ethereum maximalists were convinced the change would clinch ETH\u2019s status as a deflationary currency that would only, thereafter, appreciate in value.\n\nA year later, things aren\u2019t looking so certain.\n\nIn the last 30 days alone, global ETH supply has surged by nearly 30,000 ETH, equivalent to roughly $47.9 million at writing, according to data aggregator ultrasound.money. That sharp uptick in the amount of ETH in circulation is mostly thanks to an equally stark decline in transaction flow on the Ethereum network: far fewer NFT trades, and much less DeFi activity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince 2021, the Ethereum network has operated on a fee-burning mechanism: the more traffic on the network, the more gas prices\u2014which are required to complete on-chain transactions\u2014rise. The higher gas prices are, the more ETH is \u201cburned\u201d by the network, or permanently removed from circulation.\n\nAs of late, Ethereum gas fees have dropped remarkably low\u2014an average network transaction currently costs 7 gwei, or just $0.24. An average transaction on NFT marketplace OpenSea costs about $0.94. Contrast that with just over a year ago: during the sale of Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside collection last May, for example, network users burned over $157 million worth of Ethereum to mint just 55,000 virtual land deed NFTs: an average of $2,854 in fees alone per transaction.\n\nWhile low gas fees might be good for the average Ethereum user, they also lead to the burning of less ETH\u2014and thus, surges in global ETH supply.\n\nIs Ethereum becoming inflationary again? Yes, it is, and that's because Ethereum fees, which are supposed to burn ethers, are everywhere but not on Ethereum: its own L2s (Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.) and EVM competitors (BNB, Avalanche C, etc.) Limiting L1 dooms cryptocurrencies. pic.twitter.com/cE82gwUbZR \u2014 Nikita Zhavoronkov (@nikzh) September 23, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent inflationary trend has caused some concern among crypto users and investors who fear current trends may spell trouble for the network\u2019s long-term financial health.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe critical problem with Ethereum is that its future supply is unknown, unpredictable, and potentially inflationary. For Ethereum to be deflationary, tx fees must be high which means it must fail to scale and tx volume must not move to other crypto securities like Solana. pic.twitter.com/dITZ7RfSf6 \u2014 Joe Burnett (\ud83d\udd11)\u00b3 (@IIICapital) October 2, 2023\n\nBut the team behind Ethereum appears largely unconcerned about the development.\n\n\u201cI suspect that none of the core devs care,\u201d Micah Zoltu, an Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt of his colleagues\u2019 attitudes on the subject. \u201cIf you look at the grand scheme of things, it is insignificant.\u201d\n\nDanno Ferrin, another Ethereum core developer, said he had not been concerned by Ethereum\u2019s recent inflationary kick.\n\n\u201cIt is still below the all-time high [ETH supply],\u201d Ferrin told Decrypt. \u201cAnd [Ethereum\u2019s] short-term inflation is well below other chains and the economy as a whole.\u201d\n\nInflation has been consistently on the rise globally since last year; in the United States, prices rose last June at the sharpest year-over-year rate recorded since 1981. In response to this economic climate, the U.S. Federal Reserve has repeatedly raised interest rates, a move that has persistently lowered the values of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s daily exchange outflow reached its highest level since August on 4 October.\n\nETH\u2019s accumulation has continued to dawdle.\n\nOn 4 October, over 110,000 Ethereum [ETH] coins, worth around $177.65 million, were withdrawn from known crypto exchange wallets, marking the highest daily exchange outflow since August.\n\n#Ethereum | Roughly 110,000 $ETH were withdrawn from known #crypto exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, worth around $177.65 million, according to onchain data from @santimentfeed. pic.twitter.com/3CGVgOQUbM \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 5, 2023\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s exchange outflow surges in this manner, it suggests that coin holders are moving their assets off exchanges and into cold storage or other non-custodial wallets, which could signify bullish sentiment.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nETH fails to react\n\nA surge in exchange outflows is typically followed by a rally in an asset\u2019s price, which means a reduction in sell-offs. However, this has yet to manifest in ETH, as the price remains trapped within a narrow range.\n\nAt press time, the leading altcoin exchanged hands at $1,620. Following Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] brief surge above $28,000 during the intraday trading session on 5 October, ETH\u2019s price touched $1648, after which it shed all its gains, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nOn the daily chart, coin accumulation amongst spot traders has lost momentum. As of this writing, the coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was positioned in a downtrend beneath its 50-neutral line.\n\nLikewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was below the zero line at -0.11. A negative CMF value indicates that more money is flowing out of an asset than into it.\n\nA negative CMF value coupled with price consolidation or decline is taken as a bearish signal, suggesting that investors are selling the asset and reducing their exposure.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) revealed that ETH\u2019s sellers regained market control after the coin\u2019s price fell from its $1648 peak on 5 October. At press time, the negative directional indicator (red) at 20.63 was positioned above the positive directional indicator (green) at 20.23.\n\nThis crossover showed that the current price trend in the ETH market was a downtrend and that downward price movements outpaced upward price movements.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFutures traders tread a different path\n\nDespite the recent price action and the significant bearish sentiments in the ETH market, futures traders have remained steadfast.\n\nThe month so far has seen an uptick in ETH\u2019s Open Interest. According to data from Coinglass, the coin\u2019s Open Interest has increased by 3% since 3 October.\n\nWhen ETH open interest increases, it means that the total number of ETH futures contracts that have not been settled has increased.\n\nIt is a bullish signal as it suggests that more investors are opening new positions in ETH. And that there is increasing demand for the asset.\n\nIt remains notable that the coin\u2019s funding rates across exchanges have remained positive despite ETH\u2019s headwinds since April."

Discover SCENE\n\nHuobi Gloabl\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange has recovered millions in stolen funds from a hacker who absconded with them in September after making contact with the attacker and negotiating a deal to see it returned.\n\nJustin Sun, a Huobi Global investor and HTX adviser, took to Twitter on Saturday to announce that $8 million in stolen Ether (ETH) was restored and that the hacker made \u201cthe right choice\u201d to accept HTX\u2019s offer.\n\n\"We have confirmed that the hacker has fully returned all funds, as promised, and we have also paid the hack a white hat bonus of 250 ETH,\" wrote Sun in a post. \u201cProviding full security for user assets is always our goal to strive for!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHTX first disclosed the hack on September 25 after one of the exchange's hot wallets was compromised and drained of 5,000 ETH.\n\nAt the time, Sun assured customers that the amount was a \"relatively small sum\" versus what he said was HTX\u2019s $3 billion in assets. Sun also said at the time that HTX would offer 5% of the stolen ETH as a \"white-hat reward\" to encourage the hacker to return the funds\u2014but warned that the firm would contact law enforcement if the offer wasn't accepted within a week.\n\nCrypto firms have sometimes found themselves left negotiating with hackers to get stolen funds back rather than turning to law enforcement agencies for help. In more than one of these deals, the firm and the hacker were able to reach an agreement in which the bulk of the funds are restored, and a bounty is then paid to the hacker to close things out.\n\nHacks against cryptocurrency exchanges are a persistent risk, but the types of exchanges targeted have differed.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, there was a 63% increase in blockchain hacks compared to the same time last year, according to an Immunefi report from July. The company also found that most of the hacks happened on DeFi platforms, which lost $228 million across 79 incidents. By comparison, centralized exchanges\u2014like HTX\u2014only lost a reported $37 million across two incidents.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

According to a recent X post by the @lookonchain account, which tracks \"Smart Money\" wallets and other large addresses moving their crypto, the destination of this transaction is likely the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nButerin keeps moving ETH to Bitstamp and Coinbase\n\nButerin has been moving ETH to exchanges from his address quite often recently with speculations rising every time as to the purpose of these transfers. This time, he moved 1,000 ETH (worth approximately $1.64 million) to the exchange. Overall, per the same source, within the last two months, the co-founder and front man of Ethereum has sent 4,400 ETH (more than $7 million in fiat) to Bitstamp.\n\nvitalik.eth(@VitalikButerin) related address transferred 1K $ETH ($1.64M) out again, which may be deposited into #Bitstamp.\n\n\n\nThis address has deposited a total of 4.4K $ETH ($7.23M) to #Bitstamp in the past 2 months.https://t.co/LRrcqoxUhf pic.twitter.com/oO0rEAD6pd \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 7, 2023\n\nAs reported by U.Today, around two weeks ago, per the same blockchain sleuth Lookonchain, Buterin shifted approximately 400 ETH to the leading U.S. exchange Coinbase \u2014 back then it was worth around $1 million.

        "content": "The Flow community has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal known as \u2018EVM on Flow,\u2019 designed to achieve full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence on the Flow blockchain.\n\nThis proposal aims to enable Ethereum developers to deploy their DApps on Flow without making substantial code changes, simplifying the process of migrating or creating DApps on this innovative platform.\n\nFlow blockchain is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain designed to be the on-chain home for mainstream IPs including NBA, NFL, Doodles, and Mattel, as well as an open ecosystem where anyone can build.\n\nThe layer-one blockchain, which was created by a team with experience working at CryptoKitties, Dapper Wallet, NBA Top Shot, has a native token, FLOW which is used to pay network fees for transactions and smart contract computations and can also be traded or invested.\n\nAccording to Flow, the introduction of EVM compatibility on Flow offers a game-changing advantage to Ethereum developers. It allows them to harness the benefits of the Flow blockchain without the need to learn a new programming language or undertake complex code modifications.\n\nAdditionally, the brain behind the proposal, who is also the co-founder of Dapper Labs and Lead Architect at Flow, Dieter Shirley, stated that the process of integration involves the creation of a \u201cgateway\u201d software that can wrap and submit Ethereum transactions to the Flow blockchain. The key highlight is that no fundamental code changes are necessary to achieve full Ethereum Virtual Machine equivalence on Flow.\n\nHe added that this \u2018gateway\u2019 software enables the Flow ecosystem to potentially support Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps). It allows developers to wrap external transactions using Cadence, a smart contract programming language for Flow.\n\nHe also revealed that the proposal, which opens the door for the transfer of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens between the two networks, presents challenges that need to be addressed. Notable issues include mapping EVM gas fees to Cadence and ensuring seamless interoperability. Additionally, there is a need to finalize details regarding the EVM environment on Flow and its integration with the existing Flow infrastructure.\n\nTo solve this problem, the co-founder said that community input is critical in addressing the technical intricacies and ensuring the successful realization of EVM equivalence on Flow."

Now that Ethereum has completed its ETH 2.0 upgrade, the platform will benefit from enhanced scalability and has become more energy efficient.\n\nGiven its undeniably pivotal role in the blockchain space, experts suggest that Ethereum has the potential to see exponential growth in the next few years. With the expanding ecosystem and continuous innovation, a price prediction of around $20,000 for ETH doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched, especially when considering its previous bull runs and the broader adoption of blockchain technologies. Some even claim that it could topple Bitcoin (BTC) and become the number one cryptocurrency.\n\nXRP: The Pioneer of Cross-Border Payments\n\nXRP, developed by Ripple, has long been celebrated for its fast, low-cost cross-border payments. Facilitating real-time global transactions at a fraction of traditional costs, it\u2019s no surprise that many banking institutions have taken a keen interest in Ripple\u2019s technology. At the end of the 2018 bull market, XRP was one of the major players in the crypto world. After the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, the price plummeted and the token didn\u2019t hit the heights of other projects in the bull run of 2021.\n\nGiven the ongoing developments and partnerships, along with a broader adoption of blockchain for cross-border payments, it\u2019s conceivable that XRP\u2019s value could soar in the coming years. Expert analysis and market trends point towards a potential price of around $10 for XRP within the next few years.\n\nScorpion Casino Token: The Future of Gaming and Passive Income\n\nScorpion Casino Token($SCORP) is currently priced at a mere $0.018 and offers an exciting blend of gaming and crypto investment. The ongoing presale, with a launch price of $0.05, presents a golden opportunity for early adopters. You already stand to 3x your investment if you bought this token today by the end of the presale but hurry, the price is increasing on October 8th.\n\nOne of the most enticing features of the Scorpion ecosystem is its Buy-Back scheme. This system ensures a consistent passive income for all holders by using a portion of the platform\u2019s daily income to purchase $SCORP tokens. This is then split 50/50 with half of the tokens being burnt and therefore increasing the value of each $SCORP token. The other half is sent to token holders of $SCORP resulting in daily passive income.\n\nConsidering Scorpion Casino Token hasn\u2019t even launched yet, the upside potential of this token is huge. Some believe that in the coming years, the price of $SCORP could hit the $1 mark\n\nThe Future Looks Bright For Crypto\n\nThe crypto space is filled with volatility, making price predictions a challenging task. Yet, considering the intrinsic value and innovative solutions offered by Ethereum, XRP, and Scorpion Casino Token, it\u2019s apparent that these tokens have a promising future ahead. As with any investment, always conduct thorough research and only invest money that you are comfortable with potentially losing.\n\nGet $SCORP For The Lowest Possible Price, Find Out More Here:\n\nPresale: https://presale.scorpion.casino/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ScorpionCasino\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/scorpioncasino_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum's new two-tiered staking solution: A game changer for security and scalability - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In a significant move aimed at improving the security, efficiency, and scalability of the Ethereum network, the platform has recently shifted from its traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. This transition is seen as a crucial step in addressing some of the challenges and limitations that have plagued the staking process on Ethereum.\n\nWhile this transition holds immense promise, it is not without its hurdles, including the steep 32 ETH entry barrier for solo staking and concerns about centralization within staking pools. In response to these challenges, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has proposed an innovative two-tiered staking solution that promises to enhance the network\u2019s security and scalability.\n\nEthereum: The two-tiered staking solution\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s proposal revolves around the implementation of a two-tiered staking system, which introduces two distinct participant categories: node operators and delegators. This approach aims to strike a balance between security, decentralization, and accessibility within the Ethereum staking ecosystem.\n\nNode operators play a pivotal role in this new system by acting as validators. They commit a significant stake of 32 ETH while simultaneously running nodes responsible for handling transactions and generating new blocks. However, these operators are bound by strict ethical standards, and any engagement in malicious behavior exposes them to slashing penalties, which serve as a strong deterrent against misconduct.\n\nDelegators, on the other hand, possess stakes below the 32 ETH threshold required for solo staking. They are not involved in operating nodes themselves but have the freedom to assign their stakes to chosen node operators. This delegation allows them to support and engage with the consensus process in a lighter capacity. Delegators can carefully select the node operators they trust, fostering a sense of community and collaboration within the Ethereum network.\n\nBenefits of the two-tiered staking proposal\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s proposal offers a multitude of benefits, both from the network\u2019s perspective and for its users. One of the primary advantages of this proposal is the potential to significantly enhance scalability. By reducing the number of signatures required per block to approximately 10,000, the computational overhead is minimized, resulting in a more efficient network capable of processing a higher volume of transactions.\n\nThe two-tiered staking system raises the bar for potential attackers looking to gain control of a majority stake within the Ethereum network. This increased difficulty level serves to bolster network security and further decentralize the ecosystem, aligning with the core principles of blockchain technology.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal opens the door to more inventive and flexible staking solutions. It encourages the utilization of smart contracts and the adoption of liquidity tokens, among other mechanisms. This innovation not only diversifies the staking options available but also offers greater accessibility to a wider range of participants.\n\nFurthermore, the proposal suggests implementing these changes at various layers of abstraction within staking pools, between them, and within the Ethereum protocol itself. This approach allows for a gradual transition, minimizing disruptions while achieving the desired goal of a more secure and scalable network.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift to a two-tiered staking system, as proposed by Vitalik Buterin, marks a significant step forward in addressing the challenges associated with its transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. By striking a balance between node operators and delegators, this innovative solution promises improved security, scalability, and accessibility, ultimately paving the way for a more robust Ethereum ecosystem. As the Ethereum community embraces these changes, the future looks brighter than ever for this pioneering blockchain platform."

        "content": "In a game-changing move, Honda has entered the world of crypto. Teaming up with the blockchain payment platform called FCF Pay, they\u2019re revolutionizing the way people engage with their services. Not only that, but they\u2019re also shining the spotlight brighter onto Japan as a major player in the Web3 industry.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this exciting partnership and explore the potential impact it could have on the automotive and financial sectors.\n\nNext-Gen Partnerships\n\nHonda\u2019s exciting partnership with FCF Pay shows its commitment to innovation and staying ahead of the curve. This collaboration is set to revolutionize the way Honda customers make purchases, allowing them to use digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum instead of traditional fiat money.\n\nFCF Pay Who??\n\nFCF Pay is a popular blockchain payment platform that supports various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and even meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The collab between Honda and FCF Pay is a big step toward the widespread acceptance and use of crypto.\n\nJapan Is All In\n\nJapan is all in for Web3 innovation, as shown by the Web3 project team in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. They recently dropped a white paper with recommendations to boost Japan\u2019s Web3 sector, proving their commitment to leading the tech game. This move is a clear sign that Japan is serious about nurturing innovation and driving growth in the rapidly evolving Web3 world. They\u2019re definitely a global frontrunner\u2026\n\nHonda Isn\u2019t The First\n\nHonda wasn\u2019t actually the first Japanese car company to jump on the crypto train. SBI Motor, another big player in the industry, had already jumped on board by accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. And let\u2019s not forget the buzz that Tesla created when they announced they\u2019d be accepting Bitcoin and even Dogecoin for buying their cars (although they did change their minds later on).\n\nNissan has also been diving into the Web3 world, checking out metaverse-based vehicle sales for brands like Infiniti, Nismo, and Nissan. These advancements show how crypto is becoming more common in the automotive sector, reflecting the broader trend of digital currencies being adopted by various industries.\n\nPartnerships On Top Of Partnerships\n\nHSBC has partnered with FCF Pay to offer a convenient solution for cryptocurrency users, allowing them to utilize digital assets such as XRP, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin to pay off their mortgage bills and loans. This innovative collaboration aims to provide a seamless experience while retaining the essence of the original digital currency concept.

        "title": "Charles Hoskinson dismisses ETHGate scandal, argues Ethereum and XRP serve different ecosystems - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently fired back at allegations surrounding the ETHGate scandal. For those out of the loop, this scandal purports that members of the Ethereum community allegedly bribed U.S. regulatory officials. Hoskinson has fervently countered these claims, especially against critiques from the XRP community. Moreover, Hoskinson took to social media and an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session to clarify his position on the complex issue.\n\nHoskinson categorically emphasized the dissimilarities between Ethereum and Ripple\u2018s XRP. He underscored the absence of smart contracts in XRP\u2019s ecosystem. Additionally, while Ethereum has been concentrating on a proof of work model, Ripple has been zeroing in on banks to promote remittance relations. Hence, Hoskinson stated that Ripple was never a direct competitor or a threat to Ethereum. He also named other blockchain projects like Nxt and Bitshares as more significant challengers to Ethereum\u2019s space.\n\nRipple\u2019s CTO clashes with Hoskinson\u2019s view\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, offered an alternative viewpoint. Schwartz, differing from Hoskinson, argued that government favoritism in line with personal interests could be categorized as corruption. He dismissed Hoskinson\u2019s claim that the ETHGate scandal revealed only an \u201cunequal application\u201d of U.S. law rather than corruption. Schwartz expressed his thoughts via social media, igniting further debates within the crypto community.\n\nThe Ripple executive\u2019s comments have instigated debates that go beyond just the ETHGate scandal. Some community members are now questioning whether Hoskinson\u2019s defense might be stemming from his intent to protect his history with Ethereum. It\u2019s essential to note that Hoskinson was one of the eight co-founders of Ethereum and even served as its CEO for a brief period. After a public rift between the co-founders, he left Ethereum in 2014 to launch Cardano.\n\nHowever, both parties seem to agree on one point: The U.S. regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and XRP has been inconsistent. Despite former SEC director William Hinman classifying Ethereum as not a security back in 2018, the status of other cryptocurrencies like XRP remains unclear. This inconsistency has led to considerable hindrances in the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum.\n\nIn this debate, one thing becomes abundantly clear. The crypto world is not just about technology; it\u2019s also a field fraught with differing opinions on regulation, competition, and ethical considerations. The ETHGate scandal has merely peeled back a layer, revealing a host of complexities that market participants will have to navigate. Whether it\u2019s about defining what constitutes corruption or discussing which cryptocurrencies pose a real threat to Ethereum, the debate continues to rage, and resolution seems far from near."
