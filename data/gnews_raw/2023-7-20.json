        "title": "Ethereum (ETH): You Don't Want to Miss This Pattern - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, Ethereum has entered the ascending price channel, a pattern typically associated with an ongoing bullish trend. An ascending channel is characterized by two parallel trend lines, both slanting upward at the same angle, with the price oscillating between the upper and lower bounds.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is situated at the lower border of this channel. In previous instances, a touch at the lower trend line within this pattern often precedes a rally toward the upper boundary. If Ethereum follows this pattern, we could expect a bullish move in the near future.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Ethereum recently experienced a breakdown from the $2,000 level, a psychological barrier for many traders. This could apply some downward pressure on ETH. Yet, the current position on the ascending channel's lower border may provide enough support to counteract this bearish factor.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) - a popular momentum indicator - is presently hovering around the neutral 50 mark for Ethereum. This level often serves as a demarcation line between bullish and bearish market conditions. Notably, the RSI is maintaining its level above 50, implying that the prevailing uptrend could still have some steam.\n\nLastly, Ethereum's recent volatility appears to be lower than usual. In the world of cryptocurrencies, a decrease in volatility can often be a precursor to a significant price movement. A sudden surge in volatility could therefore potentially trigger a strong price swing for Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu is asleep\n\nIn the world of meme cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has held a significant place, with a community that is known for its zeal and resilience. However, recent market trends suggest dampening energy surrounding this token, with volatility significantly waning, putting SHIB in an anemic state.\n\nSHIB recently encountered a critical resistance level, which typically represents a price point that an asset struggles to break above due to heightened selling pressure. Unfortunately, as it stands, the token is experiencing a rapid reduction in volatility.\n\nAn asset without volatility may become less attractive for traders looking to capitalize on price swings. Therefore, the diminishing volatility of SHIB could lead to a potential increase in selling pressure, which is the last thing SHIB needs at this crucial juncture.\n\nThe current status of SHIB paints a picture of a token that is losing momentum. Unless the scenario changes - with an influx of positive news or an increase in its adoption - the current anemic state could continue.\n\nPEPE's bounce is possible\n\nThe meme-based cryptocurrency market has often showcased its unpredictable nature, with sudden price movements keeping investors and traders on their toes. One such crypto asset, Pepe (PEPE), a popular meme token, has been showing signs of a potential upward price trajectory. PEPE has once again touched its local low at approximately $0.0000015, an event that has historically led to price reversals.\n\nThis local low coincides with a 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level, as well as a support line on the token's local trend. The Exponential Moving Average is a type of weighted moving average that gives more weight to the latest data. In PEPE's case, the token's price has come to rest on this 50 EMA line, suggesting that it could potentially be in for a price boost.\n\nMoreover, this is not the first time such a price pattern has been noticed for PEPE. In the past, similar falls to this threshold have led to relatively swift price reversals. If the past is any indicator, and if the pattern continues to hold true, PEPE may be poised for a 10% run upward from its current position.\n\nOf course, any such prediction is contingent on a number of factors, including overall market sentiment, investor interest and the general performance of meme-based cryptocurrencies. With that said, the recent trend and historical data for PEPE give investors some cause for optimism."

        "content": "Interoperability protocol Rarimo is making Polygon ID, a verifiable credential infrastructure, available across multiple blockchains.\n\nRarimo announced the collaboration on Thursday, and now, users will be able to seamlessly use their credentials on the Ethereum network. Before the collaboration, a person\u2019s Polygon ID could only be used on the chain on which it was issued.\n\n\u201cThis meant that if you issued your credential on Polygon, you would not be able to use it on Ethereum. Instead, you would have to issue a new, Ethereum-native credential,\u201d Rarimo explained in a statement.\n\nNow that Ethereum has been included, credentials issued on Polygon will become available on BNB Chain and Avalanche in the coming weeks, according to Rarimo.\n\n\u201cAs the number of networks that Rarimo can scale to is limitless, a range of additional chains will be added with time,\u201d Rarimo added.\n\nPolygon ID was announced in March 2022 and the infrastructure stack was made open source in March of this year. The solution uses zero-knowledge proofs, which allow users to prove they are who they claim to be without needing to reveal their private information to outside parties. This ensures a high level of privacy and security during identity verification processes.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are a crucial component in the movement toward decentralized identity, the global market for which is expected to grow to $6.8 billion by 2027, according to MarketsandMarkets.\n\nOn Web2, the way individuals express their identity is dictated by giant companies like Meta and Google. The goal of decentralized identity is to flip the script. Whereas now, companies control when and where you share your data, the aim is to have companies request permission to verify your credentials.\n\nPolygon is just one player invested in ushering in this new way of thinking about identity. Disco, SpruceID, Iden3, Ceramic and the Ethereum Foundation are also exploring solutions on this front.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A mysterious wallet address that has existed since Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) inception has just moved its entire ETH stash after lying low for about eight years.\n\nAccording to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, the Ethereum whale received 61,216 ETH on July 30th of 2015 after participating in the second-largest crypto asset\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) the prior year.\n\nHours ago the whale transferred the entire ETH holdings to an address the blockchain tracker has identified as belonging to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe blockchain tracker says that the whale received the ETH from Ethereum\u2019s Genesis contract at an approximate cost of $0.31, translating to a profit of approximately 616,029% in about eight years. The entire ETH holding, which is now worth around $116.9 million, cost the whale slightly less than $19,000 at the time of the ICO.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,910 at time of writing.\n\nWhile the mysterious wallet now holds zero Ethereum, there are numerous other tokens that it owns.\n\nDuring Ethereum\u2019s ICO more than 50 million ETH were sold raising around $17.3 million at the time. Some of the proceeds went to the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation while a portion was allocated to the crypto asset\u2019s founding team.\n\nA similar transfer of Ethereum by a hitherto dormant whale of coins acquired during the crypto asset\u2019s early days occurred in April.

        "title": "Ethereum Consolidating For 6 Months. Good Or Bad? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum is now consolidating for 6 full months, in a narrow range between 1550 and 1950. In crypto terms, a consolidation of 6 months in a range of some 25% is pretty unusual. ETH is now even less volatile than BTC, which is also pretty unusual. Moreover, so far in 2023, ETH did not really participate to the crypto \u2018golden weeks\u2019 momentum trend(s). Crypto is known to be hyper-volatile. Consolidations tend to occur in a wider range, they also don\u2019t tend to last for long. Is this good or bad?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not about the consolidation that is good or bad, overall the longer the consolidation the better\u2026 it\u2019s really about the chart setup and structure.\n\nTruth to be told, the chart setup of ETH is very different compared to, for instance, XRP. It\u2019s no secret that the long term profile of XRP is amazing, as explained in XRP The Most Beautiful Long Term Crypto Chart Of 2023, and more recently in Our XRP Price Forecast Of 10 USD Is Now Confirmed. On the other hand, XRP holders had to wait for 2 full years to recover from the destructive impact that the SEC had created.\n\nIf we carefully look at the ETH chart, since it hit its ATH, we observe a few things:\n\nThe 6-month consolidation is orderly. We see a series of slightly higher lows, in fact it\u2019s a process that started around year-end. This is good, looks like ETH is gathering energy to create bullish momentum at a later point in time. In terms of resistance, it is blatantly clear how powerful resistance is right at the 50% retracement level (between its ATH and June 2022 lows), see the fine purple line on the chart. In August of 2022 as well as April of 2023, the 50% retracement level was tested. In the former situation, it resulted in a big drop. In the latter situation, we got a much softer drop. Overall, selling pressure is fading. That is, by far, the most important conclusion from this chart.\n\nThe last point is key, as it aligns with the overall rotational dynamics that characterize markets in the last 18 months. Rotation is huge, unusual, across all markets. Crypto is part of this dynamic, whether we like it or not.\n\nWe sense that both BTC and ETH are consolidating, right below their 50% retracement level, waiting in the queue of global markets, until its their turn to create bullish momentum.\n\nWe explained the \u2018golden weeks\u2019 concept in this article Crypto Investing Strategies Should Focus On Timing The \u2018Golden Weeks\u2019. In fact, the \u2018golden weeks\u2019 is the basis for our strategy in our premium crypto investing research service. ETH seems to be waiting, patiently, diligently, gathering steam, for its \u2018golden weeks\u2019 to come.\n\nThe only question, top of our mind, is from which level ETH will start a breakout and when exactly. The downside seems contained. Will ETH be able to break through 2000 USD this summer or this fall? We believe it will be either/or.\n\nIn the meantime, crypto enthusiasts can check out the crypto segment that is set up for outperformance whenever bullish momentum hits the crypto sector.

        "title": "Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The second quarter of 2023 brought significant challenges for the Ethereum network as its revenue experienced a sharp decline. Ethereum network revenue plummeted from $1.27 billion to $847 million during Q2, representing a staggering 33.3% drop.\n\nThe network revenue for Ethereum encompasses all transaction fees paid by users to Ether validators, as well as the portion of charges that are removed from circulation through burning.\n\nGiven this, the decline in revenue reflects the decrease in overall activity on the platform, especially in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, where developments have been far from welcoming.\n\nDuring Q2 2023, the DeFi market faced a lean period, characterized by a lack of significant growth and unfavorable events. Notably, hack incidents in the DeFi sector increased by a staggering 63% during the quarter, resulting in losses of $228 million across 79 hacks. This was confirmed by Arltduv, a Crypto Directory in a Twitter Post on July 20, 2023.\n\nThese incidents have had a negative impact on user confidence and contributed to the decline in the overall value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, with Ether-based protocols accounting for more than 90% of the total TVL.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Daily Active Addresses Decline\n\nIn addition to the revenue decline, Ethereum\u2019s daily active addresses experienced a notable drop of 6% during Q2 2023. The metric measures the number of unique wallet addresses that have conducted transactions on the Ether blockchain per day during the quarter. Despite the ongoing bear market, the decline in daily active addresses hasn\u2019t worsened significantly, indicating a level of resilience in user activity.\n\nETH price resting at $1,891 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum\u2019s performance during the second quarter suggests that while it faced challenges in network revenue and daily user engagement, the platform remains a key player in the DeFi space. The continuous efforts to improve the network\u2019s usability and scalability are crucial in attracting a broader user base, as demonstrated by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent proposal.\n\nETH Still King Of DeFi\n\nDespite the decline in daily users and network revenue, Ethereum has managed to maintain its spot as the leading blockchain when it comes to DeFi activity. The network currently accounts for more than 50% of Total Value Locked (TVL) across all blockchains, establishing it as the leader in this regard.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum and Polyon built atop the Ethereum network are also doing incredibly well. Arbitrum is currently sitting at $2.649 billion in TVL, with Polygon trailing behind at $1.044 billion in TVL.\n\nIn terms of price, ETH is still closely following the performance of Bitcoin. The altcoin is trading at $1,892 at the time of this writing, with meager gains of 0.07% in the last day.\n\nFeatured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Polyhedra Network \u2013 Proving full node of Ethereum in ZK - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Proving full nodes for Ethereum PoS is essential for security\n\nCompared to Ethereum light clients, the approach of proving Ethereum full nodes has much higher security guarantee. Ethereum light clients operate on a distinct algorithm, and their security relies entirely on a committee known as the \"sync committee.\" However, the sync committee's size is merely 512, rotating roughly daily (i.e., about 27.3 hours). The total staked assets amount to as few as 16384 ETH (calculated as 512 * 32), a figure quite negligible in comparison to the daily transactions volume on cross-chain bridges connecting Ethereum ecosystem with other networks.\n\nAnother issue is that the sync committee does not always sign the block. (e.g., block 17239413 and block 17239414). Statistics show that 1.6% blocks are not signed by the supermajority of the sync committee.\n\nSystem overview for proving Ethereum full nodes\n\nIn order to rectify these issues, Polyhedra Network has decided to get rid of the sync committee and utilize the full PoS consensus of the Ethereum blockchain, which has been deployed since the merge. This will incorporate more than 20,000 signatures (a 40-fold increase from the 512 sync committee) within a single block on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nTo manage the 40-times increase in workload, Polyhedra Network has employed its unique proof system\u2014deVirgo. This system boasts unrivaled processing capabilities, thanks to its theoretical enhancements and significant engineering advancements. deVirgo protocol theoretically eliminates the need for very large FFT or MSM, making the proof generation linear time to the number of signatures. The protocol has been deployed on zkBridge and supports parallel and distributed computation.\n\nExperiments on the proof system with a billion-size circuit revealed a proof generation time of less than 10 seconds, which matches the pace of Ethereum block generation, without increasing the proof size or verification time.\n\nEfficient proof system for proving Ethereum full nodes\n\nTo enable fast prover time for proving Ethereum full nodes, Polyhedra Network uses its efficient proof system, deVirgo. Devirgo is the distributed version of the Virgo protocol, and is designed to parallelize the GKR protocol by distributing the computation across multiple machines. With deVirgo, zkBridge can support swiftand flexible interoperability between different blockchains without relying on external trust assumptions. zkBridge also uses recursive proof to prove that the previously generated proof by deVirgo proves the corresponding block headers. The proof recursion reduces the on-chain verification cost to about 220K gas on any EVM-compatible blockchain network.`\n\nThe key insight of deVirgo is to explore the nature that the verification of Ethereum full consensus can be represented as a data-parallel circuit. Suppose there is a data-parallel arithmetic circuit \ud835\udc36 as well as N machines. The deVirgo proof system can divide the data-parallel circuit into N sub-circuits, with each machine computing only one sub-circuit. Verification of Ethereum full consensus is such a data-parallel circuit, and it can contain more than 30k of identical signature verification algorithms and hashes.\n\nCentral to deVirgo is a technique to distribute the sumcheck. In deVirgo, the sumcheck protocol is divided into two phases. In Phase 1, each machine processes their own sub-circuit and collectively generates one aggregated proof. The remaining work will be small enough for a single machine, which executes Phase 2 that concludes the distributed sumcheck.\n\nPerformance evaluation for proving Ethereum full nodes\n\nTo evaluate the implementation on BLS signature aggregation, Polyhedra Network measured the running time of the deVirgo prover and recursive verifier using two AMD EPYC\u2122 7763 CPUs. The result is summarized in the following list:\n\nPolyhedra Network has deployed Ethereum full-nodeproof system on zkBridge. zkBridge sets Ethereum as the sender chain, and other networks such as BNB Chain and Avalanche as the receiver chain. The result shows that zkBridge can generate the Ethereum full-node proofs and verify the block header on BNB Chain and other networks within 12 seconds including the delays of all the components.\n\nPolyhedra Network will continue optimizing the implementation. GPU acceleration is planned in the near future, which can lower the up-front cost for better decentralization. Nevertheless the current zkBridge proof system is efficient enough to catch up with the block time of Ethereum.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThrough the implementation of proving the Ethereum full nodes, Polyhedra Network enables fully trustless, efficient, and secure interoperability using zkBridge, to connect Ethereum ecosystems (both L1 and L2s) with other networks.\n\nzkBridge is the first trustless, efficient, secure, and universal cross-chain bridge with advanced zero-knowledge proof technology. zkBridge uses zero-knowledge proofs to efficiently convince the receiver chain that a certain state transition happened on the sender chain. With zero-knowledge proofs, zkBridge offers both strong security and a significant reduction in on-chain verification cost, without relying on external assumptions.\n\nFurthermore, zkBridge also allows transmission of current and historical Ethereum data, including the blockheader and transaction data, to be accessible by any other blockchain ecosystems and applications. This will enable any smart contract on any blockchain to trustlessly access Ethereum data and compute on top of the Ethereum data. All the security will be guaranteed by proving Ethereum PoS full nodes by using the efficient proof system of zkBridge."

        "content": "Here\u2019s an EthCC recap for those who couldn\u2019t make it to Paris this year\n\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nWelcome back to Chain Reaction.\n\nThe Paris-based Ethereum Community Conference, EthCC, happened this week and brought in more than 350 speakers and 5,000 attendees.\n\nWhile I wasn\u2019t able to make it to the largest annual European Ethereum-focused event, I kept a close eye on what was transpiring there from my NYC apartment so I can give TechCrunch readers a high-level overview and save them a couple thousand dollars on a trip to Paris (even though a vacation, I mean work trip, there does sound nice).\n\nHere are a few panels from some major organizations that caught my eye:\n\nEthereum Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, dove into the history of account abstraction and how developers have been working on it, even before the layer-1 blockchain network launched. Buterin discussed the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal, a change that could allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. If successful, this upgrade could potentially improve global web3 adoption by making crypto wallets as easy to use as an email account.\n\na16z Web3 has the potential to fix social media and consumer applications, Sriram Krishnan, general partner of a16z crypto, said during a keynote presentation. He believes now is the time to build \u201clarge-scale crypto consumer social media marketplace applications.\u201d Chris Lyons, general partner of web3 media at a16z, talked about \u201chiding the wires\u201d and how that can be the biggest opportunity in crypto to grow to 100 million users.\n\nReddit Mirela Spasova, Reddit\u2019s senior engineer manager for collectible avatars, shared the platform\u2019s primary mission to onboard millions of users into digital collectibles, like it did last year. Today Reddit has onboarded more than 8 million users to its wallets and digital collectibles and made over $1 million in revenue for 30 to 100 creators, she noted.\n\nChainlink Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink co-founder, discussed Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which recently launched on mainnet on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon blockchains. The launch of CCIP aims to focus on creating a \u201csecure and reliable internet of contracts,\u201d Nazarov noted. \u201cThe better the applications you build, the more attractive this whole blockchain thing will be, for all the people with money whether they\u2019re big banks, individuals or asset managers.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Base Jesse Pollak, lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, talked about the layer-2 blockchain\u2019s plan to become decentralized. \u201cIf you look at the pre-internet area, if you were a developer you had a hard time building products for the world.\u201d Then the internet came around and opened up the ability to build applications, Pollak said. The online era will be replaced by the onchain worlds through blockchain technology, Pollak believes. \u201cNow we\u2019re on the precipice of that changing with us moving from an online platform to an onchain platform.\u201d Also next week, Optimism, an Ethereum-focused layer-2 project, will release an \u201copen neutrality framework\u201d with a focus on decentralization guidelines, Pollak said, and Base will follow it, too. The framework plans to provide principles for networks that aim to be decentralized.\n\nAave Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave Companies, announced the launch of Lens Protocol V2, an upgrade to the web3 product aimed at creating a decentralized social networking ecosystem. The new iteration will have upgrades like \u201copen actions\u201d that connect onchain elements to social content so web3 experiences can become social ones, Kulechov noted. \u201cEffectively we\u2019ll have an internet that benefits all and people-powered social networks where you\u2019ll have a say in how the network will evolve in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis week in web3\n\nThe latest pod\n\nOn our latest episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Maria Shen, a general partner on the investment team at Electric Capital, an early-stage venture firm focused on crypto, blockchain, fintech and marketplaces.\n\nBefore Electric Capital, Maria was the CTO and co-founder of Bambify, a startup that helped small to medium-sized businesses create more efficient supply chains with manufacturers globally. Prior to that, she worked at Microsoft.\n\nIn March 2022, the firm announced that it closed $1 billion for a pair of crypto funds \u2014 a $400 million vehicle for making equity investments in startups and a $600 million fund intended to invest directly in crypto tokens. Its website currently showcases a portfolio with about 75 investments with crypto startups like Magic Eden, ConsenSys and Bitwise, to name a few.\n\nMore recently, Electric Capital put out a report that showed the number of blockchain developers in the U.S. has declined every year since 2017, dropping to 29% last year from 40% in 2017. We dove into what that report really means and how it will affect the growth of developers domestically and internationally.\n\nWe discussed which crypto sectors Maria is watching for investments, why she\u2019s betting big on NFTs and the general venture capital market sentiment.\n\nWe also talked about:\n\nU.S. regulatory impact on investments\n\nThe bear market\n\nTrends she\u2019s following\n\nAdvice for founders\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nAlso check out Jacquelyn as a guest on Boys Club, where she dives into her backstory, what it\u2019s like covering crypto, the state of the industry, trends she\u2019s following and more.\n\nFollow the money\n\nP0x Labs, the team behind Mantra Network, raised $25 million at $500 million valuation Binance Labs invested $10 million into lending and borrowing protocol Radiant Capital RISC Zero raised $40 million to bring blockchains more advanced cryptographic tools Web3 infrastructure provider Cosmic Wire raised $30 million in a seed round AI and metaverse-focused Futureverse raised $54 million in a Series A round\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re reading\n\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "content": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction; BTC and ETH Slip Nearly 5%: Potential Weekend Bounce?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, have experienced a significant slip, with BTC currently trading at $29,780 and ETH at $1,889.\n\nAs investors closely monitor these developments, delving into the technical outlook becomes essential to determine the potential price action in the coming days.\n\nThis Bitcoin and Ethereum price prediction aims to analyze the recent price movements and explore the possibility of a bounce-off before the weekend for both BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Bitcoin trades slightly above a significant support level of $29,500.\n\nThis support level is further validated by the presence of a triple bottom pattern observed in the four-hour timeframe.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators both indicate a bearish sentiment, with the RSI at 42 and the MACD hovering below 0.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day exponential moving average acts as a resistance level at $29,995, just below the psychological level of $30,000.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood of Bitcoin maintaining a bearish stance below $30,000 is significant.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nThe cryptocurrency may encounter further downward pressure if it breaches the $29,500 support level, potentially reaching the next support at $28,900.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to break below $29,500 could trigger a bullish rebound, initially pushing the price toward $30,000 and possibly surpassing $30,500 in a bullish crossover.\n\nNotably, a surge in demand for Bitcoin leading to a breakthrough above $30,450 could drive the price toward the next resistance level at $31,200.\n\nAs a result, closely monitoring the $29,500 level becomes crucial, as a move above this point could present a buying opportunity, while a break below it may prompt selling positions.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nLooking at Ethereum from a technical standpoint, the cryptocurrency currently trades within a narrow range, with $1,920 serving as resistance and $1,880 as support.\n\nDoji and spinning top candlestick patterns in this range indicate that investors are uncertain and eagerly awaiting significant developments that could trigger a breakout in either direction.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators both suggest a neutral stance.\n\nThe RSI hovers around the 50 level, signaling a lack of clear market trends. However, the MACD histogram oscillates below the zero line, implying a slight bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day exponential moving average aligns around $1,920, with Ethereum\u2019s price moving above and below this level, reflecting investor indecisiveness.\n\nEthereum Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nShould Ethereum surpass the $1,920 level, it holds the potential to target resistance at $1,945 or $1,975, indicating a continuation of the upward trend.\n\nConversely, a bearish breakdown below $1,900 could lead to a price decline towards $1,880 or even lower to $1,845.\n\nIn conclusion, closely monitoring the $1,900 level is essential, as a decisive move above or below this point could signal a shift in the market trend.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay informed about the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring our carefully selected collection of the top 15 digital assets to watch in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring that you receive professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the game and discover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the ever-changing world of digital assets.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker \u2013 Source: Cryptonews\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication \u2013 cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research."

Discover SCENE\n\nHackers have hit decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Conic Finance with an attack and drained 1,700 Ethereum\u2014worth over $3.2 million at current prices.\n\nIn a Friday tweet, the protocol said it was \u201ccontinuing to investigate the root cause of the exploit and are consulting with relevant parties.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the DeFi protocol later said the root cause was a \"re-entrancy attack,\" adding that \"a fix to the affected contract is being deployed.\" In a follow-up, the team claimed that withdrawals were safe and said that a more detailed post mortem was forthcoming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stolen crypto was all sent to one address, blockchain security company Beosin said in a tweet, linking to the transaction.\n\nSeems @ConicFinance was exploited for $3.26M in tx: https://t.co/K0VjnFprAE The stolen funds were sent to 0x3d32C5a2E592c7B17e16bdDc87EAb75f33ae3010 pic.twitter.com/mZr4MOkMQF \u2014 Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) July 21, 2023\n\nConic Finance is a new app which lets users deposit tokens into its \u201comnipools,\u201d allowing them to earn rewards. The idea is that users can diversify funds across the Curve decentralized exchange using Conic\u2019s liquidity pools.\n\nHackers targeted the Ethereum omnipool. Conic Finance has since said deposits have now been disabled to that pool.\n\nExploits like this one are very common in the DeFi space\u2014the crypto sphere which aims to replace traditional financial services like borrowing and lending via blockchain technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpdate: - We are continuing to investigate the root cause of the exploit and are consulting with relevant parties. - We have disabled ETH Omnipool deposits on the Conic front end. https://t.co/Oln0zh2nCs \u2014 Conic Finance (@ConicFinance) July 21, 2023\n\nSuch apps are new and experimental and therefore sometimes have systems which hackers can take advantage of. Last year was the \u201cthe biggest year ever for hacking\u201d in the crypto space according to blockchain data firm Chainalysis.\n\nMost of those attacks happen in the DeFi space. DeFi traders lost $228 million in just three months of Q2 this year alone, a 63% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nAccording to Immunefi, most of the crypto losses originated from two specific incidents\u2014the June 3 hack of Atomic Wallet and the May 23 exit scam by the now-defunct Fintoch platform.\n\nThe company also found that some chains were targeted more than others. It found that attacks on BNB Chain and Ethereum made up 77% of all losses in the last quarter, followed by Arbitrum at 12%. They said that attacks on Arbitrum were notable, given that it experienced no incidents at all in the same period last year."

        "content": "Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nsteady value rise in the world\u2019s most influential blockchain, Ethereum (ETH), has spotlighted the altcoin market. Here, we have Celo and the lesser-known VC Spectra (SPCT). Yet, the latter will gradually become a household name among the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Celo.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the price implications for each project and see how VC Spectra (SPCT) beats them all.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCelo Set To Return To Its Roots By Being An Ethereum L2 Again\n\nThe latest news for Celo is a return to being an Ethereum-based layer-2 solution after being an independent blockchain. After months of deliberation, the developers proposed to transition back to its predecessor on Celo\u2019s governance forum.\n\nThis has been well-received by Celo\u2019s community, resulting in a minor 22% boost in value on July 17, 2023, from $0.50 to $0.61. Yet, it quickly dropped to $0.52.\n\nStill, Celo faces stiff competition as it\u2019s ranked far lower in market cap rankings. This also means it\u2019s a riskier investment than its predecessor, Ethereum (ETH), but could grow more under the right circumstances.\n\nMany predictions have pegged Celo to be worth a maximum of $1, almost double its current value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Barely Breaks The $2,000 Level\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) price has yet to confidently breach the $2000 level on several occasions of late. Data from Lookonchain reveals that a \u2018whale\u2018 recently sold $2.78 million of ETH. This was when the value got boosted after the favorable outcome in the SEC vs. XRP lawsuit.\n\nStill, investors are confident the price will eventually break the $2000 mark as a blockchain that experiences new developments. The latest is the launch of the multi-collateral stablecoin, GHO, on Ethereum (ETH) via the Aave Protocol.\n\nWith all this in mind, predictions peg Ethereum (ETH) to be worth a maximum of $2500 by 2024.\n\nCelo isn\u2019t the blockchain looking to leverage the power of Ethereum (ETH). VC Spectra (SPCT) is also built atop the latter to deliver next-generation asset management.\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) Price Set To Leapfrog 627%\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) is a novel crypto-based asset management and trading platform for expert-vetted blockchain and technology start-ups. The platform utilizes the power of smart contracts to provide freedom and autonomy for investors.\n\nUsers have custody over their assets, manage their portfolios in real-time, and automatically receive profits from the invested projects without human intervention.\n\nAside from seeking alpha, VC Spectra (SPCT) is committed to impacting the world positively. Thus, it will fund companies that are socially responsible and sustainable.\n\nThe Spectra token (SPCT) is the icing on the cake for users. One of the benefits of a decentralized platform is that participants can govern it. Just as Celo\u2019s community had a say in the recent proposal, the same applies to VC Spectra (SPCT).\n\nSPCT offers voting power where the more tokens one holds, the more influential their vote becomes. Moreover, it provides other benefits like quarterly dividends and entry into exclusive discounted pre-ICOs.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) achieved a new milestone by entering Stage 2 of its presale. SPCT, available on the ERC20 and BRC20 networks, is trading at $0.011. This is predicted to increase value by 81.81% in the next stage to $0.02.\n\nYet, it gets better as experts believe the token should be worth $0.08 when VC Spectra (SPCT) launches, representing a 7.27x gain for those buying at $0.011.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

Because of the benefits of dApps, many businesses are looking for good ways to make their own dApps. But you should highlight the important tools that are needed to make dApps, like Ethereum RPC nodes that run on Remote Procedure Call protocols. Why do RPC nodes exist in Ethereum? The answer is clear from how a decentralised application is put together. Decentralized apps are like regular apps but can talk to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor decentralised apps to read data from the Ethereum blockchain or send requests for transactions to the network, they need to talk to the blockchain. RPC nodes come into play at this point. In the next post, you\u2019ll learn about the basics of ETH RPC nodes and how they work. You can run your own configuration or use a platform like Alchemy to learn how to run RPC nodes on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow important RPC is\n\nBefore you read a guide to Ethereum RPC nodes, you need to know what RPC is and why it\u2019s important. Decentralized apps always need information from the blockchain to do things like send transactions, check the state of the blockchain, and get block data. Nodes could use Remote Procedure Calls, or RPC, to connect dApps to the blockchain and do these things. RPC nodes help web3 apps talk to blockchain networks and make it easier for users to get to their data.\n\nRPC, which stands for \u201cRemote Procedure Call,\u201d is a light software communication protocol that lets a client or dApp talk to a remote programme or server. The server could be hosted on a different network, and the client could connect to the server through RPC without knowing the details of the server network. When the use of RPC Nodes in Ethereum is fully explained, examples would be given of how RPC can be used from a local computer to ask for resources from a remote server system.\n\nAfter the client makes a request, the request tells the server to run the procedure through a subroutine. When it comes to blockchain networks, a decentralised app (dApp) needs data from the blockchain network to work right. In RPC client-server mode, the client is the dApp, and the server is the RPC node.\n\nWhat Does Ethereum RPC Node Mean?\n\nIf you were talking about RPC nodes, the most obvious thing to bring up would be what they are. What is an Ethereum RPC node? The answers would show that RPC nodes are computers with blockchain client software on them. An RPC node could, for example, point to servers that run Ethereum\u2019s Consensus Layer and Execution Layer infrastructure.\n\n$STRONG Q: *All StrongBlock Ethereum 1.0 nodes were resynced as of 10/11/2021. You may once again use your node\u2019s RPC endpoint for your wallet and other node activities. Thanks for your patience. What does it mean ? \u2014 BaconEsq (@baconesq) October 16, 2021\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network has different kinds of nodes, such as light nodes, archival nodes, and full nodes. Solana blockchain, on the other hand, has a validator and RPC nodes. The validator nodes are the ones that run the Solana consensus protocol and get paid for validating blocks. Solana\u2019s RPC nodes let dApps connect to the blockchain and get the information they need.\n\nYou could also learn about the importance of RPC endpoints by talking about any RPC Nodes Ethereum example. RPC endpoints are the places on the network to which a dApp sends RPC requests to get to server data. After dApps and RPC endpoints are linked, users can do things requiring real-time blockchain data access.\n\nRPC requests could be handled by any node that had the right software installed. RPC endpoints that run on a node usually have a service that helps dApps get information from users about the blockchain. Because of this, all RPC endpoints work with RPC nodes, and all RPC nodes have RPC endpoints.\n\nDifferent kinds of Ethereum RPC Endpoints\n\nBeginners would also learn about the different kinds of RPC endpoints when they were introduced to RPC nodes in Ethereum. On the Ethereum network, there are two main types of node RPC endpoints: those that are public and those that are private. Also, both public and private RPC endpoints can work with the help of alternative RPC endpoints. The alternative endpoints can help applications keep backups of RPC endpoints and deal with problems when they happen. Let\u2019s take a look at how the different kinds of RPC endpoints work.\n\nEndpoint for public RPC\n\nIn the outline of answers to the question \u201cWhat is an RPC node in Ethereum?\u201d public RPC endpoints are given. Public RPC endpoints are shared resources that run on RPC nodes and allow anyone to send requests. But public RPC endpoints don\u2019t work with production-ready apps and don\u2019t have ways to help customers. At the same time, public RPC endpoints don\u2019t have developer infrastructure or the ability to grow or shrink depending on how many dApps are running. The public RPC endpoints can only be used to let anyone get information from the blockchain network.\n\nPrivate Endpoint for RPC\n\nA guide on ETH RPC Nodes talks about private RPC endpoints as the next type of RPC endpoint. Such endpoints work to meet the needs of a single decentralised app and ignore requests from other apps. So, private RPC endpoints might be faster and more reliable with RPC nodes. Private RPC nodes could work if users asked them to. Also, the private RPC endpoints make it easier to keep explicit service-level agreements, or SLAs, which ensure better performance.\n\nA Different RPC Endpoint\n\nBecause of how they work, the alternative RPC endpoints are an important part of the guide to Ethereum RPC nodes. Alternative RPC endpoints help keep your system from going down because they act as backup endpoints. The alternative RPC endpoints are a key part of making sure your dApps run smoothly for your users. One of the best ways to keep dApps from having a single point of failure is to build them with more than one RPC endpoint.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ethereum and NFTs: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nHow Ethereum RPC Nodes Work\n\nThe next most important thing to talk about when explaining RPC Nodes Ethereum for beginners is how they work. The definition of RPC nodes gives a general idea of how they work by linking dApps to data on the blockchain. When a dApp starts a subroutine or asks for data from the Ethereum blockchain, RPC nodes get to work. Then, the RPC node can get the required requests from the blockchain and send the required payload to the dApps.\n\nJSON-RPC Protocol\n\nIn an Ethereum guide to how RPC nodes work, the JSON-RPC protocol would be the most important thing to talk about. It is a lightweight RPC protocol that doesn\u2019t keep track of state and can define different data structures and the rules for how they should be processed. The way data is transferred doesn\u2019t matter for the JSON-RPC protocol because the same process works with HTTP and sockets as well as JSON-RPC. The JSON (RFC 4627) data format is used by JSON-RPC. The JSON-RPC protocol has also become popular because it can receive and process data requests more quickly.\n\nBy using the client-server model as an example, you can better understand how the JSON-RPC protocol works. From the perspective of traditional client-server models, the dApp is the client, and the RPC endpoint is the server. In this case, the Ethereum RPC nodes would use JSON-RPC to define specific methods for requesting services from the node. Users can use the methods defined in the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s JSON-RPC API to request blockchain data for dApps.\n\nThe next important part of the JSON-RPC protocol description focuses on core methods. Ethereum has a number of core methods that use JSON-RPC to get information from the blockchain network. There are chatter methods, history methods, and state methods among the JSON-RPC methods.\n\nWhen the RPC node\u2019s Ethereum example is looked at, it would show how each method works. For example, gossip methods can be used to find the head of the blockchain and the blocks that are important. On the other hand, state methods return reports about how the data on the whole blockchain is currently set up. History methods, as their name suggests, work to get the history of any block on the chain.\n\nWhen a user action needs data from the blockchain, the client or the dApp will use JSON-RPC to start requests or subroutines. The dApp would make the requests through RPC nodes, and the node would send back the information that the dApp needs.\n\nThe best way to use RPC nodes\n\nThe \u201cWhat is an RPC node in Ethereum?\u201d guides also talk about the best ways to use RPC nodes. How could a developer of decentralised applications use RPC nodes in their apps? When such questions are asked, the answers point to three different ways of doing things: using private RPC endpoints, running self-hosted nodes, or sending traffic through public RPC nodes. Let\u2019s go over the details of how to use RPC nodes with different methods in the best way.\n\nRPC Node Providers\n\nUsing a private RPC endpoint from an RPC node provider is the first step to using Ethereum RPC nodes. One of the first benefits of using RPC node providers is that they take care of setting up, managing, and maintaining nodes for your decentralised applications (dApps). RPC node providers work to make sure that dApps run smoothly, and most web3 developers choose node providers.\n\nThe best blockchain node providers have features built in for setting up and maintaining nodes. So, they can help developers save time, money, and effort while making new solutions for end users. Alchemy, which can offer Ethereum RPC node endpoints, would be a good example of a well-known RPC node in an Ethereum example. Here are some of the steps you need to take to use Alchemy\u2019s RPC node infrastructure.\n\nStart by making an account on Alchemy.\n\nUse the \u201cCreate App\u201d button on the dashboard to make your dApp.\n\nGive your dApp a name and pick the blockchain and network you want to use.\n\nTo start sending RPC requests to the new node, click the \u201cView Key\u201d button on the dashboard and copy the URL.\n\nThe simple steps show how easy it is to start working with an Ethereum blockchain RPC node provider.\n\nHaving a self-hosted RPC node running\n\nIn a guide to Ethereum RPC nodes, the main reason to have a self-hosted RPC node would be to have more control. If you run your own node, there may be some costs and benefits. Self-hosted nodes, on the other hand, could help web3 developers and technical teams have complete control over how nodes are set up. Here is a high-level look at some of the most important steps for setting up your own ETH RPC nodes.\n\nWhen setting up a self-hosted node, the first thing you need to do is define the RPC node configuration. For the execution layer and the consensus layer, you must describe the client implementation or the node client software. The hardware and system environments, as well as the client settings, must be set in the RPC node configuration.\n\nIn the second step of setting up your RPC nodes, Ethereum said you must choose a guided setup service or install the node manually through a Command Line Interface or CLI.\n\nLastly, self-hosted nodes also put a lot of emphasis on keeping your RPC node in good shape.\n\nUsing public RPC endpoints to send traffic\n\nSending traffic through public RPC endpoints would be the next popular best practice for using RPC nodes. Depending on the blockchain network, you could send requests to find public RPC endpoint offerings by referring to the blockchain documentation. After that, you can route traffic through the public RPC endpoints using the URL. But the rate limits on public endpoints make it hard for developers to make dApps.\n\nLast Words\n\nRPC Nodes and how they work The Ethereum example shows how Remote Procedure Calls can be used in dApp development in a useful way. If you look closely, you\u2019ll see that RPC nodes are an important part of the future of web3 development. At the same time, the ways that public, private, and alternative RPC endpoints work show how useful they are for making dApps. With node providers, developers could be helped by not having to worry about setting up or maintaining nodes.\n\nOn the other hand, knowing the best ways to set up RPC nodes is also important. Depending on the use cases, some methods have pros and cons that make them better or worse. So, to learn more about how well it works, you should read the Ethereum RPC node documentation."

        "content": "Despite the crypto market\u2019s turn toward a cautiously positive sentiment, things aren\u2019t looking good for Ethereum\u2019s competitors, according to Jonah Van Bourg.\n\nOn the 1000X podcast (Spotify/Apple), Cumberland\u2019s global head of trading says user counts and wallet addresses have plateaued on alternative layer-1 blockchains.\n\n\u201cYour Solanas, NEARs and Polkadots \u2014 and all these other coins \u2014 these ecosystems are dead on arrival at this point.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are flourishing, Van Bourg says. According to Blockworks Research, the TVL, or total value locked \u2014 a measure of the monetary value that resides in a blockchain\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 is comparatively low on competing chains.\n\nThe current total value locked in Solana stands at approximately $320 million, a little more than one percent of Ethereum\u2019s TVL, which is currently around $26 billion.\n\nEthereum-based layer-2 chains Arbitrum and Optimism are trending positively and already overshadow Solana\u2019s TVL with values of approximately $2 billion and $900 million, respectively.\n\nChart by Blockworks Research analyst Spencer Hughes\n\n\u201cSo is the multichain thesis still alive for the next cycle?\u201d Van Bourg asks. \u201cI vote no. I think it\u2019s time to write it off.\u201d\n\nThe greed factor\n\nAvi Feldman, GoldenTree\u2019s head of digital asset trading, is quick to disagree.\n\n\u201cGreed is too large to write it off,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get projects that are willing to build on things like Solana and Avalanche and NEAR and all of these other protocols because if they\u2019re a competent, good team, they can win that space.\u201d\n\nIncentive programs will draw value to competing protocols, Felman argues, \u201cwhen the bull market comes back.\u201d\n\nBut incentive programs have been the \u201conly draw\u201d for the competing chains, Van Bourg retorts. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\nFelman expects competing chains to experience a \u201crenaissance\u201d due to their novelty and the \u201cgreed factor,\u201d arguing that by onboarding people with incentives, they may potentially reach \u201cescape velocity\u201d to become \u201creal projects.\u201d\n\nReferring to a previous interview with Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz (Spotify/Apple), Van Bourg says the next bull cycle will be the \u201cshow me\u201d stage of crypto, whereby projects need to prove their worth at a practical level.\n\n\u201cWhat computational ability is possible on Solana that isn\u2019t possible on Arbitrum or Optimism at this point?\u201d he asks.\n\nFelman says it\u2019s not so much about the tech itself, but instead a matter of \u201cuse-case fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe constraint is not always the tech. The constraint is figuring out what to do with the tech,\u201d he says.\n\nVan Bourg agrees, but suggests that the argument only further proves his point. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t about the tech, what\u2019s the advantage of one shiny alt-L1 versus another versus ETH?\u201d Ethereum, he says, \u201cgives you everything you need right now for today\u2019s limited slate of use-cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf ETH was bowling over because of too many people trying to use it or too much throughput,\u201d Van Bourg says, \u201cthen you have an alt-L1 thesis right there.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto die-hards like to say \u201cwe\u2019re early\u201d amid the peaks and valleys of the market, but what really feels early much of the time is the tooling.\n\nCymbal, which bills itself as the first \u201chuman readable\u201d Ethereum block explorer, aims to move that forward, launching in beta today.\n\nBlockchain explorers like Etherscan are essential tools for builders and traders alike, but they\u2019re densely packed with data and very difficult for the average user to navigate, let alone understand. That's where Cymbal sees an opening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt takes the same kind of public blockchain data that\u2019s flowing through standard explorers and turns it into a feed that\u2019s not only visual and easily understandable at a glance, but also social.\n\n\u201cToday, tools like Etherscan are the best in class for looking at the blockchain\u2014but they resemble command line interfaces. We want to get to the GUI,\u201d Cymbal CEO and co-founder Eric Feng told Decrypt, alluding to the past computing shift from text-based navigation to graphical user interfaces.\n\nCymbal looks more like a social network than a pure data resource, serving up dashboards that take transaction details and wrap them up with NFT artwork\u2014from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other top collections\u2014along with data trends, public information on known wallet owners, relevant news stories from media outlets, and more.\n\nIt also runs that data through an AI tool to generate a conversational summary of transactions and trends, to make things even more understandable for the average user. Feng said that Cymbal is running the tool through OpenAI\u2019s GPT large language model.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCymbal is launching with a focus on NFTs, but Feng said that richer data regarding cryptocurrency and token transactions will be added in time, as his team works to \u201cbuild out a full Etherscan replacement.\u201d Support for the Solana blockchain is coming in a matter of weeks, he added, with Ethereum scaling network Polygon not far behind.\n\nFeng said that Cymbal started with NFTs for a couple of reasons. The tokens are often tied to artwork, which makes them visual in nature\u2014ideal for this kind of platform. NFTs are also often the first way that people are onboarded into the crypto space these days, he added, and that accessibility layer also played a role in Cymbal\u2019s decision-making.\n\n\u201cWe consider NFTs to be the gateway to Web3,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nA screenshot of the Cymbal interface. Image: Cymbal\n\nCymbal looks like a social network, and it can be used like one too. Users can follow wallets and projects, plus wallet owners can claim their own page and then personalize it to become a \u201cWeb3 profile\u201d of sorts, Feng said. He suggested potential messaging, content publishing, and other social features to come in time.\n\nThe startup has raised a total of $18.5 million to date with notable investors in the mix, including Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures, CAA Connect Ventures, UTA Ventures, Shima Capital, and Google Ventures (GV). Notable angel investors include Kleiner Perkins\u2019 John Doerr, Dapper Labs co-founder Roham Gharegozlou, and outgoing Polygon Labs president Ryan Wyatt.\n\nFeng\u2014a former CTO at Hulu and veteran of Meta and Microsoft\u2014said that Cymbal sees revenue-generating opportunities with targeted advertising based on wallet data, along with selling its curated data to app builders via API access. He said it\u2019s akin to business models used by other block explorers, as well as crypto price trackers.\n\nCymbal is positioned as a way to not only help the average NFT and crypto user better understand the blockchain space, but also help expand the industry as more accessible tools come online.\n\n\u201cThere is a subset of hardcore crypto people that can read Etherscan, just like there's people in \u2018The Matrix\u2019 that could look at the green squiggly lines and understand what's going on,\u201d Feng told Decrypt. \u201cGreat. This is not for them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt's for the masses,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's not the tens of thousands of hardcore crypto people right now. It's for the tens of millions of people that hopefully will come into the ecosystem if we can create better tooling for them.\u201d"

        "content": "Canadian crypto miner HIVE Digital Technologies wants to use Ordinals in one of its AI initiatives, inscribing generative art on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with the help of old Ethereum mining rigs.\n\nHIVE CEO Aydin Kilic described the project as an exercise in technical prowess for one of crypto\u2019s largest miners. He told Decrypt that Ordinals provides a new way for the firm to use its fleet of data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs, which it\u2019s been using to mine altcoins after Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake during the \u201cmerge\u201d and made miners obsolete.\n\n\u201cWe will create generative AI art with our own GPUs, on our own fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion, [...] and then use our hash power on the Bitcoin network to inscribe those on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Is 'The Merge'? Ethereum\u2019s Move to Proof of Stake\n\nOrdinals launched earlier this year, and the buzzy Bitcoin protocol has led to a wave of innovation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin. As a way for people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d data on individual satoshi, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin, Ordinals has also been a significant windfall for Bitcoin miners that benefit from elevated transaction fees.\n\nEven though Bitcoin transaction fees from Ordinals inscriptions have cooled over the past couple of months\u2014fervor surrounding BRC-20 tokens, which are built on top of Bitcoin using Ordinals, sent them sky high\u2014Kilic said HIVE is definitely \u201cstill leaning into them.\u201d\n\nKilic compared the initiative to jet fighter squadrons like the Blue Angels who show off their skills by flying in tight formations. He described HIVE\u2019s project as ambitious because it taps so many different segments of HIVE\u2019s business, including its cloud computing platforms and custom versions of AI models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nBitcoin Mining Revenue Hits $184 Million in Q2 Amid Ordinals Fervor\n\n\u201cWe want to do a soup-to-nuts AI and Ordinals project that\u2019s fully integrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of our core competencies as a technology leader in the AI and Bitcoin space.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from creating a digital art pipeline, Kilic said HIVE is working with its custody providers to start transacting uncommon sats found through Ordinals. Uncommon sats, which are valued at a premium, are the first sat of each Bitcoin block. Kilic said HIVE has 272 of them. Sat is a common abbreviation for satoshi, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin that data is inscribed on.\n\nWhen Ethereum shifted to proof-of-stake last year, it changed the way that transactions are verified on the network and greatly reduced its energy consumption. With Bitcoin, miners use large amounts of energy to verify transactions through proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum Energy Usage, Carbon Footprint Down 99.99% After Merge: Report\n\nAfter Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, HIVE said it was exploring alternatives to Ethereum mining. Developing a generative art pipeline using new technologies fits into HIVE\u2019s overall corporate strategy of maximizing resources, Kilic said.\n\nHIVE went public in 2017 and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the HIVE.V symbol. It has also traded on the Nasdaq since 2021 under the HIVE symbol. Shares of HIVE currently change hands at $5.66, and the company has a market capitalization of around $477 million.\n\nEchoing comments made by MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who said Ordinals holds potential in the realm of app development, Kilic said the protocol enables companies like HIVE to experiment with Bitcoin in previously unimagined ways.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s unleashing a whole new era,\u201d Kilic said. \u201cWe're all super supportive of it.\u201d"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price confirming a range close below $29,872 could fuel continuation to $27,500. Holding support makes $31,500 the level of interest.\n\nEthereum price could shatter $1,959 during the next uptrend if bulls capitalize on the 50-EMA support.\n\nRipple price eyes 5% gains to $0.823 as XRP bulls display adequate momentum for a fresh breakout.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate, although it appears bulls are now giving in as the flagship crypto tests the lower boundary. Ethereum (ETH) price is equally in limbo after sliding below a crucial support, but all is not lost with prospects of a fresh increase if bulls bring their A-game. Ripple (XRP) price remains committed, resisting a slump as token holders still enjoying proceeds from the partial win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands echo move that ended in 40% January gains.\n\nBitcoin price possible game plan\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is testing the lower boundary of the range after breaking below the critical support at $29,872. Notably, however, the breakdown is not decisive, and investors should wait for confirmation. Volatility appears to be heading back to the lowest levels seen over the past six months, a move that is often associated with an imminent reversal.\n\nBTC historical volatility\n\nNevertheless, if Bitcoin price confirms a break of the range low at $29,872, the most likely outcome would be a continuation southbound move, potentially breaching the $28,000 to tag $27,500. Such a move would constitute a 7% downswing from the current level.\n\nUsing momentum indicators to support this claim, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillators (AO) histograms are headed south. This points to falling momentum, therefore, favors the downside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nConversely, if Bitcoin price manages to hold the support at $29,872, then the key hurdle to break will be the $31,500 resistance level, which has kept BTC capped for months. A decisive flip of this supplier congestion zone into support would pave the way for a rally toward $35,260.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: Could Spot ETF Trigger BTC Rally to $50,000?\n\nEthereum price is at crossroads\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is at a crossroads after breaking below the support the uptrend line provides. While this slump is scary for bulls, not all is lost, as the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,872 remains in control since April 21.\n\nAn increase in buying pressure above the 50-EMA could fuel a fresh increase that could see Ethereum price breach the $1,959 resistance level. In a highly bullish case, ETH could leap into the $2,000 range and tag $2,120 soon. Such a move, constituting a 10% ascent, could see ETH reclaim the mid-April highs.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nHowever, if the Ethereum price makes a strong move below the 50-EMA, the 100-day EMA at $1,836 could fail to help, leaving a clear path to the June 30 lows around $1,824.\n\nAlso Read: Alt season likely in Q3 with declining Bitcoin dominance, July emerges as altcoin month.\n\nRipple price has enough strength for a fresh increase\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains bullish even after profit-taking from the July 13 rally. The ensuing selling pressure sent XRP down 20% on July 14, but bulls have since recovered lost ground, and now the remittance token\u2019s value is $0.781, 65% above the monthly lows.\n\nThe 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMA pointing north at $0.568, $0.521, and $0.484, respectively, suggest this is the path with the least resistance. In the same way, the RSI at 69 shows price strength bolstered by the AO indicator showing strong bullish pressure. With the right amount of buying pressure, the payments token could break above the $0.823 level and extend north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-Day Chart\n\nNotwithstanding, it is imperative to note that Ripple price has just confirmed Welles Wilder\u2019s interpretation of an overbought asset. The RSI crossing below the 70 level shows that XRP is overbought and holders should sell, increasing the chances of a pullback.\n\nA correction could see Ripple price break below the $0.697 support level, denoting a 10% dropdown from current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Europe Chief chases UK license after partial win in SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit."

        "content": "Starknet has announced a comprehensive Appchain framework that will enable developers to build custom blockchain protocols for specific decentralized applications (dApps). This follows a recent announcement from the project that its latest protocol upgrade has enabled Starknet to process more transactions per second than any comparable layer-2.\n\nStarknet, a scalability solution for Ethereum, uses Rollups to reduce transaction costs and increase transaction throughput. Starknet\u2019s Appchains could further improve dApp performance by enabling applications to \u201ctailor an instance of Starknet to achieve better control over the specs, lower running costs, enhance scalability, and deliver opt-in privacy.\u201d\n\nBy building custom Appchains, developers can alter fee market logic, consensus mechanisms, and other key functions of Starknet. This helps to deliver a more suitable environment for custom-built dApps to operate in.\n\nStarknet Stack: A powerful SDK that powers Starknet\u2019s Appchain Framework\n\nAppchains will be built using a comprehensive software development kit known as Starknet Stack. This includes STARK Proofs, which ensure Rollup security; the Cairo programming language, which enables developers to build smart contracts; and Account Abstraction, which makes it easier for users to interact with Starknet using smart contracts instead of private keys.\n\nStarknet\u2019s powerful Appchain infrastructure has been used privately in the past by popular dApps such as DyDx and SoRare. Both platforms are run using custom blockchain environments that were made using StarkEx\u2019s development stack. Collectively, StarkEx\u2019s Appchain infrastructure has already processed over $1 trillion in transaction volume.\n\nThe announcement of Starknet Stack will now bring decentralized access to Starknet\u2019s Appchain infrastructure. The toolkit is being open sourced to make complex dApp ecosystems more widely accessible to the community.\n\nStarknet Quantum Leap: A high-performance upgrade to the Starknet ecosystem\n\nLast week, Starknet announced that an upgrade to the protocol is now live on mainnet. The upgrade, known as Starknet Quantum Leap v.0.12.0., has significantly improved Starknet\u2019s performance. The blockchain now has the highest transactions-per-second (TPS) compared to all extant layer-2s in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhen is the Starknet Token (STRK) launch date?\n\nStarknet has announced that it will be launching a token to drive progress for the ecosystem. The token, STRK, will be used for transaction fees, governance, and as an incentive for developers who are building applications on the network.\n\nThe STRK token was initially revealed in May 2023 by former Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu. The token is rumored to be launched in September 2023.\n\nToken allocations have already been decided by StarkWare, as detailed in a blog post released by the team. 17% has been allocated to StarkWare investors, 32.9% has been allocated to core contributors, and 50.1% has been allocated to the StarkWare Foundation.\n\nOf the 50.1% allocation for the Foundation, a portion will be allocated to the earliest users of the network. However, StarkWare announced its intention to prevent gamification of the ecosystem with the expectation of a community airdrop, and all snapshots of usership predate the announcement of the token.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nETH is currently the native token for the Starknet blockchain. The price prediction for ETH is bullish, as the CoinCodex price prediction algorithm forecasts a 5% upwards move over the coming 5-day period."

        "content": "Ethereum grew in terms of market cap dominance despite volatility in the sector.\n\nInterest in staking rose, and traders turned bullish.\n\nThroughout Q2 in 2023, Ethereum[ETH] encountered significant fluctuations and high volatility. Despite these challenges, the Ethereum network demonstrated resilience and continued to attract an influx of new users to its protocol. Notably, the platform displayed substantial growth in various aspects during this period.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nA display of dominance\n\nAccording to Messari\u2019s data, the central theme dominating the near-term narrative around Ethereum was regulation. The SEC\u2019s actions against major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, raised concerns about assets\u2019 classification as securities. Despite these challenges, ETH managed to increase its dominance in the market.\n\nHowever, there is hope that with Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) in Europe, Ethereum\u2019s market cap dominance will rise even further as adoption begins to rise.\n\nFor context, MiCA is part of a broader EU package aimed at updating the bloc\u2019s approach to various digital financial aspects. MiCA primarily concentrates on crypto-asset providers and the obligations they need to declare.\n\nETH\u2019s strong tokenomics also played a pivotal role in driving its performance. The base fee burn experienced a substantial surge of 58% during the quarter, leading to approximately 380,000 ETH being burnt.\n\nThis mechanism helped reduce the overall supply of ETH, adding scarcity and potential upward price pressure. Additionally, the net ETH burnt also witnessed a remarkable threefold surge, rising from around 80,000 to approximately 230,000.\n\nStake it till you make it\n\nThe surge in gas prices, propelled by the excitement surrounding PEPE, was the driving force behind the higher burn of ETH. As a result, validators saw their real yields rise to an impressive 6.1%.\n\nThis increase in yields, coupled with the unlocking of staking, naturally attracted more flows into the staking contracts. May and June observed the highest-ever net flows, with 3 million and 1.9 million ETH respectively, further contributing to the growth and engagement of staking within the Ethereum network.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAdditionally, the number of validators on the Ethereum network also surged. According to Staking Rewards\u2019 data, the number of validators on the Ethereum network grew by 8.81% over the last month.\n\nDue to these factors, traders were feeling bullish about ETH\u2019s future. This was indicated by the declining put-to-call ratio for ETH, which indicated that the number of calls exceeded the number of puts at press time."

According to the Ethereum co-founder, account abstraction could make managing Ethereum wallets as easy as sending an e-mail.\n\nVitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Plans to Make Crypto Wallets as Simple as Email\n\n\u25ba https://t.co/QB9f5FnhFo https://t.co/QB9f5FnhFo \u2014 Decrypt (@decryptmedia) July 18, 2023 Ethereum wallets as simple as e-mail\n\nEthereum wallets on the move: towards unprecedented simplicity\n\nSince 2015, Ethereum developers have been working on account abstraction. This is an innovative concept aimed at replacing external wallets with contract-based smart wallets. This development would enable users to store their starting phrases in smart contracts, making it easier to retrieve private keys.\n\nIn his speech, Vitalik Buterin focused on the latest version, which would represent a major step forward. This is EIP-4337, or Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool.\n\nA promising future for smart wallets\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, EIP-4337 would open up new possibilities for Ethereum users. In particular, it would enable the creation of non-depository crypto wallets as programmable smart contracts. Naturally, the wallets would then feature advanced functionalities:\n\neasy wallet recovery\n\nsignature-free transactions,\n\nteam wallets.\n\nThis upgrade could be an essential catalyst for Web3 adoption. It would enable blockchains to distribute funds to users prior to registration.\n\nVersatile wallets for a better user experience\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, account abstraction would introduce \u201cpaymasters\u201d. These would enable Ethereum users to pay transaction fees with any token used in transactions.\n\nDecryption: no need to convert to ETH. The result: a smoother user experience!\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all! The integration of signature aggregators would also enable data compression, reducing transaction costs by up to 86 times.\n\nFor Ethereum, account abstraction is a giant step towards mass adoption of blockchain technology. By making crypto wallets as simple as an e-mail, Ethereum is opening the door to new users. This simplification would also enable Ethereum to become the basis for many Web3 projects, reinforcing its leading role in the crypto ecosystem.

        "content": "How Anoma and Namada Plan to Enable Intents on Ethereum: EthCC Highlights\n\nAt the EthCC event in Paris, the founders of blockchain architecture protocol Anoma and its partner Namada shared a series of updates on their projects. Anoma co-founders Adrian Brink and Christopher Goes explained how their projects aim to enable multi-chain interoperability in the French capital during the three-day event.\n\nOn the main stage on the last day of EthCC, July 20, Adrian Brink presented his vision for enabling intents on the Ethereum network. As the first blockchain architecture that focuses on intents, Anoma offers unique features for applications such as end-to-end decentralization, information flow control, and fully customizable intents.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to understand that Anoma is an architecture, not a blockchain,\u201d said Brink, explaining, \u201cThis distinction allows existing applications to utilize Anoma\u2019s properties to the extent they require. For example, rollups could employ Anoma\u2019s counterparty discovery to decentralize their sequencer, or use Anoma to generate intents for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nBrink announced the launch of Anoma\u2019s first incentivized Request for Comments (RFC) program on the main stage, which aims to attract developers and researchers from Ethereum and other communities to review Anoma\u2019s architectural specifications and suggest feedback and improvements to the current design.\n\nThe RFC program will start in fall 2023, with the Anoma Foundation allocating a part of the Anoma genesis distribution to contributors.\n\nBrink, who is also the co-founder of Namada, a Proof-of-Stake Layer-1 for multi-chain privacy, revealed a new way of swapping tokens anonymously on the Cosmos exchange Osmosis. The feature, called Shielded Swaps, allows Osmosis users to swap tokens privately on a chain that does not support privacy natively.\n\nNamada uses a unique incentivization mechanism called \u2018shielded set rewards\u2019 to reward multi-chain users who help increase the privacy for all other Namada users.\n\nThe Anoma Foundation is a Swiss non-profit that funds and coordinates the development of public goods such as Anoma\u2019s intent-centric architecture and Namada, an L1 that offers the best multichain privacy to users today. By creating a new way of building blockchain infrastructure layers, Anoma aims to make it easier for web2.5 applications to become fully decentralized and provides new primitives and tools for developers to create applications that were never possible before.\n\nNamada is a Proof-of-Stake L1 for multi-chain privacy that supports any type of asset (fungible and non-fungible). Namada\u2019s innovations include shielded transfers for all assets, providing one shared shielded set to offer the best privacy protection for every individual user. Namada connects to IBC-enabled chains and to Ethereum through a custom trustless two-way bridge. Other features of Namada include \u201cprivacy as a public good,\u201d where the protocol rewards users that help increase privacy."

        "content": "Amid the growing popularity of layer-2 scaling solutions based on zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, decentralized finance liquidity protocol Symbiosis has added support for Linea, a zkEVM-based scaling solution for cross-chain swaps developed by ConsenSys.\n\nSymbiosis said in a statement that Linea is a developer-ready zkEVM rollup, which means it is Ethereum-compatible and thus lets developers reuse a lot of existing infrastructure for creating multi-asset solutions. Linea comprises 100+ protocols, developer tools and decentralized applications, making it a potentially helpful scaling tool for developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nSymbiosis broke into the mainstream in March 2022 with its stablecoin liquidity solution. Since then, the cross-chain liquidity provider has integrated several other layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\nIn April, the protocol integrated zkSync, a ZK-rollup developed by Matter Labs. The integration helped the protocol provide one-click swaps from Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Telos and other blockchains to zkSync and back. Since April, the cross-chain liquidity protocol has added other popular L2 solutions, including Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nCointelegraph contacted Symbiosis co-founder Nick Avramov to get insight into the protocol\u2019s experience with L2 solutions, why it chose Linea and how the solution compares with other L2s. Avramov said that Linea perfectly aligns with the protocol\u2019s strategy to support the most popular L2s and that the decision to integrate it was based on community feedback and requests from partners such as OpenOcean, OKX DEX and more, which are using Symbiosis software development kit/API.\n\nOn the rise of ZK-rollups as a prominent L2 force, Avramov said:\n\n\u201cZK-rollups have better user onboarding capabilities, as they are targeting new domains like GameFi, Social, etc., to engage more people without security sacrifice, as most of these new domains rely on Ethereum and cost less.\u201d\n\nHe said ZK solutions are a natural evolution of rollups, adding, \u201cI believe, at some point, optimistic rollups will cease to exist.\u201d\n\nRelated: ConsenSys zkEVM set for public testnet to deliver secure settlements on Ethereum\n\nAvramov believes that ZK-rollups are the true L2 solution and can potentially resolve the cross-chain/multichain dilemma, an issue that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised in January 2022.\n\nSymbiosis said the integration of ZK-rollups has already helped it scale and increase its transaction throughput by 300% month on month, with cross-chain trading volume soaring past $500 million. The liquidity provider believes that with the integration of Linea, cross-chain swaps can surpass $1 billion in volume in the coming months.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Crypto audits and bug bounties are broken: Here\u2019s how to fix them"

Discover SCENE\n\nFloor, which lets users track their NFT holdings, is about to try something pretty novel: sell exclusive NFT artwork solely through its iOS and Android apps.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 26, Floor will debut the first of 10 planned NFT drops in Icons: Series One with a new work by Vinnie Hager, an artist known for his doodle-centric art style showcased in Letters, a 2021 NFT project that has generated $10 million worth of trading to date.\n\nHager\u2019s new Icons piece, titled \u201cGround Level Garden\u201d will sell for $29.99 via the app using typical mobile payment methods, and it will be an open edition drop\u2014so there\u2019s no limit on how many can be minted during the set timeframe. After purchase, the Ethereum NFT will be airdropped to the user\u2019s specified wallet, so buyers won\u2019t need to pay for network gas fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHager's artwork (center) plus the skinned Floor app (left) and custom app icon (right). Image: Floor\n\nFloor co-founder and CEO Chris Maddern wouldn\u2019t reveal the additional artists lined up for the ten successive weekly art drops, but said that they all have a \u201cpretty strong following in Web3 today.\u201d Each will be priced between $19.99 and $49.99. It\u2019s not yet confirmed whether all will be open edition drops.\n\n\u201cMobile is a platform where we've gotten very used to discovering, exploring, and transacting in bite-sized snacks,\u201d Maddern told Decrypt. \u201cThis concept of bite-sized discovery, along with an affordable price point with payment rails that customers are familiar with, makes our phones the perfect place to browse, explore, and take the first small jump into collecting in Web3.\u201d\n\nApp and game developers can sell NFTs via their iOS and Android apps, but there\u2019s a hitch: they have to pay Apple or Google a cut of any in-app purchase on the App Store or Play Store, respectively, which is as much as a 30% fee on the sale price.\n\nA look at the buying flow for Floor Icons NFTs. Image: Floor\n\nThat fee may be limiting the adoption of NFTs on mobile platforms thus far, in part because they are incompatible with the decentralized ideals of the Web3 world, including the ability for users to sell their assets via secondary marketplaces. Most marketplaces charge a single-digit percentage fee on peer-to-peer NFT trades; 30% is a massive upcharge.\n\nHowever, some app developers are choosing to soak up the fee to enable mobile NFT sales. Dapper Labs launched a beta version of NBA Top Shot on mobile earlier this year, with plans to sell packs of NFT collectibles. And the move-to-earn game Stepn on iOS has a secondary marketplace, albeit with NFT prices boosted to cover Apple\u2019s cut of each sale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaddern confirmed that Floor will also pay a cut to Apple and Google with each NFT sale, and Floor says it worked closely with both tech giants, \u201cleveraging their evolving policies\u201d in this new mobile NFT initiative. Just last week, Google said that it will change its policies later this year to enable increased NFT integration in Android apps and games on the Play Store.\n\n\u201cOur experience over the past several months has been extremely positive as we've worked to both understand the rules and collaborate actively with Apple and Google on making the best possible experience, while ensuring it's compliant in every way,\u201d Maddern told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWe found very progressive thinking while acknowledging the precedents they're setting, and the caution that needs to be shown when introducing hundreds of millions of users to new dynamics, as well as the effects on their broader developer ecosystems,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's left us hopeful that there will be a strong future for Web3 on both mobile platforms.\u201d\n\nFloor is selling Ethereum-based artwork, but the Icons pieces also have utility within the app. Owners will be able to customize the look of both the app itself and the home screen icon based on each Icons NFT in their wallet, adding extra perks to the purchase.\n\nThe startup, which raised $8 million in June 2022 and pulled in former Robinhood Crypto COO Christine Hall as co-founder and CEO, was built around mobile. Floor\u2019s founders believe that\u2019s the place where widespread Web3 adoption will eventually come from.\n\n\u201cMobile has the users, tools, time spent, and importantly the mindset of \u2018This is a place I go and explore,\u2019\u201d said Maddern. \u201cAlmost everything important starts by simply being fun and interesting, and the next wave of growth in Web3 has to embrace that, lower the barriers, and meet people where they are\u2014on their phone.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to update the name of the artwork, which had changed since the information was originally provided to Decrypt."

        "title": "Unveiling Ethereum's Unstoppable March: Top Eight Revelations from EthCC 2023, Paris - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "As we pen this dispatch from the heart of the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, the air pulsates with the electric vitality of Ethereum\u2019s groundbreaking advancements. The relentless surge of project unveilings and breakthrough updates is a testament to the formidable prowess of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this detailed discourse, we unfold the eight game-changing announcements that have punctuated EthCC 2023.\n\nShall we dive in?\n\nChainlink CCIP: The Gateway to Interlinked Blockchain Networks \u26d3\n\nChainlink, a premier data oracle network, made waves at EthCC by declaring its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) operational on the mainnet. The protocol, purpose-built to enable fluid communication between disparate blockchain networks, currently accommodates Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche. DeFi titans like Aave and Synthetix have already embraced it, with the Chainlink team dubbing it the \u201cTCP/IP of finance.\u201d\n\nStarknet Appchains: Ushering in a New Era of Layer-2 Solutions \ud83d\udfe0\n\nStarknet, a pioneer in Layer-2 scaling solutions, utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to supercharge Ethereum\u2019s scalability. Amid an avalanche of Layer-2 teams showcasing their permissionless development prowess, Starknet broke new ground by announcing their \u201cAppchains\u201d at EthCC. These application-specific blockchains enable developers to create bespoke chains with an impressive transaction per second (TPS) capacity, effectively bypassing network congestion.\n\nGnosis Pay + Gnosis Card: Bridging Web3 with Traditional Payment Infrastructures \ud83d\udcb8\n\nGnosis, a dynamic platform operating on Ethereum, champions the efficient distribution of resources, ranging from assets to ideas. In a seminal reveal at EthCC, Gnosis introduced Gnosis Pay, a decentralized payment network, and Gnosis Card, a Visa debit card. The former seamlessly amalgamates web3 with conventional payment modalities, while the latter enables direct links to on-chain, self-custodial wallets.\n\nMantle Mainnet Alpha: Reinventing Layer-2 Networks \ud83d\udfe2\n\nMantle Network, an L2 initiative distinguished by its modularity and versatility, announced the launch of its mainnet alpha at EthCC. This rollout offers developers a robust platform for crafting and trialing applications. Mantle\u2018s unique triad of transaction execution, Ethereum\u2019s L1 for settlement, and EigenLayer for data availability, places it at the forefront of the Ethereum scaling panorama.\n\nLinea Mainnet Alpha: Elevating Layer-2 Scaling \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLinea, a ConsenSys brainchild, aspires to deliver scalable Layer-2 solutions.

This pioneering L2 framework amalgamates zero-knowledge (zk) proofs with complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, promising unparalleled accessibility and scalability.\n\nEVM\u2019s Exponential Influence \ud83d\udd37\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Ethereum\u2019s computational engine and smart contract executor, has cast its influence far and wide. Testimony to this is the adoption of EVM capabilities by non-Ethereum projects. Both Tezos and Solana proclaimed their intentions to streamline the migration process for Ethereum developers, with Tezos introducing Etherlink and Solana debuting Solang.\n\nThe Dawn of the Lens V2: Reimagining Social Interactions on the Web \ud83c\udf31\n\nLens Protocol, a trailblazer in fostering an open and decentralized social stratum on the internet, unfurled the particulars of its V2 upgrade at EthCC 2023. This quantum leap propels the Lens mission forward, introducing Open Actions for users and developers to incorporate their smart contracts and orchestrate cross-chain operations on any Lens publication. Also making its debut is the Profile Manager system, which adheres to the ERC-6551 token standard, facilitating users to encapsulate NFTs within other NFTs, and seamlessly accumulate all Lens-based content directly in their Lens profiles.\n\nUnleashing UniswapX: A Quantum Shift in Crypto Trading Paradigms \ud83e\udd84\n\nUniswap, the torchbearer in decentralized exchange protocols, has unveiled UniswapX, its latest masterstroke at EthCC. This avant-garde, open-source protocol is set to revolutionize crypto trading through its Dutch auction-inspired feature, Dutch orders, that incentivize traders by progressively moderating the trade order price. UniswapX also pioneers a system for third-party fillers or market makers to negotiate its intricate onchain and offchain routing requirements, ensuring optimal prices for traders. Other striking enhancements include gas-free transactions, zero-cost failed transactions, and comprehensive protection against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the face of ongoing evolution and growth in the Ethereum ecosystem, the revelations from EthCC 2023 underscore Ethereum\u2019s unyielding momentum. From DeFi to web3 social, these innovations sketch a future abundant in Ethereum-powered growth and development.\n\nAs we take a closer look, each development unveils its uniqueness: Lens V2 pioneers an open, decentralized social layer on the web, unveiling Open Actions and an innovative Profile Manager system. UniswapX heralds a new era in crypto trading, incentivizing traders with decreasing trade order prices. Chainlink\u2019s CCIP, already integrated by DeFi giants Aave and Synthetix, fosters communication across various blockchain networks. Starknet\u2018s Appchains offer developers high transaction throughput and effective network congestion management. Gnosis\u2019 introduction of Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card signals significant strides towards merging web3 with mainstream payment systems. Mantle Network\u2018s launch of its mainnet alpha introduces a unique perspective on Layer-2 solutions. Linea\u2019s combination of zk proofs with full EVM compatibility promises exceptional scalability. Finally, Tezos and Solana are harnessing the EVM\u2019s capabilities to ease the transition for Ethereum developers.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency Prices Today, July 20: The cryptocurrency market continues to perform in a tight range. Cryptocurrencies were showing a mixed trend on Thursday, with Bitcoin down 0.86 per cent, Ethereum lower by 2.38 per cent, and Binance Coin down 0.97 per cent. However, Polygon, Dogecoin and Ripple were up in the range of 0.06 per cent to 4.50 per cent.\n\nShubham Hudda, senior manager of CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBTC continues to perform within a narrow range of less than 2 per cent, around $30,000. In the past 24 hours, XRP (up 6.18 per cent) continued to be amongst the top performers in terms of volumes and price change alongside its fork XLM (up 27 per cent). Interestingly, XRP has surpassed the trading volumes of BTC on a majority of exchanges ever since the court ruling against SEC fell in its favour.\u201d\n\nHe said the crypto market continues to perform in a tight range. The global crypto market capitalisation, up 0.3 per cent, is at $1.25 trillion. The crypto greed and fear index has jumped 6 points to re-enter the greed zone with a score of 56/100.\n\nMeanwhile, according to reports, there is a possibility for Russia to use central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). A Bill around the same awaits President Putin\u2019s signature before coming into effect. If signed, the CBDC tests will start from August 1, making Russia one of the largest adopters of CBDCs to date.\n\nCrypto Prices On July 20 (as of 10 am):\n\nBitcoin (BTC): INR 25,60,243.00 (-0.86%)\n\nEthereum (ETH): INR 1,61,897.00 (-2.38%)\n\nPolygon (MATIC): INR 65.35 (+0.06%)\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): INR 6.06 (+0.17%)\n\nTether (USDT): INR 85.18 (-0.78%)\n\nRipple (XRP): INR 70.77 (+4.50%)\n\nCardano (ADA): INR 28.61 (+1.77%)\n\nSolana (SOL): INR 2,261.95 (-0.05%)\n\nLitecoin (LTC): INR 7,957.00 (-2.77%)\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): INR 21,180.18 (-0.97%)."

        "title": "46% of Investors Believe Ether Will Outdo Bitcoin, Survey Finds - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA recent survey by the online cryptocurrency portal CryptoVantage focused on American attitudes toward cryptocurrencies and produced some intriguing findings. According to the study, 78% of respondents think Bitcoin will surpass its previous record high, but only 23% think it will peak in the upcoming year, and 47% think it will happen over the next five years. Only 8% of people believe Bitcoin will never hit its all-time high again.\n\nInterestingly, 21% of respondents think Dogecoin (DOGE) has the highest chance of ever outpacing Bitcoin in market value, while 46% of Americans think Ethereum (ETH) has the best chance.\n\nThe \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report\u201d from Fidelity Digital Assets, which was released on July 18, 2023, also contained some intriguing data on the development and prospects for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAccording to the research, Bitcoin and Ether have a solid growth path ahead. With a gain of about 85% year-to-date (YTD), Bitcoin has maintained significant price levels as on-chain indicators stabilize post-speculative activity. With a YTD increase of almost 62%, Ether displays potentially positive price signals and growing on-chain metrics.\n\nThere has been a net decrease in the supply of more than 700,000 Ether since the eagerly anticipated \u201cMerge\u201d in September 2022, suggesting less issuance. The growing number of Ethereum addresses performing their first transaction indicates a healthy network adoption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, there were 15% more active Ethereum validators in the second quarter, indicating a rise in network security awareness.\n\nGrowth Beyond 2023\n\nHowever, a lot is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem regarding new developments, and the community is eagerly anticipating significant changes predicted to increase platform usage and user interest. Two crucial actions that will soon be implemented and are projected to improve the Ethereum ecosystem considerably are the adoption of EIP4844 and the launch of the base mainnet.\n\nThe much-anticipated improvement EIP4844, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year, seeks to significantly lower costs related to rollups. To boost Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput while retaining its security, rollups are a layer 2 scaling solution. This change will probably improve user experience and entice more developers to the platform by lowering rollup expenses.\n\nWith the potential to bring millions of additional users to the ecosystem, launching the basic mainnet is another crucial milestone for Ethereum. The mainnet\u2019s extension will enable easier onboarding and participation in the Ethereum network as the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain applications soars. This improved accessibility may lead to a major rise in the acceptance and usage of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rollup solutions are undergoing general enhancements in addition to these essential ones, which will help users and developers. These improvements are anticipated to improve the platform\u2019s layer 2 solutions\u2019 general performance, effectiveness, and usability, encouraging more usage and innovation within the ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum community is anticipating the vibrant growth of new applications on rollups, layer 2s, and layer 3. Through these developments, novel DeFi platforms, autonomous worlds, and the tokenization of physical assets are all predicted to emerge. It is anticipated that the Ethereum ecosystem will experience a surge of innovative and disruptive applications as developers explore the potential of these new capabilities."

        "content": "The assessment revealed that NEAR Protocol was over 200,000 times more carbon efficient than Bitcoin, primarily due to the adoption of PoS over PoW.\n\nNEAR Foundation, the non-profit that supports and funds ecosystem development on NEAR Protocol, a leading open-source and climate-neutral blockchain, has announced it signed up to the Ethereum Climate Platform. The move demonstrates the foundation\u2019s commitment to sustainability in Web3 \u2013 and to working collaboratively with globally recognised leaders to minimise the environmental impact of Web3 ecosystem development.\n\nThe Ethereum Climate Alliance (ECA), convened by ConsenSys and climate tech firm Allinfra, was announced at COP27. ECA is a group of technology companies aligned around the mission to accelerate decarbonization and scale climate action. It achieves this by deploying the best-in-class technology and funding the development of digital environmental assets that will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and deliver positive environmental and social impact for years to come.\n\nInspired by the Ethereum Merge, ECA is launching the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) \u2013 an initiative designed to collaboratively build a blockchain-based technology platform that will engage a decentralised community to accelerate climate finance at scale. The platform is committed to redress and counteract the historical Ethereum-based carbon footprint, dating back to the network\u2019s launch in 2015, and accelerate the launch partners\u2019 own decarbonization strategies.\n\nThe NEAR Foundation\u2019s move to join the platform signals its intention to act as a sustainability model to the broader tech and business community. The collective includes a still-growing list of prominent stakeholders from the Web3 ecosystems, including including Laser Digital (Nomura), Microsoft, Polygon, The Climate Collective, Celo, Aave, Filecoin, and UPC Capital Ventures, as well as civil society leaders, all committed to mitigating human-driven climate change.\n\nNEAR Foundation\u2019s environmental stewardship is an integral part of its ethos. From its inception, NEAR has focused on a computational alternative to PoW. In this system, known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), there are no miners. Instead, validators stake a given token amount to allow themselves to take part. PoS blockchains incentivise communities to own and control the network. Only then can they validate blocks and collect a block award. Functionally, NEAR\u2019s PoS, called Nightshade, allows the platform to realise its ambition of being simple, scalable, and secure.\n\nNEAR Foundation CEO, Marieke Flament, commented: \u201cFrom the outset, we\u2019ve been dedicated to bringing a billion users into a more open web. We recognised early on that sustainability would be a cornerstone of our approach to facilitating the widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. By aligning with the Ethereum Climate Platform and implementing our Blockchain Operating System (BOS), we\u2019re not just enhancing the user experience \u2014 we\u2019re creating a paradigm shift in the blockchain industry that respects and supports our global environment.\u201d\n\nBill Kentrup, Executive Director of ECP added: \u201cHaving NEAR Foundation onboard this endeavour strengthens our joint mission significantly. Through persistent collective effort, we can bring to market climate finance tools that will accelate capital into climate-aligned assets and in turn, significantly mitigate greenhouse gases. As a fellow pioneer in the Web3 space, their participation is invaluable, and we\u2019re sincerely excited about the potential this partnership holds for the future.\u201d\n\nOn a social and ecological level, sharding allows NEAR Foundation to deliver on its carbon-neutral commitment. In 2021, NEAR Protocol was awarded the Climate Neutral Product Label, and its developers have been leading the charge in this era of extraordinary energy efficiency, creating an infrastructure that is lightning-fast, remarkably secure, and capable of accommodating millions of Web3 users.\n\nNEAR Protocol has achieved this after enlisting South Pole, a globally recognised climate solutions provider based in Zurich, Switzerland, to evaluate NEAR\u2019s carbon footprint, find ways to reduce it and counterbalance the remaining emissions with CO2 offsetting initiatives. The assessment revealed that NEAR Protocol was over 200,000 times more carbon efficient than Bitcoin, primarily due to the adoption of PoS over PoW.\n\nReforestation projects offset the minimal environmental impact of NEAR, thus rendering the NEAR Blockchain carbon neutral. Performing transactions on NEAR contributes to tree-planting initiatives in Colombia, Zimbabwe, and the United States via these carbon-offsetting projects.\n\nNEAR Foundation\u2019s mission since its inception has been to onboard 1 billion users to a more free, fair, and open web. The first step in the journey was to focus on building a best-in-class L1 blockchain that was easy to build on and use in a sustainable way. With the launch of the NEAR Blockchain Operating System \u2013 an industry first \u2013 anyone can create their own frontends and customise them to work with the blockchain of their choice."

However, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consider one\u2019s personal goals and risk tolerance before determining the next best crypto most suited to oneself.\n\nWhich crypto will boom in 2023?\n\nIn the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, several contenders have the potential to boom in 2023. ApeMax\u2018s groundbreaking Boost to Earn concept and unique tokenomics position it as a strong candidate with a growing crypto presale. Ethereum, with its widespread adoption and constant development of decentralized applications, is poised for further expansion. Additionally, Ripple, if able to resolve its legal challenges, could witness a resurgence with its established partnerships in the financial industry. However, predicting the exact winner in the crypto market is challenging, and readers should conduct their own independent thorough research and consider their risk appetite before deciding on the crypto that might boom in 2023.\n\nWhich crypto will boom in 2024?\n\nAs we look forward to 2024, several cryptocurrencies hold promise for potential booms in the market. ApeMax\u2018s innovative Boost to Earn mechanism and its fun use case could lead to growth. Ethereum\u2019s continued development and upgrades, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, could make it a strong contender for growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Ripple, should it resolve its regulatory uncertainties and grow its RippleNet partnerships, could experience a resurgence. However, predicting the future is uncertain, and the crypto market is volatile, so crypto buyers should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before making any buying decisions in 2024.\n\nWhat is the next thing like crypto?\n\nThe next thing like crypto could be Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms. CBDCs are digital versions of fiat currencies issued by central banks, and they aim to provide the benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as fast and efficient transactions, while remaining under the control of governments and central banks. On the other hand, DeFi platforms are blockchain-based financial systems that sometimes seek to offer decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without intermediaries. Both CBDCs and DeFi are rapidly evolving and have the potential to disrupt the financial industry in the coming years.\n\nWhich coin will be the next ethereum?\n\nPredicting the next coin that will achieve a level of success similar to Ethereum is challenging, as the cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic and unpredictable. However, some innovative new coins worth watching include ApeMax, Cardano, Binance Coin (BNB), and Polkadot. ApeMax for example, has an innovative Boost to Earn mechanism and its expanding crypto presale is now open to eligible buyers only. While these coins are interesting, it\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research and consider the risks before making any crypto decisions.\n\nBefore venturing into the world of cryptocurrencies, meticulous market research and due diligence are essential. Thoroughly conducting comprehensive research, seeking advice from unbiased experts, and evaluating your personal risk tolerance are critical. Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge that cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for all individuals. Moreover, all cryptocurrencies have inherent high risks and are subject to high levels of volatility. Furthermore, please be aware that ApeMax coins are not accessible for purchase by individuals from the United States, Canada, countries under sanctions, and other blocked countries.

        "title": "Eye-Opening DeFi Statistics & Facts for 2023 - Bankless Times",
        "content": "DeFi or decentralized finance refers to financial services that are powered by blockchain infrastructure and aren\u2019t controlled by a centralized authority such as a bank or a government, meaning that they provide. Although DeFi statistics show it\u2019s still minuscule compared to TradFi, Defi is growing quickly and is already irreplaceable for many people who are unbanked or who want to send money abroad with much lower fees.\n\nIn this article, we will outline the basic DeFi stats, its value, the size of the sector\u2019s segments, and details about its users by country. Keep reading for more!\n\nTop 10 DeFi Statistics in 2023\n\nThe number of DeFi users in the world is estimated at 4.8 million in 2022.\n\nEthereum has the highest staked value in DeFi, with 58% of the total.\n\nDeFi\u2019s TVL is estimated at $55.9 billion as of November 6, 2022.\n\nIn Q3, DeFi\u2019s growth amounted to 31% compared to Q2 2022.\n\nThe trading volume on DEXs has reached $952 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nThe market cap of DEXs increased by 36.8% in Q3 2022.\n\nThe country that received the highest DeFi value is India.\n\nBetween July 2021 and June 2022, India received the highest value through DeFi.\n\nThe US is the second in the world according to retail DeFi value received.\n\nEurope\u2019s most prominent DeFi player is the United Kingdom.\n\nGeneral DeFi Stats for 2023\n\nThe number of DeFi users worldwide is estimated at 4.87 million in 2022.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2022, the number of DeFi accounts grew by 660,000. This is a significant decrease compared to the same period in 2021 when the rise in DeFi accounts amounted to 1,775,000. This is unsurprising given that the crypto market experienced a major downturn in 2022.\n\n(Dune)\n\nDeFi\u2019s TVL is estimated at $55.9 billion as of November 6, 2022.\n\nWith volatility marking 2022, DeFi\u2019s TVL dropped drastically since the beginning of the year and the collapse of Terra. For comparison, in January, the total value locked in DeFi was almost three times as large at $154 billion.\n\n(DeFi Llama, CoinGecko)\n\nEthereum has the highest staked value of all blockchains in DeFi, with 58% of the total value.\n\nOne of the basic facts on DeFi is that it\u2019s powered by the Ethereum blockchain, which consequently holds 58% of the industry\u2019s TVL. Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain and a pioneer in the DeFi and smart contracts world, so it naturally has the high ground. After Ethereum, BSC and Tron have the highest TVL, with BSC holding 9.86% of TVL and Tron holding 9.68%.\n\n(Statista)\n\nThe growth of the DeFi market is estimated to happen at a CAGR of 42.5% until 2030.\n\nThe DeFi industry\u2019s size was estimated at $11.9 billion in 2021 while it\u2019s expected to reach $231.19 billion in 2030. With further adoption of digital financial services and acceptance of services enabled by blockchain, the young industry is expected to keep expanding its services.\n\n(Grand View Research)\n\nIn Q3, DeFi\u2019s growth amounted to 31% compared to Q2 2022.\n\nWith its connection to the Ethereum network, it\u2019s unsurprising that DeFi bounced back in Q3 along with it. The fastest-growing DeFi segment in this quarter was liquid staking, with an exceptional 271% growth in market cap compared to Q2.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nThere are about one million daily transactions on the Ethereum network, compared to over a billion via credit cards alone.\n\nAlthough DeFi is growing and attracting the attention of individuals and institutions alike, one of the top DeFi facts is that it\u2019s still incredibly small compared to traditional finance. To illustrate further, the commercial banking market is estimated at $2.7 trillion, while DeFi was worth around $11.9 billion according to the latest DeFi statistics. These statistics don\u2019t include other sectors such as insurance and investing, however, the discrepancy in size is just as prominent.\n\n(YCHarts, Nilson, IBIS World)\n\nThe most popular DeFi coin at the moment is stETH.\n\nstETH or Lido Staked Ether is ETH used on the popular liquid staking platform. With liquid staking tripling in Q3 2022, following its development will be pretty interesting.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nStats on DeFi Segments\n\nDEXs are the by far largest DeFi segment at 44.5% of the market cap share.\n\nWith a market cap share of 44.5%, DEXs remain the largest segment in the decentralized finance world. Oracles (systems that enable the implementation of hybrid smart contracts, vital for the development of Web 3.0) are the second-largest segment with 18.5% of the market cap, while Lending takes up 15.8% of the market cap in Q3 2022.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nThe trading volume on decentralized exchanges has reached $952 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nAt around $1 billion in volume per day, the world\u2019s largest DEX Uniswap accounts for most of this volume. What\u2019s more, it has around 70% of the DEX market share. DODO, Curve, and Sushiswap are next on the list below Uniswap when it comes to market share. However, with market shares peaking at around 12% for the biggest, DODO, they are still far behind.\n\n(Dune)\n\nThe market cap of DEXs increased by 36.8% in Q3 2022.\n\nThe latest statistics on DeFi show the market cap of DEXs climbed to $10.9 billion in Q3. Oracles grew by 18.9% to $4.52 billion, while Lending grew by 16.7% to $3.86 billion. The only segment that fell during this quarter is Asset Management, which dropped by 63.3%.\n\n(CoinGecko)\n\nDeFi Users By Country\n\nBetween July 2021 and June 2022, the country that received the highest value in DeFi is India.\n\nIndia ranks first when it comes to the value of DeFi transactions for individuals and when it comes to retail-sized transactions. Moreover, in India, ETH accounts for about 40% of the total received crypto value. One reason for this is that India receives a lot of remittances that are more easily and more affordably sent as cryptocurrency. Lebanon has the second-highest value received through DeFi protocols.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nThe US is the second in the world according to retail DeFi value received.\n\nWith India and Lebanon leading the way when it comes to DeFi transactions, the United States is the country with the highest number of interactions with DeFi of all developed markets. Its interactions with decentralized finance are driven by interest in innovation and investment, as it\u2019s among the better-known facts on DeFi that many key players such as Uniswap originate from the US. When it comes to smaller-sized DeFi transactions, the US ranks third.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nDeFi made up 37% of all North American crypto transaction volume between July 2021 and June 2022.\n\nDeFi statistics show North America has the highest participation of DeFi in crypto transactions globally. It\u2019s followed by Western Europe with 31%, which the report explains with the fact investing and speculation are more likely in markets with higher purchasing power. Other regions have significantly lower DeFi activity compared to overall crypto transaction volume.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nEurope\u2019s most prominent DeFi player is the United Kingdom.\n\nAs Western, Northern, and Central Europe stand out as the region with the largest crypto economy in the world, it\u2019s not surprising that the region is strong when it comes to DeFi, too. And in the DeFi sector, the UK is the leader. The country drives almost 20% of the entire region\u2019s web traffic to both NFT and DeFi lending websites.\n\n(Chainalysis)\n\nDeFi Statistics: FAQ\n\nWhat is DeFi? DeFi or decentralized finance refers to an industry that seeks to decentralize services including remittances, lending, insurance, investing, and saving through the use of blockchain. It focuses on enabling services without the need for a central authority like a bank to ensure safety. What is the DeFi market worth? The latest DeFi revenue estimate equaled $11.9 billion (2021). However, the total value locked in the industry is significantly higher, reaching $55.9 billion as of November 6, 2022. How many people are in DeFi? The number of DeFi users in the world is estimated at 4.8 million in 2022 (July data). This number refers to unique accounts rather than people. With 660,000 new users in the first seven months of 2022, the growth in the number of users decreased by about one-half compared to the same time the previous year. What are the most popular DeFi coins? The most popular DeFi coins as of November 2022 are stETH (or Lido-Staked Ether), DAI (a Maker-issued US-pegged stablecoin), and UNI (Uniswap\u2019s native token).\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nDeFi is the most innovative segment in crypto, offering opportunities for many services present in traditional finance as well, including investing, saving, exchanges, lending, sending remittances, and insurance. The DeFi market is still tiny compared to traditional finance, but it\u2019s growing at a 42.5% CAGR, and recovering even in a difficult year for all global markets.\n\nDeFi statistics show there are still fewer than five million unique accounts as of July 2022. However, the DeFi sector is making waves in countries that have high purchasing power such as the UK and the US, and in countries with lower and middle incomes such as India and Lebanon, where it\u2019s useful as a transaction path.\n\nSources:\n\nHere Are More DeFi Guides"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, failed to rise above the $30,000 mark early Friday. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Solana (SOL) \u2014 saw minor dips across the board.

At one point, BTC even dropped to a one-month low of $29,500. Currently, BTC faces resistance at the $30,000 level and finds support at $29,600. Apart from Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum have also experienced value declines. On a positive note, LINK's performance has managed to avoid a downturn. Furthermore, a notable development is the United States government introducing a new bill to regulate digital assets, potentially impacting the future of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBTC, for another day, traded flat while altcoins registered some significant developments. LINK (+17.3 percent) is making a big move after launching its CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol). Good moves in other prominent DeFi tokens like MKR (+8.38 percent), SNX (+5.96 percent), and COMP (+5.29 percent) underline that the current market interest is around accumulating quality DeFi protocols before Bitcoin coves out of its tight range of trading.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cThe overall market sentiment remains neutral even as prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum decreased. The macroeconomic factors and equity markets results have had little impact on user sentiment. Altcoins continue their popularity streak even amidst price volatility.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently hovering slightly above the important $29,500 support level, bolstered by a triple bottom pattern on the four-hour time frame. Technical indicators such as RSI (39) and MACD (-5) indicate bearish sentiment. The 50-day exponential moving average acts as resistance around $29,995. The likelihood of Bitcoin remaining bearish below $30,000 is high, with potential support at $28,900 if it breaks below $29,500. A bullish breakout could push it to $30,000 and even $30,500. If demand increases, a break of $30,450 could lead to a rally towards further resistance at $31,200. Watching the $29,500 level is vital as it could indicate a buying opportunity above or quick selling positions if breached.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe entire volume of the cryptocurrency market increased by an amazing 19.70 percent over the past day to reach an astounding $37.46 billion. Ripple's XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, gained 6.8 percent, while native cryptocurrencies Cardano, Solana, ADA, and SOL surged over 6 percent, outpacing Bitcoin and Ether. With a value of $29,905.69, Bitcoin continues to play a significant role in this rollercoaster. These numbers demonstrate the potential of the cryptocurrency sector and its indisputable influence on the financial landscape, which presents opportunities and difficulties for both investors and enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin is holding a key support above $30,000 with a record-breaking accumulation of 5,92,000 BTCs worth $17.8 billion at the $30,200 level as per Glassnode, suggesting that investors are confident that BTC will continue to hold above this level. However, BTC dominance is close to its 1-month low, as investors are shifting their focus to smaller, riskier tokens. One such token is XRP, which has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume after a court ruling determined that it is not a security.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee To Become 100x Cheaper With This New Plan | - cryptonewsbytes.com",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is the Ethereum co-founder, and his primary goal is to improve the network. Recently, Buterin discussed his new plans for the network, and they are impressive. So, this plan is about reducing high transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum developers have tried to reduce gas fees, which is paying off. But their progress is relatively slow. One of the first major steps they took was changing the Ethereum network to proof-of-stake. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, was initially operating as a proof of work. But the Ethereum Merge seems not enough to reduce transaction fees. This new plan is powerful because it could minimize gas fees by nearly 100%.\n\n\n\nButerin Shows How Ethereum Transaction Fees Will Become 100x Cheaper\n\nWikimedia\n\nVitalik Buterin shared more details about his plans to make transaction fees cheaper. The event where he spoke on this plan was the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris. According to the founder, the new Ethereum improvement proposal will solve many issues. And one of the issues is the high cost of transaction fees. Since users often complain about them, Buterin decided to take action. The overall summary of the plan is to reduce transaction fees. Another addition is to improve user experience.\n\nA huge takeaway from Buterin\u2019s plans is how straightforward it is. For instance, Buterin said there will be no changes to Ethereum\u2019s underlying protocol. So, executing this plan won\u2019t be as disruptive as the Ethereum Merge. Instead, it will only take a few steps to get it to work.\n\nFirst, how Ethereum wallets operate will change. Buterin says it will now be easier to use the wallet. For instance, initiating actions like secret phrase recovery will be easier. For this to happen, an integration of Account Abstraction will take place.\n\nSecondly, he said the Ethereum community will use programmable smart contract wallets. This type of wallet is also known as a non-custodial wallet. Using this wallet will contribute to reducing gas fees.\n\nTransaction Fees to Drastically Decrease\n\nExecuting this proposal will bring one major change. Ethereum users will receive and send tokens without high transaction fees. To do this, Buterin proposes an infusion of account abstraction with \u201cpaymasters.\u201d Paymasters allow crypto users to pay transaction fees using any token. In other words, Ethereum users won\u2019t pay the high gas fees in ETH.\n\nNote that the Ethereum improvement proposal will feature signature aggregators. Signature aggregators allow you to use multiple signers. Other benefits are more data compression, which translates to less costs. In other words, Vitalik Buterin says costs (gas fees) will reduce by nearly 100 percent.\n\nEverything indicates Vitalik Buterin\u2019s mind\u2019s made up concerning his new proposal. If it becomes a reality, many things will change. One of the changes is users enjoying lesser Ethereum gas fees.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay"

        "title": "\u201cParabolic\u201d Signal Suggests Litecoin & XRP Will Lead, While Bitcoin & Ethereum Lag | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum might be the two top cryptocurrencies by market cap, but according to a \u201cparabolic\u201d high timeframe signal, Litecoin and XRP could soon lead the market higher.\n\nThe lack of the technical tool being triggered in BTC and ETH suggests that these two front runners could lag behind the lower-ranked altcoins. Here\u2019s a closer look at why.\n\nExplaining The Parabolic SAR In Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies are known for their impressive, parabolic rallies, that later causes prices to reach extreme overvaluations. When the parabola breaks down, the trend tends to reverse into a brutal bear market. Understanding when these trend changes occur is the key to being profitable in the crypto market.\n\nCertain tools are designed for just this purpose. For example, the Parabolic SAR tells a trader when a trend has \u201cstopped\u201d and \u201creversed.\u201d It was created by J. Wells Wilder, Jr., who is the father of several popular technical tools, such as the Relative Strength Index, Average True Range, and more.\n\nUsing this tool on the 1M timeframe across top crypto assets ranging from Litecoin to XRP, and Bitcoin to Ethereum, shows that only LTCUSD and XRPUSD have tagged the Parabolic SAR. Based on the tool\u2019s design, this should mean that the downtrend in these assets has stopped and reversed.\n\nWill LTC and Ripple lead?| LTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhy Litecoin And XRP Could Lead Bitcoin And Ethereum\n\nLitecoin and XRP leading the crypto market recovery is unusual. Bitcoin and Ethereum each set dramatic new all-time highs in 2021, while LTC and XRP didn\u2019t. This could be contributing to the signal being triggered earlier than in BTC and ETH.\n\nLTC and XRP sellers could be significantly more exhausted having suffered through a much longer drawdown from all-time highs. Each of the two altcoins drastically outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017, so the scenario is not impossible \u2014 it just isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve seen in six years.\n\nFor Bitcoin and Ether to trigger the same signal BTCUSD will need to reach nearly $42,000 per coin, while ETHUSD will need to trade above $3,300. These targets are still a distance away, compared to Litecoin and XRP which have already caused the SAR to move below price action.\n\nAt this point, the tool can be used to set a trailing stop loss, placing a stop loss order at the SAR indicator. When tagged, it stops the trader out at a point where there is a higher probability the trend has stopped and reversed."

        "title": "Crypto Investors Speak: 47% Bet On Ethereum's Triumph Over Bitcoin - TronWeekly",
        "content": "There is considerable speculation within the cryptocurrency market regarding Ethereum\u2019s potential to surpass Bitcoin in terms of popularity and value. Recent reports indicate that long-term investors are showing a preference for Ethereum over other cryptocurrencies. According to a survey by CryptoVantage, out of 1,000 North American investors who have invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years, 46% of respondents see ETH as the primary candidate to outshine Bitcoin. Dogecoin also garnered some interest, with 20.8% of investors believing it could challenge BTC. Other cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin, Solana, and Cardano were mentioned on the list, but their chances of overtaking Bitcoin were considered low.\n\nEthereum has maintained its popularity among investors due to various reasons. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Bitcoin still holds a dominant position in the cryptocurrency industry. In the last quarter, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance increased significantly by 3.2%, reaching 47.9%, which was last observed in Q2 2021. In contrast, ETH experienced a modest surge of 1% during the second quarter of 2023. Despite the growing interest in Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance remains strong.\n\nFurthermore, in the last quarter, Bitcoin recorded a price return of 6.9%, and Ethereum followed closely with a 6% increase during the same period. These figures indicate that ETH may encounter difficulties in catching up to Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position in the market. However, it is important to consider that short-term price movements might not accurately reflect long-term trends.\n\nAs of the current moment, Bitcoin\u2019s price stands at $30,012, with a market cap of $583.35 billion. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s market cap is noted at $229.54 billion, and its price hovers around $1,909.\n\nEthereum Holds Steady in the Institutional Arena\n\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by CoinShares among prominent asset managers, Bitcoin is widely regarded as the cryptocurrency with the most promising growth potential. Institutional investors have significantly influenced the cryptocurrency market by offering substantial support to Bitcoin. Despite this, ETH still holds the largest share in the portfolios of these asset managers. This underscores the enduring confidence and optimism surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future prospects, leading to the belief that it has the potential to surpass Bitcoin in the long run.\n\nHowever, there are challenges to overcome in order to surpass Bitcoin\u2019s current dominant position. As the crypto market constantly evolves, only time will tell whether Ethereum can narrow the gap and firmly establish itself as a leading cryptocurrency."
