        "title": "Ethereum Miner Dumped ETH After Merge in Favor of Dogecoin - Blockworks",
        "content": "Crypto miner BIT Mining (BTCM) once made most of its self-mining revenue from Ethereum. After the Merge, it\u2019s increasingly relying on Dogecoin and Litecoin for fresh cash.\n\nThe miner, based in Ohio and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reported revenue of $72.9 million for last quarter \u2014 a near-20% jump from the previous period but down 75% year on year.\n\nBIT Mining\u2019s revenue comes from three primary business areas: mining crypto itself, mining as part of a pool and hosting services in its datacenters.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mining pool revenue came in at $60 million last quarter, making up 82% of its total inflows, while self-mining and datacenters each brought in about $6 million.\n\nAs noted by analyst Mike Fay (via Seeking Alpha), Ethereum mining contributed more than three-quarters of BIT\u2019s self-mining revenue leading up to the Merge last September.\n\nThe event transitioned Ethereum away from energy-intensive proof of work to proof of stake, eliminating the need for crypto miners as part of consensus.\n\nBIT Mining\u2019s self-mining revenue predictably nosedived after the switch, dropping from $7.1 million in Q3 2022 to $1.9 million in the following period.\n\nThe firm mined $6.2 million crypto in the first quarter of 2023 \u2014 most of it litecoin (LTC) and dogecoin (DOGE) after shutting down certain bitcoin mining rigs.\n\nDogecoin and Litecoin hashrates skyrocketed to all-time highs directly around the Merge, although their hashing algorithms differ from Ethereum\u2019s. Crypto miners are able to direct their rigs at Dogecoin and Litecoin simultaneously through what\u2019s known as \u201cmerge-mining.\u201d\n\nBTCM has drastically underperformed the crypto market, as well as major miners Riot and Marathon\n\nBIT Mining sold ETH over staking it\n\nFay found one move particularly confounding: BIT Mining sold one-third of its ETH holdings between quarters, amounting to 1,602 ETH ($3 million at current prices).\n\nOn the other hand, the firm held 62% more dogecoin quarter on quarter, going from 42.8 million DOGE ($3.1 million) to 69.5 million DOGE ($5 million). Its bitcoin holdings (289 BTC worth $7.8 million) remained unchanged.\n\nThat means BIT Mining\u2019s crypto balance sheet was almost 28% DOGE at the end of Q1 2023. Its total assets were $40.2 million with $39 million liabilities, including lease obligations.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s crypto treasury management decisions are odd from where I sit,\u201d Fay wrote in his report. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve made it no secret that I think assets like Dogecoin don\u2019t have much of a future, in my view the more egregious decision is selling the ETH on the balance sheet when the company could be generating rewards by staking it natively on-chain.\u201d\n\nFay continued: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand why management would opt instead for holding meme coins rather than selling all DOGE production and staking Ethereum at virtually no cost. BTCM is still an avoid for me.\u201d Blockworks has reached out to BIT Mining for comment.\n\nThanks to rising ETH prices this year, BIT Mining\u2019s ether stash is worth practically the same\n\nIn any case, BIT Mining has reportedly only managed to generate a positive net income for one quarter between 2016 and 2022 while increasingly diluting its shares as of 2021.\n\nBIT Mining, which commands a $31 million market cap, is up 85% across 2023 so far but down the same amount over the past year.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum price is correcting gains from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could start a fresh rally if it clears the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a substantial decline if it breaks the $1,870 support.\n\nEthereum Price Reaches Key Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $1,920 resistance zone. ETH corrected lower below the $1,900 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. However, the bulls were active above the $1,870 support zone. There is also a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,920 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,930 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,920 and $1,930 resistance levels might send Ether toward $2,000. The next resistance sits near $2,050, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,120. Any more gains above the $2,120 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,250 resistance. An intermediate resistance might be $2,200.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,890 level and the trend line.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,870 zone or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,836 swing low to the $1,930 high. If there is a close below the $1,870 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,800 level or even $1,780 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,870\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,920\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) investor and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver claimed that Ethereum, not Bitcoin, will be responsible for driving the bulk of new users towards crypto.\n\nOn a May 31 episode of the Show Me The Crypto podcast, Ver \u2014 labeled \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for his early Bitcoin advocacy \u2014 said that despite Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues and the other layer-one \u201cclones\u201d that have popped up in its wake, the Ethereum ecosystem is still where the action is:\n\n\u201cEven though Ethereum doesn\u2019t have the biggest market cap compared to Bitcoin, I think Ethereum is the front-runner in terms of driving worldwide adoption.\u201d\n\nVer praised the rise of Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon (MATIC) that can help share some of the load away from the main chain.\n\nVer provides an account of the \u201ccivil war\u201d that occurred in the early days of Bitcoin between Etheruem\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Bitcoin core developers.\n\nDisagreements over the use of smart contracts and moving away from the idea of blockchains being used purely as currency or stores of value eventually drove Buterin to develop Ethereum, Ver noted:\n\n\u201cAll of that would have been built on top of Bitcoin if not for the scaling civil war that happened. These Bitcoin core developers hate Vitalik, and they basically drove him from the project to go and create Ethereum, and more power to him for that.\u201d\n\nVer also spoke on the recent Ledger debate, calling the controversial Recover service \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The service allows users to store their encrypted seed phase with external custodians to safeguard against loss; Ver said that while it\u2019s fine for people to have custodial accounts and choose to recover their keys if they wish, the ethos of crypto is centered on having full control of your assets at all times.\n\nRelated: Hybrid rollups: The silver bullet for scalability and security on Ethereum\n\nIn January, Ver was sued by a trading unit of the crypto lending firm Genesis for failing to pay some $20.8 million in unsettled crypto options.\n\nVer claimed in a January Reddit post that he had \u201csufficient funds\u201d to pay the outstanding sum but argued that because Genesis was no longer solvent, he was not legally required to uphold his end of the deal.\n\nLast year, Ver made headlines for allegations of defaulting on a debt. CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed Ver owed the firm $47 million USD Coin (USDC) and was bound by a written contract. On June 28, Ver denied these claims without directly mentioning the company.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? We Put ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard Against Each Other - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Naturally, the question of whether Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin by total market cap is very interesting to crypto investors.\n\nAnd there are some pretty strong arguments to be made on both sides, which is why we decided to engage with unbiased AI chatbots.\n\nWill Ethereum Bitcoin Flippening Happen?\n\nBitcoin maxis believe BTC will be the world\u2019s most common reserve currency for international trade. In that scenario, Ethereum would have to be some kind of global computer with incredible levels of user adoption. Only if it achieves world-class network activity on its platform would it stand a chance in such a future.\n\nBut the flippening of Bitcoin by Ethereum is no idle question. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, at its peak levels of market dominance, has comprised as much as 25% of the value of all traded cryptos. That was in 2017. For the past couple of years, the percentage has ranged in the mid to high teens.\n\nEarlier this month, we asked OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT if Ethereum can flip Bitcoin in five years. The short version of ChatGPT\u2019s answer? Such an outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Google AI\u2019s Bard chatbot had to say in answer to the same question we put to ChatGPT:\n\n\u201cDo you think Ethereum\u2019s price can flip Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next 5 years?\u201d\n\nThe short version of Bard\u2019s answer?\n\n\u201cIt is possible\u2026\u201d\n\nGoogle Bard vs. ChatGPT Showdown:\n\nBard said:\n\n\u201cUltimately, the question of whether Ethereum will flip Bitcoin will depend on a number of factors, including the continued adoption of Ethereum, the success of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nAdoption rates are the key metrics here that push the cryptocurrencies\u2019 values up or down in the market. Bard agreed with ChatGPT on that:\n\n\u201cEthereum has a broader range of use cases than Bitcoin, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. As these use cases continue to grow in popularity, it could lead to increased demand for Ethereum and a higher price.\u201d\n\nGoogle Bard was sure to qualify that although possible, the ETH flippening may not happen:\n\n\u201cOverall, it is possible that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in the next 5 years. However, there are a number of factors that could prevent this from happening.\u201d\n\nBard said some of those factors include Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage, its \u201cgreater security,\u201d and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are steadily gaining popularity, with the advent of ChatGPT leading the way. The AI landscape now welcomes Google\u2019s Bard, the latest addition to this domain.\n\nAlthough still in its experimental phase, Bard showcases impressive language processing capabilities, which have found practical applications in cryptocurrencies. The tool\u2019s unique potential lies in its ability to generate feasible price projections for various digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH).\n\nGiven this context, Finbold utilized Bard on June 1, seeking its predictive insights on Ethereum\u2019s potential price trajectory by the end of 2023.\n\nBard noted there are a number of factors that could influence the price, including the continued growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) markets, the adoption of the network by mainstream businesses and institutions, as well as any major changes to the Ethereum protocol, all in all, it said if these factors are positive \u201cETH could reach $2,500 or even higher by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nETH end of 2023 price predictions. Source: Google Bard\n\nEthereum price predictions\n\nIn addition, Bard also provided insights into notable price predictions for the end of 2023 from reputable institutions and platforms.\n\nAmong these forecasts, Gov Capital, a financial research firm that uses a combination of technical analysis and fundamental analysis to make cryptocurrency price predictions, projects that Ethereum will reach a price of $2,587 by the end of 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, DigitalCoinPrice offered an average price target of $2,878, while PricePrediction using its own artificial intelligence, suggests Ethereum will reach a maximum price of $3,000 and a minimum price of $1,808 in 2023.\n\nETH end of 2023 price predictions. Source: Google Bard\n\n\n\nETH price analysis\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,861, showing a minor decrease of 0.36% in the past 24 hours. However, it has experienced a positive trend over the last seven days, with a gain of 3.40%.\n\nETH 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe recent slight decline in price within the last 24 hours could be attributed to various factors, such as investors securing profits or a general downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, the overall trajectory over the past week remains optimistic, indicating sustained bullish sentiment among Ethereum investors.\n\nKey price levels to observe include the support level at $1,784, which corresponds to the 50-day moving average. A drop below this level may suggest a more significant price decline. On the other hand, the resistance level at $1,941 represents the 200-day moving average. A breakthrough above this level could indicate a notable price increase.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "content": "Change is in the air. Crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been in a pretty brutal bear market for almost exactly a year now, which many, myself included, had projected to last for years.\n\nBut now, there are signs of life springing up all around, being driven by Bitcoin NFTs, and recent news of China opening the door for citizens to engage the blockchain again. The bear market may be over sooner than we had thought, so let\u2019s get into what\u2019s making me think that NFTs might just be back.\n\nNoteworthy Happenings\n\nChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders. These two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\n\nCollectors are eying high-priced NFTs ahead of a potential incoming pump from Chinese investors looking to snatch NFT grails like CryptoPunks, BAYC and Azuki. An x-factor that not enough people are talking about yet is, what if they decided to dive into the mostly unexplored world of Bitcoin NFTs where opportunities may be even greater than the already expensive Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nBitcoin NFTs are really starting to cook, and just yesterday the 10 millionth Ordinal was inscribed . This massive milestone many thought improbable just a few months ago, but believers in Bitcoin NFTs never had a doubt. At this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\n\nA new token standard was created on Bitcoin yesterday called BRC-721E . This will let traders bridge their Ethereum NFT over to Bitcoin by \u201cburning\u201d the Ethereum NFT and re-creating it on Bitcoin. Now we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time.\n\nA new meta is emerging in NFTs which is to drop a new cryptocurrency (an ERC-20 or BRC-20 token) and then build an ecosystem around it, likely with NFTs. $OXBT is the new hottest BRC-20 collection on Bitcoin, and there are teases of upcoming utility for this token. Fun fact , $OXBT is now held by more wallets than any other individual digital asset on the Bitcoin blockchain other than BTC itself and its smaller denomination, Satoshis.\n\nThis hot new meta recently took off with new meme coins like $PEPE, $TURBO, $BEN, and $PSYOP looking for ways to drive more users to the token, and the concept now seems destined to shape the NFT scene for the foreseeable future.\n\nGaming on the cusp of taking over Web3\n\nGaming is on the cusp of taking over Web3. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, now has over 20 blockchain games listed on their store with some like Defimons now entering a closed beta.\n\nIf Mythos Chain\u2019s DMarket, and ImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained are any indication of what\u2019s to come (they are), we\u2019re in for a meteoric rise in NFT adoption. Just look at how the buyers/sellers and transactions compare to a typical PFP project.\n\n\n\nSales from these two projects have propelled them into the top five for the past seven days, foreshadowing what\u2019s to come as blockchain games begin to enter the mainstream.\n\nPeep the charts\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m fascinated to see who Bitcoin\u2019s growth impacts more, Ethereum and its layer 2s, or Solana? Take notice of which chains aren\u2019t in the top 10 NFT Collection Rankings by Sales Volume for the past 7 days, and you\u2019ll see who it may be.\n\nNakamigos have had a sudden surge, as have Jack Butchers\u2019 art project Openens, pushing both ahead of Milady Maker and into the Top 10. Milady Maker continues to hang around with the big dogs, now with extra action that revolves around the new BRC-721E bridge that originated in the Milady project.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time.\n\n(Disclosure: The author of this commentary holds $OXBT)"

And amid an avalanche of nothing-related memes, Pauly has reiterated the wallet is not related to the launch of a new token.\n\n\u201cThere is no presale,\u201d Pauly said, responding to a Twitter user who claimed he was playing with people\u2019s emotions for financial speculation. \u201cLiterally nothing is being sold.\u201d\n\nThere is no presale how is this person so delusional? Literally nothing is being sold. \u2014 PAULY (@Pauly0x) May 31, 2023\n\nOn Wednesday, as funds continued to pour into Pauly\u2019s wallet, he hosted a talk on Twitter Spaces, where he, unsurprisingly, said nothing.\n\nThe development comes as Crypto Twitter is deep in the throes of meme coin mania, a wave of speculation sparked by PepeCoin. No matter how nascent or obscure, traders continue to dive headfirst into tokens based on little more than vibes and hopes of lucrative gains. And that\u2019s despite the lack of utility many meme coins offer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStop sending your funds to blatant meme coin presale scams like @miladyerc20 The account previously had the usernames @0thecoin @itachycoin before the latest scam. Can not believe they got 63 ETH ($116k) in just 1 hr. pic.twitter.com/XoY19qCR1C \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 10, 2023\n\nMany of these coins are outright scams. On May 10, a Twitter account called \"Milady Coin\" raised $116,000 in ETH by posting a wallet address and offering a token presale for what was later discovered to be a non-existent project, as chronicled by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. Another token called \"JARED\" followed the same playbook. It claimed to be affiliated with famed MEV bot \"jaredfromsubway\"\u2014it wasn't.\n\nPrior, this trend had spawned tokens like BEN and PSYOP, created by a Twitter user named ben.eth. And as recognizable crypto characters like YouTuber Ben \u201cBitboy\u201d Armstrong have drawn close to the coin, the phenomenon has been captured by established digital artists like Beeple.\n\n\u201cI am not in any way affiliated with any of these dumbass coins or the grifters running them,\u201d he said on Tuesday, showcasing some of his recent work.\n\nugh, here's daily reminder i am not in ANY WAY affiliated with any of these dumbass coins or the grifters running them.... if you interpret these artworks as ENDORESMENTS in any way, i dunno what to tell you... #ngmi pic.twitter.com/9GLtA66g2D \u2014 beeple (@beeple) May 30, 2023\n\nThe market capitalization of BEN has grown to $46 million since it launched, yet the token has fallen more than 47% over the past week, according to CoinGecko. Another recent meme coin called JEFF has found popularity, but the token plummeted more than 52% over the past 24 hours on Wednesday, as of this writing.\n\nWhile Pauly\u2019s wallet has turned heads on Twitter for the attention and funds it has received thus far, the influencer described \u201cYou Get Nothing\u201d as akin to performance art.\n\n\u201cIt is almost as if this is some kind of mass psychological experiment,\u201d Pauly said, describing yougetnothing.eth as \u201ca case study\u201d and \u201can exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum represents over 98% of the funds sent to yougetnothing.eth, but Pauly\u2019s wallet has received a variety of other tokens, such as $12,500 worth of PepeCoin and nearly $4,000 worth of the stablecoin Tether, according to data from Nansen.\n\nPeople are also sending obscure meme tokens to the address. For example, yougetnothing.eth has received over 203 million BEN tokens worth just over $21, and 333 JEFF tokens worth $0.73, according to Nansen.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pauly recognized that his wallet contained a panoply of \u200b\u200bpeculiar assets, telling his followers that they should ignore its contents.\n\n\u201cPeople are desperately trying to push these shitcoins based on nothing,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThe way they do this is by sending tokens out to wallets like mine, to make it look like I have bought the tokens. I have not bought any of this crap.\u201d\n\nThe smattering of tokens that Pauly has received is reminiscent of Budweiser\u2019s embrace of NFTs in 2021. After it announced it had registered beer.eth as an ENS domain, the beer brand\u2019s wallet was hit with a wave of oddball NFTs\u2014like a \u201cMinimalistic Cock\u201d drawing and an NFT from PeePeeBoy."

        "content": "Economist and crypto trader Alex Kr\u00fcger is turning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), predicting they will finish the year strong.\n\nKr\u00fcger tells his 153,900 Twitter followers that the Federal Reserve is likely near the end of raising interest rates to tame inflation, and will likely pivot in December.\n\nHe believes the markets will anticipate the Fed\u2019s pivot and start rallying as early as August.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has delivered 20 x 25bps (basis points) rate hikes in its fastest and most aggressive hiking cycle in history. Which means at least 90% of the Fed hikes are behind (if not all). That to me is all that matters, and makes it easy to stay long. This has been my view all year.\n\nMy base case is a December pivot and a bull market gearing up in early August to front run this. Why? The economy is cooling and inflation is falling. The Fed is forced to overshoot (hiking) due to its past errors \u2026 which increases odds of it pivoting when data rolls over.\u201d\n\nKr\u00fcger says even if inflation proves more sticky and the Fed does not pivot in December, he still believes the markets will end 2023 higher than they are trading at today.\n\n\u201cIf core inflation remains sticky there will be no pivot in 2023, but with the Fed at least 90% done regardless (and the AI revolution) upside into year end still is a good bet.\u201d\n\nThe crypto trader also says he is taking long positions on both BTC and ETH, betting on them having big moves to the upside.\n\nAccording to Kr\u00fcger, Bitcoin is having a challenging time crossing the key $30,000 level because investors are selling on rallies and volume.\n\nKr\u00fcger says that if Bitcoin can cross the $30,000 level and fails to form a head and shoulders pattern, which is used in technical analysis to determine a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal, it will likely soar.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, on BTC land it\u2019s been hard to push higher as everyone has been emboldened to sell rips and vol. But if by chance the market manages to get above $30,000, then TA (technical analysis) says that\u2019s a major failed [head and shoulders] bear trap [and] high odds of a strong rip.\n\nI am decently long BTC and ETH via spot and calls, and ready to get more aggressive later in the year.\u201d\n\nHowever, the crypto trader warns that if Bitcoin retests $26,000, the digital asset may show further weakness.\n\n\u201cOn the downside, if BTC pushes back down to $26,000, chart to me says should see a decent flush on a stops run (good spot to de-risk if very long).\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $27,702 at time of writing, while Ethereum is worth $1,904.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nCryptocurrency strategist Benjamin Cowen has shared his insights on the potential performance of Ethereum (ETH) compared to Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future. In a recent YouTube video, Cowen highlights key trends in the crypto market that all investors and traders should turn their focus toward.\n\nBitcoin Dominance On The Rise\n\nCowen points out that the Bitcoin dominance chart (BTC.D), which indicates the proportion of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin, is showing a strong upward trend; suggesting that the dominance of the crypto is increasing in the markets.\n\nOn the other hand, he observes that the Ethereum versus Bitcoin chart (ETH/BTC) is moving in the opposite direction. He notes that the chart is consistently forming lower highs, indicating that Ethereum\u2019s performance relative to Bitcoin is declining.\n\nPredictions For The \u201cFlippening.\u201d\n\nCowen cautions against premature conclusions about the \u201cflippening,\u201d a hypothetical event in which Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in market capitalization. He explains that each time the ETH/BTC chart forms a lower high, there is often a surge of excitement in the community, with people speculating that the flipping is imminent. However, history has shown that these lower highs have not led to a significant shift in the market dynamics.\n\nLiquidity Hampers ETH/BTC Decline\n\nCowen also discusses why the ETH/BTC pair may not be experiencing as steep a decline as it did during the bear market of 2018-2019. He attributes this to the increased liquidity present in the system today. The abundance of liquidity has made it more challenging for the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, to swiftly remove excess liquidity from the market. Nevertheless, Cowen suggests that liquidity is gradually being reduced.\n\nOverall, Benjamin Cowen\u2019s analysis indicates that while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the crypto market is increasing, Ethereum\u2019s performance relative to Bitcoin has been on a downward trend. He advises caution and highlights the historical pattern of lower highs not leading to the anticipated flipping. He also emphasizes the impact of increased liquidity, which has slowed down the rate of decline for the ETH/BTC pair compared to the previous bear market."

        "content": "Bitcoin slid on Wednesday\u2014and took the rest of the crypto market with it\u2014in what has been a sluggish month for the asset.\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading for $27,105 at 9am New York time, down 3% in 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAt one point, it slid sharply and nearly dropped below the $27,000 mark. Late last night it was trading for $27,626.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest digital asset, was also down, trading for $1,868, a 2.3% drop in the past day.\n\nNearly all the top coins and tokens shed value today, with Solana, Polygon, and Dogecoin all experiencing significant sell-offs.\n\nAnd meme coin mania seems to have died down: Pepe, a new token launched at the end of April which experienced astronomical gains, dropped by 9% in 24 hours.\n\nSui, a highly-anticipated layer-1 blockchain which launched last month, has also been hit particularly hard, trading at a 24-hour loss of over 6% for $0.96.\n\nThe sharp drop in prices comes as the U.S. Congress races to carve out a debt-limit deal to avoid a default in the world's biggest economy. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned weeks ago that it would be an \"economic catastrophe\" were the U.S. were to default on its debt.\n\nBitcoin Trades at 18% Discount on Binance Australia as Exchange Cuts On-Ramp\n\nAnd a top U.S. Federal Reserve official today said that there was no compelling case for the central bank to stop hiking up interest rates: a strategy which has led investors to shift \"risk-on\" assets like equities and cryptocurrency.\n\nIncidentally, the S&P500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices were down on Wednesday too.\n\nInvestors also are more focused on tech stocks, particularly due to a surge in interest in the artificial intelligence sector. Computing company Nvidia yesterday overtook tech giants Tesla and Meta in terms of market cap, soaring to a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.\n\nBitcoin last month touched a 10-month high of $30,000 per coin. It has since dropped, but the asset is up considerably since the start of the year, when it was trading for just $16,615."

        "content": "Ethereum has been consolidating within a narrow price range, tightly bound by the upper limit of the descending flag pattern and the 100-day moving average. However, a breakout is imminent and will determine the subsequent direction of the cryptocurrency.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nExamining the daily chart, Ethereum demonstrated a period of stable price action around the $1790 mark, near the 100-day moving average, before gaining support and embarking on an upward trajectory.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful attempt to breach the flag\u2019s upper boundary at $1.9K, resulting in a minor correction, Ethereum\u2019s price remains confined within a limited range, approximately between the $1791 level of the 100-day moving average and the dynamic resistance offered by the flag\u2019s upper trendline. A breakout from the flag pattern is likely to initiate another rally toward the $2K resistance zone.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTaking a closer look at the 4-hour chart, three significant price regions present challenges for Ethereum buyers and sellers: the static resistance at $2K, the dynamic resistance from the mid-trendline of the ascending channel, and the dynamic support provided by the channel\u2019s lower threshold.\n\nConsidering the ongoing price action, it might seem more likely that Ethereum will continue its upward trend, aiming to surpass the $2K resistance level. However, given the current market conditions and prevailing uncertainty among market participants, it is more probable that a consolidation phase will occur first between the $2K region and the lower boundary of the channel."

But fast-forward to 2023 and investors have largely lost interest in the blue-chip tokens like Uniswap and Maker, according to blockchain data firm Glassnode.\n\nGlassnode said in a Wednesday report the downturn was largely due to Ethereum seducing investors with its new staking feature, which can give returns of up to 4% APR.\n\nNow investors can earn returns on the cryptocurrency with less risk and more reward, the firm said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that the lackluster performance of DeFi tokens over the last two years is a factor or the emergence of native ETH staking yield,\u201d the report said, noting that the DeFi market cap stands at just 12% of its all-time high in November 2021.\n\nThe flexibility of the #Ethereum application layer has become a remarkable bedrock for innovation and narrative generation, with the #DeFi sector remaining one of the most prominent use cases.

Why? Because they now need to compete with Ethereum, which can offer steady returns with seemingly low risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is because the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap successfully upgraded in April, allowing investors to safely lock-up their ETH and receive returns for the cryptocurrency they pledged to the network.\n\nNow, they can earn better rewards\u2014with less risk. \u201cNot only is downside performance and volatility equivalent to ETH, but the upside performance is measurably less,\u201d Glassnode said.\n\nBlockchain data app Cielo\u2019s head of research, ZoomerAnon, told Decrypt that for \u201cDeFi to remain attractive to users,\u201d they will need to adopt liquid staking\u2014which is available on Ethereum.\n\nLiquid staking allows investors to have quick access to crypto they\u2019ve pledged by providing them with tokens redeemable for staked assets which they can move around elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe battle to reignite interest in DeFi tokens is likely under way, but given the new hurdle rate set by the ETH token itself, it is unlikely to be an easy one,\u201d Glassnode added."

        "content": "Bitcoin is gearing up to catch Ethereum.\n\nDevelopers have published a new token standard that allows users to migrate their Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin.\n\nThe new token standard is a game-changer for the NFT industry.\n\nEthereum\u2019s undisputed dominance in the NFT industry has remained unchallenged since the inception of the digital asset. Many competitors have emerged over the years, offering exciting solutions, yet none have been able to dethrone Ethereum from its reign. However, with Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence in the NFT sector, Ethereum\u2019s supremacy could be under threat.\n\nBitcoin, the reigning king of cryptocurrencies, has swiftly ascended the ranks, securing the second spot in the market within a few months. Now, the network is set on overthrowing Ethereum\u2019s long-standing supremacy in the NFT industry.\n\nHow is it planning to do so? By enabling the migration of Ethereum NFTs into its network.\n\nA Seismic Shift\n\nOn Friday, May 30, Ordinals Market, the largest Bitcoin NFT market, in collaboration with NFT collection Miladys, jointly published the BRC-721E standard allowing users to migrate ERC-721 NFTs to Bitcoin.\n\nThe new protocol is a game-changer and could signal a seismic shift in the NFT landscape by allowing Bitcoin to reign supreme. However, before Bitcoin can do that, it\u2019s important to note the BRC-712E protocol is still in its early stages.\n\nNevertheless, NFTs on Bitcoin have been spreading like wildfire. According to Dune Analytics, users have inscribed over ten million ordinals on the network and have generated over $44 million in fees \u2013 a 200% increase since the first week of May.\n\nAs more users jump on board the hype train, learning how to migrate an Ethereum NFT to Bitcoin could be helpful.\n\nHow Does BRC-721E Work?\n\nThe BRC-721E token standard allows users to convert their Ethereum-based ERC-721 NFTs into Bitcoin Ordinals by using a bridge between both networks.\n\nThe process involves sending ERC-721 NFTs to a burn address to trigger an on-chain inscription request. The token standard then encodes the metadata directly onto a burn transaction, which nominates a Bitcoin address to receive the inscription.\n\nBy doing so, the BRC-721E protocol doesn\u2019t store metadata directly on the Bitcoin but instead points to the original Ethereum NFT using the burn transaction and an indexer.\n\n\ud83d\udd38How is this different?\ud83d\udd38\n\n\n\nTeleburn requires you to know the inscription ID in advance of burning the ETH NFT.\n\n\n\nBRC-721E allows the burn to take place before inscribing. Meaning the burn TX acts as an on-chain inscription request!\n\n\n\nUsers can also receive airdrops using this. \u2014 kiwidream.eth (@kiwi_dream) May 29, 2023\n\nAdditionally, since inscriptions are limited to 100 bytes, and high-quality images can be 10,000 times the size, this mechanism significantly reduces the costs of inscribing an image. It allows rich, dynamic meta on Bitcoin without taking up block space.\n\nBRC-721E is undoubtedly a significant achievement for the NFT space because it enables assets to transition between Ethereum and Bitcoin while maintaining their unique properties and provenance.\n\nHow to Migrate Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin\n\nBefore you follow this tutorial, it\u2019s important to note that every action is irreversible due to the immutable nature of blockchains, and there\u2019s no way to undo it once it\u2019s set in stone. Therefore, it\u2019s highly advised to be careful and double-check everything before you do anything permanent.\n\nAdditionally, this tutorial requires you to know how to make an ETH call, inscribe Ordinals, and retrieve information like your ETH and Bitcoin address, token ID, and more.\n\nHere are a few tutorials on how to deploy Ethereum smart contracts and how to inscribe Ordinals.\n\nThe first step is to Burn your ERC-721 NFT by using the following ETH call.\n\nBRC-721E ETH Burn call. Source: Ordinals.Market\n\nReplace the ETH address with your address, the Token ID with the NFT\u2019s token ID, and the receiving BTC address with your Bitcoin address.\n\nThis call triggers the on-chain inscription request mentioned earlier.\n\nAfter your ERC-721 NFT has transferred to the burn address, you must inscribe the following BRC-721E JSON code on Bitcoin to claim your ETH burn on Bitcoin.\n\nBRC-721E JSON code inscription. Source: Ordinals.Market\n\nBe sure to replace the token_id and contract parameters with that of your NFT. Once the code is inscribed, your bridged NFT will appear on a custom Ordinal marketplace collection page with its full metadata.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nGoingParabolic, the owner of BAYC 1626, one of the most valuable Bored Ape NFTs, inscribed his BAYC on Bitcoin using TeleBurn, a creator platform for making Bitcoin NFTs using ordinals.\n\n300,000 Transactions still sit in limbo on Bitcoin\u2019s mempool, awaiting confirmation because of the Ordinals craze.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nBRC-721E could be the edge Bitcoin needs to gain ground over Ethereum and end its reign. However, the new standard could hinder the network\u2019s scalability given Bitcoin\u2019s recent struggles with BRC-20 memecoins and Ordinals.\n\nRead more about BRC-721E:\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Threaten Ethereum NFTs With New BRC-721E Standard.\n\nRead why Bitcoin is trading a discount in Australia:\n\nWhy Bitcoin Is Trading at a $5k Discount on Binance Australia"

It will advance the speed of transactions with BTC lquidity and make them more cost efficient.\n\ntBTC by Threshold Network launches on Arbitrum L2\n\nAccording to the official announcement shared by Web3 team Threshold Network, its noncustodial bridge solution dubbed tBTC has launched on the Arbitrum (ARB) mainnet. The launch is a phase of the tBTC Wrapped Tour initiative designed to introduce \"native\" Bitcoin (BTC) liquidity to various programmable blockchains.\n\ntBTC goes live on @arbitrum for tour stop 3 on the tBTC Wrapped Tour\n\n\n\nPowered by @wormholecrypto and fueled by @Balancer liquidity\n\n\ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/bc1R7nVqXm \u2014 Threshold Network \u271c (@TheTNetwork) May 30, 2023\n\nThe integration is powered by Wormhole, the largest bridge infrastructure provider, and Balancer DeFi. On Balancer, tBTC/WETH and WBTC/tBTC bridges are accepting liquidity from LPs.\n\nAs explained by the representatives of Threshold Network, this is the only bridge solution so far that entirely avoids any centralized points of failure, relying on a distributed set of validators:\n\nUnlike its centralized counterparts, with their permissioned access and risk of censorship \u2013 tBTC doesn\u2019t need middlemen or intermediaries. Instead, it leverages a randomly selected group of node operators on the Threshold Network.\n\nArbitrum One, the largest Arbitrum's blockchain, is the top Ethereum (ETH) L2 scaler by total value locked (TVL). As of late May, 2023, it is in charge of $5.74 billion out of $8.77 billion; out of $3 locked on Ethereum's L2s, $2 are injected into Arbitrum's DeFis.\n\nCelebrating NFT drop released\n\nTo immortalize the launch of tBTC on Arbitrum, Threshold Network invites all crypto enthusiasts to take part in celebrating NFT activity.\n\nAnyone who mints tBTC, bridges it to Arbitrum (ARB) and brings liquidity to Balancer's liquidity pools will be eligible to claim a unique Galxe OAT NFT.\n\nAlso, more blockchains will be added to tBTC's range of networks supported, the protocol's team added.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, a noncustodial bridge to Polygon zkEVM was launched one month ago, April 27, 2023. It is poised to ensure liquidity inflows to the most promising and developed EVM-equivalent network so far."

        "title": "Aave Review 2024: What To Know About The Pros, Cons, Features - Milk Road",
        "content": "What Is Aave?\n\nAave is a decentralized crypto lending platform that supports ERC-20 tokens such as ETH, MATIC, WBTC, and others. Decentralized lenders don\u2019t require identity verification. They also don\u2019t come with consumer protections you\u2019d expect from traditional lenders.\n\nVersion 2 of Aave is still active and supports the Ethereum network as well as Polygon and Avalanche. Aave Version 3 now supports Ethereum but expands the list of Ethereum-compatible networks to include Arbitrum, Optimism, and more. Version 3 is the default and brings enhanced risk management as well as a broader range of networks and tokens.\n\nAave\u2019s platform is non-custodial, meaning you control transactions from your own crypto wallet. However, when supplying on Aave, you deposit your tokens into a smart contract which can liquidate your (collateral) tokens if needed to repay a loan.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t have complete control over your tokens, you can withdraw at any time (if your tokens aren\u2019t used as collateral for a loan).\n\nExpert Review: Aave In Action\n\nI took Aave for a spin, testing its features, pushing and prodding to see what breaks. Nothing broke, although some of Aave\u2019s features (flash loans) may remain out of reach for traders without coding chops.\n\nI found Aave\u2019s basic features, such as lending and borrowing, easy to use. Most questions I had were answered in the vast documentation. Aave\u2019s Discord channel helped as well.\n\nWallet Connection And Supported Networks\n\nAave Version 3 supports Ethereum several Ethereum-compatible networks that also work with MetaMask, a popular decentralized crypto wallet.\n\nAave V3 supported networks:\n\nEthereum\n\nArbitrum\n\nAvalanche\n\nFantom\n\nHarmony\n\nOptimism\n\nPolygon\n\nI connected Aave to MetaMask to explore, choosing the fast and affordable Polygon network to perform transactions.\n\nFunding\n\nAave supports 20 crypto assets for deposit on Polygon, but other networks offer fewer choices. For example, I could only choose from nine types of crypto to deposit on Arbitrum.\n\nIf needed, you can buy tokens through a third party on Aave. I was offered Transak in my region. Transak didn\u2019t support all tokens on Aave, however.\n\nHere are the purchase fees for WETH (wrapped Ethereum):\n\nPurchase Amount Base Fees Card Fees $100 2.75% Zelle, Cash App, Venmo 3.99% Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay $500 1.5% Zelle, Cash App, Venmo 3.99% Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay $1000 0.95% Zelle, Cash App, Venmo 3.99% Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay\n\nTo fund my account, I chose MATIC I bought on Coinbase. A click on the \u201csupply\u201d button let me choose an amount of MATIC to deposit and then whisked me away to an approval page in MetaMask.\n\nDeposit values are shown in token quantities and USD market values. Aave uses an oracle, a link to the outside world, to get up-to-date pricing from exchanges. A fallback in the code sources token prices from Uniswap.\n\nLending\n\nEvery token you can supply on Aave pays a yield (except for the Aave token itself).\n\nMost yields range from under 1% to 2.5%. The MATIC token I initially deposited paid 1.47% APY (annual percentage yield). A sortable list of supported tokens made it easy for me to choose a token with a higher yield.\n\nAave\u2019s protocol sets rates by supply and demand. Supplied tokens go into a pool. As borrowers access a larger percentage of the pool, borrowing APYs increase. This increase in rates benefits suppliers for that token. Only a portion of your supplied tokens will be borrowed, however, so you\u2019ll see a gap between the Borrow APY and the APY yield you earn.\n\nCRV and SUSHI tokens were in high demand at the time, so I swapped MATIC to CRV and SUSHI. CRV was paying over 50% APY.\n\nIn the background, Aave replaces your tokens with an Aave-specific equivalent token, such as aWMATIC (Aave wrapped MATIC) or aCRV (Aave CRV). When swapping, Aave offered to add the new tokens to my MetaMask wallet.\n\nWhen supplying (lending), your token balance increases to reflect your earnings while the per-token price updates in real time.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to find a report to view earnings, however. A visit to the Discord channel suggested that many investors track the starting and ending token quantities on a spreadsheet. Take notes when you start a position.\n\nBorrowing\n\nThe tokens you supply on Aave become collateral for borrowing if you take a loan. Most assets can be used as collateral, but some are restricted, including Tether (USDT).\n\nWhen borrowing, I could choose from stable APY rates (which can still fluctuate) or variable APY rates (which can vary considerably). When a small percentage of the pool is borrowed, variable rates are lower than stable rates. But when the utilization rate exceeds the optimal level, rates can spike, as seen in the example below for CRV.\n\nA low-interest rate might not stay low, and variable borrower rates of up to 100 APY% or more are possible.\n\nCollateral requirements for Aave loans depend on the collateral you supply. For example, when I supply DAI, the DAI position will be liquidated when the debt value equals 80% of the collateral value. However, when I supply SUSHI as collateral, liquidation takes place when the debt value reaches just 45% of the collateral value.\n\nUsing volatile assets as collateral is riskier because your collateral may be liquidated due to changes in market price, which then results in a liquidation penalty of 5% to 10%.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) limits also differ from token to token. The Max LTV for DAI is 75%, whereas the Max LTV is only 20% for SUSHI.\n\nI borrowed DAI, and Aave gave me the option of a stable rate or variable rate. You can change this selection throughout the course of the loan. The new loan appeared at the top of the dashboard, along with an update to my \u201chealth factor.\u201d\n\nAave assigns a health factor to accounts with loan balances based on the LTV and liquidation risk.\n\nMy \u201cnet worth\u201d also decreased by the amount of the loan.\n\nLoan repayments are intuitive, and Aave gave me the option of paying my loan with the borrowed asset or with collateral.\n\nYou can repay in full or in part, or not at all. Interest on the loan accrues according to the utilization rate for the token you borrow. There\u2019s no fixed repayment schedule, but interest will chew away at your LTV until you repay or the collateral is liquidated.\n\nStaking\n\nIf I had to choose my least favorite part of Aave, it\u2019s staking.\n\nBy staking the Aave token, you can earn a variable yield based on how much Aave is staked. But you have to stake on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum blockchain bases fees on the complexity of the transaction. Aave\u2019s staking smart contract is complex, resulting in higher gas fees and making Aave staking a pricey proposition if you aren\u2019t staking large amounts.\n\nStaking in Aave\u2019s \u201cSafety Module\u201d helps cover deficits if the market moves too fast to liquidate collateral for positions. Staked amounts can be slashed by up to 30% if needed to cover shortfall events.\n\nStaking on Aave acts like a type of insurance. The stakers become insurers and make money \u2013 until there\u2019s a loss. Staked amounts can be slashed to cover shortfalls on Aave.\n\nThere\u2019s also a 10-day cooldown period, after which you have 48 hours to unstake before you have to start the process again.\n\nFlash Loans\n\nAave was first to market with flash loans, which are loans in which the borrowing, transactions, and repayment all take place during one block (about 12 seconds on average).In theory, I could borrow millions of dollars if the Ethereum network calculates that I could repay the loan within the same block, including fees. One common use for these loans is for arbitrage on decentralized exchanges. Most flash loans are written in code (Solidity) and executed by calls to Aave within the code.\n\nThere\u2019s no GUI interface on Aave to take a flash loan. However, platforms like Furucombo offer a GUI to build a flash loan. I fiddled with Furucombo\u2019s block-builder app but couldn\u2019t find any arbitrage opportunities to make me rich (and still repay the loan). I guess I still have to work tomorrow.\n\nSwaps\n\nAave\u2019s swaps are powered by ParaSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that finds the best exchange rates from several DEXs. A preview panel for each swap allowed me to adjust the quantity and slippage (price range). The estimated fees for the swap matched the cost in my MetaMask wallet closely.\n\nSwaps are limited to the assets supported by Aave on the blockchain you choose. Expect a narrow selection.\n\nWithdraw\n\nAfter a long day of chasing unsustainable yields, I wanted to withdraw my new-found riches. The process was simple. When withdrawing CRV, Aave automatically converted aCRV to CRV, depositing the CRV tokens into my MetaMask wallet.\n\nBut it may make sense to swap your high-yield tokens for tokens you want to hold before you withdraw, especially if you wandered into the weird-token weeds like I did.\n\nAave Vs. Centralized Lenders\n\nAave is similar to centralized crypto lenders in that you still have to deposit your tokens. Instead of depositing into a custodial wallet like you would with a centralized lender, you put tokens into a smart contract.\n\nBoth approaches bring risks.\n\nCentralized lenders might gamble your money away on risky bets.\n\nmight gamble your money away on risky bets. Decentralized protocols may have bugs, get hacked, or just disappear (rug pull).\n\nBut Aave is easier to use, doesn\u2019t require ID, and brings more transparency. The source code is available for scrutiny; you can peek under the hood to see the mechanics.\n\nBy contrast, centralized lenders require a leap of faith. In 2022, centralized crypto lending titans Celsius and BlockFi both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, locking user deposits indefinitely.\n\nAave Support\n\nIn addition to extensive documentation, Aave offers three ways to get support:\n\nDiscord\n\nChat\n\nEmail\n\nChat and email are both available from Aave.com and aren\u2019t visible when you\u2019re in the Aave app. I reached out by email using the contact link to ask a question about the wide chasm between the supply APY and the borrow APY.\n\nI received a friendly response within two hours, explaining that the large gap in APYs was due to the percentage of the pool that was borrowed (less than 100%) as well as a 10% reserve factor.\n\nThe reserve factor is used to promote Aave\u2019s growth.\n\nAave Notable Features\n\nSupply (lending) When supplying tokens to Aave, your tokens go into a pool that earns interest as others borrow from the pool. Borrowing Taking a loan couldn\u2019t be easier, but Aave uses overcollateralized loans. If the market swoons, your collateral may be liquidated. Flash Loans With flash loans, you can borrow millions, but you\u2019ll have to pay the loan back in the same block. Staking Aave lets you stake the AAVE Token or Aave Balancer Pool Token (ABPT) to earn a yield of up to 14% (ABPT). Swaps Easily swap your tokens if you find a better yield opportunity on Aave.\n\nAave Fees\n\nUnless you\u2019re borrowing, most fees on Aave are network fees. You\u2019ll pay a network fee to supply or to swap tokens, the latter of which may come with swap fees as well (paid to other protocols). On the Polygon network, these fees are low. On the Ethereum network (Aave V2 and staking), gas fees can prevent smaller positions from achieving a profit.\n\nStaking Network fees (smart contract) Supply Tokens Network fees only Borrow Tokens 1% up to 100% or higher plus network fees Swap Tokens DEX fees, typically under 0.3%, plus network fees Buy Tokens Up to 3.99% plus spread Flash Loans 0.09% one-time fee plus network fees\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nAave Version 3 offers a powerful way to lend or borrow, but the protocol\u2019s liquidation process asks that you borrow responsibly. With a liquidation penalty of up to 10%, more than the loan balance is at risk. On the supply side, you\u2019ll find a wide assortment of tokens paying varied yields, with the ability to swap to another token in a few clicks.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Aave CEFI Or DeFi? Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Decisions on the future of the platform are determined by the community. Holders of the AAVE token can participate in governance by voting. Is Aave Open Source? Yes. Aave is open-source. The code is available for review here. What Is The Aave Token? The AAVE token is a governance token that enables token holders to vote on changes to the protocol. Token holders can also stake the AAVE token to earn a yield. Staking acts as a type of insurance for shortfall events. Are There Risks To Using Aave? Yes. Bugs or hacks are risks with any DeFi protocol. There\u2019s also a risk in borrowing. Market price changes for your collateral can lead to unexpected liquidations. On Aave, a liquidation also comes with a penalty of 5% to 10% Does Aave Provide Tax Reports? No. You\u2019ll have to track your gains and losses or use a crypto tax service that can access your wallet activity to calculate your gains and losses.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "content": "Ethereum and most top altcoins have suffered a substantial loss amidst the latest crypto market\u2019s downfall. The bears are stepping back to pull the price to $1,700 in the next few days. It lost 2.5% overnight.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s recovery that pushed the price above the $1900 level last weekend, Ethereum\u2019s price broke slightly above the important descending trendline and traded above it for the first two days of the week.\n\nUnfortunately, it lost that level today and rolled back under the trendline due to multiple rejections. Some bulls are already trapped with the fake-out as they could suffer more loss if the price continues to dip.\n\nThe latest reaction shows a strong bearish commitment to price as they gear up to unleash more pressure in the market. However, the wedge\u2019s lower boundary is the sell target to pay attention to in this fresh dip.\n\nIf the bears pull lower in the next few days, ETH may encounter some tough supports around the $1,750 level before dropping further. As shown on the daily chart, the volume indicator is still on the fall with no signs of increase yet.\n\nConsidering more positive action to take place, Ethereum would need to reclaim Monday\u2019s high of $1,926 to bring the bulls back into the market. But with the look of things, the bears appear set to stir the wheel one more time before the bulls can gain control.\n\nETH\u2019s Key Level To Watch\n\nIn the meantime, the potential level for a rebound lies at $1,788. If this price level fails to produce support, the next levels to consider for drops are $1,722.9 and $1,678.9, sitting right on the wedge\u2019s lower boundary.\n\nA recovery above the immediate $1,883 resistance level could pave the way for more push to the $1,948 resistance level, located above the weekly high. After that $2,030 and $2,160 are the next buying targets to watch.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $1,883, $1,948, $2,030\n\nKey Support Levels: $1,788.4, $1,722.9, $1,678.9\n\nSpot Price: $1,865\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Deutsche Telekom is a validator on the Polygon network\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS provides staking services to support Polygon\u2019s Supernets\n\nDeutsche Telekom MMS relies on Polygon to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem\n\n\u00a9 Deutsche Telekom / Polygon Labs\n\nDeutsche Telekom, one of the world's leading integrated telecommunications companies, is a validator on Polygon, the leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform, expanding its activities in the field of blockchain technology and signaling support for the network\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nFollowing Q, Flow, Celo, Chainlink, and Ethereum, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom MMS, extends its validation nodes to Polygon, providing staking and validation services for the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network and Polygon\u2019s Supernets solutions. Deutsche Telekom MMS is one of only 100 validators on the Polygon (PoS) network.\n\n\u201cThe Polygon ecosystem is very developer-friendly and resource-efficient. It is based on the highest security standards of the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d noted Dirk R\u00f6der, Head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom. \u201cThe collaboration with Polygon is an important step for Deutsche Telekom MMS to fully exploit the potential of blockchain technology and enable applications suitable for mass deployment. Deutsche Telekom MMS also supports Polygon staking, contributing to the security and decentralization of the blockchain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to have Deutsche Telekom, one of the world\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, become a validator on the Polygon network,\u201d said Michael Blank, Chief Operating Officer at Polygon Labs. \u201cThis collaboration will pave the way for more businesses to embrace blockchain technology through Polygon and empower consumers by unlocking the ownership and autonomy that web3 technology offers.\u201d\n\nValidators play key role in operating and securing blockchains\n\nDeveloped by Polygon Labs, Polygon\u2019s development and growth team, the Polygon ecosystem offers a growing suite of protocols for developers to gain easy access to major scaling solutions, including zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains, app-specific chains, and data availability protocols. As a validator, Deutsche Telekom MMS will help secure Polygon's PoS sidechain and Supernets app-chains, contributing to their security, governance, and decentralization by running a full node, producing blocks, validating and participating in consensus, and committing checkpoints on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nToday, Polygon\u2019s PoS chain already hosts tens of thousands of decentralized applications, more than three million daily transactions, and $1.2 billion in Total Value Locked. Polygon Supernets allows builders to create high-performing, customizable app chains with flexible implementation options quickly and seamlessly so that projects can focus on their business model and user strategies. Supernets allow projects to define their own throughput, gas currency, gas limit requirements, and much more.\n\nBoth solutions operate in conjunction with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing them to process transactions quickly, economically, and securely. Changes are then replicated on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "What Is Coinbase Wallet?\n\nLike similar wallets, Coinbase Wallet provides a way to send and receive crypto assets on the blockchain. And because the wallet supports the Ethereum blockchain as well as Ethereum-compatible networks, like Base, Polygon and Optimism, you can use Coinbase Wallet as a DeFi crypto wallet, so you can connect to a growing number of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nFor example, you can connect to Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, or Opensea, the leading NFT marketplace.\n\nCoinbase Wallet also supports self-custody storage for the Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin and Litecoin networks.\n\nKey Features\n\nFeature Explanation Buy Connect to your Coinbase exchange account\u2019s payment methods, allowing you to buy several types of cryptocurrency within your wallet or buy crypto via local payment methods in 130+ countries Swap Swap with price checks on over 75 DEXes and the ability to trade thousands of tokens across major chains including Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Solana, and BNB Chain Bridge Lets you transfer supported tokens between blockchains Send/Receive Send to contacts or any address; receive using your address, scannable QR code, .eth address, or your Coinbase Decentralized ID (cb.id). Send USDC on Base, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Avalanche C-chain without any network fees dApp browser (mobile) Connect to decentralized applications to trade, buy NFTs, or explore metaverse worlds Enhanced token detection Coinbase Wallet can automatically detect new tokens added to your wallet. You can also add support for new tokens manually Support for hardware wallets Pair Coinbase Wallet with Ledger devices. Your hardware wallet provides a second signature for transactions Adjustable gas fees Adjust transaction costs with custom slippage tolerance to match the transaction\u2019s priority Safety Coinbase Wallet automatically filters out spam tokens and NFTs. Decodes and simulates transactions, including EIP-712 messages in a clear, user-friendly format. Offers protective warnings against malicious dapps and addresses. Users can easily review and revoke existing token allowance approvals as well\n\nCoinbase Wallet Fees\n\nTransaction Fee Sending USDC on Base, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Avalanche C-chain None Other token and NFT sends Network fee (varies) Token swap variable based on networks and payment methods\n\nFor most transfers, there are the standard network transaction fees. Coinbase Wallet doesn\u2019t add any additional fees.\n\nThere are no fees for sending USDC between wallets on Base, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Avalanche C-chain\n\nIf you connect your Coinbase Wallet to your Coinbase account to trade, expect to pay a fee of between 0.5% and 4.5% on trades depending on the token, volume, and payment method.\n\nYou will pay a flat fee of 1% if you want to swap one token for another in your Coinbase Wallet.\n\nOur Expert Review Of Coinbase Wallet\n\nI took Coinbase Wallet for a test drive, trying out the Chrome Extension and mobile app to give you our Milk Road opinion. Here\u2019s my experience with each.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Browser Extension Review\n\nWhen I sent MATIC from my wallet, Coinbase automatically chose the Polygon network where I had my MATIC tokens stashed. No surprises there and no settings to change.\n\nWhat was surprising is that Coinbase Wallet shows sending amounts in USD as well as the crypto token quantity. MetaMask, the most popular competitor, shows these values in crypto tokens. Score one for Coinbase Wallet; after all, we still think in USD (or our local currency).\n\nTo get the receiving address, you can scan a QR code, copy/paste the address, or use the ENS-compatible name for the wallet described in the how-to later in the article.\n\nCoinbase Wallet lets you adjust the network fee for ETH-compatible network transactions, a feature made possible by EIP-1559, an improvement to the Ethereum network that allows fee adjustments. It also supports Replace-By-Fee (BIP-125) which allows you to speed up BTC transactions.\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nAlthough Coinbase Wallet is a standalone app, you can connect it to your Coinbase (Pay) account to fund purchases. On the Coinbase exchange, you\u2019ll find a wider selection \u2013 but not all are supported by the wallet. You can also buy crypto with local fiat onramps and payment methods in 130+ countries via Coinbase Wallet\u2019s integrations with Transak and Onramper.\n\nMetaMask, which we\u2019ve also reviewed, offers four ways to buy crypto (including Coinbase Pay).\n\nSwaps\n\nI used Coinbase Wallet to swap USDC for MATIC on Polygon. The wallet app compared exchange rates from 21 different sources (liquidity pools) and gave me the best price possible from these markets. Slippage is set to 3% by default, but this can be easily adjusted in the app. They also have a gasless swap feature, where I can choose to pay the network fee with USDC (deducted from my swap) instead of MATIC.\n\nBridge\n\nSometimes, you need to move assets from one blockchain to another, such as when I sent a bunch of MATIC from my Coinbase account over the Ethereum network rather than the Polygon network.\n\nCoinbase Wallet offers a cross-blockchain bridge for these situations with support for bridging assets to and from the Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism networks.\n\nThe bridge fee was $6.20 for the transaction due to network traffic. In a few minutes, the MATIC tokens arrived on the Polygon network.\n\nLedger Support\n\nI connected my Ledger to the Coinbase Wallet extension (mobile isn\u2019t supported). One downside to using a Ledger with Coinbase Wallet is that you have to start with a new Coinbase Wallet. With MetaMask, you can connect to an existing wallet (but Ledger adds new accounts).\n\nCommunity\n\nCoinbase\u2019s ENS-compatible name system lets you search for users by their .eth or cb.id name. This makes it easy to send crypto to someone you know \u2013 or just peek at their activity.\n\nVitalik.eth is going bonkers with the BONK token, it seems.\n\nSupport\n\nCoinbase offers chatbot support (Coinbase Assistant) and email support. You can find both on the help page.\n\nI reached out to Coinbase with a setup question but didn\u2019t get far with the chatbot.\n\nI also used the contact form to inquire. Three hours later, I received a cordial reply, but my specific question remained unanswered.\n\nHowever, I did reach a live agent through chat on a separate issue after Coinbase restricted my account for 24 hours. I could buy crypto, but my crypto was trapped on Coinbase.\n\nAfter some friendly discussion, I was told there was no way to override the system and to wait 24 hours for the restriction to be lifted.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Mobile App Review\n\nWallet\n\nCoinbase\u2019s mobile wallet performs sending and receiving tasks well. I sent BTC, ETH, and MATIC to another wallet without any surprises. The mobile wallet uses a built-in QR code scanner to read the receiving address of other wallets quickly.\n\nWhen sending, I was able to adjust the fee for ETH transactions. Lower fees may mean slower transactions, whereas higher fees can speed up transactions. It also supports Replace-By-Fee (BIP-125) which allows you to speed up BTC transactions.\n\nBuying Crypto\n\nThe buy feature in Coinbase Wallet connects to the payment methods you use on the Coinbase exchange. Coinbase uses Plaid to connect to your bank. Users with multi-factor authentication on their bank account might run into trouble, like I did. If you use PayPal with Coinbase, PayPal isn\u2019t available with Coinbase Pay.\n\nOnce you\u2019re connected, you can use a bank account or debit card to buy any cryptocurrency supported by the mobile wallet. Fees for buying crypto through Coinbase Wallet follow Coinbase\u2019s basic fee structure (which is costlier than Coinbase Advanced).\n\nPurchase Amount Coinbase Fee Under $10 $0.99 $10 to $25 $1.49 $25 to $50 $1.99 $50 to $200 $2.99\n\nFees ranges can vary from these figures, however. I was quoted $1.99 for a $24.84 purchase. You\u2019ll also pay about 4% for card-funded purchases. You can preview the transaction cost before finalizing your purchase.\n\nIn this example, my fee is $1.49, plus a $0.17 network fee to transfer the Bitcoin to my wallet.\n\nBalances for mobile-only cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) won\u2019t show in the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension.\n\nSwaps\n\nThe experience for swaps (exchanging one token for another) works just like on the Chrome extension. Swaps execute smoothly and the Coinbase Wallet supports adjusting the slippage allowed.\n\nIn the example below, I was offered the best price from 21 decentralized exchanges. Coinbase doesn\u2019t add any additional fees for swapping tokens, but there is a fee charge which is the sum of expected network fees as well as 0.1% charge from their DEX aggregator.\n\nBridge\n\nCoinbase\u2019s bridge lets you move cryptocurrency across blockchains. Transactions take several minutes.\n\nHere you can see some of the interface issues in which the app doesn\u2019t scale to the device screen properly. In some cases, I wasn\u2019t able to read the blue button at the bottom to preview or execute transactions.\n\ndApp Browser\n\nEthereum and compatible cryptocurrency networks support smart contracts (computer programs that run on the blockchain), making decentralized applications possible. Swap tokens, play games, or shop for NFTs.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s mobile wallet provides a built-in dApp browser featuring popular dApps like Opensea and Quickswap. I visited both and found my Coinbase Wallet was already connected to these dApps. Quickswap warned that I was on the wrong network (Ethereum) and provided an option to switch to Polygon. Uniswap did not connect automatically, however.\n\nThe dApp browser is slow, but for simple DeFi tasks on the go, Coinbase Wallet gets the job done.\n\nWho\u2019s Coinbase Wallet Good For?\n\nExisting Coinbase Users . If you already use Coinbase to trade and need a wallet to store your tokens, the Coinbase Wallet is an ideal solution because it integrates seamlessly with the trading platform. You can also cut trading fees by transferring money easily between your Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase account compared to other wallet apps.\n\n.

Coinbase Wallet makes it discover trending NFTs.\n\nWho\u2019s It Not Good For?\n\nPeople wary of self-custody risks . The Coinbase Wallet is a self-custody wallet that gives users full control over their tokens. However, if you lose your wallet keys and recovery phrase, you won\u2019t be able to recover your tokens.\n\n. The Coinbase Wallet is a self-custody wallet that gives users full control over their tokens. However, if you lose your wallet keys and recovery phrase, you won\u2019t be able to recover your tokens. People who prefer cold storage. Coinbase Wallet is a \u201chot wallet,\u201d meaning it is connected to the internet and vulnerable to hacking attacks. Some people prefer \u201ccold wallets\u201d that are offline to reduce the risks of compromise.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Alternatives\n\nHere\u2019s how Coinbase Wallet compares to other popular wallets.\n\nCoinbase Wallet MetaMask Trust Wallet Platform Chrome extension, iOS & Android mobile app Chrome extension, iOS & Android mobile app Chrome extension, macOS, iOS & Android mobile app Supported cryptocurrencies ERC-20 tokens and Solana (Chrome extension), ERC-20 tokens, Solana, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and more (mobile) ERC-20 tokens ERC-20 tokens, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Tron, Solana, Stellar, and more Crypto purchase fees $0.99 to $2.99, 3.99% for debit card purchases $1.85 to $3.50, depending on payment processor Up to 4.5% or $3.99, whichever is higher NFT support Yes Yes Yes Swaps supported Yes, ERC-20 tokens Yes, ERC-20 tokens Yes, ERC-20 tokens Bridge Yes, ERC-20 tokens Yes, ERC-20 tokens No, external only Hardware wallet support Ledger (browser extension only) Ledger and Trezor (Chrome extension) Ledger (browser extension only)\n\nCoinbase\u2019s wallet app is available as a Chrome extension or as a mobile wallet (iOS and Android) and can connect to your Coinbase exchange account to buy crypto (but not sell).\n\nHow Does Coinbase Wallet Work?\n\nCoinbase Wallet uses BIP39, the industry standard, to generate a 12-word recovery phrase. This recovery phrase is the key to your wallet. Anyone with the recovery phrase can re-create your wallet and control your crypto assets, so you want to be very careful storing this.\n\nIn the background, the 12-word phrase is linked to a private key (a long string of letters and numbers) that allows you to control your wallet assets on the blockchain.\n\nWallets also use a public key, which creates the wallet address. Coinbase Wallet supports multiple networks (on mobile) and multiple accounts, so you might have several addresses.\n\nAll your Coinbase Wallet assets share the same 12-word recovery phrase.\n\nCoinbase Wallet is a hot wallet, meaning the wallet\u2019s keys were generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. You can connect a Ledger hardware wallet (a cold wallet that generates a private key offline) to a Coinbase Wallet to further secure your assets. However, you need to do this with a new Coinbase Wallet using the Chrome extension. You can find instructions to connect your Ledger here.\n\nWhen you send crypto or connect to a decentralized application, your wallet asks permission to \u201csign\u201d the transaction using your private key. In simple terms, your wallet works as an authenticator.\n\nMulticoin Support\n\nCoinbase Wallet supports several popular Ethereum-compatible blockchains, including Base, Polygon, and Avalanche C-Chain. The wallet also supports Solana, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Binance Chain, and Litecoin.\n\nHowever, some popular cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano and Polkadot, are not supported by the extension or the mobile app. If you have a diversified portfolio, you may need more than one wallet.\n\nHow To Set Up Your Coinbase Wallet\n\nI set up a new wallet using the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.\n\nStep 1: Download And Install The Coinbase Wallet Extension.\n\nVisit Coinbase for the official download link. The link takes you to the Chrome extension installation page. Add the extension to your Chrome or Chromium-based browser.\n\nStep 2: Create A New Wallet.\n\nClick on create new wallet. You can use the second option to install your wallet on additional devices later if needed.\n\nStep 3: Write Down Your Recovery Phrase.\n\nYour wallet will generate a 12-word recovery phrase as well as a hidden private key. Write down the recovery phrase and store it safely. Although Coinbase Wallet offers the option to copy the seed phrase to your clipboard, for security reasons, this isn\u2019t recommended.\n\nStep 4: Verify Your Recovery Phrase And Choose A Password.\n\nChoose the first and last word from your recovery phrase. On the next screen, you\u2019ll also choose a password to protect your wallet while away from your computer.\n\nStep 5: Claim Your Username.\n\nCoinbase Wallet offers a free Ethereum Name Service (ENS) username using this format: yourname.cb.id. Others can send supported crypto tokens directly to your username, which maps to your wallet address. You can also import a .eth name if you have one.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Click on the Buy button to connect to your Coinbase Pay account if needed.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nCoinbase Wallet brings some advantages compared to its main competitor, MetaMask, by offering support for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and a number of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor basic sending and receiving as well as problem-free swaps, Coinbase Wallet\u2019s mobile app makes a solid choice, while the Chrome and Brave extension provides a reliable way to explore web3 on the desktop.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Coinbase Wallet A Good Wallet? Yes. Coinbase Wallet offers a reliable way to store supported coins and tokens or connect to decentralized applications. Should I Keep My Crypto In Coinbase Wallet? Coinbase Wallet is a hot wallet, meaning the wallet\u2019s private key was generated and stored on a device connected to the internet. You can reduce risk by limiting how much you keep in your wallet or by pairing the Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension with a hardware wallet to enhance security. Can I Transfer Money From My Coinbase Wallet To My Bank Account? No. Coinbase Wallet lets you buy or swap crypto, but there is no way to transfer money to your bank account from your wallet. How Much Are Coinbase Wallet Fees? Coinbase Wallet doesn\u2019t charge a fee to use the wallet, but some actions require a fee. Swaps can cost $6 and up. Buying crypto through Coinbase Wallet comes with fees of up to 3.99%. Why do I Need A Crypto Wallet? A crypto wallet lets you control your crypto assets on the blockchain. A standalone wallet can connect to web3 applications and provide an off-exchange way to manage your cryptocurrency or NFTs. Is Coinbase Wallet Safe? It appears pretty safe. Coinbase Wallet gives you full control over your crypto keys, so no third party can tamper with your funds without permission. If you download the mobile app, you can also control access to it with biometric authentication (fingerprint or Face ID). Keep in mind that it\u2019s impossible to know if this wallet will always be safe in the long run.\n\nStaff Writer Eric Huffman Eric Huffman is a staff writer for MilkRoad.com.

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum - Collateral Network Set For Bullish Growth Q2 in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. But which is a better investment? In the last month, both projects have decreased in price following a rally, though given its recent upgrade, Ethereum is looking to become the more popular option. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum compete, Collateral Network (COLT) is offering higher returns and dominating the presale space.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nInvestors Believe Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Could Be Over\n\nBitcoin has been one of the most profitable assets in the world in 2023. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin (BTC) increased in value from $16,500 to over $30,000. However, Bitcoin is now on the decline. In the last 30 days, Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased in price by 12.1%, with one Bitcoin (BTC) selling for $26,364 at the time of writing.\n\nGiven its steady decline in recent weeks, Bitcoin trading volume is also down as investors look to recoup their losses with alternative investments. Furthermore, some investors believe that Bitcoin is only accessible to crypto whales. Given its huge price tag, very few investors can buy an entire Bitcoin. As a result, only investors with large portfolios can truly profit from its growth.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH) Trading Activity Rises Despite Price Collapse\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent upgrade has been a huge win for the Ethereum community. Trading volume is up, and more investors staked Ethereum in the final two weeks of April than in the whole of March. During this upgrade, over $30 billion worth of staked everything was unlocked, and any liquidity doubts were put to bed.\n\nHowever, much like Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has decreased in the last month. Ethereum (ETH) is down by 5.71%, with one Ether selling for $1,765.06. Nonetheless, investors believe that Ethereum (ETH) could be the better long-term alternative due to its influence throughout the DeFi market.\n\nDespite being a newer project in the market, Collateral Network is looking to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2023. Collateral Network is a completely unique DeFi project set to revolutionize the lending process by helping borrowers unlock liquidity from real-world assets.\n\nThis is done by minting the physical assets as fractionalized NFTs and selling these fractions to multiple investors. The physical assets, which can be properties, vintage cars, fine wines, jewelry, and watches, act as collateral for liquidity. In the process, borrowers can raise funds in 24 hours without impacting their credit rating. Lenders are rewarded with a weekly interest, which will be paid passively for the duration of the loan.\n\nCollateral Network simplifies the lending process offering greater levels of transparency through the use of AI, more convenience with smart contracts, and outstanding privacy with data being stored on the blockchain.\n\nCollateral Network is powered by COLT tokens. These will be used for governance rights and will reward holders with staking bonuses and exclusive access to auctions for distressed assets. Tokens are selling fast during stage one of the Collateral Network (COLT), with one token available for $0.014.\n\nIn the next six months, COLT is expected to hit $0.35, offering a 3500% return from its original price, a significantly larger gain than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), which has made it one of the most popular assets in the presale market. Furthermore, once the token hits major exchanges, it is expected to surge by 100x. Therefore, the best moment to acquire those tokens is now, when early investors can benefit from a 40% deposit bonus.\n\nFor more information on Collateral Network, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Thinking about buying cryptocurrency?\n\nYour first question may have to do with how to know which cryptocurrency to buy. How to know what crypto to buy starts by understanding what cryptocurrency is and what to look for when buying cryptocurrency. When you finish reading this article, you\u2019ll understand the basics of crypto, how to analyze different cryptocurrencies, which cryptocurrencies are evergreen choices for every investor and how to research and buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Crypto\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that exists as an encrypted set of transactions on a digital ledger known as a blockchain. A bank or government entity issues the currency and maintains a ledger of transactions with standard fiat currencies.\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrency, a computer algorithm performs both tasks. This highlights two defining features of cryptocurrency: the concept of blockchain and cryptography.\n\nA blockchain is a digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions. Each transaction represents a \"block\" of data strung together to form a chain that theoretically makes all cryptocurrency transactions available to all owners. The data for every transaction is encrypted using cryptography.\n\nCryptocurrencies share common characteristics, including the following:\n\nDigital form: Cryptocurrency does not have a physical equivalent like coins or paper money. The currency is code that exists inside of computers. Peer-to-peer form: A transaction only goes from one person to another online. There is no intermediary person or institution. Borderless and frictionless: There is no exchange rate for cryptocurrency being traded in the U.S., Germany or Japan. It is a currency like gold and other precious metals that trades freely across countries and borders. Encrypted: Cryptocurrency owners are completely anonymous because each user has a public key (similar to a username) and a private key (like a password). Decentralized: This means there are no banks. An owner\u2019s private key allows them access to their digital wallet, which carries some risk. If the owner loses the private key, no bank can back them up. Operate in a zero-trust environment: This means that all cryptocurrencies are built and verified on a blockchain by computers based on a series of algorithms.\n\nHow to Analyze Crypto to Buy\n\nHow do you know what to look for when buying cryptocurrency? The best new cryptocurrency to buy can seem like a stumbling block for most investors. That\u2019s because cryptocurrency is not a physical currency and cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t companies with revenue and earnings. The rules that investors would use to analyze stocks don\u2019t apply to cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t evaluate cryptocurrency. Take a look at some ways to analyze a cryptocurrency that you may want to buy. First, it\u2019s important to understand the differences between types of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStep 1: Consider tokens vs. altcoins.\n\nCryptocurrencies are categorized as coins (also called alternative cryptocurrency, or altcoins) and tokens. Altcoins are an alternative to Bitcoin. All altcoins have their own independent blockchain. These can be derived from Bitcoin's open-source protocol. They can also create their own blockchain and protocol for their native currency.\n\nTokens operate on top of an existing blockchain and allow the creation of more decentralized applications (called DApps), which is the future of cryptocurrency. Tokens are created using smart contracts, programmable computer codes that are completely self-executing. Tokens can represent any tradable asset. DApps can be thought of as similar to an interface that allows smart contracts to interact with the blockchain. Ethereum is the most popular digital application.\n\nStep 2: Understand the project.\n\nNext, understand the use case (the project) for the DApp:\n\nReview the project\u2019s white paper . Most cryptocurrency projects produce a white paper summarizing the objectives and how the cryptocurrency will help achieve those objectives. The white paper should also spell out the long-term vision as well as the timeline for the project. These white papers can be highly technical in nature as is the cryptocurrency itself. If you don\u2019t understand what the project is trying to accomplish, you may want to find a different cryptocurrency to analyze. Research the development team and project leadership. Some of this information should be readily supplied by the company on its \u201cAbout\u201d page. Prospective investors should be concerned if it\u2019s unclear who the founders or developers are. Research the \u201ccommunity.\u201d Cryptocurrencies can be very fraternal. This means that many altcoins have a passionate group of followers, which is essential for a currency to gain adoption. The value of cryptocurrency depends on the basic rules of supply and demand. A cryptocurrency that nobody wants to buy or trade will be worthless. A coin that is in high demand but with limited supply will be priceless.\n\nStep 3: Analyze market capitalization.\n\nAnalyzing cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t follow the same rules as investors use to analyze a company or its stock so you might wonder how the words \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d or market cap apply to cryptocurrency. Many investors may think that assigning a market cap to cryptocurrency but market capitalization commonly used cryptocurrency metric defined as:\n\n\n\nTotal Circulation Supply x Price\n\nIn other words, a coin with a total circulation of 300,000 coins and a price of one cent would have a market cap of 3,000 (300,000 x 0.01).\n\nBecause of the volatility of cryptocurrency, however, market caps can change suddenly and significantly. In this regard, crypto investors can apply some of the same logic as with stocks. That is, cryptocurrencies with a larger market cap tend to be less volatile than the ones with a smaller market cap.\n\nStep 4: Review the \u201ctokenomics.\u201d\n\nIn addition to knowing the relationship between a cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and its market cap, it\u2019s critical to understand the distribution, circulation and total supply of a cryptocurrency, also called \u201ctokenomics,\u201d which affects the price of cryptocurrency over time.\n\nTokenomics is based on the relationship between a coin\u2019s circulating supply, which is the amount of the coin currently in the market and its total supply, which is the amount of the currency after all the available tokens have been unlocked and distributed. It is also based on the coin\u2019s maximum supply, which is the total amount of the coin there will ever be.\n\nBitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million, which means at some point, there will never be any new Bitcoin mined. This is an indicator that the price of Bitcoin will rise significantly in the future because each individual bitcoin (or fraction of a Bitcoin) will become much more valuable.\n\nStep 5: Look for trusted sources.\n\nMany investors want to do the research for themselves but cryptocurrency can get very technical in nature. You can access many online sources to assist you. For example, MarketBeat provides a cryptocurrency screener in addition to a daily cryptocurrency newsletter. Other reliable sources include Messari, Glassnode and CoinGecko.\n\n5 of the Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now\n\nThe first and most commonly recognized platform is the Bitcoin network. However, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies available. Here is a list of five of the best cryptocurrencies to buy as of this writing.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin remains the largest of the cryptocurrencies. As of October 2022, it has a $350 billion market cap. One of the key arguments for owning bitcoin is the idea of scarcity. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be \u201cmined\u201d and over 19 million are already in circulation.\n\nBitcoin has also become widely accepted as a medium of exchange. Payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard allow Bitcoin to be used in transactions, which creates more institutional interest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is also controversial because of its proof-of-work (PoW) validation mechanism. While users appreciate it for its safety and security, it draws the ire of environmental advocates who are concerned about the amount of electricity used in bitcoin mining.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nEthereum is right behind Bitcoin in terms of market cap. Ethereum launched in 2015, about six years after Bitcoin. The coin is used as the payment or \u201cgas\u201d behind the platform, which is known for executing smart contracts. This has made Ethereum one of the go-to coins for developers, particularly those interested in creating nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThis popularity has come with a cost. As digital networks go, Ethereum has become kind of slow. But that is likely to change with \u201cthe merge\u201d that happened in September 2022. It transitioned Ethereum from a PoW protocol to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. This makes the network faster and lowers the gas fees for developers. It will make Ethereum a more environmentally friendly token as well.\n\n3. Cardano\n\nCardano is another PoS project. Cardano was the first coin launched with that mechanism in place. Cardano is popular among developers. As of September 2022, 1,000 projects were created on the platform\u2019s blockchain, which gives credence to the idea that it may be a buy-and-hold coin for the long term.\n\nThe founders take a staged, measured approach to rolling out the entire Cardano platform. Each stage has brought new functionality to the platform. Cardano trades with the symbol ADA and recently released its rewards token, ADACash, to much fanfare.\n\n4. Ripple\n\nRipple is a blockchain project used to facilitate fast and inexpensive cross-border transactions. Think about what has to happen to send money to a friend or relative overseas using the current SWIFT system. The funds have to leave your account in dollars and are delivered to the receiving country\u2019s bank, where the funds are subject to exchange rates. It\u2019s a project that\u2019s not timely and inefficient.\n\nThe Ripple token takes the place of the currency. You buy Ripple, send it to the receiving party who receives the funds as Ripple and then convert them into their native currency. All of this happens in seconds or minutes (as opposed to days).\n\nRipple remains engaged in a court case with the SEC. Although Ripple is confident it will win, the outcome is still unclear at the time of this writing. The issue is whether or not Ripple should be treated as a security.\n\nLearn more: What is an SEC filing and how does it relate to market indexes?\n\n5. Polygon\n\nPolygon is an offshoot of the Ethereum blockchain. The platform\u2019s goal is to improve the scalability and infrastructure of Ethereum. It accomplishes this with a \u201clayer two\u201d concept that expands the Ethereum blockchain into multiple chains. This allows faster transaction speeds.\n\nThe platform supports the Tether (USDT) stablecoin and is making investments in carbon neutrality. Meta Platforms and Stripe have adopted Polygon, which will likely help facilitate the coin\u2019s adoption.\n\nHow to Buy Crypto\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some steps to buy cryptocurrency.\n\nStep 1: Determine your future goals.\n\nFiguring out your future goals isn\u2019t as cut-and-dried as it may seem. Cryptocurrency can serve many purposes. Many individuals buy cryptocurrency as an investment that they believe will increase in value over time. The most common way to make money with cryptocurrencies involves using a buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nSome investors want to have a supply of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, such as Dogecoin. Dogecoin doesn\u2019t have any particular utility aside from as a medium of exchange. One of the most publicized use cases for Dogecoin was when billionaire and owner of the National Basketball Association\u2019s Dallas Mavericks said Dogecoin would be accepted as payment for some purchases. The same is true of AMC Entertainment, which accepts Dogecoin as a form of payment.\n\nStill others want to own cryptocurrency as a store of value. Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold and Ethereum as digital silver. As of this writing, there\u2019s no evidence that cryptocurrency is an inflation hedge or a hedge against fiat currency. There are many who believe that will ultimately be the greatest reason to own cryptocurrency.\n\nStep 2: Find an online crypto exchange and open your account.\n\nYou may be surprised to know how many crypto exchanges exist. Some of the more popular exchanges include Coinbase and eToro. A growing number of brokerage houses give their clients the option to invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nOnce you find an exchange to trade on, you\u2019re ready to open your account. Because cryptocurrency is decentralized, the only time you need to use fiat currency is to fund your trading account. You\u2019ll need to make sure you have the required tools:\n\nDigital wallet (cryptocurrency wallet): Cryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet. The digital wallet is software that makes it possible for the blockchain to recognize the owner.\n\nPublic key: The public key is similar to a username that allows balances to be transferred from one account to another.\n\nPrivate key : The private key is a password that allows the user to confirm the transaction.\n\nStep 3: Practice diversification.\n\nSimilar to investing in stocks, it\u2019s a good idea to carefully divide your cryptocurrency investments among several coins to mitigate risk. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and it\u2019s not surprising to see the price of a coin more 5% to 10% in a single direction in a day. Unlike the stock market, the crypto market never sleeps. Crypto exchanges are open 24/7, 365 days a year. You\u2019ll have to monitor your accounts a bit more frequently than you might check your stocks.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to crypto or have a limited amount of funds available to purchase crypto assets, many analysts say it\u2019s best to stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum as the best crypto to buy now. These two stalwart names will survive whatever shakeup happens as a result of potential regulation. Plus, these are the coins that institutional investors buy."

        "title": "From cricket to crypto: AB de Villiers ventures into Web3 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "AB de Villiers is a household name in the world of cricket, renowned for his swashbuckling batting style and records in the shorter formats of the game. Perhaps less well known is his involvement in the Web3 and cryptocurrency space as he moves on from an illustrious sports career.\n\nThe 39-year-old South African sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Cointelegraph as he shifts his attention to the world of Web3. From his love affair with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to an ambassadorship with a Web3 investment platform, De Villiers has familiarized himself with the ins and outs of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs the South African explained in the first episode of Crypto and Sport, his personal experience navigating the crypto ecosystem has tossed up some testing deliveries to bat away. It has also led him to become an ambassador for a new Ethereum-based Web3 investment platform looking to open up retail investor access to opportunities in promising new start-ups.\n\nHands off my Mutant Ape!\n\nDe Villiers admits that he kept the crypto space at an arms\u2019 length for a number of years despite the best efforts of Web3 savvy friends and family to compel him to explore the industry as early as 2017.\n\nRelated: Planet of the Bored Apes: BAYC\u2019s success morphs into ecosystem\n\nWhile his brothers pressed him to invest in Ripple\u2019s native XRP in those early days, De Villiers remained skeptical of the crypto ecosystem and kept his distance, until he started exploring trading more seriously after downloading Trading View:\n\n\u201cI started to follow some of my favorite stuff. Obviously, the markets as well, gold, commodities, the Nasdaq and S&P 500. I just found a bit of interest, started reading a little bit about the markets around the world and then obviously also crypto, Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP were my first interests.\u201d\n\nA couple of years later, NFTs took off with collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club scoring hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. De Villiers brushed up on the intricacies of the space with the help of a friend working in the industry.\n\nA variety of Mutant Apes listed on NFT marketplace OpenSea. With a current floor price of around 9.5 ETH, each avatar of the 20,000-strong collection is valued at over $18,000.\n\nGetting to grips with MetaMask and its various wallet and network connections, token swaps and blockchain bridges, De Villiers quickly became enamored with collecting NFTs. Describing his experience as being littered with highs and lows, the former Proteas captain was particularly proud of being a Mutant Ape owner, which also happened to be his first NFT trade.\n\n\u201cI think I started off with an amazing bang. I bought an M2 mutant ape. Amazing as a first investment. I went straight for the big one. Obviously, it\u2019s not overboard, but still, an M2 is a biggie.\u201d\n\nHis dose of NFT dabbling went on for some time, with De Villiers estimating that his NFT trophy cabinet held over 300 digital collectibles before an unfortunate incident left him scrambling. Enticed by a malicious NFT masquerading as a new Pudgy Penguin drop, De Villiers inadvertently gave a hacker access to his wallet by signing a malicious contract more than a year ago:\n\n\u201cI tapped on it, it looked very legit. There was a $1 gas fee. The minute I hit that gas fee, it stalled. I hit it about five times, which ultimately meant that I gave this guy access to my whole wallet.\u201d\n\nDe Villiers ended up losing a portion of his collection before sending the remainder of his NFTs to another wallet for safekeeping. He admitted that the experience had made him recognize some of the challenges of navigating Web3 for newcomers:\n\n\u201cI made a couple of mistakes, and it cost me dearly, but that is something I really want to talk about. For anyone who wants to invest in NFTs, blockchain or Web3, it\u2019s all new, and it\u2019s complicated, or it can be unless you simplify it as much as possible.\u201d\n\nLeveling the investment playing field\n\nThe experience also led him to get involved with Common Wealth as an ambassador. The Ethereum-powered Web3 investment platform aims to give retail investors early access to startups that are traditionally stonewalled for conventional venture capital investors. It \u201clevels the playing field\u201d for retail investors to invest in high-potential early-stage Web3 projects, as De Villiers tells Cointelegraph.\n\nReady to level up your investment game? With Common Wealth, you can invest in private VC deals that were once reserved for the few, not the many. Let\u2019s level up the playing field. pic.twitter.com/nJR2G2SC5B \u2014 Common Wealth (@joincommonwlth) May 31, 2023\n\nThe platform allows the average investor access to early stage projects and companies at seed and private sale rounds. Users are able to invest in a variety of funds with crypto to access tokenized shares issued as genesis NFTs .\n\nCommunity investors decide which projects to back through different funds, with voting power proportionate to their investment in a respective fund. Fund NFTs can be sold, traded or fractionalized on the platform or other marketplaces, which affords access to capital that is typically locked up for long time frames in conventional seed investment rounds.\n\nFor De Villiers, giving the everyday investor access to an easy to use platform with a low financial barrier to entry to traditionally exclusive early fundraising rounds resonated with his views on financial inclusivity.\n\nHe draws parallels to the socio economic landscape in South Africa, with its multitude of cultures and a regrettably large disparity of wealth, and the potential for projects like Common Wealth to tackle inequality:\n\n\u201cI love the fact that the common person, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Common Wealth, can get an opportunity alongside the most wealthy person out there, the guy who has been involved with this space for ten years, who knows all the tricks, the ins and outs, this just gives you a level playing field.\u201d\n\nWith some 9.5 million followers on Twitter and more than double that on Instagram, De Villiers added that his alignment with the project was assured by the pedigree of individuals behind Common Wealth. Prominent team members include alumni from Google, Activision Blizzard, Intel, Cardano and Facebook that have built the Ethereum-powered mobile-optimized platform.\n\nDe Villiers continues to adjust to life after an illustrious cricket career that saw him named ICC One Day International player of the year three times. Broadcast work is in the cards for the 39-year-old, while he admits that he\u2019d like to continue exploring the Web3 industry in various capacities, whether it is apportioning investments into Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), NFTs and other promising Web3 projects.\n\nThat comes with the usual caveat of caution when investing in the cryptocurrency space, given a long history of market volatility and other criticisms of the nascent sector.\n\nMagazine: Crypto scoring big with European football"

        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE), Polygon (MATIC), and Sythentix (SNX) are three of the top altcoins to buy right now. All three are predicted to enjoy significant growth while many cryptocurrencies struggle to rebound from the 2022 lows.\n\nInQubeta expected to have phenomenal year\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) solves a problem many potential investors face: not having access to traditional investments due to entry barriers like high minimum deposits many people can\u2019t afford. InQubeta\u2019s platform bypasses these barriers, making it possible for anyone to invest in promising AI startups.\n\nArtificial intelligence has generated lots of buzz in the past decade as it slowly transitions from being an interesting concept to reality. AI software now helps financial institutions to detect fraud, and self-learning assembly line robots are already being used by many companies.\n\nMany technology experts predict AI will be the next big tech revolution, and the increasing investments in the sector are congruent with their analyses, with the total investment in the AI industry jumping from $12.75 billion in 2015 to $93.5 billion in 2021. That number is expected to keep growing as InQubeta\u2019s platform allows more investors to be part of AI\u2019s rise.\n\nStartups can raise capital for their AI projects by minting ERC-20 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the InQubeta blockchain, which is built on Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) platform. Once fractionalized these NFTs represent equity in these companies and other rewards.\n\nEach company\u2019s NFTs are listed on the InQubeta marketplace once approved. There, investors can browse companies and read about their projects before purchasing tokens of companies they find interesting. Investors get to choose and pick which companies they want to bet on.\n\nPurchases are made with the platform\u2019s native currency, $QUBE. The token is deflationary by design, with a 2% tax on marketplace transactions that\u2019s sent to a burn wallet, and a 5% tax used to fund a reward pool for those who stake their $QUBE tokens. These tokens also give them access to participate in the platform\u2019s governance.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) recovering well\n\nPolygon has been one of the few altcoins that have grown steadily since the 2022 crash, with prices rising by over 100% in 2023. Polygon is a cryptocurrency that connects blockchains and improves their scalability. The platform runs on Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) blockchain and provides improved interoperability and flexibility while enjoying the structure of ETH\u2019s network.\n\nMATIC is the platform\u2019s native currency, and it\u2019s an ERC-20 token. It is used for transaction fees, to secure the network, and to give investors access to the platform\u2019s governance.\n\nSynthetix (SNX) poised for growth\n\nSynthetix prices haven\u2019t increased as much as Polygon\u2019s, but some cryptocurrency experts predict it will see significant growth later in the year. Its platform provides a liquidity provisioning protocol that other protocols can tap into.\n\nThe Synthetix platform offers low fees and deep liquidity. The network serves as a backend for many protocols on the Ethereum and Optimism networks. Synthetix\u2019s goal is to widen the cryptocurrency ecosystem by introducing non-blockchain assets.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta, Polygon, and Synthetix are three of the top altcoins to buy as all three are projected to experience significant growth. InQubeta has the most potential out of the trio by bringing investors and artificial intelligence startups together.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Neben Validierungsdienste bietet die Telekom MMS auch Staking-Services f\u00fcr das Proof-of-Stake (PoS) -Netzwerk und die Supernets von Polygon an. Supernets, auch Sidechains genannt, sind spezielle, in sich geschlossene Blockchains auf dem Polygon-Netzwerk. Sie erm\u00f6glichen eine h\u00f6here Skalierbarkeit und die Entwicklung massentauglicher Anwendungen auf der Blockchain. Gleichzeitig sind die Supernets mit der Ethereum-Blockchain verbunden. Transaktionen werden so schneller, wirtschaftlicher und sicherer abgewickelt und \u00c4nderungen auf Ethereum gespiegelt.\n\nHinweis f\u00fcr deutsche Untertitel: Unter Einstellungen \u201eUntertitel automatisch \u00fcbersetzen\u201c ausw\u00e4hlen, dann bei \u201ebeliebige Sprache\u201c Deutsch w\u00e4hlen.\n\nValidatoren spielen Schl\u00fcsselrolle bei Betrieb und Sicherung von Blockchains\n\nDie Telekom MMS betreibt einen vollst\u00e4ndigen Knoten, erzeugt Bl\u00f6cke, validiert, nimmt am Konsens teil und legt Kontrollpunkte auf der Ethereum Blockchain fest. Als Validator sichert sie Polygon, die Ethereum Sidechain, und deren Supernets ab. So tr\u00e4gt die Telekom-Tochter zur Sicherheit, Governance und Dezentralisierung bei.\n\n\u201eDas Polygon-\u00d6kosystem ist sehr entwicklerfreundlich und ressourcenschonend. Es basiert auf h\u00f6chsten Sicherheitsstandards des Ethereum-\u00d6kosystems. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Polygon ist ein wichtiger Schritt f\u00fcr die Telekom MMS, das Potenzial der Blockchain-Technologie voll auszusch\u00f6pfen und massentaugliche Anwendungen zu erm\u00f6glichen. Die Telekom MMS unterst\u00fctzt zudem das Polygon-Staking und tr\u00e4gt damit zur Sicherheit und Dezentralisierung der Blockchain bei\u201c, sagt Dirk R\u00f6der, Leiter Blockchain Solutions Center der Deutschen Telekom.\n\n\"Wir freuen uns, dass die Deutsche Telekom, einer der weltweit f\u00fchrenden Telekommunikationsanbieter, ein Validator f\u00fcr das Polygon-Netzwerk ist\", sagte Michael Blank, Chief Operating Officer bei Polygon Labs. \"Diese Zusammenarbeit wird den Weg f\u00fcr mehr Unternehmen ebnen, die Blockchain-Technologie \u00fcber Polygon zu nutzen, und den Verbrauchern die M\u00f6glichkeit geben, die Eigentumsrechte und die Autonomie zu nutzen, die die Web3-Technologie bietet.\"\n\nDas von Polygon Labs entwickelte Polygon-\u00d6kosystem bietet eine wachsende Anzahl von Protokollen. Es erm\u00f6glicht Entwicklern einen einfachen Zugang zu Skalierungsl\u00f6sungen. Sie erstellen auf den Polygon Supernets schnell und nahtlos hochleistungsf\u00e4hige, anpassbare App-Chains mit flexiblen Implementierungsoptionen. Web3-Projekte k\u00f6nnen ihren eigenen Datendurchsatz mit Kryptow\u00e4hrung und Grenzwerte f\u00fcr Transaktionen definieren. Mit Supernets konzentrieren sich Projekte auf ihr Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell und ihre Nutzerstrategien."

        "title": "Pauly0x earns nearly $1M through unconventional Ethereum transfers - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Crypto influencer Pauly0x has unexpectedly made nearly $1 million by demanding Ethereum transfers to his yougetnothing.eth wallet. With a tweet calling the Bitcoin sector \u201can absolute joke,\u201d this experiment drew much attention and more than $1 million in just seven minutes. The episode demonstrates the crypto sphere\u2019s quirkiness and unpredictability.\n\nPauly0x swoops $1 million in Ethereum transfers\n\nAccording to media reports, a crypto influencer named Pauly0x made close to $1 million after requesting Ethereum transfers from fans to his yougetnothing.eth wallet. In response, the social media influencer called the cryptocurrency industry \u201can absolute joke\u201d on Twitter.\n\nPauly0x made a public Ethereum address available to the public on May 30. A GIF of the \u201cYou Get Nothing!\u201d a scene from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was attached to it.\n\nPeople have sent Pauly0x $437,077 to his wallet\n\n\n\nContext:\n\nPauly is a crypto influencer who posted his wallet, and said you'll get nothing pic.twitter.com/gXlw4iV9WM \u2014 xero \ud83c\udfae (@xerocooleth) May 30, 2023\n\nAfter the first seven minutes, Pauly stated that the account had received about $80 in Ethereum. The tweet received 1.2 million views in a single day, helping the total to surpass $1 million. Etherscan shows more than 579 ETH in the wallet at the time of publication.\n\nOn Twitter, Pauly congratulated those who joined the \u201cmillion dollar club\u201d on May 31, adding that they will \u201cliterally receive nothing.\u201d He stated,\n\nIf there is anything you learn from following this account,\u201d he said, \u201cI hope you should never take any of these literal A**CLOWNS seriously. PaulyOX\n\nUsers of the Pepe community responded to the announcement by using Pepe the Frog, the mascot of the infamous PEPE meme coin, as a pump.\n\nHarrison, an on-chain auditor, discovered that the address received about $600,000 from 3,000 transactions. Even the balance of 43 wallets, greater than 0.5 ETH, was transmitted. It is fascinating that various sums are repeated throughout the transfers, even if these are just hypotheses. Three addresses sent 10 ETH, while the other ten sent between 5 and 7 ETH. 42 addresses sent one ETH, while six addresses sent between three and four.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, one of the addresses that sent 10 ETH was first active on May 22. Oddly, the first transaction to that wallet was 544 ETH from the crypto loan exchange MEXC.\n\nEthereum market faces investor holdings drop\n\nRecent research indicates that the Ethereum market is currently experiencing severe difficulties. Data from the on-chain analytics company Glassnode suggest a significant drop in prominent investors\u2019 holdings.\n\nAccording to data, the whales, or Ethereum addresses with 1,000 or more tokens, have dropped to a 10-month low of 6,268. This low was previously recorded in November 2022, when a total of 6,270 was marginally higher.\n\nNotably, the value of whale holdings is falling, which is usually a bearish sign, implying that institutional investors may be losing faith in the near-term prospects of Ethereum. According to analysts, such a change in the attitudes of large investors frequently has a discernible effect on the market.\n\nThe whales play a vital role since the size of their transactions might affect the price of Ethereum. Ethereum has moved closer to the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) simultaneously.\n\nTechnically speaking, the second-largest cryptocurrency might consolidate at this level. Analysts contend that the declining trade volume may, nonetheless, have an impact on the stability of Ethereum\u2019s price. Numerous causes may have contributed to these changes among whale investors.\n\nDespite a decline in the number of Ethereum whale addresses, holdings have continued to grow quickly. This suggests that even though some investors decide to sell their assets, some are optimistic about the asset. Another factor to consider is that some whales may be reallocating their assets in response to market trends, while others may be collecting profits after Ethereum\u2019s recent surges.\n\nAnalysts speculate that some whales may be reducing their holdings because of worries about the scalability of Ethereum and its high transaction costs. It is crucial to note that Ethereum is about to undergo a significant update to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\nInvestor sentiment may be impacted by this upgrade as the potential risks and advantages of the change become more apparent. Some investors may be concerned by whales\u2019 declining Ethereum holdings since it may be a harbinger of investor dissent or a decline in the market. The ownership of Ethereum is one of many issues to be aware of right now, though."
