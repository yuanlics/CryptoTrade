        "title": "3 tips for trading Ethereum this year - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is a notoriously volatile industry, regardless of what coin you\u2019re trading. During periods of extreme volatility, it\u2019s easy to become disheartened when trades don\u2019t go your way. It\u2019s also easy to become overconfident when you get lucky, falsely attributing it to your trading strategy \u2014 when, in reality, the price often rose or fell for reasons other than you assumed.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, there are sometimes still strategies you can use to trade certain tokens successfully. Ether (ETH) is arguably where you might be able to succeed this year. Here are three tips that might help.\n\nUnderstand what actually affects ETH price movements\n\nThere are many ways to analyze the price of a given cryptocurrency, and different price valuations will be given depending on the model used and how much weight is given to a specific set of conditions.\n\nBut incorrect weighting can produce erroneous conclusions. For instance, a cryptocurrency can generate positive buy signals across the board, but other factors can send the entire market tanking.\n\nNew daily reminder: $ETH will at some point clean up this $1072 area. Whether we go higher first or not pic.twitter.com/786H6iprmB \u2014 Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) January 7, 2023\n\nThis is precisely what happened with Ethereum\u2019s Merge, where a successful transition to proof-of-stake that reduced consumption by 99.9% was not really reflected in the price. In fact, bearish traders ran the price into the ground.\n\nThe crypto market also tends to correlate heavily with Bitcoin (BTC), which is traded by a lot of institutional and hedge fund money that is tied to interest rates and traditional financial markets. ETH currently holds a 0.9 correlation with Bitcoin.\n\nLeading up to May 2021 and November 2021, ETH experienced significant price increases. This was attributed to announcements from big firms, such as the decision of the European Investment Bank to offer a two-year bond on the Ethereum blockchain. Visa also announced plans to transact in USD Coin (USDC) over Ethereum.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin will surge in 2023 \u2014 But be careful what you wish for\n\nA summary of the factors that affect the price of Ether is that it will be affected most heavily by Bitcoin\u2019s price movement, interest rate decisions, institutional investment and macroeconomic conditions that discourage investment.\n\nFundamental blockchain indicators, however, can strongly point toward medium-term appreciation, perhaps over one to three years. Based on these indicators, Ethereum is a very powerful blockchain with a thriving ecosystem set for growth.\n\nAnticipate the seasonality\n\nLike other cryptocurrencies, ETH has specific months where it performs well, and others where it performs poorly. It performs the worst in September, June and March, meaning those may be good times to become a buyer.\n\nIn contrast, it performs well in February, April and May. This is a time for traders to issue sell orders, while buy-and-hold investors might simply avoid these months in terms of investment (though other criteria should also be taken into account).\n\nWhile there are claims that certain hours of the day are more lucrative than others for investment, studies have shown this is not the case, at least where Bitcoin is concerned. The same applies to days of the week.\n\nSeasonality of Ether pricing. Source: FXStreet\n\nEven if there are certain days or times to trade Ethereum, only active traders will be able to gauge this information correctly and withstand the increased fees of more regular trades. More realistically, seasonality can be applied on a monthly and perhaps quarterly basis for most.\n\nSeasonality is something to keep in mind as there are definite monthly trends.\n\nConsider dollar-cost-averaging\n\nA popular and research-backed means to trade Ether (and any other asset) is dollar-cost-averaging (DCA), a technique first popularized by Benjamin Graham and applied to the equity market.\n\nDCA is a means of investing smaller amounts at specific intervals. You could, for instance, invest a specific amount at the start of each month. This ensures that you get all the highs and lows (at least on a month-to-month basis), smoothing out volatility.\n\nRelated: Post-Merge ETH has become obsolete\n\nIt\u2019s a great way for newcomers to enter the market because it requires no technical expertise or time investment. You don\u2019t have to conduct research or learn statistical models or correlations (though you can obviously do this on the side).\n\nDCA can also be a great baseline for more creative investments, providing a stable foundation. For example, you can combine it with seasonality, choosing the three to four months where Ether has historically been priced on the low end.\n\nAt the very least, DCA can help you to avoid the volatility of the cryptocurrency markets with investment spread out across time. Holding on to your investment is as important as making profits, a fact often missed in an industry often overtaken with hype and profits.\n\nOther points to keep in mind\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in March will allow users to withdraw staked ETH, valued at more than $20 billion as of mid-January, though it isn\u2019t clear whether investors will capitalize on the opportunity \u2014 which would be bearish \u2014 or continue holding their ETH, which would be bullish.\n\nFundamental indicators with regard to a given blockchain \u2014 active addresses, forks, functional upgrades, node diversification, speed, etc. \u2014 are often not factored into the price on a short time horizon. Ethereum\u2019s Merge, for instance, reduced waste by 99.9% but did nothing for the price, being overshadowed by wider economic factors.\n\nBut these are certainly useful indicators on a longer time horizon. The work that has been done to enhance the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem will, eventually, be reflected in its price.\n\nIn this regard, Ether is a wonderful investment opportunity for late 2023 and perhaps 2024, given recent innovations.\n\nIt is, in many ways, a perfect token for a patient investor.\n\nDaniel O\u2019Keeffe worked for three years as a compliance analyst for JPMorgan and State Street.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCosmos (ATOM) is one of the Ethereum (ETH) competitors with one of the best market capitalizations. However, it has failed to draw much attention to itself and is losing the popularity contest and capital to other so-called \u201cEthereum killer\u201d networks such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX).\n\nCosmos had its launch in 2019 and was developed to be an ecosystem where multiple networks can talk to each other, as well as overcome the scalability and interoperability problems that affect many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and its rival Ethereum.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is built around a hub-based architecture, where each hub is an independent blockchain that acts as a bridge between other networks. This allows different cryptocurrencies to be exchanged and used with each other without the need for a centralized crypto exchange, strengthening the idea of an ecosystem free of a centralizer.\n\nBut why does Cosmos not grow like an Ethereum killer?\n\nFirst of all, Cosmos solves the problem of lack of communication between networks only in its ecosystem or hubs. Thus, not just any blockchain can reach Cosmos and exchange smart contracts, for example. This breaks the expectation that Cosmos could be a powerful Layer 0 network.\n\nAnother factor hindering Cosmos\u2019 growth is the value of the token to its ecosystem. You have probably heard that developing on the Ethereum blockchain is expensive and that fees are paid through the network\u2019s native token, ETH. However, the same importance that Ether has for the leading smart contract platform, ATOM does not have for Cosmos.\n\nOn the altcoin network, appchains can create their own logic, which makes ATOM unnecessary since this technology runs its sovereign blockchain instead of a smart contract implemented on another chain.\n\nMoreover, the ATOM community is far removed from the supporters of other ETH rivals such as Solana and Cardano. The community around it is very important for a cryptocurrency because, without it, hardly any project \u2014 even a serious one like Cosmos \u2014 can survive.Without being able to attract more of an audience to itself, the cryptocurrency may continue to lose ground not only to smart contract platforms but also to altcoins with no real value proposition, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nDoes this mean that Cosmos is a bad project?\n\nNo. The altcoin, even though it needs to overcome some challenges, remains in the top 10 assets with the most development activity, proving that its network is growing and that more people may soon use it.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, although it is not one of the cryptocurrencies with a large community, Cosmos is regularly present on social media, something that is also very important.\n\nIn addition, it has made important partnerships, and blockchain industry projects are using its network. A great example of this is the arrival of the DeFi dYdX protocol on its blockchain.\n\nOther advantages of Cosmos are:"

        "content": "Ethereum addresses with a non-zero balance rise to reach an all-time high.\n\nThe king alt\u2019s percent supply in profit also crossed over the 60 mark.\n\nOver the years, there has been a growth in Ethereum [ETH] addresses, and the most recent merging has further stoked curiosity. While the price of Ethereum declined for the majority of the previous year, one statistic was increasing and just reached an all-time high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nPositive addresses surge in number\n\nThroughout the years, the number of Ethereum addresses has grown dramatically. Glassnode reports that the current number of addresses exceeds 92 million, a new record. More significantly, though, is the rising trend in the total number of addresses where the balance is anything other than zero.\n\nThe \u201cnumber of addresses with a Non-Zero balance\u201d measures the proportion of all addresses on the blockchain with a positive value, indicating that they have at least some Ether (ETH).\n\nInvestors are beginning to liquidate their holdings and exit the market when this statistic drops in value. Following a steep decline in cryptocurrency prices, this pattern may become apparent.\n\nAs the indicator rises, however, it suggests that new investors are filling their wallets. The move might be signaling the beginning of a bull market.\n\nSeveral variables may be responsible for the recent surge in address activity, but two stand out as particularly plausible explanations. For the greater part of the past year, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been declining.\n\nNew and seasoned investors could increase their holdings or enter the market. In addition, ETH now had a new utility thanks to the Ethereum merge last year. Following the merge, a new type of investor was created, thanks to the staking feature.\n\nPercent supply in profit increases\n\nLooking at another important indicator could provide further information about the state of Ethereum (ETH), given the metric\u2019s accumulation trend.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the circulating supply of Ethereum was over 122 million. More than 50% of the supply, as measured by the percent supply in profit, was profitable. The percent supply in profit was just over 68% as of the time of writing.\n\nETH price is in decline, but\u2026\n\nAs of this writing, the daily trading price of Ethereum was around $1567. A decline in value was also seen within the time frame that was analyzed. Its value had dropped by almost 2%, bringing the total drop in the previous 48 hours to roughly 3%.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe same-period analysis of the Relative Strength Index revealed that the market was now in a downturn. With a further price decline, the RSI, which was at 60, might decline further. But according to the RSI line, it was still in a bull trend despite the decline."

        "content": "Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum price has risen sharply in recent weeks. After gaining more than 30%, the price is now above $1,550. Now it\u2019s February and the price is faced with a decision: will Ethereum price continue to rise or will there be a crash? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum prediction for February 2023.\n\nIs Ethereum UP in 2023?\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have seen a strong increase in the Ethereum price. From under $1,200, the price has risen to over $1,500 within the last 3 weeks. Within this time, the Ethereum course was able to increase in value by more than 30 percent. The increase started in the first days of 2023 and continued relatively continuously in the 3 weeks.\n\nEthereum price in the last 30 days, source: gocharting.com\n\nThis increase was relatively parallel to the Bitcoin price increase. Bitcoin was able to rise from $16,500 to $23,000. In percentage terms, the increase in bitcoin was even higher than the increase in Ethereum. Nevertheless, the Ether token rose to a value higher than before the Ethereum merge in September.\n\nWhy will Ethereum price continue to increase?\n\nIn the past few weeks, the crypto market in general has seen a sharp rise. This was of course due to an increase in the Bitcoin price. This triggered the subsequent surges in Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nThe increase was supported particularly strongly by falling inflation in the USA. With rising prices, many speculative investors also liquidated their positions on the foreign exchange market, which led to a further jump in prices.\n\nMost recently, a particularly large number of Chinese brought capital into the market on the Chinese New Year , which gave the market a final boost. In the last few days, prices then stabilized.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum forecast for February?\n\nAt the moment, the Ethereum price could be at a turning point. If the market remains bullish, the Ether token could go in a positive direction. However, the Ethereum price could crash again below the $1,300 mark in the coming weeks.\n\nA crash could also take on different dimensions. A slight correction would bring the Ethereum price closer to $1,400. A severe crash, for example due to a possible insolvency of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) , could even drop the Ethereum price down to $1,000 again.\n\nIf there is no correction or a crash, the Ethereum forecast for February would be slightly positive. The price could continue to rise above $1,600.\n\nEthereum Prediction for February 2023\n\nThe Ethereum forecast for the end of February depends on the scenario that will occur in the next few weeks:\n\n1st scenario: The Ethereum price sees a slight increase again and no correction. In this case, the Ethereum price should be between 1,600 and 1,800 US dollars in our forecast .\n\nThe Ethereum price sees a slight increase again and no correction. In this case, the Ethereum price should be between 1,600 and 1,800 US dollars in our . 2nd scenario: Ethereum sees another crash or correction. Barring a massive crash for now, a correction would take Ethereum price to $1,300-$1,450 on our forecast for late February 2023.\n\nIs Ethereum a good buy?\n\nAn investment in the ether token should probably be made from a long-term perspective at the moment. Because right now is a time when the Ethereum price can go in different directions, which our forecast shows.\n\nIf you believe in a further increase in the Ethereum course, you can also invest in the short term and possibly take profits in a few weeks. However, we believe that the price can increase with greater certainty in the medium term, i.e. in a few months.\n\nOffer from CryptoTicker\n\nAre you looking for a chart analysis tool that doesn\u2019t distract you with community messages and other noise?

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will it Cross the $2k Mark in 2023? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "This article features a long-term Ethereum price prediction from cryptocurrency experts\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. It\u2019s also one of the best altcoins, and went on a massive bull run in 2021 and increased by almost $4,000 at its highest, reaching its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,840. The coin has made new lows since then, but the project\u2019s future has given investors hope of another price spike. But before we deep dive into our Ethereum price prediction, let\u2019s take an overview of Ethereum.\n\nWith the recent Ethereum Merge being hailed a success, 2023 could be an excellent year for ETH. This upgrade enables Ethereum to implement sharding, which, amongst other exciting improvements, will supercharge transaction speeds on the network. Expected in the second half of 2023, sharding will push ETH transactions from 15 per second to roughly 100,000 per second.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s value decreased in 2022 to US$ 1,781, but most experts predict that the price will rebound in the future. Here\u2019s a long term Ethereum price prediction from experts below:\n\nWallet Investor, an algorithm-based crypto-asset prediction website, projected that ETH\u2019s price could grow to over US$10,000 in November 2023 and even reach US$16,391 by the end of 2025.\n\nThe same was said by DigitalCoin, which predicts that the ETH price will average around US$7,569 in 2025 before rising to US$16,858 in 2028.\n\nAccording to net, Ethereum is forecasted to reach an average price of US$18,213 in 2025.\n\nEthereum Shanghai upgrade\n\nOne of the biggest developments coming up on the Ethereum chain is the widely anticipated Shanghai upgrade. This is an upgrade that is going to increase the number of stakers on the Ethereum platforms as well as the number of validators.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will enable the validators that have staked their ETH to easily withdraw them whenever they want. At the moment, the staked Ethereum coins cannot be accessed in terms of withdrawals. This is the problem that the Shanghai upgrade is solving.\n\nThe Ethereum team is also working on the Surge upgrade, which is a protocol upgrade that will improve the chain scalability. This is another major Ethereum development that will see Ethereum price surge upon launching.\n\nConclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, much of the crypto market is very bullish on Ethereum price prediction. The coin is an essential part of the industry and without it, many of the top applications and services that have risen to popularity in the last few years would not be here today.\n\nOf course, not everyone feels the same and there are plenty of reasons some investors will not touch ETH. You don\u2019t necessarily have to agree with them, but you must hear them out. You should be fully aware of ETH\u2019s pitfalls as well as its benefits.\n\nDespite these bullish fundamentals, Ethereum could still struggle in the short term. Recently, ETH tapped into the $1600 resistance zone after a surge in buying activity. With prices looking extremely overextended, ETH will likely fall to between $1275 and $1225 in the coming days and weeks. From there, ETH could tumble even further if adverse macroeconomic conditions worsen.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "An analyst who correctly called this year\u2019s crypto turnaround and bought Bitcoin and Ethereum in November says his bullish stance on the market will change if BTC falls below a key support level.\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 46,800 YouTube subscribers that he while Bitcoin\u2019s rally from 2022\u2019s low is significant, the bull case for the king crypto could be invalidated if the top crypto asset by market cap falls below the $19,000 level.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin is] up 50% since the low [~ $15,500], which is quite significant\u2026 [It is] chilling above areas that it has to be above. And as long as we don\u2019t lose $18,000/$19,000, nothing changes. I\u2019m going to be bullish until we lose $19,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $23,044 at time of writing, a fractional gain during the last 24 hours. According to the trader, Bitcoin could even plunge below its 2022 low of $15,500 if the $19,000 support level crumbles.\n\n\u201cIf you go down to $19,000\u2026 then you\u2019d make new lows.\u201d\n\nDonAlt says he\u2019s holding onto his positions and believes the current crypto rally is not over yet.\n\nHowever, If Bitcoin continues an upward trend, DonAlt says his preferred level to take profits is around the $32,000 price tag.\n\n\u201cJust makes sense to be bullish. But I don\u2019t know where to buy pullbacks and I don\u2019t know where to take profits other than $32,000, just based on the fact that I wouldn\u2019t want to sell into [the] $24,000 level. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like any monthly level either unless it\u2019s like $35,000, which is roughly in the area of $32,000 as well.\u201d\n\nAs for Ethereum, the trader says he remains bullish although ETH has under-performed compared to Bitcoin in recent days.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see much resistance until the second-largest crypto asset reaches the $2,200 area.\n\n\u201cMy thesis is basically we retested the monthly support at $1,100 and there\u2019s no real level that I like between $1,100 and $2,2200 \u2013 so let\u2019s go to $2,200.\u201d\n\nOverall, DonAlt says he\u2019s mainly watching Bitcoin to ensure it holds its key support level, and he will make decisions on altocins based on how it performs.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The latest iteration of the DeFi protocol comes with several improvements, including gas fee optimization and more.\n\nAave V3 launches on the ethereum mainnet\n\nFollowing strong backing and support from members of the Aave community, the development team has successfully integrated the third iteration of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, dubbed Aave V3, on the ethereum mainnet.\n\nPer a Twitter thread by Stani Kulechov, Aave founder and CEO, Aave V3 comes with several improvements and features, including gas optimization (reduces gas cost by 20 to 25%), a high-efficiency mode for increased capital efficiency, and more.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1618903037761945601\n\nTo make Aave V3 as hack-proof as possible, the team revealed last October that it had spent about $1.6 million on audit operations for the platform between 2020 and 2022.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, Aave protocol is the world\u2019s 4th-largest DeFi ecosystem, with $4.56 billion in total value locked (TVL), only dwarfed by Lido (TVL $8.03 billion), MakerDAO ($7.15 billion) and Curve ($4.72 billion), according to Defi Llama.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "For ETH stakers, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is a well-awaited change as they will be able to remove their staked funds as validators. Aside from its effects on staking, it\u2019s also ETH to new heights in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum, an open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality used to run on Proof-of-work, which made the mining process expensive and energy intensive. After the merge, Ethereum\u2019s mechanism shifted from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. Now, what changes Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade brings for ETH holders?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Have a Huge Impact on ETH\n\nIn March 2023, the Shanghai/Capella fork will go live. Jack Niewold, Founder of Crypto Pragmatist, an email newsletter on the narratives and assets shaping crypto, recently tweeted,\n\n\u201cabout 14% of total ETH supply is staked, and it can be unstaked after the Shanghai fork. This makes some people bearish\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum\u2019s core developers deployed the first mainnet shadow fork designed to test the readiness of ETH staking withdrawal capability. This brought ETH holders one step closer to accessing the $26 billion worth of Ethereum.\n\nRead More: Ethereum Shadow fork Goes Live: Here\u2019s 7 Things You Need to Know\n\nWithdrawals and ETH Developers Feud\n\nWhere the Ethereum merge introduced the ability for users to deposit ETH with the network, The Shanghai upgrade will allow ETH holders to stake their coins since the Beacon Chain, Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake consensus layer. However, some of Ethereum\u2019s devs believe the team is rushing the Shanghai upgrade. Micah Zoltu, an Ethereum dev, stated that the current Shanghai code does not allow ETH withdrawals to be compatible, and a rushed launch will create more problems for both developers and holders. They believe that the unstaking of ETH is acceding to public demands and not so much about the long-term health of Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: 5 Ethereum Stocks To Indirectly Reap The Benefits Of Ether\u2019s Surge"

        "content": "The third version of the crypto lending app Aave has now been deployed to Ethereum for the first time, according to a Jan. 27 Twitter thread from the Aave team. \u201cAave v3\u201d was originally released in March 2022 and deployed on multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains shortly afterward. Until now, Ethereum users only had access to the app's older \u201cv2\u201d version.\n\nAave Protocol V3 is now live on the Ethereum market\n\n\n\n\u201dThe most exciting aspect of V3 is its flexible design, which enables a variety of new risk mitigation features, and its improved capital efficiency & decentralized liquidity \u2013 all while reducing gas costs.\u201d @StaniKulechov pic.twitter.com/QsSnnlhEMr \u2014 Aave (@AaveAave) January 27, 2023\n\nAave v3 includes several features intended to help users save on fees and maximize the efficiency of users\u2019 capital. For example, high-efficiency mode allows the borrower to avoid some of the app\u2019s more stringent risk parameters if the borrower\u2019s collateral is highly correlated with the asset being borrowed. Developers say this may be useful for borrowers of stablecoins or liquid staking derivatives.\n\nIn addition, the \u201cisolation\u201d feature allows certain riskier assets to be used as collateral as long as they have their own debt ceiling and are only used to borrow stablecoins. Under the previous version, there was no way to limit what type of asset could be borrowed given a certain type of collateral. This meant that lower market cap and illiquid coins often couldn\u2019t be used as collateral.\n\nRelated: Aave purchases 2.7M CRV to clear bad debt following failed Eisenberg attack\n\nv3 also includes a gas optimization algorithm that the developers say will reduce gas fees by 20% to 25%.\n\nThe code for v3 was published back in November 2021. In March 2022, the Aave DAO approved an initial vote to deploy the new version. Over the next few months, v3 was deployed to Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon. However, the Ethereum version of Aave has always had the most liquidity and v3 was not available on it previously.\n\nAccording to the official proposal, the initial launch only has seven coins. The vote to launch began on Jan. 23 and lasted for two days. After supporters won the vote, the execution of the proposal was able to move forward on Jan. 27. Less than 0.01% of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) members voted against the proposal.\n\nIn November 2022, Aave changed its governance procedures after it was hit by a $60 million short attack that ultimately failed."

        "content": "The crypto market may be in a slump right now, but it still has plenty of potential. If it's headed for a rebound, investing now could prove to be lucrative.\n\nCryptocurrency, in general, is one of the fastest-growing assets in history. Between 2020 and 2022 alone, Bitcoin (BTC 0.76%) earned returns of nearly 600%. Ethereum (ETH 0.32%) was up more than 2,200% in that time frame, and Solana surged by a staggering 17,760%.\n\nBut crypto is also notorious for its extreme volatility, so can you realistically depend on it to help you retire early? Here's what you need to know.\n\nIs crypto still a safe investment?\n\nCryptocurrency has always been high risk simply because it's still speculative. Nobody knows where it will be a decade or two from now, or whether the sector will survive at all. Investors are still divided over its future, and that uncertainty has led to some wild price fluctuations.\n\nIn the short term, then, don't expect to see any significant returns. While the market could rebound in the relatively near future, crypto has proven that it can sink as quickly as it can surge.\n\nThat said, crypto's long-term potential is far more promising. For example, while Ethereum is currently down nearly 70% from its all-time high, it's still up by close to 52,000% since it was launched in 2015.\n\nIn other words, if you had invested $1,000 in Ethereum in 2015, you'd have more than $519,000 today -- and that's despite the crypto market meltdown over the past year.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees that you'll see these types of returns again, even if the market does bounce back. But if investors have learned anything from crypto over the past few years, it's to expect the unexpected.\n\nCan crypto help you retire richer?\n\nCrypto can potentially help you earn enough to retire early. However, it's crucial to have the right outlook and strategy.\n\nAgain, this is a risky investment, and there are no guarantees it will even exist in a few decades, let alone deliver life-changing returns. If you're going to include crypto in your portfolio, it's important to ensure you're limiting as much risk as possible -- and there are a few ways to do that:\n\nOnly invest what you're willing to lose: Crypto is still in its early stages, so there's always a chance you could lose whatever money you invest if it fails. Before you buy anything, consider how much you can realistically afford to risk.\n\nCrypto is still in its early stages, so there's always a chance you could lose whatever money you invest if it fails. Before you buy anything, consider how much you can realistically afford to risk. Double-check your diversification: A well-diversified portfolio can help protect your savings if crypto doesn't pan out. While everyone's investments will look different, it's wise to invest in at least 20 to 25 stocks from a variety of industries. In other words, make sure you're not putting all your eggs in one basket with crypto.\n\nA well-diversified portfolio can help protect your savings if crypto doesn't pan out. While everyone's investments will look different, it's wise to invest in at least 20 to 25 stocks from a variety of industries. In other words, make sure you're not putting all your eggs in one basket with crypto. Invest in the right places: Although all cryptocurrencies are speculative to a degree, the ones with the most real-world potential are the most likely to succeed. Right now, the two safest bets are Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they're the largest and most widely used.\n\nCryptocurrency can potentially be lucrative, and if the market takes off again, you could stand to make a lot of money by investing now when prices are lower.\n\nWhile there are still no guarantees that crypto will help you retire early, the right strategy can limit your risk as much as possible. By keeping realistic expectations and investing in the right places, you'll improve your chances of potentially making a lot of money over time."

        "content": "Tron founder Justin Sun transferred $15.5 million ETH out of his wallet to Poloniex.\n\nDespite the exchange inflow, ETH was able to resist sell pressure.\n\nOn 25 January, Justin Sun transferred 10,000 worth of Ethereum [ETH] to his Poloniex account, Lookonchain disclosed. Such large transfers were usually with the intention to sell and probably push the asset price down. Still, the Etherscan information showed that the Tron [TRX] founder had $347 million worth of the altcoin.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s strength\n\nInterestingly, ETH was able to resist the selling pressure. At press time, CoinMarketCap data showed that the altcoin registered a 3.47% uptick in the last 24 hours.\n\nFurthermore, Glassnode data revealed that the Ethereum investor capitalization was 131.22 billion. The metric measures the difference between the realized cap and thermocap.\n\nIt also serves as an indicator to evaluate bottoms in bear markets. The information from the on-chain platform showed that the capitalization has steadied around the same region since November.\n\nDespite Sun\u2019s large inflow, Ethereum\u2019s exchange inflow was not a notable exception. At the time of writing, the exchange inflow was 7300. This condition inferred that Sun only formed a part of those who transferred into exchanges, as others were minimal.\n\nHence, there might be a cause for increased selling pressure to send the ETH price down.\n\nThe exchange outflow was, however, lower at 5211. This implied that not many investors had recently increased their ETH long-term holdings.\n\nSlow volume and a circulation dip\n\nHowever, the uptick recovered by ETH was not followed by a significant volume spike. The volume shows the data spanning the aggregate amount of tokens involved in transactions within an interval. At press time, the volume increased by 11% to $10.25 billion.\n\nAlthough the volume increased, it was a different scenario with the circulation. The circulation shows the number of unique tokens used during a period. For the one-day circulation, Santiment showed that it was down 263,000. This means that the increase in ETH value was not enough reason to improve unique user input.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nPrior to the time of writing, Ethereum validators ready for the Shanghai upgrade hit 500,000. However, the number seemed to have slowed down especially since it required 32 ETH to deposit into the Beacon chain.\n\nAt press time CryptoQuant data showed that there have been only 49 new depositors. With the event billed for March, investors would expect a positive outcome from it."

        "content": "Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has continued to make serious waves in the crypto industry by raising over 18 million dollars in presale.\n\nNow in stage 9 after appearing on a 3D billboard in New York City and securing a tier 1 CEX launch for its official release, the sky seems to be the limit for Big Eyes Coin.\n\nAnd during a time when the cryptocurrency industry is not on top form, it could be the perfect time for this cat-themed meme coin to capitalize.\n\nAfter all, so-called crypto powerhouses like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are no way near their all-time high prices.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is at a measly $1,604.22, considerably less than its peak of $4,724.31 back in November 2022. Likewise, Bitcoin displays a current price of $22,959.19, more than 40,000 dollars less than its max record of $66,953.34 over 12 months ago.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the 200% bonus code (LAUNCHBIGEYES200) Big Eyes Coin is offering, the number of presale orders is only going to increase in the next few weeks.\n\nBitcoin: A Vast History Of Remuneration\n\nBitcoin might be going through a rough patch but no one can deny how profitable it has been for investors in previous years.\n\nDespite starting at a price of less than $1 in 2009, Bitcoin surpassed $19,000 in December 2017, giving a lot of crypto enthusiasts a healthy return.\n\nAnd just when many believed Bitcoin could not become any more profitable, it reached around $40,000 in January 2021 and over $63,000 in April 2021.\n\nThroughout these periods Bitcoin did have many fluctuations, yet it always bounced back impressively and could do the same in the near future.\n\nEthereum: A Cryptocurrency With Multiple Uses\n\nEthereum is one of the most practical cryptocurrencies on the market due to its role in the development of decentralized applications, the allocation of other cryptocurrencies on its blockchain, and the creation of notorious NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).\n\nPlus, following its merge upgrade in September, when it went from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, Ethereum has a much lesser carbon footprint and is a lot more eco-friendly.\n\nHence, even though Ethereum is struggling to resurge, its sheer use and practicality in the universe could allow it to become incredibly enriching again.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: A Meme Coin With Unique Selling Points\n\nBig Eyes Coin has the potential to blow its competition away with its planned release of top ten NFTs, ocean-saving charity donations, and facilitation of an exciting, fun-filled community.\n\nYou only need to check out the Big Eyes website for a moment to get a feel for the inexplicably adorable cat-related NFTs to come.\n\nAnd the amazing part is, every time an investor purchases a Big Eyes NFT, some of this will passively go towards saving the oceans and various sealife.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enticing enough, individuals will get to meet like-minded investors at a range of in-person events.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIt is not through divine intervention that Ethereum and Bitcoin are so successful in the crypto economy.\n\nNevertheless, Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale success suggests the cat-themed meme coin can catch up to these leading cryptos thanks to its unique and innovative features.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Decentralized lending and borrowing protocol Aave has deployed its third version on the Ethereum network following unanimous support for a governance proposal.\n\nThe Aave v3 upgrade will focus on mitigating user risk and improving capital efficiency (High Efficiency Mode) when staking or borrowing correlated assets like stablecoins and liquid staking derivates (LSDs). Liquid staking derivatives are derivative contracts that allow users to retain liquidity of an asset while staking it for a reward.\n\nHigh Efficiency Mode, also called eMode, allows users to capitalize on the highest borrowing power out of their collateral for correlated assets. Users can now leverage larger amounts of assets like wstETH (wrapped staked ether) and stake it on the Ethereum blockchain for rewards.\n\nThe upgrade is also focused on gas optimization, with Aave stating that it will reduce gas costs across all functions by 20%-25%. Gas is a transaction fee on Ethereum that is paid to validators.\n\nThe Aave protocol has $4.56 billion in total value locked (TVL), an increase of 23.37% over the past 30 days, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nThe Aave token (AAVE), which can be used as collateral on the platform, is trading at $86.73, little changed in the past 24 hours."

        "content": "JAKARTA - TON Network has the potential to experience a significant increase in trading volume and interest following the launch of the Toncoin (TON) option. On Thursday, the BIT crypto exchange, Bit.com announced that TON will be available on its platform Option trade, reported by DailyCoin.\n\nFor information, the Option trade is a type of financial transaction where buyers buy rights, but it is not an obligation, to buy or sell assets at certain prices on or before the expiration date.\n\nOption trading offers greater flexibility than spot or futures trading, as it allows traders to choose strike prices and expiration dates according to their trading plans.\n\nAn option buyer can make a profit from the expected asset price movement without having to buy or sell the asset itself, while an option seller can make money from the premium paid by the buyer. However, option buyers also risk losing money in the amount of premium paid if the asset price does not move as expected.\n\nIn the context above, BIT announced that option exchanges and crypto futures will launch option trading on TON. This will make TON the third crypto asset to have trading options, after BTC and ETH. So far, only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are available for option trading. Both of these assets are the largest crypto assets by market cap.\n\nBIT, Darley, and DWF Labs Partnerships Results\n\nThe launch of the TON option is the result of a partnership between the BIT crypto exchange, liquidity provider Darley Technologies, and blockchain marketplace maker DWF Labs. The toN inclusion in option trading could have a significant impact on this asset, which was originally launched by messaging platform Telegram.\n\nAnalysts stated that this could increase trading interest and increase TON liquidity. The launch of this TON option is expected to provide an opportunity for traders to explore new opportunities in the crypto market and increase potential profits in the future.\n\nLast year, TON experienced significant growth and became one of the cryptocurrencies that recorded its best performance in 2022, with a 200 percent increase in the second half of this year. One of BIT's partners, DWF Labs, is a major supporter of the TON ecosystem. DWF has invested $10 million in TON last year and pledged to invest even more.\n\n\"THE TON ecosystem is one of the most promising in the market with a global community growing by more than 2 percent every week and more than 100 million transactions to date,\" said Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner at DWF Labs. Grachev also added that DWF will support 50 projects in 2023.\n\nOpen Network (TON) is a blockchain network launched by Telegram's personal messaging platform. Previously known as Telegram Open Network, TON changed its name after its founding company withdrew from the project.\n\nPotential for Trafficking\n\nThe launch of the TON option is part of BIT's long-term vision to develop a crypto option market. This crypto exchange aims to make trading crypto options more accessible and benefit from its growth.\n\nAccording to BIT Co-founder and COO, Lan Yue, the option market has enormous growth potential with the emergence of products marginalized in dollars and the addition of various altcoin options. BIT is committed to making crypto options more accessible to institutional and retail traders.\n\n\"With the appearance of products that are marginalized in dollars and the addition of various altcoin options, the option market has enormous growth potential,\" said BIT Co-founder and COO, Lan Yue.\n\nAlong with the growing crypto market, BIT believes that options will become a more important element in the crypto market. The launch of this TON option is expected to provide opportunities for traders to explore new opportunities in the crypto market and increase potential profits in the future.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "content": "According to market capitalization, Ethereum, the second cryptocurrency, has captured more attention from users and followers of the crypto market; this time, it does so with The Merge. If you are into bitcoin and want to trade, then you may start by using a safe and secure platform like this trading app.\n\nA new way of using the blockchain, leaving behind the solution of mathematical algorithms through network consensus to Proof of Participation ( PoS ).\n\nThe expectations of a change could provide an effective solution to the fundamental problems of Ethereum and position it as a more efficient option from the perspective of energy consumption. Enter the Bitcoin-Prime trading system for more information.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nWhat is the Ethereum merge about?\n\nThe merge of Ethereum is the long-awaited transformation of the technological bases that have characterized this digital currency and that today undoubtedly leaves many attentive to the changes that are approaching.\n\nEthereum is characterized by, like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, having an energy consumption that undoubtedly leaves a mark on the environment; one of the main changes is the conversion of ETH into a much more ecological digital currency, reducing its energy consumption by almost 99%.\n\nThis indicates that Ethereum could become an environmentally friendly digital currency, increasing its adoption after the sustainability it will offer.\n\nIt is important to note that this cryptocurrency is the base platform for DApps-type projects, decentralized finance projects, and the now popular Non-Fungible Tokens.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nETH Network with Beacon Chain, where the way of reaching consensus for the mining of new digital currencies will change from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS); this implies that traditional mining will no longer apply to Ethereum.\n\nThe miners will stop operating as those in charge of extracting new coins; now, this function will be in the order of the investors who own ETH, who, through staking with their coins, will be the ones who validate the transactions.\n\nImportance of The Merge\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is not only challenging the traditional way of mining digital currencies but also hopes to overcome the limitations that the blockchain has experienced by involving PoS as a validating process, breaking down the barriers between users and the network itself.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nThe importance of such a promoted merger is because the concept of mining and its participants are left out, as well as the expensive equipment used to carry out this economic activity that has benefited many.\n\nThe creation of new blocks and the complete validation of the transactions will be in charge of the users of the Ethereum network, which will possibly transform the way of obtaining rewards for creating new coins.\n\nOn the other hand, it is considered that the impact on the carbon footprint will decrease significantly; leaving Bitcoin as the Blockchain network that uses Proof of Work.\n\nThis proposal will benefit not only Ethereum and its energy consumption. Still, it will open the field to NFTs by eliminating the barriers that have been speculated regarding the environmental impact that they could produce.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages\n\nAccording to analysts and experts in the cryptographic market, the changes expected with The Merge may not even be appreciated by users because there will be no drastic changes to show them.\n\nPossibly we are facing a highly publicized scenario where what is expected is to encourage crypto investments to dissipate a little the effects that macroeconomic factors have had on the market so far this year.\n\nThe expectations are many; everything revolves around whether the changes achieved the stated objectives.\n\nEvaluating the global scenario at the time of the merger, a set of sales and disadvantages is considered that can be contrasted as follows:\n\nThe decrease in energy consumption is undoubtedly a positive aspect, which could generate controversy in the face of possible network centralization.\n\nThe ease of staking from any computer is a point in its favor; what has not been made clear is the possibility that hackers will have access to obsolete keys and carry out a long-range attack.\n\nThe possibility that inflation decreases concerning the emission of ETH could become a disadvantage since it would delay the processes.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe long-awaited merger has achieved its primary objective of reducing energy consumption, making this cryptocurrency a highly ecological and competitive digital financial instrument.\n\nEthereum has decreased its consumption from over 20 million megawatts to just 2,500-megawatt hours per year.\n\nThe cryptographic market constantly evolves despite the explosive economic and financial landscape that never ceases to surprise its followers."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a very positive moment, with the Fear&Greed Index marking 55 points, the first \u201cgreed\u201d signal since April 2022. This is a promising signal after months of fluctuations between fear and neutrality, confirming a promising start to the year for cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn less than a month, cryptocurrency capitalization has managed to recover more than 30%, rising from $797 billion at the end of 2022, to about $1,050 billion today.\n\nMost of the credit for this increase has gone to Bitcoin, which has surpassed $23k, recovering its August 2021 prices and wiping out the decline caused by the FTX crisis.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is returning to the highs of early November 2022 at $1,600, maintaining a market share of 18%.\n\nAltcoins are also performing well, with some of the major and best-known ones such as Solana (SOL) and Decentraland (MANA) each gaining more than 120% since the beginning of the month. Over the past week, all of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by capitalization are on their way to closing with gains.\n\nIn particular, should Sunday night\u2019s close confirm current levels, it would be the fourth consecutive weekly close above par for Bitcoin, an event that has not occurred since August 2021.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the rise of XRP, a cryptocurrency launched in 2012, which has recovered 20% since the beginning of the new year, with current prices above $0.40 per token, allowing it to climb back to 6th position in the overall crypto capitalization ranking.\n\nHowever, the company behind XRP, Ripple Labs, is engaged in a legal dispute with the US SEC, which is objecting to the XRP token as a security, and the final ruling is expected to be published in the coming weeks.\n\nFinally, the Aptos (APT) token deserves mention, which is putting up another triple-digit weekly rise, gaining more than 400% since the beginning of the year and earning the top spot among the month\u2019s best rises. The Aptos blockchain was created in 2021 by a team of former developers of the Diem project (a payment system devised by Facebook in 2019) who decided to leverage their experience in building a decentralized and easily scalable payment network.\n\nIn the last week, the price of APT rose above $20 for the first time. At the opening on 1 January, the price of APT was $3.4 per token.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nDespite the slowdown in its rise, the price of BTC remains firmly above $22,500. Signal of possible consolidation that will have to find confirmation until early next week.\n\nIf confirmed, the current levels will become the basis of a valid support to be stored for the coming weeks while waiting to see again the $25,500, historical resistance level.\n\nOtherwise, the decline should not extend below $20,500 in order not to jeopardize the excellent work done since the beginning of the year.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe queen of altcoins fails to keep up with BTC and stumbles with prices returning below $1,600 in recent hours.\n\nIt is important for ETH to get through the weekend unscathed with prices above $1,500 otherwise the bullish technical structure that began in early January will deteriorate.\n\nThe holding of the $1,500 in the coming days of the week could become the springboard to overcome the $1,680, resistance that coincides with the recent highs and early November."
