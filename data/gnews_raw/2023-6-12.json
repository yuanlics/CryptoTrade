        "title": "SEC\u2019s Gensler seen telling hedge funds that Ethereum and Litecoin are \u2018not securities\u2019 in 2018 video - Fortune",
        "content": "A new video has surfaced showing future Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gensler telling an audience of institutional investors that four cryptocurrencies are not securities, and that 75% of the overall crypto market at the time was outside that legal category.\n\nThe video is from a crypto-themed institutional investor event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity in 2018, and it shows Gensler expressing sentiments that appear to contradict his more recent suggestions that all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities. You can watch the relevant excerpt above.\n\n\u201cOver 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They\u2019re not securities,\u201d Gensler tells the audience. \u201cThree quarters of this [digital asset] market are not securities.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came at a time when crypto was in the midst of a bull market, and precede Gensler\u2019s appointment as SEC chair by a little over two years. For the Bloomberg event, Gensler is identified as a senior MIT lecturer and a former chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.\n\nOther videos have surfaced from Gensler\u2019s time at MIT that show him stating Ethereum is not a security. This video is arguably more significant since it shows the now-chair of the SEC providing guidance to hedge funds and other investors about the legal status of the crypto market.\n\nCrypto lawyer Preston Byrne has previously noted that Gensler\u2019s 2018 comments came in a personal capacity and not as a government official, and so are not material when it comes to the SEC\u2019s current legal position. Nonetheless, the comments likely will anger the crypto industry and many cryptocurrency owners, who claim Gensler failed to provide guidance about the legality of specific tokens before embarking on what many have called a \u201cregulation by enforcement strategy.\u201d\n\nThe most recent phase of Gensler\u2019s crackdown came last week when the SEC sued top crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for violating securities laws. In its legal complaints, the agency for the first time identified 13 cryptocurrencies\u2014including major ones like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon\u2014as securities for the first time.\n\nWhile Gensler has recently refused to say that Ethereum is not a security, the SEC has so far been silent about the other non-Bitcoin currencies cited in the Bloomberg speech. One of them, Litecoin, is an early competitor to Bitcoin that launched in 2011, while Bitcoin Cash was a so-called fork of the original cryptocurrency that garnered flash-in-the-pan success upon launching in 2017 but has since declined in relevance.\n\nGensler\u2019s comments about the four cryptocurrencies not being securities came as part of a much broader speech during which he described crypto market dynamics and warned that many recently launched blockchain projects were outright scams. The now-SEC chair was introduced at the event as \u201cmy friend Gary Gensler\u201d by Mike Novogratz, a hedge fund billionaire who runs the crypto fund Galaxy.\n\nIn a separate portion of the video (shown here), Gensler appears to endorse crypto lending, comparing the practice to the more familiar one of lending shares.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten comfortable with [stock lending] since someone else got comfortable with it decades in the past,\u201d says Gensler. \u201cBut if you run a hedge fund and want to do what I\u2019ll call crypto sec lending, how does that work? I think firms like Mike\u2019s are going to figure this out.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s positions on crypto lending appears to have changed since his tenure at the SEC, where he has recently declared crypto lending to be illegal.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment on the record about any potential conflicts between Gensler\u2019s 2018 remarks and the agency\u2019s current legal stance."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Avoid a Major Breakdown if it Closes Above One Key Level - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is moving lower from the $1,780 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could decline heavily if there is a clear move below the $1,720 support.\n\nEthereum is struggling to clear the $1,780 and $1,800 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,760 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline heavily if there is a close below $1,720.\n\nEthereum Price Remains At Risk\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted a fresh increase above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum above the $1,780 resistance, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nEarlier, the price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,854 swing high to the $1,718 low. The price is now back below $1,750 and showing bearish signs. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,760 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is clearly struggling to clear $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,755 zone and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $1,780 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,854 swing high to the $1,718 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,775 and $1,780 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,850. The next resistance sits near $1,880, above which Ethereum could rise toward the key barrier at $1,920. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nMore Downsides in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,755 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,720 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,700 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,700 support, the price could decline toward the $1,640 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,600 level or even $1,550 in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,720\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum 'fails' without these 3 important 'transitions' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the success of Ethereum will come down to three major technical \u201ctransitions\u201d that need to happen almost simultaneously \u2014 layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy-preserving features.\n\nIn a June 9 post via his personal blog, Buterin explained that the Ethereum blockchain outright \u201cfails\u201d without sufficient scaling infrastructure to make transactions cheap.\n\n\u201cEthereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run), and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother point of failure, according to Buterin, relates to smart contract wallets.\n\nHe explained that a move to smart contract wallets has caused some issues, because of complexities from the user experience side of things when users take control of multiple addresses at once.\n\nEthereum needs to improve its layer-2 scalability, wallet security and privacy features, according to Buterin. Source: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s website\n\nIn addition to wallets securing crypto assets, Buterin explained that wallets would need to secure data in order to truly transition into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups:\n\n\u201cIn a ZK world, however, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it's also holding your data.\u201d\n\nThe last of Buterin\u2019s three transitions \u2014 privacy \u2014 will need to come in the form of improved identity, reputation and social recovery systems.\n\n\u201cWithout the third, Ethereum fails because having all transactions (and POAPs, etc) available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users, and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder suggested that stealth addresses could be implemented to resolve this issue.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin reveals 3 \u2018huge\u2019 opportunities for crypto in 2023\n\nButerin said that achieving all three will be \u201cchallenging\u201d because of the \u201cintense coordination\u201d involved between them.\n\nHe admitted that each of the three transitions \u201cweaken\u201d the \u201cone user \u2014 one address\u201d model, which, in turn, may complicate the way transactions are executed.\n\n\u201cIf you want to pay someone, how will you get the information on how to pay them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf users have many assets stored in different places across different chains, how do they do key changes and social recovery?\" he added.\n\nButerin concluded by stressing the need to build infrastructure that ultimately improvers user experience:\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges, achieving scalability, wallet security, and privacy for regular users is crucial for Ethereum's future. It is not just about technical feasibility but about actual accessibility for regular users. We need to rise to meet this challenge.\u201d\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains, Polygon Miden founder"

However, the funds won\u2019t be given as physical cash but in the form of USD Coin (USDC) cryptocurrency.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

See all of our newsletters\n\n\u201cPandemics beyond Covid continue to be a large risk in the 21st century,\u201d the Russian-American programmer tweeted. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our efforts to better live with airborne viruses and eventually live without them.\u201d\n\nEarmarked for improvements in indoor air quality and research into the effects of Long Covid, $10 million in USDC will be provided by Buterin himself, while $90 million worth of the cryptocurrency will be given by Crypto Relief, a Covid-19 relief fund created by Sandeep Nailwal, the founder of the Polygon blockchain. The fund previously allocated $100 million in 2022 to Covid-19 initiatives selected by Buterin.\n\nWhile this year\u2019s donation from Crypto Relief will be given as USDC, it comes from a transfer of the meme-cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) given to the fund by Buterin. In May 2021, he donated more than $1.2 billion worth of the tokens to Crypto Relief, in addition to making million-dollar gifts of cryptocurrency to organizations like Gitcoin, GiveWell, Methuselah Foundation and Machine Intelligence Research.\n\nNailwal later returned $100 million worth of the SHIB coins to Buterin, citing issues surrounding India\u2019s legislation for relief fund distribution. In response, Buterin formed his own fund, Balvi, to distribute the money. In November of 2022, Balvi gave $9.4 million in cryptocurrency to the University of Maryland to fund studies on air disinfection, followed by a $15 million donation in March to the University of California San Diego to establish the Meta-Institute for Airborne Disease in a Changing Climate.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of crypto donations?\n\nA growing number of public institutions and non-profits have begun to accept cryptocurrency donations in recent years. Fidelity Charitable, a public charity and the largest grantmaker in the U.S., has received more than $500 million in cryptocurrency since it began accepting it in 2015, according to its most recent annual report.\n\nGiving cryptocurrency as a donation instead of first converting the digital currency into cash allows donors to bypass the capital gains tax, meaning charities may receive larger donations in crypto than they would in cash. Some nonprofits, like the American Red Cross and Save the Children, have established programs to immediately convert crypto gifts into liquid funds.\n\nFor Buterin\u2019s donation to the University of Maryland, the school partnered with the Giving Block, which aids donees accepting cryptocurrency and helps donors find charities willing to accept the gifts. The University of California San Diego exchanged its donation into U.S. dollars through Engiven, which provides crypto donation services to nonprofits.\n\nBut figuring out how to accept cryptocurrency or when to convert the currency into cash can be confusing for nonprofits. And the unstable nature of the crypto market provides an additional layer of risk for institutions that can\u2019t be certain of a gift\u2019s reliability. Numerous donations promised to nonprofits by the now-bankrupt crypto fund FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, for example, were withdrawn after FTX collapsed in November.\n\nThe tenuous nature of cryptocurrency gifts was also evident in Buterin\u2019s more than $1 billion gift to Crypto Relief in SHIB, which subsequently spooked holders of the coin and led to a 36 percent decrease in its value, according to Forbes.\n\nOther nonprofits have expressed concerns about these types of donations, such as the energy-intensive nature of cryptocurrency mining. In 2021, Greenpeace announced it would no longer accept Bitcoin because of its environmental impact, while the Mozilla Foundation cited similar reasons for its decision to restrict certain types of cryptocurrency donations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Wikipedia Foundation, which has accepted cryptocurrency since 2014, revealed in May of 2022 that it would stop accepting the donations following a three-month discussion of concerns related to the currency\u2019s energy use and the foundation\u2019s potential promotion of a risky industry."

While the issuance was by the international investment subsidiary of the Bank of China, domestically, it is state-owned and China\u2019s second largest bank.\n\nThe tokenized securities were issued under Hong Kong and Swiss Law on the UBS Tokenize service.\n\n\u201cBOCI is very pleased to be at the forefront of innovation in technology finance and digital finance,\u201d said Ms Ying Wang, Deputy CEO at BOCI. \u201cWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products, for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products, designed specifically for customers in Asia Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation and innovative development of Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry.\u201d\n\nLate last year, UBS Wealth Management announced it issued $50 million of blockchain-based debt securities to high net worth individuals (HNWI) based in Hong Kong and Singapore. In that case, it used English and Swiss law and a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nUBS has been a blockchain trailblazer for some time. It was one of the initiators of the Utility Settlement Coin, which evolved into Fnality, the bank-backed settlement token project readying for launch in the UK.\n\nLast year, the bank also issued its own $370 million blockchain bond on the Swiss Digital Exchange (SDX). That was groundbreaking as the largest native digital security issued to date. Additionally, it was innovative because the central securities depository (CSD) of SDX was linked to the conventional SIX CSD allowing most investors to buy the tokenized securities conventionally."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the market, each with its unique features and potential for growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to expand, investors may wonder which digital asset is the better investment. In this article, we\u2019ll compare Bitcoin and Ethereum by examining their advantages, risks, and personal considerations to help you make an informed decision and finally buy Ethereum with credit card without any stress.\n\n\n\nExplanation of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, launched in 2009. It operates on a decentralized network and uses blockchain technology to facilitate transactions. Ethereum, launched in 2015, is a blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to power these applications and facilitate transactions within the network.\n\n\n\nBrief Overview of the Cryptocurrency Market\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has grown significantly in recent years, with thousands of digital assets available for investment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most well-known, other cryptocurrencies offer unique features and potential for growth.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\n\n\nBitcoin offers several advantages, including:\n\n\n\nEstablished and Widely Recognized\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has established itself as a recognizable brand and a dominant player in the market. Its widespread adoption and recognition can provide a level of stability and liquidity that can be attractive to investors.\n\n\n\nLarger Market Cap\n\nBitcoin has a larger market capitalization than Ethereum, making it a more established and stable investment option.\n\n\n\nLimited Supply\n\nBitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, which can increase its value over time as demand grows.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum offers several advantages, including:\n\n\n\nSmart Contract Functionality\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities have led to a growing number of use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This functionality can drive innovation and increase the platform\u2019s value over time.\n\n\n\nFaster Transaction Times\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction times are faster than Bitcoin\u2019s, making it a more efficient option for transactions.\n\n\n\nGrowing Ecosystem of Decentralized Applications\n\nEthereum\u2019s growing ecosystem of dApps and smart contracts can provide a level of versatility and potential for growth that can be attractive to investors.\n\nRisks and Concerns\n\n\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum come with risks and concerns, including:\n\n\n\nVolatility of the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with prices often experiencing significant fluctuations. This volatility can lead to potential losses for investors who are not prepared to weather market downturns.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, it may face increased regulatory scrutiny from governments worldwide. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s value and their ability to operate in certain jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nCryptocurrencies are vulnerable to security breaches and hacks, which can lead to potential losses for investors.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWhen deciding between Bitcoin and Ethereum, personal considerations should be taken into account. Consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions to determine which digital asset aligns with your objectives. Ultimately, the decision to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum should be based on a thorough analysis of the advantages, risks, and personal considerations involved. Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies comes with risks, and it\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions."

Let\u2019s take a look at Ethereum\u2019s chances of recovering from the crash and which new tokens traders are backing to defy the bear market.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Remains Bearish for June\n\nThe security versus commodity debate has now become the overarching narrative of the crypto market. In its lawsuit, the SEC labelled several major altcoins such as Cardano, Solana and MATIC as unregistered securities. These tokens plummeted by as much as 30% following the filing.\n\nOn the surface, the SEC\u2019s lawsuit could have been beneficial for Ethereum. Both the Solana and Cardano communities have not shied away from calling themselves \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d, and both blockchains are designed to replace Ethereum as the leading platform for smart contract technology. Thus, a bearish outlook for ADA and SOL could have been bullish for Ether.\n\nAs it turns out, Ethereum may soon find itself on the SEC\u2019s target as well. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said multiple times that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that he is comfortable deeming a commodity. In a tense exchange with Representative Patrick McHenry during his congressional hearing, Gensler hesitated in clarifying whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nSeveral other key figures have taken a strong stance against Ether as well. New York Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin for offering the sale of ETH, which she labelled as an unregistered security.\n\nThe token may soon face a double whammy as the Federal Reserve is set to decide on a major interest rate hike next week. Several key officials including Fed chair Jerome Powell have taken an uncompromising stance in their fight against soaring inflation levels. If the Fed indeed proceeds with another interest rate hike, ETH prices could take another major hit.\n\nA recent report by CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum-based assets saw outflows totalling $36 million in just the last week. The report believes that most of the outflows are a result of the Fed\u2019s unending hawkish monetary policy.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain also needs significant improvements to ensure long-term user retention. In his blog, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin explained that the blockchain will simply die without three key transitions of scalability, privacy and wallet security. Buterin\u2019s biggest fear is that with ETH transactions costing a lot of fees, users will simply move to other options like Solana and Cardano. While these blockchains are more centralised than Ethereum, they are also significantly faster.\n\nTradingView, a technical analysis platform, gives a sell signal to the token in the daily time frame. With ETH underperforming 12 of the 15 most important moving average indicators, its price prediction remains bearish for June.\n\nWhich Tokens are Outperforming the Beark Market?\n\nDespite the struggles of major tokens several new tokens are providing hope to traders.\n\nTwo of these include Wall Street Memes and Ecoterra, both of which are sailing through their respective presales.\n\nWall Street Memes Token Raises $6.5 Million in Bid to Be the Next Big Meme Coin\n\nThe Wall Street Memes token has become one of the hottest commodities in the meme coin market. Investors are losing confidence in tokens such as Pepe and Doge due to their inability to perform in the bear market. But the $WSM token has become one of the most consistent performers as it has raised over $6.5 million in less than 3 weeks.\n\nThe token is a result of the same community spirit that inspired the historic GameStop short squeeze in 2021. In fact, the Wall Street Memes group considers it its mission to disrupt the traditional financial landscape. The group also has a strong track record in the crypto space as well. It sold out its Wall St Bulls NFT collection in 32 minutes, netting a cool $2.5 million. It has also recently announced its own Bitcoin ordinal NFTs.\n\nThe group is not resting on its laurels as the Wall Street Memes token has adopted community-driven tokenomics. The entire $WSM supply is available to the general public, with no cuts for any private sales. 50% of the tokens are available during the presale itself, allowing ample opportunities for investors to take advantage of the early presale prices.\n\n30% of the token supply is reserved for cool community awards, to be used to further enhance user adoption. 5 lucky degens will earn $10K worth of $WSM tokens through a generous airdrop.\n\nA global brand value and a million-strong internet army mean that the $WSM tokens are quickly selling out. Investors have limited opportunity to purchase the token through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Presale\n\nNew Green Crypto Project Ecoterra Raises $5 Million in Fight Against Climate Change\n\nAs the concerns of global warming and climate change rise, investors are now clamouring for eco-friendly investment opportunities in the crypto space. The newly launched Ecoterra project is dominating this demand as it recently reached the $5 million milestone in presale.\n\nThe project has come up with an innovative implementation of blockchain technology and tokenomics to tackle the anthropogenic climate crisis. It incentivizes individuals and corporations to play their roles in reversing the harmful effects of global warming.\n\nFor example, companies spend millions of dollars to build an eco-friendly reputation. With Ecoterra, companies can simply purchase recycled products at a cheap cost and earn social credit. Similarly, individuals can earn $ECOTERRA tokens by recycling waste products or by paying their green energy bills through the platform.\n\nThe project has partnered with leading climate action organisation Verra to offer cost-effective carbon offset solutions. Users can reduce their carbon footprint by purchasing these offsets from Ecoterra\u2019s carbon offsets marketplace.\n\nGiven the token\u2019s strong presale and its crucial role in changing the mainstream perception of the crypto industry, it is a likely candidate for several Tier-1 exchange listings including Binance.\n\nInterested investors can become a part of this green movement by purchasing Ecterra tokens either through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.\n\nVisit Ecoterra Presale"

Discover SCENE\n\nBinance halted trades across several Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH) token pairs in the latest shake-up since the company was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.\n\nOn Monday, the company said that it ended trading for more than a dozen pairs that involve its native BNB token, the defunct Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, and five involving ETH. The trades began to cease at 11:00 p.m. EST on Sunday and the rest were frozen by 4 a.m. EST Monday morning.\n\nUsers on its international exchange were reminded that they can still trade in the currencies as part of other pairs on the platform, but were advised to cancel their Trading Bots before the removals were completed to avoid losses. A trading bot is an automated tool on Binance that can automatically run trades for users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBinance did not connect the announcements with any response to the SEC lawsuit, but it comes as the latest change affecting trading operations on the platform.\n\nLast Wednesday, Binance US eliminated more than forty crypto trading pairs, with the majority using the stablecoin Tether (USDT) as its pair. Other tokens paired with Bitcoin and BUSD were also impacted. Left untouched on the exchange were trades involving token pairs with Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC), among others that the SEC listed as unregistered securities in their lawsuit against Binance.\n\nA day later, Binance US said its banking service providers had signaled they would be pausing fiat currency, or US dollar, withdrawals starting as soon as June 13, and that the platform would operate as a \"crypto-only exchange\" until it found new partners. It said crypto services, including staking products that the SEC also flagged in its lawsuit, would remain operational.\n\nOn June 5, the SEC launched a 13-count lawsuit against Binance and its founder CEO Changpeng Zhao that accused them of violating securities laws that include failing to register as an exchange and engaging in unregistered crypto transactions among other allegations.\n\nThe company has denied any wrongdoing, and accused the SEC of waging an \"ideological campaign\" against the cryptocurrency industry by targeting it and other major firms.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is convinced that all crypto assets aside from Bitcoin are securities. Its latest war on crypto exchanges has included staking services, which the regulator seeks to shut down.\n\nThis could push more staked ETH out of exchanges and onto the market-leading liquid staking provider Lido. This may sound good, but it poses significant risks to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLido Staking Risks Exposed\n\nLido provides liquid staking services for Ethereum as an alternative to self-staking, which is highly technical, and involves exchanges that take substantial commissions.\n\nIt has rapidly become the market leader with 7.18 million staked ETH, or 36% of the total 19.6 million staked.\n\nOn June 13, Ethereum advocates at \u2018Bankless\u2019 sounded the alarm on Lido, calling for the prevention of its domination of ETH staking.\n\nA continued SEC crackdown on exchanges is likely to push more staked Ethereum to Lido, it noted. There was already a surge in staked ETH redemptions from Coinbase last week after the lawsuit by the regulator.\n\nKraken was forced to end its Ethereum staking services for U.S. users in February, resulting in an exodus as soon as Shapella rolled out.\n\nFurthermore, Lido\u2019s market share has grown since the Shapella upgrade enabled staking withdrawals.\n\nEthereum developers such as Danny Ryan have warned about the dangers of staking \u201ccartelization,\u201d in which platforms such as Lido can extract outsized profits compared to non-pooled capital.\n\nBankless reported that the platform was near the first threshold with around a third of all staked ETH.\n\n\u201cLido is nearing the first of three thresholds at which Ethereum is more easily manipulated by an attacker.\u201d\n\nIt added that Lido has already voted against self-limiting deposits, but Ethereum advocates are now calling for them to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely Ethereum will implement such controls at the protocol level, but it is clear Lido must face economic repercussions,\u201d Bankless noted.\n\nThere is a growing movement to divest from Lido and explore alternative Ethereum staking options.\n\n\u201cEtherians must band together and decrease our reliance on Lido to prevent its domination over staking!\u201d\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nEthereum staking deposits are still outpacing withdrawals, however, asset prices have taken a hit following last week\u2019s regulatory attacks on the industry.\n\nETH was trading flat on the day at $1,745 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. The asset has lost more than 8% since the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase last week, more than its big brother Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, it is looking increasingly bearish, having fallen to the lower boundary of its three-month-long range-bound channel."

        "content": "The SEC released hundreds of documents, including emails and notes, after a judge ordered the documents to be unsealed as part of the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the securities regulator.\n\nThe highly-anticipated documents related to a June 2018 speech from former SEC Division Director William Hinman were released on Tuesday, June 13.\n\nThe documents show how Hinman\u2019s speech \u2014 which clarified that the SEC didn\u2019t believe that ether was a security at the time \u2014 evolved prior to the SEC targeting XRP as a security.\n\nIn his speech, Hinman said, \u201cAnd putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.\u201d\n\nThe released documents show conversations between SEC employees at the time \u2014 including the trading and markets department\u2019s comments \u2014 and Hinman.\n\nIn an email, Hinman said the language around ether \u201cwould be used if we all are in agreement. We also have a call with [Vitalik] Buterin later this week to confirm our understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates.\u201d\n\nBrett Redfearn, the director of trading and markets at the time, told Hinman via email his original language on ETH and whether it was a security remained \u201cvague.\u201d Redfearn suggested that Hinman use \u201cstronger\u201d language.\n\nGoogle Document comments show an unnamed editor saying, \u201cAs we discussed, as written, referring to the sentiment within this section of the speech. We think the relevant question as discussed throughout the rest of the speech is whether a digital asset meets the legal standards of a security, not whether it warrants regulation as a security.\u201d\n\nThe comments also show the SEC saying that \u201cwe do not want to suggest that BTC is a security.\u201d\n\nAn additional comment left on the document says:\n\n\u201cWe thought you were going to say that you don\u2019t believe ETH is a security. We think that is a helpful message. This statement, on the other hand, appears likely to create more confusion about the status of ETH. To the extent you don\u2019t say ETH is not a security, please consider confirming the policy rationale to the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws, as you did with respect to Bitcoin earlier in the paragraph.\u201d\n\nEmployees also noted that they had \u201creservations\u201d about including a direct statement on ether in the speech because \u201cit seems that it would be difficult for the agency to take a different position on ether in the future. Further, the rest of the paragraph strongly implies the thinking applies to ether.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout the sentence about ether, those implications might generate a useful reaction about ether (from purchasers or those in the FinTech space). With the sentence, the reaction seems less likely to focus on the analysis, and more likely to focus on the potential fallout of making a direct statement about ether\u2019s status as a security.\u201d\n\nIn another comment, SEC officials acknowledged that \u201cthe fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities \u2014 and no longer are required to register with all the benefits to investors of registration \u2014 seems to point out what might be considered a \u201cregulatory gap\u201d that exists in this space.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, this speech acknowledges that there is an \u201cother\u201d category,\u201d the comments said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a security because there\u2019s no \u201ccontrolling group\u201d (at least in the Howey sense) yet, like many other things (medication, credit cards) there may be a need for regulation to protect purchasers.\u201d\n\nKnown conflicts of interest\n\nA first batch of emails between Hinman and Shira Pavis Minton, the designated agency ethics official at the SEC, was released in April 2022 after Empower Oversight, a nonprofit whistleblower organization, successfully filed a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nMinton warned Hinman that he is not to engage in any SEC matters that could impact law firm Simpson Thacher, where he worked before the SEC, due to his financial interest in the firm. He was also advised not to meet with anyone from Simpson Thacher.\n\nHinman met with Josh Bonnie, a partner at Simpson Thacher, several times after being warned about the conflict of interest, Empower Oversight said in an April 2022 statement. The former SEC director also met with the co-founders of and investors in Ethereum ahead of the speech he gave in 2018 declaring ether a token, not a security.\n\nThe April 2022 email release suggested that Hinman and the SEC had an interest in promoting and protecting ether over other, similar tokens. If this were found to be true, it would be a significant win for Ripple.\n\nShortly after these documents revealed the agency may have acted inconsistently with their classification of crypto tokens, a judge ruled that the SEC would not be able to edit or clarify any of the content in the emails ahead of the XRP case, which had already been underway for over a year when the first round of emails dropped.\n\nThe SEC and Ripple are awaiting a summary judgment, which Ripple\u2019s legal team previously said could come before the end of the year. There is a possibility that the judge could rule that there is not sufficient evidence for a summary judgment and the case could go to trial, or Ripple and the SEC could potentially agree on a settlement, although Ripple has said this is an unlikely outcome.\n\nNews analysis by David Canellis\n\nOutside of an outright win against the SEC, the release of the Hinman emails is the Superbowl for XRP investors.\n\nA word of caution, especially as markets push XRP nearly 10% higher: The Hinman speech never explicitly mentioned Ripple \u2014 or any other cryptocurrency apart from bitcoin and ether, for that matter.\n\nIn a bid to defend itself from an antagonistic regulator, Ripple Labs has attempted to draw parallels between Ethereum and its XRP technology, token sales and promotional efforts. To borrow Hinman\u2019s phrasing, if Ethereum can become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d over time \u2014 then maybe so too can XRP transform from a security into a commodity.\n\nSuch an evolution would certainly undermine the SEC\u2019s case. Perhaps converting to a slap on the wrist akin to Block.one\u2019s $22 million settlement, after it raised up to $4.4 billion with its own token sale.\n\nBut the XRP Ledger is a different beast than Ethereum \u2014 far lower in terms of validator counts and use cases, but with a more direct line to corporate support in the form of Ripple Labs.\n\nIt may be tempting to believe Hinman\u2019s treatment of Ethereum is analogous to XRP, vindicating the latter by association.\n\nBut to do so would run the risk of underestimating key differences between major blockchain technologies, at a time when regulator pettiness is at an all-time high. How the courts will ultimately navigate that is still anyone\u2019s guess, and these emails could simply bolster the case for ether\u2019s commodity classification, with XRP\u2019s relevance merely tangential.\n\nThe end of the Ripple v. SEC case may well be in sight, but consider the final outcome as hazy as the SEC\u2019s definition of \u201ccrypto security.\u201d\n\nUpdated June 13, 2023 at 11:22 am ET: Additional quotes added from the court documents.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Forms Weekly Golden Cross, But Is It Enough To Save Crypto? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Despite the carnage and chaos all across the crypto market due to recent US SEC-related enforcement actions, Ethereum has just given a bullish buy signal.\n\nOn weekly timeframes, ETHUSD has formed a golden cross, but will it be enough to give the asset class a glimmer of hope amidst such darkness? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nEthereum Price Golden Cross Buy Signal Forms On Weekly Chart\n\nEthereum prices are down roughly 20% off 2023 highs, but still down more than 60% from the record peak back in 2021. Hope for a recovery across the crypto market dwindled last week, when the United States SEC launched enforcement actions against an already weakened industry.\n\nOther coins have plummeted by 50% or more in just days, while Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown resilience as the two top cryptocurrencies by market cap. ETHUSD has done so well in the recently bearish environment, in fact, is has formed a golden cross of the 50-week moving average and the 200-week moving average.\n\nThe golden cross comes almost immediately after a death cross, nullifying a long-term sell signal with a buy signal. When using a two-moving average system, a buy signal occurs when the shorter timeframe crosses the longer timeframe span. This is called a golden cross, while the opposite crossover is called a death cross.\n\nA golden cross appears | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWill The Moving Averages Save Crypto From Further Collapse?\n\nWhen using moving averages as a trading signal, in addition to crossovers, price making it above or below the averages is another signal a trend is strengthening. ETHUSD is also well above both the 50- and 200-week MAs.\n\nFinally, the slope of the moving averages can be used similarly to a trend line. The 200-week moving average is still pointed in an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the 50-week is just starting to turn direction upward.\n\nThe last time the golden cross appeared, Ethereum climbed another 680% before its peak. In contrast, the last time ETHUSD pushed above both moving averages in 2020, Ether rallied by more than 1,700%. Current price action has only brought Ethereum under 5% from the moment it made it above the two averages.\n\nPast performance is not a guarantee of future results. Plus, considering the macro and regulatory pressure on altcoins, another death cross could follow any day now. However, of ETHUSD can remain above the two averages, another impressive price increase could be around the corner.\n\nWith all the noise in the market right now, everyone has entirely missed the fact #Ethereum has formed a weekly golden cross pic.twitter.com/ylNwp3DEUI \u2014 Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d (@tonythebullBTC) June 12, 2023\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The latest billion-dollar mint for the stablecoin issuer comes within two months of its last mint on April 21.\n\nTether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino took to Twitter to clarify that the latest USDT mint is part of what the firm calls an \u201cinventory replenish\u201d on the Ethereum network.

This procedure allows traders to access other supporting blockchains for the cryptocurrency they hold, letting them utilize their digital assets on multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cExchanges often find themselves in a situation where a majority of their Tether USDT tokens are held on one particular chain. Consequently, these third-party entities approach us to facilitate a chain swap, ensuring smooth and efficient operations,\" Ardoino told Cointelegraph.\n\nArdoino explained that Tether periodically works with different crypto platforms to help them rebalance the USDT liquidity across various blockchains. For example, if a crypto exchange has a surplus of USDT liquidity on the Ethereum blockchain and a deficit on the Tron blockchain, where it needs to process withdrawals, the exchange will chain-swap its Ethereum-based USDT to the Tron blockchain.\n\nRelated: Tether CTO on USDC depeg: \u2018Bitcoin maxis were right all along\u2019 | PBW 2023\n\nTether has minted over $16 billion of new USDT in 2023, with its current market capitalization at more than $83 billion.

        "content": "At the time of writing, Ethereum price is trading at $1,751 with support at $1,730 holding firmly. In a video shared widely across social media, the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Gary Gensler says that the two most prominent cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are not securities.\n\nEvaluating Ethereum Price Profitability This Week\n\nEthereum, like many of its peers, started the week while consolidating losses after a gruesome week in the wake of the intensified crackdown on the crypto market by the US SEC. As Coinbase, Binance, and the foundations of selected cryptos like ADA, SOL, and MATIC start their respective legal battles, investors may want to know how to adjust their crypto portfolios.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Ethereum price must first deal with resistance at $1,760 to close the gap to $1,800. On the bright side, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator dons a vivid buy signal.\n\nTraders eyeing new long positions in Ethereum price would be encouraged to activate their orders as long as the MACD line in blue holds above the signal line in red.\n\nInsights from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment suggest that the crypto market could start to rise, now that the dust lifted by the SEC going after Binance and Coinbase has settled. The rebound is expected to continue \u201cuntil the next development with the lawsuits.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f With traders still very much aware of the #SEC going after #Binance and #Coinbase, the mass hysteria has at least settled down. Until the next developments with the lawsuits, we could see some gradual rising of prices back to pre-crash levels. https://t.co/Za7tchgeUx pic.twitter.com/BSZEHrjQNP \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 12, 2023\n\nMoreover, most altcoins experienced extreme capitulation last week, leaving many traders and investors in losses. The sharp price drop will likely trigger increased accumulation among whales. If this accumulation trend continues, \u201cthere is reason to believe a strong rebound can occur,\u201d Santiment states.\n\nOld Video Shows Gary Gensler Declare, $BTC And $ETH Are Not Securities\n\nAccording to a related report by Cointelegraph, back then, Gary Gensler held a faculty position at the esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The footage dates back nearly two years prior to his eventual ascension to the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn a stark juxtaposition to his previous stance, Gensler\u2019s subsequent actions at the SEC paint a different picture. The recent months have witnessed the regulatory body plunge into a wave of enforcement initiatives within the cryptosphere.\n\nLast week, Gensler listed 68 cryptos as securities, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) in the most recent lawsuits. Moreover, the regulatory chair once declared that all cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin are securities, which contradicts his statement in the 2018 video.\n\nChair Gensler in 2018 at a Bloomberg conference in NYC: \u201cBitcoin.

        "content": "Tether announced it will coordinate with a third-party exchange to conduct a chain swap as it wants to convert 750 million USDT from Tron to Ethereum ERC20. The total supply of USDT will not change during this process, as per the firm.\n\nA chain swap process entails moving cryptocurrencies from one blockchain to another, which enables traders to obtain access to the various blockchains that support the cryptocurrency they are holding. In general, it allows the use of their digital assets on these other supporting blockchains.\n\n1B USDT Mint on Ethereum\n\nThe development follows Tether minting a fresh batch of $1 billion worth of its USDT on the Ethereum blockchain on Monday. Tether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino explained on Twitter that the latest billion-dollar mint is part of the company\u2019s inventory replenishment on the Ethereum Network. The transaction is authorized but \u201cnot issued,\u201d meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for the next period of issuance requests and chain swaps.\n\nTether previously explained,\n\n\u201cInventory replenishment is the process of creating new USD\u20ae that are stored in Tether\u2019s treasury inventory as \u201cauthorized but not issued\u201d USD\u20ae. These tokens are not part of the total market capitalization of USD\u20ae, as they have not been issued or released into circulation yet.\u201d\n\nUSDT has positioned itself as a crucial piece of infrastructure of the crypto ecosystem and is widely used for conducting trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. Its issuer, on the other hand, has been at the receiving end of endless scrutiny over its reserve assets and lack of transparency for years.\n\nBut this year\u2019s banking sector debacle, as well as the increasing crackdown on the asset class, has resulted in investors fleeing to USDT, thereby significantly boosting its dominance.\n\nTether\u2019s Growing Dominance\n\nUSDT\u2019s circulation hit a peak above $83 billion this week. One of the major factors that have catalyzed the surge is the latest price deviation of rival dollar-denominated stablecoin TrueUSD (TUSD).\n\nThe shrinking investor confidence in fellow Circle-issued USDC stablecoin is yet another reason that has led to market participants fleeing to the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, USDT.\n\nLast month, Tether announced expanding its footprint in Georgia with an investment in a payment processing company called, CityPay.io. The company also revealed plans to launch sustainable Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay."

        "content": "Mon 12 Jun 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by La R\u00e9daction C.\n\nFollowing the success of Shapella, Vitalik Buterin has announced the arrival of other projects that will complement The Merge. After several months of behind-the-scenes work, the co-founder of one of the world\u2019s most popular blockchains is unveiling a new roadmap in which he outlines three major technical transitions. Details in this article.\n\nChanges on the horizon for Ethereum\n\nConcerned about the future of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin recently warned against excessive use of layer 1. Now that the alert has been made known to the public, the network\u2019s strongman has announced major technical changes via his blog.\n\nOpening words from Vitalik Buterin. \u2013 Source: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum transitions from a young experimental technology into a mature tech stack that is capable of actually bringing an open, global and permissionless experience to average users, there are three major technical transitions that the stack needs to undergo, roughly simultaneously:\n\nThe L2 scaling transition \u2013 everyone moving to rollups\n\n\u2013 everyone moving to rollups The wallet security transition \u2013 everyone moving to smart contract wallets\n\n\u2013 everyone moving to smart contract wallets The privacy transition \u2013 making sure privacy-preserving funds transfers are available, and making sure all of the other gadgets that are being developed (social recovery, identity, reputation) are privacy-preserving\u201d\n\nLayer 2 scaling\n\nThis would notably allow for a reduction in transaction fees during bullish cycles, according to V. Buterin. We want to emphasize that Ethereum is increasingly being overlooked by users due to its astronomical gas fees.\n\n\u201cWithout the first, Ethereum fails because each transaction costs $3.75 ($82.48 if we have another bull run), and every product aiming for the mass market inevitably forgets about the chain and adopts centralized workarounds for everything,\u201d he points out.\n\nWallet security\n\nWith a significant increase in cryptocurrency platform attacks, including a recent incident with the Atomic wallet, security has become a priority for developers like Buterin. Thus, in his opinion, Ethereum will need to design secure wallets to attract many users.\n\nThe best alternative for Vitalik Buterin lies in smart contract wallets. These would be able to support complex functions such as social recovery.\n\nPrivacy protection\n\nVitalik Buterin wants to make privacy protection the third necessary technical transition for Ethereum. As such, he has proposed the implementation of stealth address protocols. This will allow users to have more convenience.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Coinbase faced a lawsuit last May, alleging a violation of privacy laws by a user.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has recently broken below the 100-day moving average, resulting in a decline toward the significant support region of around $1.7K.\n\nIt is crucial to closely monitor the price action in this important area as it may provide a clear indication of the next movement of ETH\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum Price Technical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum had been struggling to breach the 100-day moving average for a prolonged period but has finally broken below it on June 10th, indicating a bearish outlook for the mid term.\n\nHowever, the ETH price has reached the substantial support region at $1.7K, where the bearish momentum has halted, leading to a stable price action at this level. If selling pressure persists and causes a further decline below this support region, the bears\u2019 next target would be the 200-day moving average at $1625.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the price has finally dropped below the lower trendline of the channel and reached the major support zone at $1.7K. It holds significant psychological value as it has been supporting the price since March 2023.\n\nConsidering that the RSI indicator is currently around the oversold section, there is a possibility of a price retracement towards the lower trendline of the channel before initiating the next move. However, if the $1.7K level successfully prevents further decline and triggers a bullish rally, the next target for Ethereum would be the $2K resistance region.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThis graph illustrates the Ethereum Exchange Reserves metric for Binance and Coinbase exchanges in relation to Ethereum\u2019s price. Recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against both Binance and Coinbase, which has generated significant fear within the market.\n\nIn response to this development, investors have withdrawn approximately $1.43 billion from the Binance crypto exchange and its U.S. affiliate following the regulatory actions. Binance experienced net outflows of $1.34 billion worth of crypto tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, while its U.S. affiliate, Binance.US, recorded net outflows of $70.8 million. Coinbase has also witnessed substantial outflows due to the prevailing uncertainty among market participants.\n\nConsequently, the ETH Exchange Reserve metric has undergone a notable decrease for both exchanges, underscoring the fear and uncertainty triggered by the conflict involving the SEC, Binance, and Coinbase."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is witnessing an uptick in adoption rate despite the latest market-wide slump. Its non-zero addresses recently hit an all-time high value amid a 7-day decline of 8.25% in the asset\u2019s price.\n\nThe number of non-zero addresses holding ETH climbed to 100.82 million today, marking the highest value ever witnessed.\n\nInformation from the Glassnode chart reveals a consistent upward trajectory in non-zero ETH addresses, with only a minor decline observed in late 2021. This sustained growth persisted through the market challenges experienced in 2022, especially the turmoil caused by the Terra and FTX implosions.\n\nConsequently, non-zero addresses have recently surged to their highest value. This metric underscores the growing interest in ethereum and crypto assets, as more market participants enter the scene despite the occasional turbulence.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin wallets holding at least 1 BTC reach 1m mark\n\nNon-zero ETH addresses are addresses holding a positive balance of ETH. In other words, they have a value of the asset greater than zero. This metric is often used to measure the level of activity and engagement within the Ethereum network, as it indicates the number of addresses currently holding some form of value.\n\nAn increase may indicate growing interest from individuals or businesses, more widespread token ownership, growing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contract usage, or the accumulation of assets by long-term holders. All these factors contribute to the overall health and vitality of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs reported by crypto.news last week, the cumulative balance of the ten largest ethereum addresses recently hit an all-time high of 31.8 million ETH valued at $59.47 billion at the time of the report. This was due to an impressive accumulation campaign observed among these addresses, Santiment revealed.\n\nThe increase in these metrics coincides with a period of decline for ETH, prompted by the downturn in the market. Notably, on June 10, ETH experienced a decrease of 4.83% following the SEC\u2019s complaints against Binance and Coinbase. This decline represented the most significant intra-day loss for the asset in over a month.\n\nETH price \u2013 June 12 | Source: Trading View\n\nETH registered a meager 0.07% gain on June 11 to invalidate what would have been a 3-day losing streak. However, the asset started today on a bearish note. ETH is 0.59% down today, currently changing hands at $1,742 at the time of writing.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

(sorry, VDog)\n\nBut this one really caught my attention.\n\nVitalik believes there are 3 things that are crucial to Ethereum\u2019s future. Without them, Ethereum will fail. Plain and simple.\n\nIt\u2019s a 15-minute read, but here\u2019s the 2-minute MilkNotes\u2122 summary:\n\nThere are three \u201ctransitions\u201d needed to turn Ethereum from an experimental tech \u2192 open, global, and permissionless tech.\n\nHere they are:\n\n1/ The L2 scaling transition \u2013 everyone moving to rollups.\n\nEthereum rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling technology that processes a batch of transactions off-chain and then submits them all together on-chain.\n\nOptimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are some of the most popular roll-ups. (But none are better than Fruit By The Foot.)\n\nWhy this transition needs to happen: Rollups make transactions A LOT cheaper.\n\nRight now,\n\nIt costs about $3.65 to swap tokens on the Ethereum mainnet\n\nIt costs ~$0.10 to do the same thing on other rollups\n\nAnd when Ethereum sees a lot of activity, those fees can get really high. (~$100)\n\nAccording to Vitalik \u2013 without cheap fees, Ethereum adoption will fail.\n\n2/ The wallet security transition \u2013 everyone moving to smart contract wallets.\n\nThere\u2019s a big dilemma in crypto right now: where\u2019s the safest place to store your assets?\n\nCentral exchanges are shutting down. Software wallets are getting hacked. Hardware wallets have more trust issues than Drake.\n\nVitalik\u2019s answer: smart contract wallets.\n\nThese have:\n\nNo single point of failure : there is no single thing (and ideally, no collection of things that travel together) that, if stolen, can give an attacker access to your funds.\n\nLow mental overhead : it shouldn\u2019t take rocket science to use it.\n\nMaximum ease of transacting: most normal activities should not require much more effort than they do in regular wallets (eg. Metamask)\n\nIt\u2019s the Secure Trinity.\n\nTwo popular smart contract wallets are the Argent wallet and the Loopring wallet.\n\nWhy this transition needs to happen: Without a safe place to store crypto \u2013 users will keep losing funds, lose trust, and just end up moving back to centralized solutions.\n\n3/ The privacy transition \u2013 everyone moving to \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d tools.\n\nRight now the blockchain is an open book. Everyone can see everything.\n\nTransactions. Wallet balances. You name it.\n\nBut not everyone loves that concept. Imagine if your current bank account and all your daily purchases were made public\u2026\n\nWhy this transition needs to happen: Vitalik believes that having all transactions available for anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users.\n\nBecause of this, he thinks most users would move onto centralized solutions that at least (somewhat) hide your data.\n\nAnd those are the three big things Vitalik thinks Ethereum needs: rollups, smart contract wallets, and privacy tools. He says all 3 need to happen too.\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cVitalik, my G, you created Ethereum \u2013 why don\u2019t you just implement the transitions yourself?\u201d\n\nSimple. It\u2019s not up to him.\n\nYou see, unlike Zuck at Facebook, Vitalik isn\u2019t the CEO of Ethereum. There is no CEO. It\u2019s decentralized.\n\nBut he does have influence and a voice. So even though his blogs aren\u2019t commandments, \u200b\u200bit\u2019s always cool to get his opinions and thoughts.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to the Ethereum community and if they want to make these moves.\n\nOnly time will tell\u2026\n\nThe electric vehicle industry is firing on all cylinders. Between new models and competitors, innovation around batteries, and Elon\u2019s focus returning to Tesla, the future's looking bright.\n\nAnd when it comes to new initiatives, the EV industry is full of them.\n\nThe latest? EV \ud83e\udd1d Blockchain\n\nThat\u2019s right, the first automotive project is arriving on Cardano. Introducing eTukTuk.\n\neTukTuk has BIG ambitions: To build an affordable network of charging stations and electric vehicles for the developing world.\n\nHere\u2019s some more info on them:\n\nTheir initiative cuts carbon emissions and improves air quality, with a focus on developing nations that need it most\n\nTheir team is made up of seasoned professionals with a background in Finance, Tech, Automotive, and Blockchain\n\nUtilizing the blockchain allows them to create digital identities, provide wider access for users, and reward network participants through the $TUK token\n\nLearn more about eTukTuk and $TUK below!\n\nTHE U.S. IS LOSING THE CRYPTO RACE \ud83c\udfc7\n\nCountries want one thing: to be the crypto hub of the world.\n\nIt's a global race. And there\u2019s gonna be winners\u2026 and losers.\n\nLet's take a look at the contenders:\n\n1/ The U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s cracking down harder on crypto than my mom did on me after I stole from her vodka stash in the 10th grade.\n\nThe SEC sued Binance & Coinbase, everyone\u2019s leaving for greener, foreign pastures, and 50% of BTC on U.S.-based exchanges has left for ones overseas. Folks are spooked\u2026\n\n2/ The U.K.\n\nOur friends across the pond are reaping some of the benefits of that though \u2013 a16z just announced it\u2019s setting up shop there.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because the UK\u2019s Prime Minister is pro-crypto \u2013 the Royal Mint, for example, dropped an NFT for sale in March.\n\n3/ Hong Kong\n\nChina may be on the fence about crypto, but Hong Kong\u2019s going all in.\n\nJust opened crypto trading to retail investors\n\nInvited Coinbase to apply for an exchange license there\n\nHas had a bunch of crypto companies apply to set up shop there\n\nNot too shabby.\n\n4/ Dubai\n\nIt has (heads up, here comes the \u201cR\u201d word) regulations when it comes to the crypto space. Clear rules for companies that want to operate there = muy bueno.\n\nEveryone & their mother wants a slice of the market: Crypto.com and Coinbase have applied for a license. And Binance has been there for a while now.\n\nPlus, they are building a cool-ass Bitcoin tower there\u2026\n\nThe Results: We don't know who's gonna win, but we do know who's losing\u2026\n\nThe U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s fixing to learn the hard way how a lack of clear crypto laws will put it behind.\n\nMILK ROADERS INDEX: HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT CRYPTO? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLast week, we asked you a question\u2026 how are you feeling about the crypto markets?\n\nWell, the results are in\u2026.\n\nMost Roaders are feelin\u2019 like Switzerland \u2013 neutral.\n\nThen we asked you why you felt that way, here were some of our favorite responses:\n\nStefan: \u201cNo matter what will happen to exchanges and with regulators, Bitcoin, and crypto can't be controlled or manipulated. Sure, they might tank the price for a while (let's say that the US chooses to ban every crypto transaction, that'd cause a massive dump). At the same time, they can't ban crypto itself. They can't control it. That's the power of it.\u201d\n\nJeremy: \u201cNo storm lasts forever.\u201d\n\nMack: \u201cThere is a big discount in the market. But first to get back confidence, The fed is forcing a lot of pain and putting some kids on the naughty step from some needed \"time out\". Hopefully they will learn the lesson so it\u2019s not the wild wild west where anything goes.

If we\u2019re honest, most of this is well deserved on the principals playing fast and loose \u2013 if not outright dishonest. \u201d\n\nJJ: \u201cWhile the regulatory headwinds are strong, I\u2019ve learned from past bear cycles. This is an opportunity to buy. Especially some L1s that are in the down \u201d\n\nP.S. \u2013 If you didn\u2019t get a chance to vote last week, hit reply to this email and let us know how you\u2019re feeling about the crypto market!\n\nMILK & COOKIES \ud83c\udf6a\n\nA federal judge ruled in favor of the CFTC\u2019s belief that a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is \u201ca person.\u201d Watch out DAOs\u2026\n\nSturdy Finance (DeFi lending protocol) got hacked for $800K.

        "title": "Ethereum Future Success: Vitalik Buterin's 3 Key Transitions - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has identified three key technical \u201ctransitions\u201d that he believes are essential for Ethereum\u2019s success. In a recent blog post, Buterin emphasized the importance of layer-2 scaling, Smart contract wallet security, and privacy-preserving features.\n\nButerin pointed out that without sufficient scaling infrastructure, the Ethereum blockchain faces significant challenges. He highlighted the high transaction costs, which currently stand at $3.75 per transaction, potentially reaching $82.48 during a bull run. To avoid centralized workarounds, Buterin stressed the need for affordable transactions to enable mass adoption.\n\nSmart contract wallets are a point of concern for Buterin, as user experience complexities arise when users manage multiple addresses simultaneously. This aspect needs improvement to ensure a seamless and user-friendly on-chain experience.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin emphasized the need for enhanced wallet security and privacy features. He argued that in an on-chain world leveraging zero-knowledge rollups, wallets must not only protect authentication credentials but also safeguard user data. Enhancing identity, reputation, and social recovery systems is crucial to address privacy concerns.\n\nTo address privacy issues, Buterin suggested the implementation of stealth addresses, offering a potential solution for protecting user data.\n\nHowever, Buterin acknowledged the challenges in coordinating these three transitions, as they potentially weaken the traditional \u201cone user \u2014 one address\u201d model and may complicate transaction execution. Questions arise regarding how users will obtain payment information or manage different assets stored across various chains.\n\nButerin concluded by emphasizing the importance of building infrastructure that improves the overall user experience. Achieving scalability, wallet security, and privacy for regular users is vital for Ethereum\u2019s future success. Meeting this challenge goes beyond technical feasibility; it is about ensuring accessibility and usability for a broader user base."

The document revealed that the SEC took a consultation from Vitalik Buterin in the process leading to the controversial speech.\n\nAn extract from the document released states that, on May 31, 2018, opposition to the recommendation grew within the US SEC against including Ether with Bitcoin as examples of digital assets which are no longer a \u201csecurity\u201d.\n\nHowever, on June 4, then SEC director, Hinman shared a draft of the speech with the commission division heads. The doc mentions that he stated that there is a call with Buterin later in that week in order to confirm the US SEC\u2019s understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates. It added that this move would suggest that the draft did not reflect Hinman\u2019s understanding of how Ether works.

The OGC was concerned about the difficulty it would have to face in taking a different position on Ether in the future.\n\nAlso Read: SEC\u2019s Strongest Argument In XRP Case At Risk Amid Hinman Docs Disclosure\n\nThe General Counsel added that Eth\u2019s Buterin has far more details than retail buyers of Ethereum.

US regulators are on a warpath, going after major crypto exchanges and declaring a handful of major altcoins securities \u2013 a scarlet letter in crypto terms.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain under pressure as the largest crypto token was mildly up after the weekend jitters and traded below the $26,000 mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was down in red and dropped another per cent to remain below $1,750 levels. Action in the altcoin was majorly mixed.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets observed brisk selling pressure over the weekend amid the ongoing lawsuits by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, which has led to a mass exodus of deposits in these exchanges, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"Amidst regulatory challenges and liquidity issues in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown some resilience. Bitcoin is trading around $25,700, continuing to hold its $25,000 psychological support as its dominance is nearing the 50 per cent mark for the first time since April 2021,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTop crypto tokens were trading mixed on Monday, but the move was majorly seen on the downside. Shiba Inu and BNB were down 5 per cent, each, while Solana declined more than 4 per cent. Avalanche shed 3 per cent. Among the gainers, Polygon gained 3 per cent, while Cardano and XRP were up over a per cent, each, after weekend dents.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower, falling to the $1.05 trillion mark as it shed less than half-a-per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes almost halved, falling more than 49 per cent to $26.6 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)is currently stressed after dropping below the $0.07 resistance level. It has declined by 15% on the weekly and is now trading near $0.06. DOGE has to break the 14-day moving average at $0.068, which could be a good sign for its mid-term trend and could signal a potential trend reversal.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the 14-day RSI (28.8 per cent) indicates an oversold sentiment. These values suggest a potential consolidation in the near term if the price continues to hold the $0.055 support level. If DOGE is unable to break through the $0.07 barrier, the price may continue to fall. Especially if altcoins continue to bleed post-US SEC action.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.055, $0.050\n\nResistance: $0.070, $0.080\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

Why did I name those four? They\u2019re not securities,\u201d Gensler says in the video.\n\nChair Gensler in 2018 at a Bloomberg conference in NYC:\n\n\n\n\u201cBitcoin. Ether. Litecoin.

In total, the SEC has labeled at least 68 cryptocurrencies as securities in various lawsuits, though none of the four cryptocurrencies mentioned in the 2018 video have made it on this list.\n\nThe comments in the video are, however, another contrast from Gensler's more recent views on Ether (ETH). The SEC chair was pressed for his answer on if ETH was security before a U.S. House Committee in April, but he refused to answer.\n\nGary Gensler and Representative McHenry arguing on whether $ETH is a commodity or a security, with Gensler unable to answer the question pic.twitter.com/DTMtazYmuS \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 19, 2023\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler: Crypto market is like 1920s stock market, full of 'fraudsters'\n\nOther videos of Gensler taken around his time at MIT have also surfaced this year showing him making similar comments about crypto.\n\nIn a 2019 video that circulated in April, Gensler called Algorand (ALGO) \u201cgreat technology.\u201d The same week the video circulated, the SEC sued crypto exchange Bittrex and claimed ALGO was a security in its complaint, with many in the crypto space calling the SEC chair a hypocrite.\n\nIn another video dated 2018 that circulated in April, Gensler is seen teaching a class at MIT and claims that three-quarters of the market i\u201cnon-securities.\u201d\n\nThe below clip is from a Fall 2018 Graduate MIT course called \"Blockchain and Money\"\n\n\n\nGary Gensler - the current President of the SEC, was the professor.\n\n\n\nThe Hypocrisy speaks for itself\n\n\n\n\"So we already know in the US and in many other jurisdictions that 3/4 of the market\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rjRWeq5P8X \u2014 zk- (@ZK_shark) April 25, 2023\n\n\u201cIt's just a commodity, cash, crypto,\u201d Gensler goes on to say in the video.\n\nWhile Gensler\u2019s comments came at a time before he chaired the SEC, many in the crypto space have claimed his actions are hypocritical.

Tradecurve users can conveniently use their cryptocurrency balance as collateral to enter trades across a wide array of assets \u2014 be it commodities, stocks, forex, or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne of Tradecurve\u2019s standout features is its ability to allow users to trade without KYC (Know Your Customer) verifications. This means that traders can tap into global markets without going through the often lengthy and cumbersome process of identity verification.\n\nAmong other advantageous features offered by Tradecurve, users can take advantage of AI-driven algorithmic trading, high leverage up to 500:1, premium account services, reduced trading fees, and the chance to mimic successful traders through copy trading.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s native token, TCRV, is an essential part of the platform\u2019s ecosystem and plays a key role in the trading activities of users. Holding TCRV tokens can earn users additional rewards when trading on the platform and discounts on premium services. As more people join the platform and use its services, demand for TCRV tokens is expected to increase.\n\nSince the start of the presale last month, the price of TCRV has already risen over 50% to $0.015. Market analysts believe that this is just the beginning of Tradecurve\u2019s promising journey and predict the token\u2019s value could hit $1.00 once it becomes available on top-tier exchanges later this year \u2014 a gain of more than 50 times its current value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price to Reach $50K According to Vaneck\n\nVanEck is known for its research-driven performance analysis on digital assets, offering a range of insights for investors to understand the market and make informed decisions. The company has a strong track record of accuracy in predicting price movements and developments in the crypto industry.\n\nAccording to a projection by VanEck, the Ethereum (ETH) price could skyrocket to $51,000 by 2030 if there\u2019s another crypto bull market. The prediction is based on Ethereum (ETH) becoming accepted across various industry sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and insurance.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly believed that Ethereum (ETH) could evolve into the leading open-source settlement network worldwide. If this scenario unfolds, Ethereum (ETH) would essentially become a digital stage for a significant chunk of business operations across different industries.\n\nConversely, if Ethereum (ETH) fails to achieve prime dominance or becomes a smart contract platform with less than 15% dominance, it would signify a bear market, potentially pulling Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s price down to less than $350 in the coming seven years.\n\nVanEck also points out that if circumstances favor Ethereum (ETH), it could possibly secure a base case price of more than $11,000 \u2014 offering a substantial return for long-term traders.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1856 after starting the year at just $1200.\n\nThis means that Ethereum (ETH) has already seen a gain of more than 50% since the start of 2023, and if VanEck\u2019s prediction proves accurate it could mean an incredible return for those who invest now.\n\nFor more information about $TCRV presale tokens:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Experts Say Collateral Network Could Be the Next Cardano - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, the search for the next big project is never-ending. Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) are among the most promising projects to deliver substantial gains. Additionally, the Collateral Network (COLT) presale has captured the interest of many investors.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum: Powering the Future of Decentralized Finance\n\nWhen it comes to blockchain technology and decentralized applications, Ethereum has emerged as a trailblazer. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has solidified its position as a fundamental pillar of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWith its smart contract functionality and robust developer community, Ethereum has paved the way for the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum was conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and officially launched in 2015. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum aims to be a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nEthereum introduced its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which serves as the fuel for executing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Ethereum network operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as Ethereum 2.0, which is being rolled out in phases to address scalability and energy efficiency concerns. This upgrade is expected to revolutionize the network, making it faster, more secure, and environmentally friendly.\n\nCardano: A Paradigm for Progress\n\nCardano, a project built on a scientifically backed approach, has gained recognition for its commitment to rigorous research and development. Powered by its native token ADA, Cardano has set out to establish a secure and scalable blockchain platform capable of supporting complex decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nCardano sets itself apart by combining peer-reviewed academic research with a meticulous approach to building blockchain solutions. This emphasis on scientific rigor has helped Cardano attract partnerships with governments and institutions, positioning itself as a reliable and trustworthy platform.\n\nThe Cardano project has recently achieved significant milestones, including the successful launch of its much-anticipated smart contract functionality. This development opens the door for a wide range of decentralized applications to thrive on the Cardano platform, providing increased opportunities for developers and users alike.\n\nCardano\u2019s systematic approach to innovation and commitment to technological advancement has garnered admiration within the crypto community. This way, Cardano serves as a reference point for projects aspiring to achieve similar levels of success, such as the upcoming Collateral Network.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network: Pioneering Peer-to-Peer Lending on Ethereum\n\nIn the fast-paced world of decentralized finance, Collateral Network aims to revolutionize peer-to-peer lending by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain. This innovative platform allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets, unlocking liquidity and providing a decentralized alternative to traditional lending institutions.\n\nThe platform accepts a diverse range of assets as collateral, including real estate, fine art, vintage cars, gold, fine wines, watches, diamonds, and collectibles. By leveraging the blockchain\u2019s transparency and security, Collateral Network ensures the integrity of the collateral and the loans.\n\nThe Collateral Network platform functions by tokenizing physical assets into NFT and using them as collateral. Borrowers can unlock the value of their assets by depositing them into the platform\u2019s smart contracts. Borrowers can then borrow cryptocurrencies against the value of their collateralized assets, providing them with immediate access to liquidity.\n\nAnalysts predict that the presale of COLT tokens could experience a significant price increase, with projections of up to 3,500% (35x). During the presale, the price of COLT tokens is expected to reach $0.35. Once listed on major exchanges, there is the anticipation of a further surge, potentially reaching a 100x increase.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "ChatGPT has seen an exponential level of growth ever since it was released, with millions of users using it on a daily basis, it has been proven to be super effective at researching data and giving predictions.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tradecurve to see how far it thinks their price can climb. While the data received from ChatGPT is not always 100% accurate, the prediction it makes can give investors a higher perspective as to the potential future of a specific cryptocurrency.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nChatGPT Predicts The Future of Bitcoin\n\nFirst, we asked ChatGPT to predict the future value of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. On June 7, 2023, Bitcoin traded at $26,883.32. The results given by ChatGPT were split into bullish and bearish. For the bullish predictions, ChatGPT estimated that Bitcoin could reach between $60,000 to $100,000 by the end of 2023. However, it also listed bearish predictions, where Bitcoin could dip to $20,000 or even $10,000.\n\nChatGPT noted that it is impossible to say for sure what the price of Bitcoin will be by the end of the year. However, it did notice that it is a volatile cryptocurrency and suggested that investors need to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before investing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Outlook According to ChatGPT\n\nSecond, we asked ChatGPT to predict the future of Ethereum. As of June 7, 2023, Ethereum traded at $1,870.29. The AI chatbot noted how experts believe that the price of Ethereum could reach new all-time highs in 2023. However, it also showcased that Ethereum could decrease in value due to the increased regulation of cryptocurrencies by governments around the world.\n\nGoing over the bullish predictions for Ethereum, ChatGPT predicts a value between $16,391 to $18,213 by the end of the year. However, it also showcased bearish outlooks, where Ethereum could dip to $2,000 or even $1,000 by the end of the year. It\u2019s clear that ChatGPT did not give a definitive answer to either Bitcoin or Ethereum\u2019s future value, but the numbers do shed some light on the potential momentum of the coins in either direction.\n\nTradecurve and Its Potential to 100x In Value ACcording to ChatGPT\n\nThird, we asked ChatGPT to predict what Tradecurve\u2019s value will look like in the future. The AI chatbot noted that this is a new cryptocurrency that is still in its presale stage and that a lot of factors can affect its growth moving forward. Some of them included the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors, the increased demand for crypto by retail investors, and the success of the platform.\n\nEstimates made by ChatGPT suggest that Tradecurve can climb 100x in value to $1.5 by the end of 2023. As of June 7, TCRV is at Stage 3 of its presale, trading at $0.015. The platform offers access to crypto and derivatives without KYC and will implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) while also offering high leverage and algorithmic trading.\n\nTraders and investors will want to jump into the TCRV presale early in order to get the highest return of investments when the project explodes in value at launch, according to the predictions made by ChatGPT.\n\nAccess more data surrounding Tradecurve below:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How to Launch a DAO - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief A decentralized autonomous organization is an organizational structure where control is spread out rather than hierarchical.\n\nDAOs use smart contracts on a blockchain, with participants using governance tokens to vote on proposed actions.\n\nIt's not difficult to spin up a new DAO; the hard part is getting people to join, and retaining them.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe term DAO (short for \"decentralized autonomous organization\") became a crypto buzzword in 2021, but the concept has real value. As of June 2022, the DAO ecosystem has a combined treasury value of $8.7 billion, according to the analytics site DeepDAO.\n\nDAOs continue to grow as a community organizing model, a means of quickly raising and distributing money for social causes, or decentralizing blockchain-based protocols.\n\nHere are the basics on how to start one. (This explainer is not financial or legal advice.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations use a shared treasury, smart contracts (programs that execute once criteria are met), and tokens for voting.\n\nThe first DAO, called \"The DAO,\" launched on Ethereum in 2016. While it is possible to establish a DAO on any blockchain that supports smart contracts, most of them run on Ethereum.\n\nSetting up a DAO\n\nForming a DAO requires several steps:\n\nName the DAO\n\nCreate a mission statement\n\nSpin up a Discord server\n\nSet up a Twitter account\n\nInvite people to join\n\nLaunch a governance token\n\nCreate a funding mechanism\n\nSet up Snapshot or other tools for voting and logging member contributions\n\nTo summarize a Minimum Viable DAO in 5 steps: 1. Establish a mission 2. Build a community on @discord or @telegram 3. Create a shared treasury with @gnosisPM 4. Construct a governance framework with @SnapshotLabs 5. Distribute ownership with @viamirror or @CoinviseCo \u2014 Lucas \ud83d\udd25_\ud83d\udd25 (@0x_Lucas) December 21, 2021\n\nEvery DAO needs a name that encapsulates its mission, such as ConstitutionDAO, FreeRossDAO, Ukraine DAO, and AssangeDAO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor this lesson, let's imagine that we want to launch an explorer's club DAO. Decrypt has gone ahead and set it up.\n\nName: Exploration DAO\n\nDAO Type: Education/Club\n\nMission Statement: To finance and facilitate exploration of unknown places and preserve historical items, works, and sites. Exploration DAO is dedicated to funding people and organizations working to explore and preserve history. The DAO will donate all funds raised outside operating costs to charities, schools, museums, and global organizations.\n\nNext, we want to set up where the DAO will live for member engagement, community building, and announcement. The most commonly used platforms are:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ExplorationDAO Discord: https://discord.gg/U3f89V2kZN Telegram: https://t.me/+kuf4cw16ZsgyNDUx\n\nTwitter: Love it or hate it, Twitter is the public square. DAOs use Twitter to announce their plans to the broader world.\n\nDiscord: If any Web2 app has stuck around in Web3, it's Discord, which built its base with gamers but has now also become the home of DAOs. DAO leaders like Discord for its ability to organize thousands of people into different roles and working groups.\n\nTelegram: DAOs may also use Telegram to create groups and gather members, perhaps before forming a Discord.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat tools are available for launching a DAO?\n\nHere are some popular sites for launching a DAO:\n\nDAOhaus\n\nDAOhaus is a DAO protocol for joining existing DAOs and creating a new DAO based on the Moloch framework. DAOs can be launched by setting a few parameters: 1. The type of DAO being launched: Guild (works collectively to offer services); Clubs (little to no financial decisions); Ventures (for large financial decisions; Grants (distribute wealth); and Products (govern a product or protocol); 2. The addresses of the members; 3. Filling in the DAO's metadata like its name, social media, and website link.\n\nCollab.Land\n\nNot specifically a tool for launching a DAO, Collab.Land is a popular tool used by DAOs to moderate membership. It does this by verifying that each member currently holds the DAO's token, allowing access to the DAO's various Discord channels, and kicks out members who no longer hold the token.\n\nAragon\n\nAragon is an open-source platform for launching and maintaining a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain. Aragon offers two main products: Aragon Client, a toolkit for developers to create online organizations that aim for more transparency and customizability, and Aragon Govern, a framework for DAO governance with on-chain execution and plug-in dispute resolution.\n\nTreasury management tools\n\nEventually, a DAO will need a treasury to store its funds and manage its tokens. Deciding which tool to use depends on the group's needs and treasury size. The DAO will need a compatible wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Portis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGnosis Safe\n\nGnosis Safe is an Ethereum wallet that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur. When a DAO wants to pursue a course of action, it's voted on by the members of the DAO (see Snapshot below) and then executed by a core group of signers, known as a multi-sig (multi-signature). With Gnosis Safe, users can define a list of signer accounts and the required number of signers so no single DAO member can move funds independently.\n\nSyndicate Web3 Investment Clubs\n\nTo start a Web3 investment club on Syndicate, founders will need to connect a wallet like Metamask to the Syndicate network. Deposits are collected in that wallet, and any existing assets in the wallet will be visible to all club members. After the investment club founder chooses a name, the platform will assign a club token symbol. Syndicate investment clubs can then become the treasury of a DAO built around it.\n\nVoting tools\n\nAfter setting up a treasury, a DAO will need a way for members to vote on proposals. Snapshot is by far the most popular tool. It is a decentralized voting system that allows users to create proposals and vote off-chain, meaning votes are cast\u2014no cryptocurrency is exchanged\u2014using ERC-20 tokens or even NFTs to show voting power.\n\nFundraising tools\n\nJuicebox\n\nThink of Juicebox as a Web3 version of Kickstarter. Projects use Juicebox to raise funding from their communities via smart contracts on Ethereum. Projects can design a fundraising page and funding structure and define how funds and rewards will be distributed.\n\nMirror\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMirror is best known as a blogging platform built on blockchain technology. But in addition to publishing articles, DAOs can also use Mirror for crowdfunding projects that use Ethereum smart contracts, and to turn posts into NFTs.\n\nDid you know? DAOs come in various flavors, from fashion DAOs like Digitalax to DAOs formed around buying sports franchises to DAOs like Maker that act as DeFi central banks.\n\nThe future of DAOs: What's Next?\n\nAs DAOs become more mainstream, more tools will become available to offer more one-stop solutions tools like Superdao and DAOhaus, where with a few clicks, a new DAO is spun up. But while the number of tools available to launch a DAO continues to grow, the most crucial piece of the puzzle is the ability to organize and motivate DAO members to act and work toward the DAO's mission and goal."

        "content": "The crypto market continues to waver as we transition toward the second half of the year amid a regulatory crackdown in the U.S. But as trading volume continues to dwindle across centralized exchanges, some big crypto whales are still trading.\n\nWe decided to take a look at what six major crypto whales\u2019 wallets \u2014 a \u201cwhale\u201d in investing or gambling denotes a player with a lot of capital in play \u2014 are doing: where they park funds and how their activity signals movement in the market, according to on-chain portfolio data from Nansen.\n\nThe wallets are worth a total of $493.6 million, with almost 98% of their wallets\u2019 allocated on the Ethereum blockchain, the data showed. The wallets and their data were selected by Nansen to detail a series of active wallets; we will continue to explore other whale wallets over time to expand our sample set.\n\nA majority of the wallets include \u201cwrapped\u201d crypto assets, which is a tokenized version of the original coin that holds the same value. For example, there\u2019s bitcoin (BTC) and wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and an investor would own the latter if they wanted to use bitcoin on the Ethereum network, which it doesn\u2019t operate on. It can, though, through the wrapped version.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at six crypto whale\u2019s wallets ranging from \u201csmallest\u201d to largest:\n\nCrypto wallet 1 with $18.25 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 98.31% on the Ethereum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 85.55% is staked Ethereum (stETH) at $25.8 million. 6.44% is wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) at $1.94 million.

Less than 1%, or $860,695, is held in USDC.\n\nProtocol allocation 99.91% held in crypto wallet.\n\nPortfolio performance down 4.1% on the week\n\nCrypto wallet 6 with $206.86 million net worth:\n\nChain allocation: 94.2% on the Ethereum chain. 3.9% on Arbitrum chain.\n\nBiggest token allocations: 61.57% in wrapped ether (wETH) at about $127.32 million. 14.55% in MKR at $30 million. 12.87%, about $26.64 million, held in stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI.\n\nBiggest protocol allocations 37.37%, or $77.3 million, held on lending pool Morpho. 26.6%, or $55 million, held in crypto wallet. 22.1%, or $45.72 million, held on Uniswap.\n\nPortfolio performance down 3% on the week\n\nThe takeaway\n\nAll the portfolios are down on the week, which makes sense given the crypto market\u2019s shaky nature, and almost all are solely allocated on Ethereum\u2019s chain, making it the dominant place by a landslide for investors.\n\nAcross the six wallets, 97.55% were allocated to the Ethereum chain, with less than 3% on Arbitrum and Optimism chains. So it makes sense that the biggest token allocations all pertained to Ethereum with wrapped ether, staked ether and ether making up 69% of the six wallets\u2019 $493.6 million total. After Ethereum, wrapped bitcoin composed 7.66% of the total allocation across the wallets.\n\nOverall, this means the whales are generally risk-off, given the majority are holding liquid staking tokens, stablecoins and wrapped bitcoin and ether, signaling a conservative mindset.\n\nWhat was surprising, though, were the six wallets\u2019 lack of stablecoin allocations. Only crypto wallet 2 and 6 had a notable amount held in stablecoins, at 22% and 12.87%, respectively. This shows that these whales have a stronger appetite and are actively investing in the market, even if they\u2019re defaulting to staking, opposed to watching from the sidelines with their money held in a (supposed to be) stable way.\n\nWallet 4 and 5 hold the majority of their funds in their crypto wallets, while others preferred to hold their tokens on protocols to (hopefully) gain passive income. Half of the wallets are also staking a majority of their portfolios, which is a common activity across whales. Crypto staking can provide returns, but if the asset being staked drops in value, then the rewards will also drop; there is no guarantee that rewards will offset any potential declines in value of the staked asset. So the mass amount that these three crypto wallets are staking signals that they might believe that these investments are going to be in the green long term.\n\nIt also makes sense that the wallets that are staking their assets through a protocol like Aave, which provides users noncustodial liquidity markets that can earn interest (currently around 6% APR). While there\u2019s a number of liquidity protocols out there, Aave seems to be leading the ranks here for the whales. The comparison I make to this is: I shop at Target and Walmart, but I prefer one over the other, even though they provide similar experiences.\n\nIn general, digital asset investment products saw outflows of $88 million, marking eight consecutive weeks of outflows worth a total of $417 million, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report. \u201cWe believe that this is monetary policy related, with currently no clear end in sight to interest rate rises, leaving investors cautious,\u201d the report stated. This week, Ethereum, had outflows of $36 million, which is the largest seven-day outflow since the Merge in September.\n\nTypically, the crypto market is looked at holistically by tracking volume, trading activity and other metrics. But by looking at a handful of wallets, we can see what some whales are doing, which matters given how much capital they control compared to the average retail trader. Regardless of how each of these wallets initially got its net worth, their current activity points to a more conservative approach, something traders tend to do when in a bear market as tokens become less predictable and there are fewer opportunities to get rich quick.\n\nGiven that we only looked at six crypto whale portfolios, it\u2019s important to note that this is a small part of the market and should not be used as financial advice. This was done to look at where whales are moving capital and what they\u2019re doing amid the bear market \u2014 and how it\u2019s paying off for them. As always, you should do your own research."

        "title": "Vitalik's Triple Call! Can MillionaireGame (MG) and ETH Seize The Opportunities of Ethereum Transition? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has drawn a roadmap for what he believes to be the three main technical transitions required to ensure the success of the Ethereum blockchain. Will MillionaireGame (MG), rumored to be the next whale club on Ethereum, grasp this opportunity?\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) \u2013 The Next Whale Club on Ethereum\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) is an upcoming meme coin on Ethereum. Unlike other generic meme coins, MG focuses on fulfilling an investor\u2019s dream \u2013 to become a millionaire. MG reflects the real wishes of investors who are hoping to hit the jackpot by investing small amounts in meme coins. As the MG game begins, a new millionaire will be randomly selected from the token holders every month.\n\nEmphasizing Technological Capabilities Like Ethereum\n\nLike Ethereum, MG is a project that emphasizes technological prowess. The MG game will be run by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness. With a sustainable token economy designed such that as long as the token market cap is above $40 million with a 2% price increase, the Millionaire Game can continue for over 50 years, as claimed by the teams, making it the next dominating whale club.\n\nVitalik\u2019s First Transition \u2013 Layer 2 Expansion\n\nThe first transition Vitalik mentions is expanding Layer 2. Over the past few years, Ethereum has quickly witnessed the emergence of a Layer 2 ecosystem comprising Optimistic Rollup and Zero Knowledge-Rollup solutions. These solutions help reduce transaction costs, but the L2 space still needs to mature and expand further, as most activities still happen on the mainnet. Buterin warns that without Layer 2 expansion, Ethereum could face rising transaction fees, especially during market expansion or \u201cbull\u201d phases.\n\nVitalik\u2019s Second and Third Transitions \u2013 Wallet Security and Privacy\n\nIn his blog, Vitalik further stresses the importance of the second transition, wallet security. He emphasizes that potential security issues may deter users from storing funds on the Ethereum network, forcing them to opt for centralized exchanges. Vitalik also highlights the importance of privacy as the third transition. He expresses concern that without robust data privacy measures, users may be reluctant to use Ethereum.\n\nPrice Surge and Exciting Times Ahead for MG\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced substantial volatility following Vitalik\u2019s announcement, but has since attained stability, underscoring Ethereum\u2019s enduring strength. Simultaneously, MG has unveiled the presale price for its impending second phase, forecasting an encouraging 18% ascent in the token value. Investors drawn to the Millionaire Game\u2019s innovative approach should closely monitor these unfolding events. An early-stage investment in a meme coin like MG presents optimal opportunities for substantial returns. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that this comes intertwined with the inherent uncertainties characteristic of all cryptocurrency ventures.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) Presale Information:\n\nhttps://www.millionairegame.org/claim-discount\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Is Ethereum Classic still relevant after Ethereum Merge? AI Analytics provide insights - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "As the Ethereum blockchain transitions from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake system, the cryptocurrency market watches in anticipation. With the Ethereum Merge bringing about significant changes, the future of ETC remains uncertain, prompting questions whether it is still relevant after the Ethereum Merge. Fortunately, Avorak comes in handy with its advanced algorithms.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) came as a hard fork from the original Ethereum blockchain after a hack on the DAO platform. While Ethereum developers chose to reverse the hack, part of the community continued with the original blockchain and created Ethereum Classic, which functions similarly to Ethereum but with a smaller market capitalization and developer community. Since Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake, some miners have migrated to ETC, but without organic demand, Ethereum Classic price prediction notes that ETC\u2019s long-term prospects are uncertain. As such, AI analytics by AvoraK AI can provide valuable insights including the Ethereum Classic Price Prediction for investors and traders looking to make informed decisions.\n\nEthereum Merge\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is the transition of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, resulting in a 99.95% decrease in energy consumption. This upgrade is significant because it makes the framework more sustainable offering greater crypto-economic security, as well as making it easier for anyone to participate in securing the Ethereum network. The Ethereum Merge is a software upgrade that essentially changes the verification system of the blockchain, which establishes a decentralized method to validate transactions and eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks.\n\nSince the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has seen a massive surge in mean hash rate as some miners migrated to ETC. However, there has been no increase in on-chain activity on ETC, ETC mining profitability has plummeted. Without organic demand for ETC, it is likely to struggle from continued sell pressure from miners. ETCG shareholders own 8.5% of the ETC in circulation, which is a highly concentrated crypto by the top 100 address ownership. The lack of user demand for the network or the ETC coin, in general, makes the long bet on ETCG a bet that Grayscale will dissolve the trust and distribute the proceeds from the coin sales for a larger value than where the fund shares are currently trading.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge involves retiring miners and introducing stakers, which is expected to result in a significant drop in Ether\u2019s value. This shift will impact Ethereum\u2019s native coin\u2019s economics by cutting back on its issuance, reducing its total supply through burn mechanisms, and introducing staking. The Merge\u2019s impact on ETH, in terms of its dynamics, is likely the most significant aspect for investors and traders. The reduction in supply is equivalent to three Bitcoin halvings.\n\nAvorak AI\n\nAvorak (AVRK) provides investors with an investment and business opportunity with simplified AI solutions, including chatbots, trade bots, text generators, and image creators. The question of whether ETC will remain relevant after the Ethereum Merge remains unanswered. AI analytics can provide insights into the future of ETC. By analyzing market trends, on-chain activity, and social media sentiment, AI algorithms can identify patterns and predict potential outcomes for ETC after the Ethereum Merge.\n\nAVRK token is in ICO phase seven with a value increase of 325% to $0.255. Early investors can access bonus payouts and other rights after the ICO and listing. ICO holders can participate in Beta testing of various AI tools, Avorak Write, a content generation tool is making waves in the text generation space. The tool strives to eliminate plagiarism and repetitive content problems of existing tools.\n\nWrap Up\n\nWhile the long-term prospects of ETC are uncertain, AI analytics can provide valuable insights for investors and traders looking to make informed decisions. By analyzing large amounts of data and generating predictions based on complex algorithms, Avorak AI can be a useful tool in navigating the ever-changing cryptocurrency market and identifying potential investment opportunities.\n\nMore on Avorak AI here:\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Is Ethereum 2.0 Staking Profitable After The Merge Event? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum has been at the forefront of innovation and change in the ever-evolving crypto sphere. The Ethereum network, known for its smart contract functionality and the birthplace of decentralized applications (dApps), has recently undergone a transformative event known as the \u2018Ethereum Merge.\u2019 This event marks a significant shift in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism, transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), thereby completely eliminating the role of miners and replacing it with staking work.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is a milestone in the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, a long-awaited event that has been in the works for several years. This transition is not just a technical upgrade; it represents a paradigm shift in the way Ethereum operates. PoW, the original consensus mechanism of Ethereum, involved miners solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks, known as Ethereum mining. This process, while secure, was energy-intensive and faced criticism for its environmental impact.\n\nThe shift to PoS changes the game entirely. Instead of miners, we now have validators who are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of Ethereum they hold and are willing to \u2018stake\u2019 as collateral. This method is not only more energy-efficient but also democratizes the Ethereum network by allowing more participants to engage in the validation process.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge is a bold step towards a more sustainable and inclusive blockchain ecosystem. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the fascinating realm of Ethereum 2.0 staking, a revolutionary development that has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. This article is designed to be a comprehensive resource for both newcomers and seasoned investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhether you\u2019re considering staking services as a potential investment or simply curious about the latest developments in the Ethereum network, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate the world of Ethereum 2.0 staking.\n\nWhat is Ethereum 2.0?\n\nEthereum 2.0, also known as ETH2, represents a significant evolution in the world of blockchain technology. It is a multi-phased upgrade designed to enhance the scalability and security of the Ethereum network through a series of infrastructure modifications. The most notable of these changes is the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIn January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation rebranded Ethereum 2.0 as the \u201cconsensus layer,\u201d emphasizing that this upgrade is not about building a new network from scratch but rather enhancing the existing one. The original Ethereum network, now referred to as the \u201cexecution layer,\u201d continues to be the domain where network and smart contract rules reside.\n\nThis rebranding reflects the seamless integration of the two layers, with the consensus layer handling the network\u2019s security and the execution layer managing the computation and storage. The full upgrade, which is expected to be completed by 2023, will result in a more robust, efficient, and scalable Ethereum network ready to meet the growing demands of the global blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhat is ETH 2.0 staking?\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network, once plagued by high transaction costs and scalability issues, has undergone a significant transformation with the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Previously, the success of DeFi projects led to an overburdened network, with transaction costs skyrocketing to levels that were prohibitively expensive for many use cases. Non-finance DApps (decentralized applications developed on top of Ethereum) found it particularly challenging to operate due to these high gas fees.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s network upgrade, now known as Ethereum 2.0, has addressed these issues, enhancing the security, speed, efficiency, and scalability of the Ethereum network. This upgrade has allowed Ethereum to process more transactions, alleviate bottlenecks, and accommodate a broader range of use cases, extending beyond the realm of finance.\n\nA key component of this upgrade is the shift from a mining model to a staking model. In a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation, similar to mining in the previous model. Anyone with the minimum required balance of cryptocurrency can become a validator, validate transactions and earn staking rewards. Ethereum can be staked on various cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and more.\n\nBefore the upgrade, Ethereum could handle around 15 transactions per second, a rate that was relatively slow for financial transactions. However, with the implementation of PoS, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to enable the processing of up to 100,000 transactions per second. This significant increase in capacity considerably expands the range of projects and applications that can be built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Staking Work?\n\nIn the realm of blockchain technology, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, unlike its Proof-of-Work (PoW) counterpart, operates by bundling 32 blocks of transactions into a single validation cycle, which averages around 6.4 minutes.\n\nThese bundled blocks are known as \u201cepochs.\u201d An epoch reaches a state of finality, meaning it becomes unalterable, once two subsequent epochs have been appended to the blockchain.\n\nThe Beacon Chain, a key component of the PoS system, forms \u2018committees\u2019 of 128 stakers and assigns them randomly to a specific shard block. Each committee is allocated a \u2018slot,\u2019 a fixed period to propose a new block and authenticate the transactions it contains. With 32 slots in each epoch, a total of 32 committees are required to finalize the validation cycle.\n\nIn each committee, a single member is chosen at random to propose a new transaction block, while the remaining 127 members cast their votes on the proposal and confirm the authenticity of the transactions.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is instrumental in ensuring network synchronization. It collects state data from shards and disseminates it to other shards. It also manages validators, from registering their stake contributions to distributing rewards and penalties.\n\nSharding is a technique that segments the Ethereum network into multiple \u2018shards,\u2019 each maintaining its own state, which includes a unique set of account balances and smart contracts.\n\nWhen a new block receives attestation from the majority of the committee, it is appended to the blockchain, and a \u201ccross-link\u201d is created to confirm its inclusion. The staker selected to propose the new block is rewarded only after this process.\n\nThe states of individual shards are harmonized with the main chain, the Beacon Chain, through cross-linking. This ensures that the final state of each shard is mirrored on the Beacon Chain.\n\nIn a distributed network, a transaction achieves \u201cfinality\u201d when it is included in a block that is immutable. The Casper finality protocol in PoS accomplishes this by securing agreement from validators on the state of a block at designated checkpoints.\n\nThe finalization of a block occurs when it receives agreement from two-thirds of the validators. If validators later attempt to overturn this with a 51% attack, they stand to forfeit their entire stake.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum validators have been engaged in staking for quite some time. The Beacon Chain, an upgraded proof-of-stake network, successfully merged to become the primary Ethereum network on September 15, 2022, following its initial launch on December 1, 2020.\n\nSince the initial launch of the Beacon Chain, investors have had the opportunity to stake in this network. Their Ethereum, once staked, was securely locked until the successful completion of the merge, marking the beginning of a new era for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Shanghai/Capella upgrade was successfully implemented on April 12, 2023. This upgrade facilitated the staking withdrawals of rewards, thereby addressing the issue of staking liquidity.\n\nHow to stake Ethereum?\n\nFor those considering staking on the Ethereum network, a minimum of 32 ETH is required, which will be locked for a certain period. Additionally, setting up a staking node involves running an Ethereum client, a type of software that facilitates node interaction with the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are several compatible software clients for setting up staking nodes, including:\n\nPrysm: A variant of the Ethereum software developed using the Go language.\n\nTeku: An enterprise-oriented software client developed in Java.\n\nLighthouse: A software client developed using the Rust programming language.\n\nLodestar: A software client developed by Chaincode Labs using JavaScript/Typescript.\n\nTo run these clients, a computer with sufficient memory to download the Ethereum blockchain is necessary.\n\nValidators are required to maintain a constant connection to the blockchain, implying that a reliable internet connection is essential. Once the validator software is installed on your computer, the next step involves committing a minimum of 32 ETH to the designated Ethereum staking contract address.\n\nStaking via Crypto Exchange\n\nNumerous opportunities exist for users interested in staking Ethereum, with options spanning from solo staking to staking-as-a-service and collective staking. These alternatives cater to a diverse user base, and each has its unique characteristics.\n\nThey differ in aspects such as risk levels, potential rewards, and trust requirements. Some are more decentralized, have undergone more rigorous testing, or carry higher risks than others. For those who prefer not to manage their own keys, there are solutions that handle the technical aspects while still allowing users to earn native block rewards.\n\nCoinbase, a leading exchange, provides an Ethereum staking program for users who prefer not to operate their own node. When it comes to wallets, Ledger stands out as a prime choice for staking ETH.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to staking Ethereum via a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance:\n\nStep 1: Register for an account. This usually involves providing personal details, verifying your identity, and setting up a payment method for buying ETH. Step 2: Buy ETH. After setting up your account, you\u2019ll need to acquire Ethereum. This can typically be done using various payment methods offered by the exchange, such as bank transfers, credit cards, or debit cards. Step 3: Move ETH to the exchange\u2019s staking program. Once you have ETH in your exchange wallet, you should be able to locate an option to stake ETH within the wallet interface. The exact steps may differ based on the exchange, but generally, you\u2019ll need to go to the wallet\u2019s staking section and follow the instructions to stake your ETH. Step 4: Select your staking preferences. This involves choosing parameters like the amount of ETH you wish to stake and the duration for which you want to stake it. Step 5: Begin staking and earning rewards. Rewards are usually credited to your account at regular intervals, depending on the specific staking program and its payout schedule.\n\nExchange APY (for Flexible Term Staking of ETH) Huobi 5% BitForex 3% PrimeXBT 1.99% KuCoin 1.66% Bybit 1.2% Binance 0.92% MEXC 0.5% Phemex 0.3% Crypto.com 0.2%\n\nStaking Through a Wallet\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to staking Ethereum using a cryptocurrency wallet, such as Guarda:\n\nStep 1: Select a suitable wallet. Opt for a wallet that supports Ethereum staking. Some well-known choices include Ledger, Trezor, and MetaMask. Step 2: Move ETH to your wallet. After choosing a wallet, you\u2019ll need to transfer ETH into it from an exchange or another wallet. Step 3: Go to the staking area. Once your wallet has ETH, find the staking area within the wallet\u2019s interface. This might involve clicking on a specific button or tab. Step 4: Stake following the provided instructions. After finding the staking area, adhere to the instructions given by the wallet to stake your ETH.\n\nImmediate Method: Staking ETH via a staking pool\n\nEthereum requires a minimum of 32 ETH for individual staking, a sum many crypto holders don\u2019t possess. To address this, solutions like centralized exchanges and staking pools have emerged. Staking pools allow ETH holders to combine their funds to reach the 32 ETH staking threshold, with rewards distributed proportionally.\n\nStaking pools can be non-liquid or liquid. Non-liquid pools allow ETH holders to earn rewards without a tradable derivative token, making it a non-taxable event. They typically offer an APY of 4% to 6% and don\u2019t require the 32 ETH threshold.\n\nLiquid staking pools, on the other hand, offer a derivative token that can be traded or used in other DeFi protocols. This makes it a taxable event but also provides higher yield potential, with returns of up to 10% when combined with loans or liquidity mining.\n\nRequirements To Begin Ethereum Staking\n\nStaking Ethereum (ETH) not only provides you with the opportunity to earn rewards for contributing to the network, but it also enhances the network\u2019s security and sustainability. If you choose to stake solo, you can do so by establishing your own staking node and operating the software on your personal hardware. This method does not necessarily require you to provide personal information to a third-party service provider.\n\nOn the other hand, staking-as-a-service (SAAS) and pooled staking are alternative methods where you entrust your staking rights to a third-party service provider. This provider then oversees the staking process for you. In this scenario, you will typically need to set up an account with the service provider, which may necessitate the submission of personal data or maintaining a minimum balance.\n\nMinimum Deposit\n\nFor individual staking, you need a minimum deposit of 32 ETH, which is the requisite amount to operate a validator node on the Ethereum network. However, when it comes to pooled staking or staking through a staking-as-a-service platform, the minimum deposit requirement may not be fixed, as it depends on the specific exchange or wallet service you\u2019re using. Some of these services do not have a minimum deposit requirement, while others may necessitate a deposit ranging from as little as 0.1 ETH to 5 ETH worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Profitable Is Ethereum 2.0 Staking?\n\nThe reward given to stakers is contingent on the total amount of ETH staked and the number of validators in the network. When the staked ETH pool decreases, the annual interest rate escalates. For instance, with only about 500,000 ETH staked, the annual interest rate (APR) was slightly above 20%.\n\nHowever, by August 2021, with over 6,800,000 ETH staked, the APR fell to approximately 6.0%. The interest rate diminishes once the staking pool is sufficiently large to foster a decentralized environment.\n\nFurthermore, staking Ethereum is advantageous as it simplifies node operation. It doesn\u2019t require substantial hardware or energy investments, and you can participate in staking pools if you lack sufficient ETH.\n\nStaking promotes decentralization and encourages broader participation. Unlike mining, adding more nodes doesn\u2019t increase profit percentages. Staking also facilitates secure sharding, which allows Ethereum to create multiple blocks simultaneously, speeding up transaction processing. In a proof-of-work system, sharding would decrease the power needed to compromise a network segment.\n\nConsiderations when selecting a Staking method\n\nWhen staking, several considerations, such as security, fees, and wallet quality, are paramount, as you\u2019ll be entrusting and immobilizing a significant amount of cryptocurrency, which could be a lure for hackers. Here\u2019s a breakdown of these considerations:\n\nSecurity: Staking entails the long-term lock-up of a substantial cryptocurrency amount, making it essential to opt for a platform with stringent security measures to avert potential losses.\n\nFees: The fees associated with staking can vary greatly across different wallets and exchanges, and they can considerably affect your staking profits. Thus, it\u2019s important to scrutinize the fees and choose a provider with reasonable rates.\n\nWallet Quality and Safety: Opting for a trustworthy wallet with a history of safety can provide an added layer of security and assurance when staking a large quantity of ETH.\n\nCustomer Service: Having access to timely and efficient customer service can facilitate a smoother and less daunting staking process, particularly if you face any challenges or have inquiries.\n\nValidator Uptime/Reliability: Validators, who are tasked with transaction processing and blockchain maintenance, should be dependable with a solid record of uptime and performance, as any downtime could result in forfeited rewards or financial losses.\n\nSpeed: Certain staking methods might be sluggish or have lengthy waiting periods before rewards are distributed. It\u2019s crucial to identify an efficient validator that ensures swift distribution of rewards to optimize returns and reduce waiting periods. If you can\u2019t locate one, you can operate your own node if you\u2019re well-versed in ETH staking.\n\nIs Staking Ethereum a Good Idea?\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a long-term investment in Ethereum, staking could be a beneficial strategy. The additional yield you gain can increase your total Ethereum holdings.\n\nHowever, staking may not always be the best option. It requires you to forfeit liquidity, as your Ethereum will be locked for several months.\n\nEven though protocols like Lido can provide some assistance, there\u2019s no assurance that market sentiments won\u2019t abruptly shift, potentially altering the stETH/ETH rate from its usual 1-to-1 ratio. The stablecoin market crash in May 2022 serves as a stark reminder of this risk.\n\nYour decision should primarily be based on your investment timeline and your readiness to retain Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is a highly volatile and risky investment that can rapidly change course. Therefore, before investing in Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency, it\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research and be prepared for the inherent volatility of such investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum 2.0 staking, post-merge, is a significant leap forward in the world of blockchain technology. It\u2019s a testament to Ethereum\u2019s commitment to innovation, scalability, and sustainability.\n\nThis transformative upgrade allows Ethereum holders to actively contribute to the network\u2019s security while earning rewards, fostering a more inclusive and participatory ecosystem.\n\nAs we move forward into this new era of Ethereum, the opportunities for growth and advancement are immense. The full implementation of Ethereum 2.0, with its staking feature, marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Ethereum journey, one that is sure to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. It\u2019s indeed an exciting time to be part of the Ethereum community as we stand on the brink of a new frontier in decentralized finance."

        "content": "Among the most popular and innovative crypto assets, Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) stand out for their technology and applications.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the latest news and prices of these three cryptocurrencies so as to understand the market trends that are affecting them.\n\nWe will analyze the unique characteristics of each cryptocurrency and assess the factors that may have contributed to the recent price movements.\n\nPrices and crypto market statistics of Solana, Ethereum, and Ripple\n\nLet\u2019s start with an analysis of the first asset, namely Solana, among the three is the one that has suffered the most from this momentary crisis, losing 27.7% of its value in just 7 days.\n\nAs of today, its current price is $15.58.\n\nCurrently, it has a market capitalization of about $6.2 billion, indicating its position among prominent cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe trading volume in the past 24 hours is $445.8 million, while Solana\u2019s circulating supply is about 398.8 million SOL, with an average holding time of 71 days.\n\nIn terms of popularity, Solana ranks seventh among the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrencies.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum has suffered losses due to market conditions, leaving behind -6% of its value in one week. Its current price is $1,755.13.\n\nAs for market statistics, the capitalization is $210.7 billion, with a trading volume (in the last 24 hours) of $5.5 billion.\n\nThe token\u2019s circulating supply is 120.2 million ETH with an average holding time of 51 days.\n\nLast but not least is the XRP token, which despite a minimal decline of 3% in the last 7 days, is coming from a month of great growth, also dictated by the terms of the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nThe current price is $0.52, with a market capitalization of $27 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $1.1 billion.\n\nRipple\u2019s circulating supply is currently 52 billion XRP.\n\nBut let\u2019s turn to the most recent news affecting the markets for these crypto assets.\n\nWhales go against the market and hold the Ethereum crypto\n\nEthereum (ETH) whales have defied market uncertainty by showing increased appetite for the cryptocurrency. In a surprising move amid price volatility, these large ETH holders have accumulated more tokens, signaling their confidence in the long-term potential of the Ethereum network.\n\nA notable example of this trend is a whale of a wallet that recently withdrew a significant amount of ETH from the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency trading platform, Binance.\n\nIn the past month, this wallet has moved nearly 39,300 tokens, a significant demonstration of their belief in Ethereum\u2019s future prospects.\n\nThis interesting development becomes even more noteworthy when one considers the context of significant price declines in the market.\n\nWhile many investors may have been discouraged by the recent volatility and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, Ethereum whales have chosen to view this situation as an opportunity rather than a setback.\n\nThe motivations of the whales with regard to Ethereum\n\nOne possible interpretation of this behavior is that these whales, with their extensive holdings and knowledge of the market, have a deeper understanding of the underlying factors affecting Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nThey may have recognized that short-term price fluctuations do not necessarily reflect the long-term potential and value of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s continued developments and upgrades, such as the implementation of Ethereum 2.0 and the growing adoption of decentralized finance applications (DeFi), have likely contributed to whale confidence.\n\nThese advances have the potential to further improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, security, and utility, making it an attractive investment option for both private and institutional investors.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s established position as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin, provides it with a solid foundation and broad recognition in the industry.\n\nThis, coupled with growing interest from institutional investors and mainstream adoption, has likely bolstered whales\u2019 confidence in the long-term value of ETH.\n\nThe Solana Foundation takes a determined stand against the SEC\n\nThe Solana Foundation responded to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a recent tweet, expressing its disagreement with the classification of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, as a security.\n\nThis announcement had a significant impact on SOL\u2019s value, dropping its price to $15.\n\nIn its response, the Solana Foundation made it clear that it firmly believes that SOL should not be considered a security.\n\nIt stressed that its blockchain and ecosystem are designed to enable decentralized applications and provide a solid infrastructure for developers, rather than serve as traditional security.\n\nIn addition, the foundation expressed a willingness to work with policymakers to establish legal clarity in the rapidly evolving realm of digital assets. It recognizes the importance of a regulatory framework that protects investors while promoting innovation and growth in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe disagreement between the Solana Foundation and the SEC highlights the ongoing debate over the classification of cryptocurrencies and their regulatory oversight.\n\nDifferent jurisdictions and regulatory bodies have different interpretations on how cryptocurrencies should be classified and regulated, leading to a complex and fragmented landscape.\n\nAlthough the SEC\u2019s classification may have initially caused a decline in SOL\u2019s value, it is important to note that regulatory actions and decisions can have both short-term and long-term impacts on cryptocurrencies.\n\nClear guidelines and favorable regulatory environments are key to instilling investor confidence and promoting wider adoption of digital assets."

        "title": "Tether the issuer of USDT engages in a chain swap: here's what we're talking about - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Tether, the provider of the most widely used stablecoin, USDT, recently made headlines for its coordinated chain swap operation.\n\nIn a strategic move, Tether partnered with a third-party exchange to facilitate the conversion of 750 million USDT tokens from the Tron blockchain to the Ethereum ERC20 standard.\n\nThis article explores the significance of this chain swap and its implications for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nUnderstanding chain swaps and Tether\u2019s move with USDT tokens\n\nChain swaps are processes that involve moving digital assets from one blockchain network to another.\n\nTether\u2019s chain swap from Tron to Ethereum ERC20 involves the transfer of a significant amount of USDT tokens between these two blockchains.\n\nBy converting USDT tokens from one blockchain to the other, Tether aims to provide greater accessibility and liquidity to its users.\n\nTether\u2019s decision to conduct a blockchain swap between the Tron and Ethereum ERC20 networks stems from several motivations.\n\nFirst, the move is aimed at diversifying Tether\u2019s presence and usage across multiple blockchains, thereby expanding its reach and user base.\n\nEthereum, being the second largest blockchain network and home to a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, presents immense opportunities for Tether to tap into a thriving ecosystem.\n\nSecond, the blockchain exchange allows Tether to leverage the unique advantages offered by both the Tron and Ethereum networks.\n\nTron\u2018s high-speed, low-cost transactions make it suitable for users who prioritize efficiency, while Ethereum\u2019s robust DeFi infrastructure offers Tether numerous opportunities to explore innovative financial applications and decentralized exchanges.\n\nDuring the chain swap process, it is important to note that Tether\u2019s total supply remains unchanged.\n\nThe 750 million USDt tokens that are swapped from Tron to Ethereum ERC20 represent a simple transfer of assets between the two blockchains. This ensures that the stability and reliability associated with Tether\u2019s total offering is maintained throughout the process.\n\nImpact on users and market dynamics\n\nThe chain swap transaction has significant implications for users and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe conversion from Tron to Ethereum ERC20 gives Tether users access to a wider range of DeFi protocols and decentralized exchanges built on Ethereum.\n\nThis expansion opens up opportunities for users to engage in various lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities.\n\nIn addition, the Tether exchange could have an impact on the market dynamics of Tron and Ethereum.\n\nThe increased presence of Tether on the Ethereum network could lead to increased liquidity and exchange volumes, potentially increasing the value of Ethereum and related DeFi assets.\n\nIn addition, the migration of Tether users from Tron to Ethereum could trigger a change in Tron\u2019s market dynamics and incentivize the development of new projects and initiatives to retain and attract users.\n\nFuture perspectives\n\nTether\u2019s chain swap transaction between Tron and Ethereum ERC20 is likely to have a ripple effect on the broader cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nIt shows the growing interoperability and collaboration between different blockchain networks, paving the way for further advances in decentralized finance and cross-chain transactions.\n\nAs Tether explores new chains and expands its compatibility, it is expected that the stablecoin issuer will continue to forge strategic partnerships and collaborations with various blockchain networks.\n\nThis will enable Tether to meet the specific needs and preferences of different user communities, further strengthening its position as a leading stablecoin provider.\n\nIn addition, Tether\u2019s chain swap reinforces the importance of stablecoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As cryptocurrencies continue to experience volatility, stablecoins offer a reliable means of preserving value and facilitating transactions.\n\nTether, a major issuer of stablecoins, plays a key role in providing stability and liquidity to the market.\n\nWe can therefore say that Tether\u2019s coordinated chain swap from Tron to Ethereum ERC20 represents a significant step toward greater interoperability and accessibility in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nBy expanding its presence across multiple blockchain networks, Tether intends to offer users more opportunities and seamless integration with decentralized financial applications.\n\nAs the market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Tether\u2019s chain swap and similar initiatives will shape the future of stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum, undoubtedly the most sought-after digital assets, have now been positioned live on the MultiversX Bridge. This will help them to get connected with speedy, as well as cost-effective transaction fees, along with endless possibilities for carrying out innovations.\n\nThis will also allow BTC and ETH to communicate with a similar amount of ease in the case of EGLD and ESDTs. Where the DeFi protocols and various ecosystem products are concerned, it will be made possible to incorporate them, opening the doors for users to scour fresh avenues inside the ecosystem.\n\nWhat is highly significant at this point is that from here on, the portal will be coming with two varying types in the case of BTC, as well as ETH, which will be the conventional network and ESDT.
