        "content": "Advertisement\n\nRecent data shows an astonishing growth of users and transactions among Ethereum\u2019s growing list of layer 2 networks.\n\nPolygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum have recorded increased daily user activity by 30%, 180%, and 40%, respectively.\n\nPolygon has been tipped for massive successes this year with several network upgrades and more web3 projects before Q2 2023.\n\nThe importance of Layer 2 solutions is becoming much more glaring as web3 adoption continues to grow, paving the way for developers to launch without compromising speed for scalability.\n\nLayer 2 solutions have recorded a significant rise in the past three months in major metrics, including daily users, transaction volumes, and increased network fees. According to a report by blockchain analysis provider Token Terminal, the amount of assets locked in these networks is also rising.\n\nData from Token Terminal shows that Polygon has seen a surge in daily users since Oct 2022. As of October, daily users stood at 313,400 a figure that has nearly doubled to over 600,000 daily users. The increased transaction has led to nearly $55,000 in daily network fees for Polygon.\n\nAccording to the data, Arbitrum One has grown by 40% and now has 41,695 daily users making daily fees over $40,000. Arbitrum also dominates the market share in terms of total value locked (TVL) on its network. TVL on Arbitrum is at $2.5 billion, accounting for 52% of the total assets locked on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 platforms.\n\nOptimism has recorded gains of over 180% in daily network fees, which is a significantly higher increase than Polygon. The last three months have also seen daily users on Optimism spike by 190%. TVL on Optimism currently stands at $1.46 billion with a market share of 30%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolygon\u2019s developers are working round the clock\n\nAmong layer 2 networks, Polygon is tipped to have a more robust development in 2023. The network\u2019s recent hard fork, which will reduce gas fees and improve its overall performance, can be described as an early sign of future developments.\n\nMultiple projects are also set to migrate to Polygon from rival networks, including Solana\u2019s yOOTs. Polygon has partnered with Xternity to migrate Synergy Land, a web3 game, from Solana. Last week Mastercard announced a partnership with Polygon as it launched its web3 musician accelerator program aimed at helping artists build their brands leveraging on web3.\n\nPolygon climbed back into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after it was pushed out briefly by Solana this week."

        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate indicates that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) dominance over stablecoins has been increasing and reached its highest in the last three months.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance over stablecoins strengthens as the ETH price surpasses $1,600.\n\nThe analysis includes the top four stablecoins: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), and DAI (DAI).\n\nThe chart below represents a comparison of the ETH market cap to the aggregate value of these stablecoins since the beginning of 2020. The green line reflects the combined value of the stablecoins, while the black one shows the ETH market cap.\n\nETH held an unquestionable dominance over stablecoins between the beginning of 2020 and mid-2022. In the summer of 2022, stablecoins\u2019 aggregate value surpassed ETHs, marking a first in the history of ETH.\n\nEven though ETH recovered its dominance by the end of July 2022, stablecoins triumphed over ETH dominance once more for a short while in November 2022. Current data shows that ETH\u2019s dominance over stablecoins has been strengthened since then.\n\nExchanges\u2019 stablecoin reserves have been shrinking since the FTX collapse. A recent CryptoSlate analysis revealed that a total of 3.93 billion stablecoins had left the exchanges since the FTX crash.\n\nIn the meantime, the ETH price has been on an upwards trajectory. ETH is being traded for around $1,623 at the time of writing, reflecting a 33.23% increase in the last 30 days.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum and equity prices go in opposite directions\n\nRecent information indicated that Ethereum\u2019s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment\u2019s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.\n\nWhen the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit hits four-month high\n\nBesides the stock market\u2019s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.\n\nThe graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.\n\nMVRV shows reduced loss\n\nWhen the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of Ethereum.\n\nThough a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum remains in the overbought zone\n\nA daily timeframe chart of Ethereum\u2019s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory."

        "content": "Over the course of the past three weeks, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has seen a meteoric rise. Despite the fact that are a few bearish indications that appear along the levels of lower timeframes, bulls have still continued to prevail. However, as per recent analysis by experts, the price seems to indicate a trend exhaustion that could be underway.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Surge\n\nThe price of Ethereum has increased by 38% since the beginning of 2023 and is presently trading in the $1,650 range. Because of this enormous rise, new all-time highs were established on January 13 and 20. And, in spite of the fact that there is a clear theoretical prognosis for the Ethereum price to reverse, there is a possibility that there will be a liquidity run, which might result in a third higher high being reached.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More: Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023\n\nThis has been echoed by industry stalwarts like Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, who is of the opinion that ETH can continue rallying towards $1,700-1,730 before facing any sort of rejection. Earlier, when the ETH price had dipped, Micheal noted that those dips were the \u201cbest options before the relief rally occurs\u201d.\n\nIn this scenario, bulls have a possibility of making a comeback if they can drive the momentum signal to create a higher high at the same time. In the event that buyers are unable to make this occur, investors should expect a moderate trend reversal. Bears need to push prices below $1,568\u2014a level that serves as a support for higher time frames\u2014in order to generate momentum against buyers. If the support level of $1,568 is breached and turned into a resistance level, it will clear the way for sellers to push the price of Ethereum down to the support levels of $1,417, $1,331, and $1,227. ETH To Cross $2K? On the other hand, few experts tend to believe that the uptrend for Ethereum is far from being done. ETH bulls must stage a rebound in order to force the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to create another higher-high in the overbought area in their quest to gather liquidity resting above $1,650. The $1,820 barrier can become a support floor for Ethereum pricing if it is overcome, according to experts. Concurrently if the RSI supports this upward climb, the bearish argument will be refuted & a similar development would make ETH retest the psychological threshold of $2,000 as well. As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,661. This represents an increase of 6% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 9% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nOver the course of the past 20 days, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, has moved about $12 million worth of cryptocurrency between his several wallets. According to the findings of LookOnChain\u2019s investigation, the \u201cwhale\u201d address that ends in 0x9e92 and has received 9,300 ETH in the past 20 days may be connected in some way to the person who created the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe recipient of the payments is most likely Vitalik, given the receiving address, which ends in \u201c0xd04d,\u201d has only received money from the wallet known as Vb3 so far, says LookOnChain.\n\nFollowing the completion of the transaction, the whale now possesses a total of 170,913 ETH, which has a value of around $265.3 million at press time. The history of the transaction does not indicate any activity that would lead us to believe that the whale is in fact connected to a certain exchange or operates as an unregulated counter.\n\nWhy is Vitalik Selling His Ethereum Holdings?\n\nThere does not seem to be any particular reason for Vitalik to be selling his crypto assets; but, in the past, we have seen that this has a negative influence on the price of Ethereum.\n\nThis is due to the fact that there are users, traders, and investors in crypto that follow him on social media and keep tabs on what he does. This action may cause a widespread pessimistic outlook, which, in turn, will have a negative impact on the price of Ether.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the second biggest cryptocurrency has been seeing some rather solid bullish movement, and at one point, it even managed to break over the $1,600 level. The coin has reached a resistance point of around $1,500 and is now trading at roughly $1,550 at the time of this publication.\n\nIn addition, the alternative coin\u2019s price has increased by more than 10% in the previous week, making it one of the assets that are now doing its best. On-chain signals indicate that the bulls have acquired a fractionally greater amount than the bears. We can only hope that this state of affairs persists and that Vitalik\u2019s activities have no impact on the token\u2019s value."

Cosmos, on the other hand, recorded 117 average daily developers.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana and Internet Computer (ICP) saw the most significant increase in active devs in 2022. Since the previous year, the two blockchain networks surged by 1,320% and 1,050%, respectively.\n\nThe report also stated that Solana looks promising despite being the most impacted in the FTX-induced drawdown.\n\nThe average number of daily active developers on the blockchain noted a decline of 31.4% over the past 30 days and continued to attract an average of 69 daily active developers."

With its 22 blockchain solution providers, the nation doesn\u2019t stand out even at the regional level.\n\nHowever, as the race to test and implement central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) accelerates every day, the Scandinavian nation is taking an active stance on its own national digital currency. In fact, it was among the first countries to begin the work on a CBDC back in 2016.\n\nDropping cash\n\nIn recent years, amid a rise in cashless payment methods and concern over cash-enabled illicit transactions, some Norwegian banks have moved to remove cash options altogether.\n\nIn 2016, Trond Bentestuen, then an executive at major Norwegian bank DNB, proposed to stop using cash as a means of payment in the country:\n\n\u201cToday, there is approximately 50 billion kroner in circulation and [the country\u2019s central bank] Norges Bank can only account for 40 percent of its use. That means that 60 percent of money usage is outside of any control.\u201d\n\nA year before that, another large Norwegian bank, Nordea, also refused to accept cash, leaving only one branch in Oslo Central Station to continue handling cash.\n\nThis sentiment came in parallel with Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm, as DNB enabled its customers to buy BTC via its mobile app, local courts demanded that convicted drug dealers pay their fines in crypto, and local newspapers widely discussed investments in digital assets.\n\nRecent: Bitcoin mining in a university dorm: A cooler BTC story\n\nLast year Torbj\u00f8rn H\u00e6geland, executive director for financial stability at Norway\u2019s central bank, Norges Bank, outlined to the project\u2019s goal of replacing cash use in the country:\n\n\"With this background, the decline in cash use and other structural changes in the payment system are key drivers for the project.\"\n\nThe experimental phase of the Norwegian CBDC will last until June 2023 and end with recommendations from the central bank on whether the implementation of a prototype is necessary.\n\nEthereum is the key\n\nIn September 2022, Norges Bank released the open-source code for the Ethereum-backed digital currency sandbox. Available on GitHub, the sandbox is designed to offer an interface for interacting with the test network, enabling functions like minting, burning and transferring ERC-20 tokens.\n\nHowever, the second part of the source code, announced to go public by mid-September, has yet to be revealed. As specified in a blog post, the initial use of open-source code was not a \u201csignal that the technology will be based on open-source code,\u201d but a \u201cgood starting point for learning as much as possible in collaboration with developers and alliance partners.\u201d\n\nNorges Bank in Oslo. Source: Reuters/Gwladys Fouche\n\nEarlier, the bank revealed its principal partner in building the infrastructure for the project \u2014 Nahmii, a Norway-based developer of a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum of the same name. The company has been working on this scaling technology for Ethereum for several years and has its own network and tokens. At this point, the test network for the Norwegian CBDC uses not the public Ethereum ecosystem, but a private version of the enterprise blockchain Hyperledger Besu.\n\nIn late 2022, Norway became part of Project Icebreaker, a joint exploration with the central banks of Israel, Norway and Sweden on how CBDCs can be used for cross-border payments. Within its framework, the three central banks will connect their domestic proof-of-concept CBDC systems. The final report for the project is scheduled for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nLocal specifics, universal problems\n\nIn terms of hopes and fears, what defines the Norwegian CBDC project among others is the national regulatory context. Like its geographical neighbors, Norway is known for its cautious approach to the digital assets market, with high taxes and the relatively small scale of its domestic crypto ecosystem \u2014 a recent study by EU Blockchain Observatory estimated its total equity funding at a modest $26.9 million.\n\nNorwegian serial entrepreneur Sander Andersen, who has recently moved his fintech company to Switzerland, doubts that the upcoming project will co-exist peacefully with the crypto industry. There are already more than enough problems for tech entrepreneurs in the country, he said in a chat with Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cDespite the country's strong infrastructure for entrepreneurs in other industries, such as low energy costs and free education, these benefits do not extend to the digital realm. The tax burden faced by digital companies makes it nearly impossible to compete with businesses based in more business-friendly jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nAs central bank digital currencies have the potential to compete with private cryptocurrencies, and the goal of any government is to control financial transactions as tightly as possible, Andersen doesn\u2019t see Norway among the exceptions:\n\n\u201cThe Norwegian central bank's CBDC project can also pose a threat to the legal status of private stablecoins in the country. The introduction of a CBDC may prompt increased regulation and oversight of private stablecoins, making it harder for these companies to operate.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin, a company contributing its contracts library to the Norges Bank project, doesn\u2019t sound so pessimistic. From a technical perspective, he emphasized, there is nothing stopping private stablecoins from trading and operating alongside CBDCs on both public and private Ethereum networks, especially if they use common, compatible token standards such as ERC-20.\n\nHowever, from a policy perspective, there\u2019s nothing that can stop central banks from performing financial gatekeeping and enforcing the Know Your Customer (KYC) standards, and this is where the CBDC looks like a natural development. Banks will not sit idly by as the blockchain ecosystem grows, as there is a lot of shadow-banking activity happening on-chain, Lewellen specified, adding:\n\n\u201cCBDCs offer central banks the ability to better perform gatekeeping and enforce KYC rules on CBDC holders, whereas enforcing the same standards against entities using non-governmental stablecoins is far more challenging.\u201d\n\nRecent: Ava Labs and Amazon\u2019s partnership could \u2018expand the pie\u2019 for blockchain\n\nCould Norway\u2019s CBDC offer anything reassuring in terms of users\u2019 privacy? It\u2019s hardly possible from both technological and strategic points of view, Lewellen said. Today, a mature solution doesn\u2019t exist that would allow privacy in a compliant manner regarding the use of CBDCs.\n\nAny national digital currency would almost certainly require every address to be linked to an identity, using KYC and other means we see in banks today. In fact, if done on the private ledger, like the one that Norges Bank is testing right now, the CBDC will offer not only less privacy for a single customer, but at the same time less public transparency with regard to blockchains."

        "title": "3 Reasons to Invest in Crypto in 2023 -- and 1 Reason Not To - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the last year has been rough for crypto.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 0.59%) and Ethereum (ETH 0.13%) are both down roughly 70% from their peaks, and Cardano and Solana have plummeted by around 90%. Those numbers are tough to stomach, and many investors have fled the crypto market in recent months.\n\nIf you're nervous about the market right now, you're not alone. But should you keep investing? There are three reasons to stick with crypto in 2023, and one reason you're better off avoiding it for now.\n\nWhy now could be a smart buying opportunity\n\n1. Prices are at rock bottom\n\nAt its peak, Bitcoin cost nearly $70,000 per token, and Ethereum was priced at close to $5,000 per token. Today, Bitcoin stands at just under $21,000, with Ethereum at roughly $1,500.\n\nIf you've been looking for a more affordable time to invest in crypto, you may not get a better chance than right now. The crypto market is essentially on clearance at the moment, and it's possible to load up on quality investments for a fraction of the price.\n\n2. The upswing could be lucrative\n\nOf course, nobody knows for certain whether the crypto market will recover. However, downturns like this aren't necessarily uncommon in this industry, and major cryptocurrencies have faced worse in the past.\n\nFor example, back in 2018, Ethereum's price fell by nearly 95% over the course of the year. If you had invested at its lowest point, you would have seen returns of nearly 4,500% over the following three years alone.\n\nAgain, it's unclear what the future holds for crypto, and we may not see another rally similar to the 2020-2021 surge. But even if cryptocurrencies don't reach their all-time highs again anytime soon, even a relatively small upswing could still be lucrative if you invest at rock-bottom prices.\n\n3. You might regret not investing\n\nCrypto is a speculative investment, so nobody -- even the experts -- knows how it will fare over the long term. While it could fail, it could also change the world.\n\nWhen you're deciding whether to invest, consider which of these options you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if crypto fails, or not investing and missing out on the investment of a lifetime if crypto succeeds.\n\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean you should go all-in and invest every dollar you have in crypto. As with any investment, it's important to buy wisely and only invest what you can afford. But for some people, it's worth risking a little money to avoid the regret of not taking this chance.\n\nWhy it may be best to avoid crypto\n\n1. You're a risk-averse investor\n\nFor all its potential, crypto also carries a significant amount of risk. At the moment, it's impossible to know whether crypto will succeed, and there's always a chance that you could lose whatever you invest. If money is tight, now may not be the best time to buy.\n\nAlso, this investment is notorious for its extreme volatility. Even in good times, it can experience nauseating ups and downs. Not all investors have the stomach for crypto, and that's OK. If you know you'd lose sleep over that level of volatility, you might be better off sticking to stocks for now.\n\nThe future of crypto is uncertain, and whether you choose to invest now will depend largely on your risk tolerance and personal preferences. But if a rebound is on the way, right now may be one of the best chances to buy."

        "content": "After leaving Ethereum, Hoskinson took a six months sabbatical. During this time, he contemplated returning to academia and perhaps rounding up his Ph.D.\n\nHowever, life had other plans for him. During his sabbatical, he was approached by Jeremy Wood, a former colleague at Ethereum.\n\nThe two men founded Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). The company was founded as an engineering and research company that built cryptocurrencies and blockchains. They initially put a few thousand dollars into the company and started getting crypto-building contracts.\n\nThe company got paid in Bitcoin, and the market soon entered a bull run. Within a short while, Hoskinson realized that IOHK was raking in unbelievable profits and could now build its own blockchain and still have enough left for administrative costs.\n\nIOHK sold part of its Bitcoin holdings and began work on building Cardano. Interestingly, while building Cardano, Hoskinson refused to seek venture capital.\n\nHoskinson later revealed that he believed seeking venture capital for Cardano would counter crypto\u2019s principles. He felt that venture capitalists would \u201cget their pound of flesh\u201d from the project before anyone else and thus ran contrary to crypto\u2019s principles of decentralization.\n\nIn recent times, Hoskinson has even been critical of his decision to oppose Buterin at Ethereum. He\u2019s admitted that he may have been wrong about what path Ethereum should follow, and the subsequent success of the community means that Buterin and the rest of his camp could have been correct.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Cardano grew at a dizzying rate. By 2017, IOHK, the parent company of Cardano, was rich enough to sponsor research labs at the University of Edinburgh and the Tokyo Institute of Technology. This research eventually led to the Ouroboros blockchain consensus protocol. Ouroboros would later be used as the basis of the Cardano blockchain platform.\n\nThe next year, Cardano announced a partnership with the Ethiopian government to discuss ways to deploy Cardano in the country.\n\nLike every other cryptocurrency, Cardano suffered during the 2018 bear market. The project only started recovering in 2021, and since then, it has managed to hit new highs before succumbing to the current bear market."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe jokes wrote themselves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice declared ominously that it would hold a live press conference at noon to announce an \"International Cryptocurrency Enforcement Action.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrypto Twitter panicked, and so did crypto prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum each fell nearly 5% in just a few minutes, amounting to a flash crash. Which big player was caught in the DOJ's crosshairs? Binance was a popular bet, and CZ didn't help matters by tweeting just \"4,\" which he announced on January 2 is his new signal for incoming \"FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.\"\n\nThen the press conference happened. It wasn't Binance. It wasn't Celsius, or Voyager, or Blockfi, or any other bankrupt crypto lender that screwed over its customers. It was a Hong Kong-based, Russian-owned crypto exchange called Bitzlato.\n\nBitz-what? Bitzlatte? I've been writing about crypto since 2011, and never heard of it.\n\nBitzlato has like 1,400 followers and hasn't tweeted in almost a year pic.twitter.com/VMNqVMSo5x \u2014 Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) January 18, 2023\n\nBitzlato, the DOJ said, processed more than $700 million in illicit funds, including millions in proceeds from ransomware.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOkay. But as of January 18, Bitzlato customer wallets had... $11,000 in them, according to a Coinbase operations director. At Bitzlato's peak, customer wallets held $6 million\u2014a trifle. And yet DOJ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco touted the enforcement action as \"a significant blow to the cryptocrime ecosystem.\" She said Bitzlato, \"fueled a high-tech axis of cryptocrime.\"\n\nThe crypto market quickly rebounded.\n\nI could embed a bunch more of the best memes on this, but let's move on to the Why, and the What This Means.\n\nThe DOJ is attempting to flex.\n\nPeople in crypto laughed at it, but those outside crypto probably didn't. The U.S. government wants to make crystal clear\u2014especially after the massively scrutinized collapse of FTX\u2014that it is aware of CRYPTO CRIME (!) and is taking decisive action.\n\nThe DOJ has reportedly been investigating Binance since 2018, and according to Reuters is split over whether to bring charges. It's been rumored that the DOJ is also investigating Digital Currency Group, owner of crypto lender Genesis, which filed for bankruptcy this week.\n\nAnd the DOJ isn't alone: the SEC charged both Genesis and Gemini at once last week for violating securities laws.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview on our gm podcast last month, was reluctant to say outright that the FTX meltdown will lead directly to more crypto regulation. But it's clear that at the very least it has already led to more posturing. And Peirce did say she hopes it won't lead her peers to overreact with hasty restrictions.\n\n\u201cI think we should all be on the lookout for regulatory frameworks that are developed in the context of enforcement action, because it\u2019s a very tempting thing for regulators to do that,\u201d Peirce said. \u201cAnd it just cuts everybody else out of the process.\u201d\n\nI frequently say that people in crypto have an irrational fear of the very word \"regulation.\" They presume regulating crypto means shutting it down entirely, when regulation could simply mean\u2014in an ideal scenario for all\u2014creating new safeguards for retail investors.\n\nThat said, what Sam Bankman-Fried hath wrought is a new climate in which regulators and politicians are feeling more pressured than ever before to show they're serious about ridding crypto of the bad actors. And that could lead to overreach. We already saw it last year with Tornado Cash.\n\nThe next big hyped enforcement action may not be against some small-time player."

        "title": "What is a DAO & How Does it Work? - Coin Culture",
        "content": "Since its beginnings, blockchain technology has significantly developed and revolutionised numerous industries, including the financial and creative sectors. Alongside the widespread adoption of DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs, other blockchain technologies, particularly Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), are gaining popularity in the digital arena. However, what a DAO is, how it works, and what the top DAO projects are in 2023. Keep reading to figure it out!\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nOne of the common challenges in the digital world is how to organise people around the world who don\u2019t personally know each other, establish rules and enforce them. For now, DAO is available to solve the challenge.\n\nSo, what does DAO mean? Wikipedia defines a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) as an organisation represented by rules encoded as a computer program. These rules are transparent as they are member-controlled instead of single-control authority.\n\nA DAO\u2019s financial transactions records and programs are maintained on a blockchain. It provides a safe way for internet strangers to collaborate and a platform to commit funds for various causes.\n\nDAOs are more like internet-based businesses without a single control organ. The members collectively own and manage the business. It has in-built treasuries that can only be accessed with the members\u2019 authorisation. All the decisions in the organisation are made through member proposals and voting.\n\nWhat makes DAO different?\n\nDAO is becoming a popular organisational strategy due to its unique approach to finances and operations. The recording of the DAO\u2019s financial transactions and rules on the blockchain leads to transparency.\n\nDue to smart contracts, DAO eliminates the need for a third party in financial transactions. The DAO draws its firmness from smart contracts. Therefore, it is right to find out what DAO Ethereum is. Ethereum provides a platform for developing and deploying smart contracts that govern the DAOs.\n\nThe smart contracts contain all the organisation\u2019s guidelines and storage. Given the decentralisation of blockchains, no one can edit the smart contracts without the other members\u2019 consent. Transparency eliminates the need for legal status backing like other traditional firms.\n\nCompared to traditional companies, DAO has democratised organisations. Instead of letting a few individuals make decisions on behalf of the company, DAO allows every member to vote to adopt proposals. The funding for most of the DAOs is through crowdfunding. Also, all the DAO activities are transparent and fully public. This is different from the traditional organisations, whose operations are predominantly private and with limited public access.\n\nSo far, DAOs are being used for many purposes, such as investment, charity, fundraising, borrowing, or buying NFTs, all without intermediaries. A DAO can accept donations from anyone around the world, and the members can decide how to spend donations.\n\nHow DAO works\n\nAs stated previously, a DAO is an organisation in which decisions are made from the bottom up; a group of members collectively owns the organisation. There are numerous ways to engage in a DAO, the most common of which is token ownership.\n\nDAOs operate via smart contracts distributed on various blockchains and Ethereum was the first blockchain to employ them. Those with a stake in a DAO are then granted voting rights and can affect the organisation\u2019s operations by rejecting or proposing new governance proposals.\n\nThis strategy prohibits spamming DAOs with proposals; a proposal will only pass if most stakeholders support it. The smart contracts specify how this majority is chosen for each DAO.\n\nFor a DAO to launch, it must undergo various sustainability phases. Here is the process of creating a functional DAO.\n\nThe smart contract setup \u2013 the first step in creating a DAO is to develop a set of rules governing the organisation. These rules are encrypted on the smart contracts and used for all operations. They determine the DAO\u2019s workflow, finances, and governance system. The smart contract rules will only change through member proposals and voting.\n\nFunding \u2013 once the smart contract is in place, the DAO needs funding to start operating. The DAO smart contract details the funding through the creation of a native token. This token operates like any other crypto and can be used for voting rights and incentives. Anytime you interact with what is a DAO crypto, you are referring to the native token of the given organisation.\n\nDeployment \u2013 with the rules and funds in place, the last step is the DAO deployment. The organisation operates within the rules set by the smart contract.\n\nWhy do we need DAOs?\n\nTo trust the individuals you want to collaborate with to start a business is challenging, especially with someone you\u2019ve only ever communicated with online. For DAOs, the only thing you need to trust is the DAO\u2019s code, which is open and verifiable by anybody. This can pave the way for many new kinds of cooperation and coordination globally.\n\nDAO A traditional organisation Often flat, and entirely democratised. Often hierarchical. Members need to approve any modifications before they go into effect. The structure determines whether a single party is given the option to make changes or whether voting is required. Votes are tallied, and the result is implemented without a trusted middleman. If voting is permitted, votes are tallied internally, and voting results must be handled manually. Services are handled automatically in a decentralised manner (e.g. distribution of charity funds). Requires human intervention or centralised automation and is susceptible to manipulation. All activity is publicly available and transparent. Activity is private and limited to the public.\n\nBelow are some examples of how you can use a DAO:\n\nA charity: You can take donations from everyone worldwide and vote on which causes to finance through a charity.\n\nCollective ownership: Members can vote on how to use physical or digital assets acquired through collective ownership.\n\nVentures and grants: You can build a venture fund that pools investment cash and votes on which firms to support. Later, repaid funds could be divided among DAO members.\n\nBest DAO crypto projects 2023\n\nRobotEra \u2013 Overall Best DAO Project in 2023\n\nRobotEra, a metaverse-based ecosystem that intends to be a Sandbox-like metaverse gaming project, is our top-recommended best DAO project in 2023. RobotEra uses TARO as its native token, and the ERC-20 token grants investors access to the RobotEra DAO and other metaverse resources.\n\nRobot NFTs are the 3D in-game avatars of users on the \u2018Taro Planet\u2019 \u2013 the virtual metaverse world of RobotEra. With NFTs, players can purchase Land on seven continents inside the Taro Planet.\n\nAccording to the RobotEra whitepaper, the platform will ultimately deploy its DAO, which can be accessible by staking TARO tokens. The DAO will offer the ability to vote and make decisions on numerous aspects of the Taro Planet. Since Robots in the game are separated into diverse factions, DAO members can vote on and propose implementation tactics for their own factions.\n\nBattle Infinity \u2013 Overall Best Crypto DAO Project\n\nBattle Infinity intends to merge Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming with Web 3.0 technology by establishing a metaverse-based game (Battle Arena). It provides users with a decentralised platform that gives them access to a virtual game ecosystem where they can play, earn, and create products.\n\nThe IBAT token serves as the platform\u2019s utility token. IBAT tokens are generated on the Binance Smart Chain and are preparing for a mainnet deployment in phase 3 of the platform\u2019s roadmap. To participate in the Battle Stake, users must stake IBAT, with the possibility to earn, build, and generate NFTs that can be turned into IBAT awards.\n\nMakerDAO \u2013 Top DAO Project Built on Ethereum\n\nMakerDAO is a peer-to-peer decentralised autonomous organisation established on the Ethereum blockchain that enables individuals to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. As with any other DeFi protocol, the borrowing and lending procedure on this platform is governed by smart contracts.\n\nDue to the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies, MakerDAO employs Dai, a stablecoin, to establish lending rates and repayment amounts. MakerDAO is a cryptocurrency lending credit facility that grants loans at predetermined interest rates. If a MakerDAO user wants to borrow a specified quantity of cryptocurrency, they must first deposit Ethereum into a Maker smart contract.\n\nFuture application-specific decentralised financial protocols will rely heavily on the Maker Protocol and Dai stablecoin as the foundational infrastructure layer.\n\nTamadoge \u2013 Upcoming Meme Token DAO project\n\nTamadoge, the native cryptocurrency of the Tamaverse, is a project launched amid massive hype as the latest Doge-themed meme coin with significant potential. Tamadoge provides a multi-utility token and play-to-earn (P2E) platform on the blockchain, whereas Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies gained popularity owing to the social media support of notable celebrities.\n\nOn this P2E platform, players compete for possible earnings from a prize pool, which are awarded as TAMA tokens. Tamadoge pets are supposed to be created, bred, and traded by users. Each pet is issued as a non-fungible token (NFT) via smart contracts and possesses unique qualities, strengths, and limitations. The objective is to make these Doge pets competitive to gain points on the leaderboard each month.\n\nDash \u2013 Innovative \u2018Privacy Coin\u2019 Set for a Rebound\n\nDash is one of the top utility tokens for privacy and anonymity. Dash began as a fork of Litecoin and has since become a popular digital currency among those who value privacy about their personal information and transaction history. Over the past few years, businesses and online retailers have increasingly adopted Dash, which is now accepted at over 155,000 locations.\n\nDash functions similarly to Bitcoin, except that its InstantSend feature allows transactions to be completed in less than two seconds. In addition, Dash employs a valuable method that mixes transactions with others, making it nearly impossible to identify a specific transaction to a particular wallet.\n\nWhile the project is a DAO insofar as all decisions are made collectively via a subset of master nodes, the degree to which the Dash network is decentralised remains debatable because the network\u2019s governance tokens were distributed in a manner that concentrated wealth among a small group of stakeholders, granting them disproportionate voting power over the project.\n\nUniswap \u2013 Leading DeFi Protocol with $5.5B in TVL\n\nUniswap is a decentralised exchange (DEX) established on the Ethereum network that facilitates the easy exchange of ERC-20 tokens. This is the Ethereum token standard and contains some of the top altcoins, like Chainlink and Shiba Inu. Since the exchange is decentralised, an intermediary is unnecessary to facilitate transactions.\n\nUniswap employs liquidity pools, which eliminate the typical order book. Anyone can deposit unused ERC-20 tokens into Uniswap\u2019s liquidity pools in exchange for a yield. Depending on the token, returns can be significantly higher than those granted by conventional savings accounts.\n\nDue to its widespread adoption, Uniswap has become one of the most popular DeFi protocols worldwide. Numerous investors purchase UNI, the protocol\u2019s native token, to gain exposure to its growth.\n\nConsequently, Uniswap keeps the second position on our DAO crypto ranking list.\n\nOlympusDAO \u2013 DAO Project for Stablecoins\u2019 Liquidity\n\nThe objective of the OlympusDAO project was to create a new decentralised infrastructure for finance, which would be community-driven. At its core, OlympusDAO provided a solution to one of the most vexing issues in DeFi: the provision of sustainable liquidity for native tokens.\n\nInstead of renting liquidity through token payouts, Olympus acquires it through its bonding mechanism. The mechanism provides a discount on the project\u2019s OHM token in return for tokens, such as liquidity provider tokens (e.g. ones that represent deposits in OHM-DAI pool).\n\nIn addition, Olympus gave rise to the famed 3,3 meme, a slang for game-theoretic cooperation. This means the option to stake OHM tokens to get the six-digit APY offered at the project\u2019s inception. When new bonds are issued, the protocol mints new OHM tokens, and the bulk of these tokens are distributed to stakers.\n\nFAQs about DAOs\n\nWhat is the purpose of a DAO?\n\nA DAO\u2019s purpose is to improve several organisations\u2019 traditional management structures. A DAO attempts to provide every member with a voice, a vote, and the ability to suggest initiatives, as opposed to relying on a single individual or a small group of individuals to guide the organisation\u2019s direction. A DAO also aspires to have governance by blockchain-based code.\n\nWhat is an NFT DAO?\n\nNFT DAOs are decentralised autonomous organisations that use NFTs as a membership and governance token in addition to a shared DAO treasury. By doing so, NFT initiatives can set up a formal structure that gives holders collective control over the project\u2019s development. In laying the groundwork for collaborative, decentralised, and economically beneficial construction, NFT DAOs embody some of web3\u2019s defining characteristics.\n\nWhat is Lido DAO (LDO)?\n\nFor Ethereum 2.0 and other proof of stake (POS) blockchains like Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Lido is a decentralised autonomous organisation that offers a liquid staking service. Lido DAO token holders can stake them and reap profits without locking or managing the staking infrastructure. Also, they can stake Ethereum without making any initial investments or worrying about the upkeep of any underlying infrastructure; hence, joining on-chain operations like compound returns and lending.\n\nHow to create DAO on Ethereum?\n\nThere are a number of DAO startup templates and tools available to help startups save time and effort in developing their systems, or they can choose to develop their systems from scratch. Popular choices for the Ethereum blockchain include Aragon and Snapshot. Also, to make DAOs on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, you can use a program called DAOstack Alchemy (formerly known as xDAI). If you want your DAO\u2019s tokens, crowdfunding, and treasury tasks to go well, you\u2019ll need to get the DAO treasury tools working properly after you set them up.\n\nHow does a DAO make money?\n\nTypically, a DAO will exchange fiat currency for its token as its initial funding mechanism. A member\u2019s share of voting power and ownership is reflected in the value of this native token. If a DAO is successful, there will be a rise in the price of the tokens used within it.\n\nTokens issued in the future by the DAO can be sold for higher prices. The members of a DAO have the power to authorise the organisation to make investments. Buying up businesses, NFTs, or other tokens is only one example of what a DAO can do with its funds. If the value of those assets goes up, so does the value of the DAO.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe goal of DAOs is to create a collective organisation in which all members have an equal say in the running of the business. Many experts and insiders in the field agree that this form of organisation is gaining popularity and may even displace certain more conventional businesses.\n\nCurrent trends can influence how customers connect with a company or brand. Thus, companies and brands need to keep tabs on these developments. While DAOs\u2019 adoption isn\u2019t widespread now, they\u2019re gaining popularity amongst many developers and creators."
