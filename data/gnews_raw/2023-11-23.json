        "title": "Cardano vs Ethereum: The Ultimate Comparison - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Cardano vs Ethereum are two leading blockchain platforms that have gained significant attention in the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized applications (dApps). These platforms have revolutionized the way we use apps, with Bitcoin being the most popular cryptocurrency. As the creation and development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology continue to reshape various industries, many investors and developers find themselves comparing Cardano and Ethereum, two popular decentralized application platforms, to determine which platform is better suited for their needs in the world of bitcoin.\n\nUnderstanding the differences and similarities between Cardano and Ethereum, two popular cryptocurrencies, is crucial for making informed decisions about investment opportunities, application development, and utilizing the power of blockchain technology. Whether you are interested in investing in bitcoin or exploring other cryptocurrencies, taking the time to understand these key players in the market is essential. Both software platforms offer a series of services and applications, but their underlying philosophies, mechanisms, and design vary significantly. When considering time and investment choices, it is important to understand these differences.\n\nBy delving into these aspects, such as the ethereum foundation, software, philosophy, and pow, we aim to provide you with valuable insights that will help you navigate the world of blockchain investments effectively.\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: A Comparison\n\nWhen comparing Cardano and Ethereum in terms of their work blockchain and blockchain network, there are several key points to consider. Both platforms utilize software to power their respective networks. Let\u2019s explore the main differences between these two cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Blockchain, in terms of technology, governance, and scalability, and understand how these variances impact their respective ecosystems.\n\nTechnology\n\nCardano, with its scientific approach to blockchain development, is well-regarded in the field of eth. It utilizes a layered architecture that separates the settlement chain layer from the computational chain layer. This design allows for greater flexibility and security within the chain platform. On the other hand, Ethereum follows a single-layer chain architecture where both settlement and computation occur on the same layer.\n\nCardano employs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which aims to be more energy-efficient compared to Ethereum\u2018s current proof-of-work system. The implementation of Ouroboros ensures that transactions on the Cardano blockchain are validated by participants who hold a stake in the network.\n\nGovernance\n\nIn terms of governance, Cardano takes a more decentralized approach compared to Ethereum. It emphasizes community involvement through its unique voting system. Stakeholders can participate in decision-making processes by submitting proposals and voting on important protocol upgrades or changes.\n\nEthereum has traditionally relied on a more centralized governance model with decisions made by core developers and foundation members. However, there have been recent efforts within the Ethereum community to transition towards a more decentralized governance structure through initiatives like Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nScalability\n\nScalability has been a significant challenge for both Cardano and Ethereum due to their increasing popularity and usage. However, they employ different strategies to address this issue.\n\nCardano aims to achieve scalability through its use of sidechains or \u201chydra heads.\u201d These sidechains allow for parallel processing of transactions while maintaining interoperability with the main Cardano blockchain. This approach enables higher transaction throughput without compromising security and decentralization.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is undergoing a major upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2, which aims to improve scalability through the implementation of a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (PoS). This upgrade will also introduce shard chains, allowing for increased transaction processing capacity.\n\nHow Ethereum Differs from Cardano\n\nEarly Mover Advantage\n\nEthereum, being one of the earliest blockchain platforms, has a significant advantage in terms of its position and influence in the industry. It was launched back in 2015 and quickly gained popularity among developers and users alike. Its early adoption allowed it to establish a strong network effect, attracting a large community and fostering the development of numerous decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano is a relatively newer player in the blockchain space. Launched in 2017 by IOHK, it aims to provide a more secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications. While Cardano may lack Ethereum\u2018s first-mover advantage, it compensates with its rigorous academic approach and commitment to scientific research.\n\n.\n\nDevelopment Processes: Decentralized vs Centralized\n\nAnother distinguishing factor between Ethereum and Cardano is their development processes. Ethereum\u2019s development is driven by its creator, Vitalik Buterin, along with an open-source community of developers worldwide. Updates or changes to Ethereum\u2018s protocol require a consensus among the community, which can sometimes lead to delays or disagreements.\n\nIn contrast, Cardano takes a more structured and methodical approach to development. It follows a peer-reviewed research process, where proposals are thoroughly examined and validated by experts before implementation. This rigorous approach ensures that changes made to Cardano\u2019s protocol are well-vetted and scientifically grounded.\n\nCardano is divided into different layers: the settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL). This separation allows for greater flexibility and modularity in development, enabling easier upgrades without disrupting the entire network.\n\nKey Similarities between Cardano and Ethereum\n\nShared Goals: Decentralization, Security, and Smart Contract Functionality\n\nCardano and Ethereum may have their differences, but they also share some common goals. One of these shared objectives is decentralization. Both platforms aim to create a decentralized ecosystem where power is distributed among the network participants rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few entities. By achieving decentralization, they strive to eliminate single points of failure and enhance the security and resilience of their networks.\n\nAnother similarity between Cardano and Ethereum lies in their focus on security. Both platforms recognize the critical importance of ensuring the safety of user funds and protecting against potential vulnerabilities or attacks. They employ various measures such as rigorous code audits, bug bounties, and regular upgrades to address security issues promptly.\n\nFurthermore, both Cardano and Ethereum offer smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions that automatically execute when those conditions are met. This feature enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of these platforms, opening up a world of possibilities for innovative solutions across various industries.\n\nCommitment to Fostering Innovation through Developer Communities\n\nBoth Cardano and Ethereum understand the significance of developer communities in driving innovation within their ecosystems. They actively encourage developers to contribute by providing tools, resources, and support for building on their respective platforms.\n\nEthereum has established itself as a pioneer in this regard with its vast developer community. It offers an extensive set of development tools like Solidity (a programming language), Remix IDE (an integrated development environment), and Truffle Suite (a development framework). These tools empower developers to create smart contracts and dApps efficiently.\n\nSimilarly, Cardano places great emphasis on fostering its own developer community through initiatives like Project Catalyst. This program allows developers to submit proposals for funding projects that will contribute to the growth of the Cardano ecosystem. By involving developers directly in decision-making processes, Cardano aims to create a collaborative environment that encourages innovation and drives the platform forward.\n\nImportance of Interoperability for Both Ecosystems\n\nInteroperability is a crucial aspect for both Cardano and Ethereum. It refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other seamlessly. Achieving interoperability allows for the exchange of assets, data, and services across multiple platforms, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nCardano recognizes this importance and has been working on its own interoperability solution called \u201cHydra.\u201d This technology aims to enable seamless communication between different blockchains while maintaining security and scalability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has made significant progress in achieving interoperability through projects like Polkadot and Cosmos. These initiatives focus on creating bridges between various blockchains, facilitating cross-chain transactions and data transfers.\n\nAdvantages of Cardano\n\nAcademic Research and Scientific Rigor\n\nCardano sets itself apart by placing a strong emphasis on academic research and scientific rigor throughout its development process. This means that the team behind Cardano is committed to conducting thorough research, analyzing data, and implementing evidence-based solutions. By taking this approach, Cardano aims to ensure that its platform is built on solid foundations, making it more reliable and secure.\n\nOuroboros: Enhanced Security and Scalability\n\nOne of the key advantages of Cardano is its unique proof-of-stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Unlike other blockchain networks that rely on energy-intensive mining processes, Cardano uses a more efficient consensus mechanism. Ouroboros allows users to participate in the network\u2019s security and validation process based on the number of coins they hold. This not only reduces energy consumption but also enhances the overall security and scalability of the network.\n\nWith Ouroboros, Cardano achieves a high level of decentralization by ensuring that no single entity has control over the majority of the network\u2019s resources. This helps prevent malicious attacks and makes it more difficult for any individual or group to manipulate the system for their own gain.\n\nMulti-Layered Architecture for Seamless Upgrades\n\nCardano\u2019s multi-layered architecture is designed with future upgrades in mind. The platform consists of two main layers: the settlement layer and the computation layer. The settlement layer handles transactions and ensures secure value transfer, while the computation layer enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to run on top of Cardano.\n\nThis modular design allows for seamless upgrades without disrupting existing functionalities or compromising security. It enables developers to introduce new features or improvements to specific layers without affecting the entire ecosystem. As a result, Cardano can adapt to changing needs and technological advancements while maintaining stability.\n\nBy embracing a multi-layered architecture, Cardano provides flexibility for developers who want to build and deploy their own dApps on the platform. This opens up a world of possibilities for innovation and collaboration within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nDisadvantages of Cardano\n\nSlower Pace of Development\n\nCardano, while a promising blockchain project, has faced criticism for its relatively slower pace of development compared to other platforms like Ethereum. Some users and investors have expressed concerns that the team behind Cardano may not be able to deliver updates and improvements at the same speed as their competitors. This could potentially impact the platform\u2019s ability to keep up with the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nChallenges for New Projects\n\nAnother potential disadvantage of Cardano is the challenges faced by new projects seeking to build on top of its infrastructure. As Cardano is still evolving and developing, there may be limitations or uncertainties in terms of compatibility and stability. This can make it more difficult for developers to create and launch their own decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform.\n\nFurthermore, due to its relatively smaller user base compared to more established platforms like Ethereum, new projects building on Cardano may struggle to gain traction and attract users. Network effects play a significant role in the success of blockchain platforms, and lower adoption rates could limit the growth potential for projects built on Cardano.\n\nLower Adoption Rates\n\nWhile Cardano has made significant strides in establishing itself as a reputable blockchain platform, it still lags behind Ethereum in terms of adoption rates. Ethereum has a larger community of developers, users, and projects already built on its network. This wider adoption provides a network effect that attracts more participants and increases liquidity within the ecosystem.\n\nThe lower adoption rates for Cardano can result in limited opportunities for collaboration between different projects within its ecosystem. It may take longer for developers to access necessary resources or find support from an active community when troubleshooting issues or seeking guidance.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nExtensive Ecosystem of dApps\n\nEthereum has established itself as a leading blockchain platform, thanks to its extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). These dApps cover various sectors such as finance, gaming, and supply chain management. With Ethereum\u2018s smart contract functionality, developers can create innovative and autonomous applications that run on the blockchain.\n\nStrong Community Support\n\nOne key factor contributing to Ethereum\u2018s success is its strong community support. The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the development and promotion of the platform, has played a crucial role in fostering this support. The foundation provides grants for research and development projects, which encourages innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the active and passionate community surrounding Ethereum has contributed significantly to its growth over the years. Developers from around the world collaborate on GitHub repositories, share ideas on forums like Reddit and Discord, and organize conferences such as Devcon to discuss advancements in blockchain technology. This vibrant community ensures that Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nScalability Solutions\n\nScalability has been an ongoing challenge for many blockchain networks, including Ethereum. However, several solutions are being implemented to address this issue. Layer 2 protocols like Plasma and state channels allow for off-chain transactions while ensuring security through periodic validation on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum 2.0 is a major upgrade currently underway that aims to enhance scalability by transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This upgrade will introduce shard chains that can process transactions in parallel, significantly increasing network capacity.\n\nPioneering Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum has paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), revolutionizing traditional financial systems by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. DeFi applications built on top of Ethereum offer various services like lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoins.\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, Ether (ETH), plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem. It serves as collateral for loans, facilitates liquidity on DEXs, and powers decentralized applications. The rise of DeFi has attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors, further fueling Ethereum\u2018s growth.\n\nMover Advantage\n\nBeing one of the first blockchain platforms to gain widespread adoption, Ethereum has a significant mover advantage over its competitors. Its established network effect, developer community, and extensive dApp ecosystem make it an attractive choice for businesses and developers looking to build on the blockchain.\n\nWhile other blockchains like Cardano offer promising features and advancements, Ethereum\u2018s head start gives it an edge in terms of adoption and infrastructure development. However, competition within the blockchain space is fierce, with new platforms emerging regularly. Therefore, Ethereum must continue to innovate and evolve to maintain its position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum\n\nScalability Limitations\n\nOne major concern with Ethereum is its current scalability limitations. As the network has grown in popularity, it has experienced issues such as high gas fees and network congestion. Gas fees are transaction fees paid by users to execute smart contracts or transfer tokens on the Ethereum network. The increasing demand for transactions has led to a surge in gas fees, making it costly for users to interact with the platform.\n\nSecurity Risks with Smart Contracts\n\nAnother potential disadvantage of Ethereum lies in the security risks associated with smart contracts. While smart contracts offer decentralized and automated execution of agreements, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. One notorious example is the infamous DAO attack in 2016, where an exploit allowed hackers to drain millions of dollars from a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on top of Ethereum. This incident highlighted the need for thorough auditing and testing of smart contracts before they are deployed on the blockchain.\n\nChallenges for Developers\n\nDevelopers working with Ethereum often face challenges due to frequent updates and changes in the protocol. As Ethereum evolves, new versions are released that may introduce breaking changes or require developers to modify their applications accordingly. These updates can be time-consuming and may disrupt ongoing projects or require additional resources for maintenance and adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, developing on Ethereum requires learning Solidity, a programming language specific to writing smart contracts on the platform. This creates a barrier for developers who are already proficient in other languages but need to invest time and effort into acquiring Solidity skills.\n\nAccount Fees\n\nWhile account fees were not mentioned as an explicit talking point, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum does have costs associated with creating and managing user accounts. When users want to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) or perform transactions on Ethereum, they need to create an account through which they can access these services. However, creating an account requires paying a small fee known as \u201cgas\u201d which covers the computational resources needed to create and maintain the account.\n\nAlthough these fees are generally low, they can still be a barrier for users with limited financial means or those who frequently interact with the network. This aspect should be taken into consideration when evaluating Ethereum\u2018s usability and accessibility.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, after comparing Cardano and Ethereum, it\u2019s clear that both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses. Cardano offers a more secure and scalable blockchain with its unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Ethereum has the advantage of being the first-mover in the smart contract space and enjoys widespread adoption.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Cardano and Ethereum depends on your specific needs and priorities. If you value security and scalability, Cardano may be the better option for you. On the other hand, if you prioritize network effects and a robust ecosystem, Ethereum might be the way to go.\n\nRegardless of which platform you choose, it\u2019s important to stay informed about the latest developments and advancements in this rapidly evolving industry. Keep an eye on both Cardano and Ethereum as they continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with blockchain technology.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Cardano?\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications (dApps).

        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s time to shine may be here - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "ETH may hit $2,100 if buying pressure continues.\n\nMany transactions ended in profit in the last 24 hours.\n\nUnlike other altcoins, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price action failed to break out for a while. During that time, as recently as the 18th of November, ETH was swinging between $1,915 and $2,000. But in a swift move on the 22nd of November, the coin tapped $,2,083.\n\nHowever, technical indications revealed that ETH could be ready for more upside. JA Maartunn, an author at CryptoQuant, looked at ETH\u2019s price action and observed that there has been some Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) buying in the derivative market.\n\nSomeone(s) are TWAP-buying on Ethereum futures This linear growth in open interest indicates systematic buying over a certain period. There is $700 million added so far. pic.twitter.com/GCXK8u5yLL \u2014 Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) November 22, 2023\n\nLittle by little, ETH moons\n\nFrom the post above, Maartunn noted that over $700 million had entered the Ethereum market through TWAP. The TWAP strategy is used to minimize the impact of a large order on a cryptocurrency\u2019s value.\n\nSo, to reduce the impact, the order is broken down into smaller quantities. So, it is likely that some buy orders played a part in ETH\u2019s resurgence.\n\nAnother indicator AMBCrypto considered while assessing ETH\u2019s potential is the Open Interest. The Open Interest shows the number of outstanding futures contracts at the end of a trading day.\n\nAccording to data derived by AMBCrypto via Coinglass, ETH\u2019s Open Interest had increased. When this indicator increases at a time when the price is also increasing, it means there is a strong case for a further hike.\n\nMore gains on the way for holders?\n\nShould Open Interest resist a decline, ETH could be on its way to reclaiming $2,100. In the interim, holders of the altcoin seem satisfied with its recent performance.\n\nThis was shown by the daily on-chain transaction in profit, and compared with those in the red.\n\nAt the time of writing, the daily on-chain transaction volume in profit on the Ethereum network was 602,000. Those transactions in losses were 322,000.\n\nThis difference is a sign that most market players have received gains.\n\nThe Exponential Moving Average (EMA) backed the notion that ETH\u2019s upward momentum was alive. At press time, the 20 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 50 EMA (yellow). This crossover indicates that the trend is bullish.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nSo, traders may be looking to long/buy Ethereum for the intermediate term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supported the bullish bias. This was because the MACD had a positive value of 6.74.\n\nThis value can be used to signal an increasing upward moment. Therefore, traders looking to short ETH should take a break or watch the price action till the movement changes."

        "content": "Ethereum price recovered all losses and climbed above $2,050. ETH outperformed Bitcoin and might aim for more gains above the $2,120 resistance.\n\nEthereum remained strong above $1,930 and started a fresh increase above $2,000.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair is up over 5% and the bulls could aim for more upsides above $2,100.\n\nEthereum Price Turns Green\n\nEthereum price remained well-bid above the $1,930 support after a steady decline post report of Binance settlement. ETH formed a base and started a strong increase above the $2,000 resistance.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair gained strength and climbed above the $2,020 resistance. It gained over 5% and outperformed Bitcoin. Finally, it tested the $2,100 zone.\n\nA high is formed near $2,092 and Ethereum is now consolidating gains. It is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,930 swing low to the $2,092 high.\n\nIt is well above $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,080 zone. The first key resistance is near the $2,120 level. A clear move above the $2,120 level could spark another strong increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance is near $2,200, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,250 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,320 level.\n\nAnother Downside Correction in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,120 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,050 level. The next key support is $2,000 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,930 swing low to the $2,092 high.\n\nThe main support is now near $1,980. A downside break below the $1,980 support might trigger more losses. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,920 support zone in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,000\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,120\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It is here, the analyst explains, that nearly 1.7 million wallets had grabbed a staggering 38.7 million Ethereum worth $81,492,525,000 at the time of this writing. Martinez used a chart provided by IntoTheBlock.\n\nNow that Ethereum has massive support beneath it and little resistance to go through ahead of it, if ETH succeeds in holding in the area where it is now, this could \"pave the way for ETH to reach new yearly highs,\" Martinez expects.\n\n#Ethereum overcame a key resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044. Here, 1.67 million wallets acquired 38.7 million $ETH.\n\n\n\nWith minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this demand area could pave the way for #ETH to reach new yearly highs. pic.twitter.com/mrSKls9N4M \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) November 24, 2023\n\nEthereum jumps by 10% within two days\n\nOver the past two days, ETH has made an astonishing jump of slightly over 10% from $1,933 to the local high of $2,127. This astounding increase was mostly due to Ethereum's price surge between Wednesday and Thursday, when it added 8.08% to its value and reached the $2,088 price tag.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the second biggest crypto is changing hands at $2,106 after a tiny decline.\n\nThis price spike of Ethereum basically followed the growth of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which suddenly jumped by more than 8% within the same period of two days. BTC is now trading at $37,909 after topping the $38,000 level earlier today.\n\nBitcoin surged on the news of a successful election of a pro-Bitcoin president in Argentina, far-right libertarian Javier Milei."

        "content": "Movement Labs announces M2, the first Move VM-based L2 for Ethereum.\n\nM2 incorporates Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\nM2 promises over 145k transactions per second, boosting Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nAs the Ethereum network grapples with scalability challenges, its ecosystem actively seeks and implements innovative solutions. This rich and vibrant ecosystem of projects and developers gives Ethereum the edge over other networks.\n\nMost recently, Movement Labs announced M2, the first Move Virtual Machine (VM)-based Layer Two (L2) solution for Ethereum. The solution offers enhanced performance, security, and scalability for the network.\n\nMovement Labs\u2019 M2 Addresses Ethereum Scalability\n\nOn Tuesday, November 22, in a significant development for the Ethereum network, Movement Labs announced the launch of M2. The technology is the first Move Virtual Machine (VM) Layer Two (L2) solution, integrated with Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\nThis announcement marks a notable stride in addressing the longstanding scalability issues faced by Ethereum. Known for its diverse range of applications, Ethereum has often grappled with high transaction costs and slower processing times, presenting challenges to its scalability and efficiency.\n\nM2 promises a transformative solution to these challenges. It is engineered to enhance Ethereum\u2019s transaction capacity substantially, with the capability of theoretically processing over 145,000 transactions per second. This efficiency is set to mitigate network congestion, high transaction fees, and slow processing times.\n\nThe core innovation of M2 lies in its integration of the Move VM, known for its robust security features. Moreover, the Move VM fosters a developer-friendly environment and Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\nThe influence of M2 extends beyond the Ethereum network. Movement Labs aims to foster a more interconnected blockchain environment by integrating with various blockchain networks and virtual machines. This effort enhances liquidity and accessibility across the broader blockchain spectrum.\n\nWhat Sets Move VM in M2 Apart\n\nM2\u2019s integration of the Move Virtual Machine (VM) introduces advanced technical features tailored for enhanced smart contract functionality. Unlike traditional smart contract environments, the Move VM offers a unique resource model that treats assets as singular and uncopyable, reducing the risks of double-spending and accidental loss. This model is particularly advantageous for financial applications and NFTs, where asset integrity and authenticity are paramount.\n\nCelestia\u2019s contribution to M2 through its modular data availability layer is another crucial aspect. This technology separates consensus from data availability, allowing for more flexible and scalable blockchain architectures. In M2, Celestia\u2019s system enables the distribution and storage of data in a more efficient and less resource-intensive way.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAdopting new technologies like M2 often comes with a learning curve for developers and users. Ensuring widespread adoption may require significant community engagement, education, and support efforts.\n\nM2 is part of a broader landscape of Layer Two solutions being developed for Ethereum. These alternative solutions with unique features and approaches contribute to a diverse ecosystem.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFor the broader blockchain community, M2\u2019s launch is a testament to the ongoing innovation and collaboration within the space. It highlights the potential of new technologies to address fundamental challenges and opens up new possibilities for blockchain applications and services\n\nRead more about L2 solutions for Ethereum:\n\nTypes of Layer 2: Comparing Different Ethereum Scaling Solutions\n\n\n\nRead more about Binance\u2019s settlement with US authorities:\n\nBinance Set to Thrive Post $4.3B Settlement: Analysts"

        "content": "Over $6.51 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options are due to expire on Nov. 24, potentially indicating heightened trading activity.\n\nA vast number of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire on Nov. 24, potentially influencing market dynamics. This comes in the wake of the U.S. DOJ\u2019s recent criminal charges against the Binance and its hefty $4.3 billion fine.\n\nSpecifically, about 108,000 BTC options are nearing their expiration date. These options carry a Put Call Ratio of 0.83, indicating a slightly higher inclination towards call options (betting on price increase) than put options (betting on price decrease).\n\nThe \u2018max pain point\u2019 for these options is $33,000, which is the price level where the collective holders of the options contracts would experience the most financial loss. The total notional value of these BTC options is a staggering $4.04 billion.\n\n24 Nov Options Data\n\n108k BTC options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.83, a max pain point of $33,000 and a notional value of $4.04 billion.\n\n1.2 million ETH options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.71, a max pain of $1,700 and a notional value of $2.47\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fhrOpr6bnE \u2014 [email protected] (@BTC__options) November 23, 2023\n\nIn parallel, approximately 1.2 million ETH options are also approaching expiration. These have a Put Call Ratio of 0.71, further leaning towards call options. The max pain point for these ETH options is set at $1,700, with a notional value amounting to $2.47 billion.\n\nThe concept of \u2018max pain\u2019 in options trading is crucial to understand. It refers to the price level at which the total value of options (both calls and puts) expiring on a certain date will cause the maximum financial loss to the option holders. This concept is often used by traders to assess potential market movements as options near their expiration dates.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nWhen BTC options are set to expire, it means that the contracts, which give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) by a specified date (the expiration date), are reaching the end of their validity period.\n\n#Bitcoin options seem to have a major impact on $BTC price!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Call options are dominating the options market as Bitcoin prepares for a significant $3.8 billion options expiry.\n\n\n\nThis dominance could significantly impact BTC's price trajectory in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/SeFjoANJmw \u2014 Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) November 23, 2023\n\nOn the expiration date, these options must be either exercised or they will become worthless. If the market price of Bitcoin is favorable relative to the strike price, the option holder may choose to exercise the option to buy Bitcoin at this lower price. Conversely, if the market price is below the strike price of a put option, the holder may exercise the option to sell Bitcoin at the higher strike price.\n\nThe impending expiration of these options could result in heightened trading activity and potentially unpredictable price movements in the market. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, especially in light of the recent legal actions against Binance, which have already injected notable volatility into the market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price is unable to find enough support from investors to push the altcoin beyond $2,142.\n\nInstitutional investors did pour money into ETH this past month, but year to date, they are still noting $55 million worth of outflows.\n\nWhales, too, are booking profits on the short-term scale, selling nearly $1 billion worth of ETH in two days.\n\nEthereum price is back to trading above one of the most important psychological support levels, but it seems like this rally might not stick this time around either. The altcoin leader is facing resistance on the one hand and a lack of support from the investors on the other, making it rather difficult to break this seven-month-old curse.\n\nEthereum price reclaims key support\n\nEthereum price is trading at $2,062 after charting a 6.75% growth over the past 24 hours. The $2,000 support line is crucial not only for ETH to rally further but also acts as a key psychological support level.\n\nThe recent bullish divergence observed on the RSI confirmed that the demand for the asset was high at the beginning of Q4 but faltered as soon as ETH hit $2,124. This line has been acting as a resistance since April, and Ethereum has been unable to breach it for the second time.\n\nThe last time this level was successfully breached was back in April 2021. The potential of the same this time around is rather low, too, given the Relative Strength Index (RSI) does seem to be in the bullish zone, but the On Balance Volume (OBV) has not been rising in accordance with the price action.\n\nTheoretically, when both price and OBV are making lower peaks and lower troughs, the downward trend is likely to continue. This means that ETH breaking out of the downtrend line is most likely a fakeout, and the altcoin will fall back down to lose the support of $2,000. This would send it back towards $1,900 or $1,795.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nOn the off chance that investors push through, Ethereum could manage to test $2,124 as resistance again. Breaching it would invalidate the bearish thesis and open ETH to reaching $2,200.\n\nBig wallet holders are still wary\n\nOne of the key causes of Ethereum being unable to breach $2,124 is the lack of support it is receiving from large wallet investors such as whales and institutions. For the week ending November 17, ETH managed to bring in only $3.3 million from institutions, which is lower than even Solana\u2019s $13.6 million.\n\nWhile the month-to-date flows have seemingly improved, year to date, ETH is still noting outflows amounting to $55 million.\n\nEthereum institutional flows\n\nSimilarly, the whale addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million ETH, which have been key drivers of the price action. Even they seem to be skeptical at the moment, as they sold nearly over $948 million worth of 460,000 ETH in the span of two days to book profits and offset losses, bringing their holding to 20.06 million ETH.\n\nEthereum whale holdings\n\nThus, as long as Ethereum fails to gain the conviction of these key cohorts, the price action will most likely continue to falter."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum is testing an epic breakout point. Today, in overnight trading, the third test of 2121 USD in a period of 7 months took place. To break out or not to break out, is the million dollar question top of mind of crypto investors. Here is a simple trick that can bring some peace of mind: December 1st is a breakout milestone, here is why.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s review the Ethereum chart.\n\nThe daily chart is a beauty. It\u2019s not the most beautiful crypto chart. In order to find the most beautiful ones, we suggest you check out our latest premium post (available for existing and new subscribers) 30 cryptocurrencies in 7 segments combined with Strength In AI-Tokens, DeFi and Other Segments Taking A Break.\n\nThat said, anyone who can read a chart will see a bullish reversal. What is interesting is that the reversal is perfectly respected. We can see this by price behavior around the 50% retracement level (fine purple line). The specific price point is 2121 USD. In 2023, this specific level was tested twice, overnight a third time, and that very specific price point was rejected in each of the 3 occurrences.\n\nThe point is this \u2013 the rejection occurred at a very, very specific price point which coincides with the most important retracement level (50%). This implies that the reversal is very reliable and dominant.\n\nNow, back to the original question, how to know whether the breakout will finally occur?\n\nThat\u2019s where we have to switch to the x-axis of the chart, the most underexposed part of the chart.\n\nAs seen, the previous attempt, back in April, was rejected after 5 days. That\u2019s a number in the Fibonacci sequence. The current attempt is ongoing for 15 days, not a Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWhat we do know from experience is that breakouts attempts tend to fail after a number of days that coincide with a Fibonacci number. In the current setup, as 15 days is not a number from the Fibonacci series, the next days in the series, being 21, coincides with December 1st, 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s why, Dec 1st (+/- 1day) is the milestone for the ongoing breakout attempt. Adding price info to this, results in this statement:\n\nEthereum has an unique opportunity to clear 2121 USD and stage a secular breakout;\n\nif it does so before Dec 1st it will be a high probability confirmed breakout;\n\nhowever if price is rejected until then and moves lower on Dec 1st or Dec 2nd, it will not likely break out for at least a month or two.\n\nThat\u2019s how we combine price and timeline readings, and more detail across various altcoins is shared in our weekly alerts in our premium crypto research service >>\n\nReceive our crypto FREE newsletter alerts Download 50 crypto investing tips"

        "content": "Staked supply was 23.6% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nETH\u2019s exchange balance was barely 12% of the total coins in circulation.\n\nUsers have shown significant interest in Ethereum [ETH] staking since the Shapella Upgrade went live earlier this year.\n\nAs of this writing, 28.6 million yield-generating coins were locked up on the network, accounting for 23.6% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply, as per a Nansen dashboard.\n\nStaked supply sees a sharp increase\n\nUsers moved towards the yield-bearing mechanism after gaining more control over their staked ETH, including the ability to unstake them at any time.\n\nThe increased share of staked ETH in comparison to total ETH trading volume demonstrated the extent of investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nData shared by IntoTheBlock CEO Jesus Rodriguez revealed that the deposited amount was 1.4% of the trading volume as of 21 November.\n\nWhile 1.4% may appear to be a very small portion, a better way to look at it is to compare staked supply to exchange supply.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data, a fascinating divergence was observed between the two in 2023.\n\nThe supply locked away in Ethereum\u2019s deposit contract charged to new highs. In contrast, the ETH available for active trading sank to new depths.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s exchange balance was barely 12% of the total coins in circulation, the lowest in more than seven years.\n\nETH rewards continue to drop\n\nThese findings underlined that people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yield. The surprising part was that all of this happened despite the fact that staking awards have reduced over time.\n\nAccording to Beaconcha.in, the annualized financial return per validator was just 3.68%. down from 8.61% seen in May.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe rewards were inversely related to the amount of ETH deposited and the number of stakers involved. Put simply, the more the number of stakers, the more thinly the yield gets spread out.\n\nAt press time, ETH regained the $2,000 level after slipping below to $1,949 during U.S. trading hours. The broader market reacted to the recent shock of Binance CEO stepping down."

Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital mentioned the fact that DeFi protocols are becoming MEV conscious, which could be a huge thing and make the whole system way more profitable. Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol shared her opinion about why zero-knowledge proofs and account abstraction technologies have great potential in DeFi. Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde and Enzyme Finance, emphasized the importance of having more traditional finance (TradFi) players integrating on-chain solutions because some could continue to be the last-mile access for users.\n\nThey also talked about the rise of liquid staking derivatives and whether the current state of Ethereum staking had a concentration issue. Other topics covered include real-world assets, growing awareness of DeFi, restaking solutions, and the ongoing battle to reach the masses.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Daria Krasnova, Managing Editor at BeInCrypto and participated by Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital, Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde & Enzyme Finance, Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol, Mete (Ali) Ba\u015fkaya, Blockchain & Crypto Lecturer and Seraphim Czecker, Head of Growth at Ethena Labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-powered Builder Identification\n\nJack He, Co-founder of Aspecta shared how they are leveraging AI technologies like large language models (LLM) and image recognition to build an identity solution for builders to consolidate their behavior data across different platforms.\n\nAspecta enables builders to create LinkedIn-like identity pages and credentials to showcase their skills, experience, and impact, which the team believes fills an important gap and helps to facilitate growth and collaboration among different developer ecosystems.\n\nCollaboration among Security Solution Providers Needed\n\nIn a panel discussion on Web3 security, security experts from MetaMask Snaps, Matter Labs, Certik, DTS Project, and MetaTrust Labs shared their observations as to the current state of Web3 security and some of the emerging threats.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, they also shared some cutting-edge solutions designed to safeguard the Web3 ecosystem and the lessons learned from the high-profile hacks in the last year.\n\nAn\u0131l \u00d6z, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project emphasized that he thought every cyber security service provider should collaborate and share their knowledge to build a safer and more secure Web3 future.\n\nLastly, they talked about how individuals can effectively guard against personal losses by using tools such as browser extensions and Metamask\u2019s Blockaid security alerts, an experimental function to be standardized in Q1 2024.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Sima Baktas, Web3 Attorney at GlobalB Law and Co-Founder of CryptoFemale, Anton Astafiev, VP of Security at Matter Labs, Christian Montoya, Senior Product Owner at MetaMask Snaps, Connie Lam, Head of Solution Architect at CertiK, An\u0131l \u00d6z, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project and TY Shao, Chief Business Officer at MetaTrust Labs.\n\nCrypto Entrepreneurs Gaining Valuable Experience during the Bear Market\n\nIn a panel discussion on crypto entrepreneurship, global and local project leaders shared their firsthand experience of building cryptocurrency businesses. While they highlighted challenges such as user education, lack of service providers, lack of prior examples to draw upon as well as legal and regulatory uncertainties, they shared an opinion that building products that solve real-world problems, focusing on user experiences, and finding creative ways to collaborate with other players are critical strategies founders should prioritize to navigate through these challenges.\n\nCommenting on the phenomenon that many crypto entrepreneurs are pivoting to AI to capture venture capital\u2019s interest, Bertu\u011f Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify noted that entrepreneurs should build products for their customers instead of investors. He advised startups to \u201cride the hype\u201d when necessary but always build the war chest for survival as founders will eventually have to face a bear market.\n\nArif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX added to underline that marketing and communications is a non-stop process and should not be undervalued in bear markets.\n\nCommenting on Turkey\u2019s crypto landscape, Erkan G\u00fcl, Founder of Moseiki App mentioned that the number of trader communities is too high compared to builder communities, but the transformation is underway.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by \u00d6zge ERDEM\u0130R, Web3 Advisor, Business Developer, and participated by Bertu\u011f Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify, Erkan G\u00fcl, Founder of Moseiki App, Victor Yu, Co-Founder of Carv and Arif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX.\n\nA New Paradigm to Secure Protocols and LP Assets on Ethereum\n\nYajin (Andy) Zhou, CEO of Blocksec launched Phalcon Block, an automated attack-blockchain system, at the conference.

        "content": "In a recent announcement, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, revealed plans to delist Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) cross margin and isolated margin pairs. This strategic move, effective from Nov. 28, is part of Binance's efforts to address mounting legal challenges within the digital assets industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe affected pairs are directly associated with BUSD, a stablecoin developed in collaboration with Paxos. Isolated margin borrowing on these pairs will be suspended on Nov. 28, followed by the closure of auto-settled user positions and the cancellation of pending orders on Dec. 7.\n\nPressure rise\n\nThis decision follows allegations by the U.S. SEC, which previously classified BUSD as a security. In response, both Paxos and Binance promptly halted the further minting and circulation of the stablecoin. This reflects the ongoing adjustments made by crypto exchanges to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn a parallel development, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the founder of Binance, has stepped down from his role. This decision is part of a broader agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle criminal charges against the exchange. Richard Teng has been named as the new CEO in the midst of this transitional period.\n\nCZ's guilty plea earlier this week, related to charges of operating an unlicensed money transfer business, conspiracy and violating restrictions, resulted in a significant $4.3 billion fine for Binance. As the crypto space grapples with these regulatory challenges, the implications for the market are uncertain.\n\nThe delisting of major pairs and the leadership change at Binance underscore the growing regulatory pressures faced by crypto exchanges globally, highlighting a pivotal moment for the industry."

        "content": "Blockchain analytics platform Token Terminal has provided insight into the future trajectory of the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH). Interestingly, they predict that the crypto token could rise as high as $36,800.\n\nWhen Ethereum Will Hit $36,800\n\nIn the research paper released by the platform, Ethereum is billed to hit the $36,800 mark by 2030. However, this prediction is made in the best-case scenario of 2030 being a bull market season. One of the ways in which they analyzed ETH\u2019s future value was with the total Addressable Market analysis.\n\nThey looked at the industries already adopting blockchains while forecasting how much of them will move on-chain by 2030. In line with this, they considered the role Ethereum could play in this in terms of tokenization. Token Terminal believes that all assets could be tokenized on the network, playing an integral role in the finance industry.\n\nThe finance industry apparently does over $28 trillion in annual revenues at the moment and is growing at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. With this in mind, Token Terminal foresees that the finance industry and Ethereum could form a mutually beneficial relationship. For one, a majority of the liquidity in the industry could become consolidated on the Ethereum network.\n\nSource: Token Terminal\n\nAlongside the prediction of $36,800 in 2030, the blockchain analytics platform projects that Ethereum could also enjoy an 80% market share among Layer 1 networks. The network could reach a monthly revenue of $109,668 in the best-case scenario (dependent on 2030 being a bull year).\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price In The Next Bull Cycle\n\nMeanwhile, Token Terminal also gave an insight into what Ethereum\u2019s price could look like in the next bull run. According to the platform, the crypto token could rise to as high as $13,000 at the peak of the bull market. From their projection, the Bitcoin Halving is seen as a catalyst that could spark the next cycle.\n\nSource: Token Terminal\n\nThe next Bitcoin Halving is expected to take place on April 4, 2024. Based on Token Terminal\u2019s analysis, Ethereum\u2019s price could rise to $2,300 by then. From that moment, ETH is projected to see an increase of over 469% as it surges to over $13,000 at the peak of the next bull cycle.\n\nThe future of Ethereum looks really promising based on these forecasts. Above all, Token Terminal expects the network to continue to dominate its competitors in terms of the economic opportunity on it. They predict that new use cases on Ethereum will spur it to \u201cgrow exponentially larger\u201d in the coming years.\n\nETH price reclaims $2,100 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from The Conversation, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

We\u2019ve had a five-wave rise here\u2026 [And a] very minor ABC pullback and now we\u2019re going again, so I do think the SOL dip is over.\u201d\n\nThe trader says that Solana is likely destined to be the \u201cfastest horse\u201d moving into the next crypto market cycle, and says its Bitcoin pair (SOL/BTC) is suggesting more strength to come in the near future.\n\nBluntz says that for the time being, he\u2019s targeting somewhere above $80 for Solana until it appears that SOL has fully completed a five-wave move to the upside. However, based on his chart, the trader suggests that SOL is likely destined for much higher prices than $80.\n\nSays Bluntz,\n\n\u201cI do think we\u2019re going to continue making new highs and continue making three-wave pullbacks and continue higher. And then, once this structure looks complete and it looks like five of five [waves] has completed, marking from this very first wave down here, that\u2019s when I might start to get worried.\n\nBut at least for now, looking at this on the daily, I think this still has plenty of juice left in the tank, and I think we\u2019re probably hitting $80+ in this next leg and we\u2019ll reassess when we get there.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $57.39.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "New Ethereum layer-2 network Blast sees a massive $310m inflow - crypto.news",
        "content": "Blast\u2019s innovative layer-2 blockchain sees $310 million in deposits amidst users\u2019 criticisms.\n\nBlast Bridge, a new Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, saw an inflow of $310 million in assets shortly after its debut. This significant influx of assets includes substantial deposits of 129,866.52 ETH through Lido and 42,587,100 DAI via Maker MSR.\n\n\n\nLaunched by the co-founder of NFT marketplace Blur and supported by Paradigm, Blast is charting a unique path in the layer-2 domain. Its introduction has seen a remarkable accumulation of staked Ethereum (stETH) and stablecoins, signaling strong market interest.\n\nBlast\u2019s on-chain data | Source: DeBank\n\nBlast\u2019s approach to blockchain technology and backing from high-profile entities like Paradigm and the crypto-native investor group \u201ceGirl Capital\u201d has captured significant attention. The platform\u2019s native staking feature is designed to yield returns through Ethereum staking and real-world assets, offering a distinct avenue for user investment growth.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum price up 3%, crypto mining token also gaining momentum\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about the risks associated with Blast\u2019s operational model, particularly its reliance on the liquid-staking protocol Lido for exchanging assets for Blast points. Critics question the security and viability of locking total value locked (TVL) in a yet-to-materialize chain, suggesting possible weaknesses in the platform\u2019s foundation.\n\nBlast is actually insane lol\n\n\n\n\u2013 Raise seed money with no testnet, no docs, nothing\n\n\u2013 Use points and ref ponzi to attract TVL to a chain that doesn't exist\n\n\u2013 Rawdogg the deposited $ETH into $stETH on a 5 person multisig of anon devs\n\n\n\nWe're getting more retarded by the minute pic.twitter.com/XA32pNw4nk \u2014 Wazz (@WazzCrypto) November 21, 2023\n\nThe Blast Points system has also been a topic of controversy. Some community members compare it to a pyramid scheme, highlighting the inability of users to access their staked assets until the bridge\u2019s activation. This strategy necessitates user engagement through Blast points, a mechanism that continues to be closely scrutinized by industry watchers and participants alike.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

As such, Blast is invite-only as of Thursday, requiring a code from an existing user to gain access."

        "title": "The 7 Best Ethereum Wallets to Know About for 2024 - Simplilearn",
        "content": "It\u2019s time to talk about wallets. No, not that thing made of imitation leather that you fold up and put in your back pocket. But, of course, everything else is already digitized today, so why not wallets?\n\nHowever, we're talking about an electronic wallet that fits a particular function. Specifically, we\u2019re talking about the world of cryptocurrency. That\u2019s why today we\u2019re exploring Ethereum wallets, what they are, and which ones are the best Ethereum wallets that 2024 has to offer.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is Ethereum, Anyway? According to Investopedia, Ethereum is defined as \u201c\u2026a platform powered by blockchain technology that is best known for its native cryptocurrency, called ether, or ETH, or simply ethereum. The distributed nature of blockchain technology is what makes the Ethereum platform secure, and that security enables ETH to accrue value.\u201d The Ethereum platform, launched in 2015, supports not only ether, but also a network of decentralized apps known as dApps. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with its terms of agreement written directly into the code, got their start on the Ethereum platform. Whereas the Bitcoin blockchain exists solely to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, Ethereum wants to be more. Ethereum is angling to become an electronic, programmable network that supports numerous applications beyond cryptocurrency. As of January 2022, the Ethereum cryptocurrency\u2019s market value is second only to Bitcoin. That\u2019s a healthy position to be in when it comes to the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo, What Is an Ethereum Wallet? The short answer: Ethereum wallets are applications that allow users to interact with their Ethereum accounts. The slightly longer answer: Many banks and other financial institutions have apps that customers can use to conduct banking transactions with their mobile devices. Consider Ethereum wallets as the cryptocurrency counterpart of those banking apps. However, mobile banking apps are optional. You can get along fine without them and still access your account through more traditional mundane methods (but why would you want to?). Furthermore, the nature of Ethereum requires a wallet for you to move funds and manage your ETH. Wallets come in four forms: Physical Hardware: These are highly secure wallets that let you keep your cryptocurrency offline.\n\nMobile Applications: These resources let you access your funds from anywhere.\n\nWeb Wallets: As the name implies, web wallets allow you access to your crypto account through a web browser.\n\nDesktop Applications: You can access your accounts and manage your funds via Windows, macOS, or Linux if you have a desktop system. You can swap wallet providers whenever you like, and many of them let you manage several Ethereum applications at once from one application. And speaking of the Ethereum wallets, let\u2019s look at the best offerings for this year. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Are the Best Ethereum Wallets for 2024? Trezor Model T Let\u2019s begin our list with the oldest Bitcoin hardware wallet, arguably considered the best Ethereum wallet available. Main Highlight: It\u2019s all about security. The PIN never leaves the wallet, and this extra layer of protection makes it more difficult for hackers to access your funds.\n\nAdditional Features: Trezor is a hardware wallet that stores your funds on a USB flash drive. It supports over one thousand cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, and Ethereum Classic. But it doesn\u2019t support Ripple, Monero, Cardano, or Tezos. Trezor is compatible with Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.\n\nDrawbacks: However, Trezor isn\u2019t ideal for quick trading due to its enhanced security. CryptoWallet CryptoWallet was designed to address the problems presented by other wallets. It includes banking services such as a debit card and an IBAN. Main Highlight: CryptoWallet is a free mobile wallet that\u2019s easy to use.\n\nAdditional Features: CryptoWallet lets users buy real goods and services with their cryptocurrency via the wallet\u2019s debit card. It can also support multiple tokens in one secure wallet.\n\nDrawbacks: On the downside, users can\u2019t control their keys in CryptoWallet. MetaMask This wallet is is one of the best Ethereum wallets for network newbies. This browser extension lets you access Ethereum's blockchain via Google Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, and Mozilla Firefox. Main Highlight: This is a free web wallet that lets you access your wallet via your browser.\n\nAdditional Features: The wallet is linked to the Coinbase and ShapeShift exchange.\n\nDrawbacks: Although MetaMask is convenient once it\u2019s running, it\u2019s a little tough to set up. Ledger Nano X The Ledger Nano X is an advanced Ethereum wallet that offers security usually only found in custodial cryptocurrency wallets. The Nano X are devices you plug into your computer, like a USB flash drive. After you install the software, you can use it to store cryptocurrency. Main Highlight: Security is the main sell here, like the Trezor Model T. Hackers can't crack these wallets unless they have their backup password, known as the seed phrase.\n\nAdditional Features: This wallet is a hardware wallet, and it supports a variety of cryptocurrencies including Ethereum.\n\nDrawbacks: Users may find the setup and usage a bit tricky. It also takes time to move funds from the wallets to the cryptocurrency exchanges, so forget about rapid trading. Also, the user has no backup if they lose the seed phrase, and if they lose the wallet or it gets ruined, the funds are gone. Basics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program Exodus Here\u2019s another one of the best Ethereum wallets that\u2019s great for beginners. It\u2019s a relatively new entry into the Ethereum wallet field but has numerous features that help increase its visibility in the market. In addition, this wallet is easy to set up and use. Main Highlight: Exodus is a free desktop app that comes with a mobile application as well. It\u2019s compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nAdditional Features: The wallet supports many cryptocurrencies and offers customer support and crypto exchange via the built-in Shapeshift exchange. Exodus can also synch with your Trezor portfolio.\n\nDrawbacks: But Exodus is a bit light on the security side, as it has no 2FA security measures in place. The app also doesn\u2019t support fiat currencies such as pounds or euros. Mist Mist the official Ethereum wallet, built by the cryptocurrency\u2019s creators. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s considered one of the best Ethereum wallets available today. Main Highlight: This desktop wallet is open-source, and considering it\u2019s been developed by Ethereum\u2019s creators and recognized as one of the better wallets out there, that\u2019s quite a bargain.\n\nAdditional Features: Mist\u2019s creators have integrated it with ShapeShift, and you can use the wallet to buy ETH with BTC or fiat currency with no hassles.\n\nDrawbacks: However, you must install Ethereum\u2019s full node before using Mist, which means putting over 1TB into your device. Since it synchs with the Ethereum blockchain, it takes longer to load. Also, it only supports ETH and ERC20. MyEtherWallet We finish off our list of the best Ethereum wallets with MyEtherWallet, another Ethereum wallet that\u2019s been around for a while. MyEtherWallet offers support for hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor. In addition, your funds are stored on your computer instead of on a server. Main Highlight: MyEtherWallet is an open-source product that\u2019s easy to use, well-supported, and comes as a mobile and desktop application.\n\nAdditional Features: Since your funds are stored on your computer instead of off-site on a server, MyEtherWallet offers a more secure non-custodial solution.\n\nDrawbacks: MyEtherWallet is for ether and ERC20 tokens only. It doesn\u2019t support other coins. Unfortunately, this wallet also has no customer support if you lose your funds. That means users must be careful with their recovery passwords! So, which of the wallets on this list is best? That hinges on how much you want to spend, what you want to use it for, and how technical-minded or experienced with cryptocurrency you are. If you want something easy to use, minimal cost (as in, free!), and you don\u2019t need bells and whistles, consider CryptoWallet or MetaMask. However, if you want to spend money, go for the Trezor Model T or the Ledger Nano X. It comes down to personal taste, but this article at least narrows down the field considerably, making a choice easier.

        "content": "A top crypto analytics firm says that the 200 largest Ethereum (ETH) holders went on a massive buying spree in the past year, picking up over $2.9 billion worth of the leading altcoin.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the top 200 ETH whales are now holding more than 62 million ETH valued at about $124.1 billion, an increase of around 14.5 million ETH from the same time last year.\n\nSantiment also says there was a huge spike in ETH wallets created on Monday, the largest since July.\n\n\u201cThe 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold a combined 62.76 million ETH, currently worth ~$124.1 billion. They have accumulated 30.3% more coins since November 21, 2022. Additionally, 94,700 new ETH wallets were created yesterday, the highest spike since July.\u201d\n\nNext, the firm says that the broader crypto markets dipped after the Binance news broke.\n\n\u201cThe bombshell news of [Changpeng Zhao] stepping down after the DOJ (US Department of Justice) found him guilty for laundering and fraud is still hitting the mainstream. Altcoins have been extra volatile, and buy-the-dip opportunities may arise depending on how much FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) this causes.\u201d\n\nThe firm says that Binance\u2019s ecosystem native token Binance Coin (BNB) was among the most affected.\n\n\u201cBinance Coin has understandably been among the altcoins hit the hardest on news of [Changpeng Zhao] stepping down as CEO. But if a quick reputation recovery happens for crypto\u2019s number one exchange, a BNB bounce would be likely based on this level of trader FUD.\u201d\n\nThe firm suggests that a decline in altcoins had already started prior to the Binance news. The firm also notes that it appears some BNB holders are swapping their coins for FTX\u2019s native token FTT.\n\n\u201cAlthough many see the Binance news as the main culprit for one of the biggest retraces of the year, the fact of the matter is that altcoins had already seeing shrinking market caps. Interestingly, it appears some traders are swapping their BNB for FTX\u2019s FTT.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst is predicting that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor will soar to three figures in 2024.\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 198,500 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) will likely increase by at least 72% from its current value next year.\n\n\u201cSOL: hoping for a bit lower to be honest. Sub $50 would be an excellent entry but this is going to go to three digits next year.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader says Solana could dip to $48.79 or $42.80 before the massive surge.\n\nSolana is trading for $57.47 at time of writing, up 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, he says that decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) could dip down to Fibonacci levels of $11.15 or $12.\n\n\u201cLINK: I still want $11.15 and $12. Waiting patiently. Moves today are nice but not any sort of big MS (market structure) shift yet.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.29 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur (BLUR) could soon challenge higher resistance levels.\n\n\u201cBLUR: zoom out, I think $0.60 and $0.75 are possibilities on this current run. Incredible strength.\u201d\n\nBLUR is trading for $0.50 at time of writing, up 3.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader predicts a generally sideways trading environment for the broader crypto market, at least for the time being.\n\n\u201cBTC: nothing has changed.

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2 Blast Has $400 Million Locked in Just 4 Days, Despite Concerns - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nInterest in upcoming Ethereum layer-2 network Blast is bringing lots of cash with it. According to DeFi Llama, total value locked (TVL) in the project now stands at over $405 million just days after the project was announced\u2014and it\u2019s growing fast.\n\nBlast is a new Ethereum scaling network announced on Tuesday. In the crowded market of layer-2 networks (like Arbitrum and Optimism), developers come up with ideas to make it quicker, easier, and cheaper for people to do things on Ethereum\u2019s sometimes slow and costly blockchain.\n\nThis particular project is led in part by Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre, who co-founded Blur, the largest NFT marketplace in the space. Blur is known for giving traders ample rewards for using and remaining loyal to the marketplace, and Blast apparently aims to do much the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea of Blast is that users deposit crypto\u2014mainly staked Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins\u2014to earn returns. And people are depositing their funds fast. One crypto wallet this week deposited 10,000 ETH to the project. That\u2019s nearly $21 million in crypto.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: Blast isn't actually live yet.\n\nBlast said that it will keep users funds until its bridge goes live in February, and the sudden rise of the network and questions about the model have people talking about whether it\u2019s safe to invest or not. Blast itself claims an even higher figure of $443 million total value locked, as of this writing, with nearly 53,000 users so far.\n\nSome degen deposited 10,000 ETH into BLAST. \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/GODo20RDTp \u2014 Farokh (@farokh) November 22, 2023\n\nSome traders are concerned it may be a Ponzi scheme, as those who refer other users can receive \u201cBlast points\u201d for a May airdrop. The project is also promising sizable, \u201crisk-free\u201d yields of 4% in ETH and 5% on stablecoins to its users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers\u2014including pseudonymous NFT developer Phygital and Polygon Labs engineer Jarrod Watts\u2014have claimed that requiring three out of five anonymous keys to sign and execute transactions is potentially dangerous. Watts in particular said that Blast \"is not an L2,\" at least not in its current incarnation.\n\nBy sending money to the Blast contract, you're basically trusting 3-5 strangers to stake your funds for you. You won't be able to withdraw that money at any point in time unless those 3-5 people decide to do the right thing in the future. Again, there's no bridge here. (14/24) \u2014 Jarrod Watts (@jarrodWattsDev) November 23, 2023\n\n\u201cInvesting funds into Blast is like trusting 3-5 strangers to stake your crypto,\u201d Watts wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be able to withdraw it unless 3 signers decide it. To me, it sounds risky.\u201d\n\nPacman wrote Friday on Twitter that the project promises big rewards because the yield is coming from major decentralized finance projects Lido and MakerDAO.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\n\u201cThe reason the yield feels too good to be true in Blast is because Blast makes this yield the default for everyone,\u201d he said, adding that the project is \u201cdemocratizing higher yield.\u201d\n\nBlast has also said that one of the types of yields is the risk-free interest rate ETH staking. But members of Lido, including one who goes by the name of Sacha on X, have pointed out that no form of staking is entirely \u201crisk-free.\u201d\n\nimportant to clarify that this statement is false. while i am of the opinion that staking needs to be made as close to risk-free as possible, we are not there today. there are governance, contract, and operator risks involved. anyone using Blast needs to keep these in mind https://t.co/8z9dVJhr6J \u2014 sacha\ud83d\udca7 (@sachayve) November 21, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecrypt reached out to Blast for additional comment about the concerns, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nRisk-free or not, investors continue plugging large sums of crypto into the project at breakneck speed\u2014and it\u2019s an investment that won\u2019t budge for months. They\u2019ll have to hope Blast lives up to its promises.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "How Far Ethereum Upgrades Have Come? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It is the pioneering blockchain that applied blockchain technology to several traditional industries. After facing network congestion issues and high Ethereum gas fees, the developers behind the blockchain started implementing a series of upgrades.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum upgrades take place when they are proposed with the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The ongoing series of Ethereum upgrades are supposed to make the network sustainable, scalable, secure, and efficient. But, are they succeeding? How far Ethereum upgrades have come? Let us find out in this article.\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nEthereum holds a special place in the crypto industry being a pioneer of decentralized applications. It was developed by Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and others with an initial vision of creating a \u201cone global computer for the entire planet\u201d.\n\nEthereum introduced smart contract technology to the tech world. It brought remarkable applications like non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), metaverse, GameFi, and more.\n\nInitially, it failed to address the scalability issues and skyrocketing gas prices on the blockchain network. Adding to that the environmental concerns of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism are added to the list of Ethereum issues.\n\nIn the meanwhile, blockchain networks such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana emerged claiming to be \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d. The strong developer team behind the Ethereum decided to address all these challenges with a series of upgrades on the network. Let us now discuss the upgrades that were successfully implemented till now.\n\nRecap of Ethereum Upgrades\n\nEven though the Ethereum network has undergone numerous upgrades, the actual Ethereum 2.0 upgrade started with the Beacon Chain Genesis in December, 2020. Beacon Chain implementation was the first step in transforming Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Following several small improvements such as Muir Glacier, Beacon Chain\u2019s functionality was improved.\n\nEthereum London Upgrade\n\nEthereum London Upgrade marks an important milestone in reforming the gas fees on the Ethereum network. It brought changes to the gas fees with the help of Ethereum Improvement proposal 1559 (EIP \u2013 1559). Ethereum London Upgrade went live in August, 2021 and introduced a new gas fee system.\n\nThe Merge\n\nAfter the London upgrade, multiple improvements like the Berlin upgrade, Arrow Glacier, and Altair took place on Ethereum. Bellatrix upgrade was implemented in September, 2022 to prepare the blockchain for the most-awaited \u201cThe Merge\u201d event. It played a critical role in transitioning the last block of PoW mechanism to the first block of the PoS chain.\n\nFinally, the groundbreaking \u201cEthereum Merge\u201d or the Paris upgrade was implemented in September 2022. With this, Ethereum created history in the blockchain industry. It achieved an impossible feat of transitioning from PoW consensus mechanism to PoS. This is an important milestone in making Ethereum a sustainable blockchain.\n\nShapella Upgrade\n\nThe latest Ethereum upgrade, Shapella, took place on April 12, 2023. Shapella upgrade is actually a combination of two upgrades \u2013 Capella and Shanghai. This upgrade implemented EIP-4895 and enabled validators to withdraw their staked ETH funds. As a result, liquidity of Ether was improved, by making staking rewards accessible. The successful implementation of Shapella upgrade led to Ethereum price rally and regained its $1,900 position in the market.\n\nEthereum Upgrades: What\u2019s Next?\n\nSo far, Ethereum reformed its gas fees and became a sustainable blockchain. The next set of upgrades primarily focus on scaling.\n\nDanksharding is the next significant Ethereum upgrade that uses distributed data sampling to make Ethereum more scalable. This plays an important role in improving scalability. Additionally, it also makes making the network more decentralized by managing vast sets of data generated by layer2 rollups.\n\nProto-danksharding, which is EIP-4844, will be implemented before full danksharding. It introduces temporary data blobs and ensure that they can be seamlessly transmitted. Full danksharding is expected to be completed by early 2024.\n\nApart from this, Vitalik Buterin introduced a 5 phase Ethereum roadmap \u2013 The Surge, The scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Each phase includes each upgrade of the Ethereum network as follows.\n\nThe Surge relates to the scalability\n\nThe Scourge relates to censorship resistance\n\nThe Verge relates to the verification of blocks\n\nThe Purge relates to reducing the computational costs\n\nThe Splurge includes remaining improvements\n\nNo matter the terminology used by the community, the vision behind these upgrades is the same \u2013 to develop a sustainable, scalable, and secure Ethereum blockchain network!\n\nConclusion\n\nSo far, Ethereum\u2019s journey through its upgrades is nothing short of remarkable. The development team has already achieved a big milestone when they successfully implemented \u201cThe Merge\u201d event. The Ethereum developer team\u2019s commitment to become a more decentralized, scalable, secure, sustainable, and efficient platform is driving its evolution. The network\u2019s ability to transform as per the improvements is its strength. When all the Ethereum upgrades will get implemented, we will see if it becomes a global super computer for the entire planet!\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are Ethereum upgrades?\n\nThe Ethereum development team is implementing a series of improvements on the network to make the network more efficient and scalable. These improvements are called Ethereum upgrades.\n\nHow long will the Ethereum upgrade take?"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) added 3% in the past 24 hours amid a mild recovery in the crypto market. Bitcoin (BTC) also rose above $37,000 after a dip earlier this week, influencing altcoins such as ETH.\n\nWith the market gaining momentum, the focus is shifting to the presale phase of Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a new crypto-mining platform.\n\nEthereum adds 7% on bullish on-chain metrics\n\nThe ETH price is up by over 7% from the Nov. 22 low, regaining the crucial $2,000 level.\n\nThis rally comes as the crypto market rebounds from losses sustained following news regarding Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao.\n\nHowever, more importantly, the ETH reversal aligns with its bullish on-chain metrics.\n\nAccording to FXStreet, the top 200 ETH wallets have been accumulating in the past year.\n\nThis formation suggests that \u201cwhale\u201d investors are bullish on the coin.\n\nETH supply on exchanges has decreased by almost 20% in the past six months, reaching its lowest since May.\n\nThis decrease in supply on exchanges may support prices since it reduces selling pressure.\n\nMoreover, interest in Ethereum appears to be increasing, as more than 422,000 ETH wallets are currently active. This is a significant surge in the past few days.\n\nCrypto market gains $60b after Binance fallout\n\nThe broader crypto market also shows signs of recovery following the massive news of Binance\u2019s landmark settlement and the loss of its founder, Changpeng Zhao.\n\nBitcoin has rebounded over 5% from Nov. 22 lows, with other altcoins like Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also posting sizable gains.\n\nThe total crypto market cap now stands at $1.48 trillion, adding over $60 billion since yesterday.\n\nThis rebound seems driven by optimism that the regulatory uncertainties surrounding crypto might be resolved, particularly following the recent developments with Binance.\n\nSome analysts say the settlements, while harsh, could provide much-needed clarity for the crypto sector\u2019s future progress.\n\nAdditionally, macroeconomic factors like stabilizing inflation data have supported a risk-on environment for crypto as an asset class.\n\nWhile risks remain, the market is regaining footing.\n\nYou might also like: Netflix director allegedly YOLOs $4m of allocated series budget on Dogecoin\n\nBitcoin Minetrix raises $4.2 million\n\nAs the market stabilizes, attention is turning to a project in its presale phase \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s whitepaper, Bitcoin Minetrix is a decentralized cloud mining platform that allows users to stake BTCMTX and earn BTC rewards.\n\nIts \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model gives users mining power based on token holdings, eliminating upfront costs, fixed contracts, and hidden fees associated with traditional cloud mining firms.\n\nBeing an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, users can stake BTCMTX simply by connecting an Ethereum-compatible wallet.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s potential is closely tied to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024.\n\nAs mining rewards get cut in half, Bitcoin could enter a bull run that sends miner profits soaring.\n\nBTCMTX exposes users to this potential scenario without the need for expensive mining equipment.\n\nThe project has raised $4.2 million from over 5,400 Telegram community members.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is ranked third on CoinSniper.net and second on ICOBench.com.\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix roadmap includes plans for a mobile app, exchange listings, and partnering with cloud mining providers.\n\nVisit the Bitcoin Minetrix presale\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "A CryptoQuant Analyst has identified a significant systemic buying trend in Ethereum, suggesting a rising influx of strategic investments into the blockchain network.\n\nAnalyst Reveals Ethereum Systemic Buying Trend\n\nA crypto market observer and a contributing analyst at CryptoQuant, Maarten Regterschot has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to publish a systemic buying trend he witnessed in Ethereum. The analyst presented a chart indicating that one or more investors have been engaging in Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) buying on Ethereum futures.\n\nRegterschot stated that the linear increase in open interest in Ethereum suggests that there has been systemic buying of ETH assets for an extended period of time. He revealed that approximately $700 million has already been added to the market.\n\n\u201cSomeone(s) are TWAP-buying on Ethereum futures. This linear growth in open interest indicates systematic buying over a certain period. There is $700 million added so far,\u201d Regterschot said.\n\nSystemic buying in this context involves crypto investments made at regular and periodic intervals. TWAP on the other hand is the measure of an asset\u2019s average price over a specific time period.\n\nThis systemic buying trend suggests a growing demand for ETH by investors over a long period. The trend also coincides with the latest Ethereum developments in the crypto space, including the growing applications on Ethereum Spot ETFs and its potential approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe analyst has not revealed insights into the motives behind this systemic buying of Ethereum. However, the developments could become a catalyst for a potential bullish momentum for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nETH Price Holds $2000 Mark\n\nThe price of Ethereum has seen multiple upticks within the last few months, allowing the cryptocurrency to finally cross the $2,000 mark. According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum\u2019s price is up by 2.3% and trading at $2,062 at the time of writing. Although its overall market capitalization is down by 23.31%, the cryptocurrency has been experiencing a fair amount of price increases recently.\n\nAs the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the US SEC looms next year, many investors are currently holding their crypto assets as they gear up for a possible bull run. There have also been several optimistic price projections for the ETH token. Some analysts have predicted that the price of the cryptocurrency will reach $2,250 if it succeeds in crossing multiple resistance levels.\n\nETH price falls to $2,055 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Decrypt, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum new yearly highs on the horizon as ETH breaks key resistance - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In line with the overwhelming bullish sentiment in the general cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has continued its gains from previous weeks and has already broken out of the key resistance area, signaling it is ready for more significant gains soon.\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum has overcome a resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044, where 1.67 million crypto wallets purchased 38.73 million ETH, according to the recent data shared by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez in an X post he published on November 24.\n\nEthereum holders in/out of money. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nAs the crypto trading expert concluded, should Ethereum stay above this demand area, it could pave the way for it \u201cto reach new yearly highs,\u201d particularly considering there is \u201cminimal resistance ahead and solid support below.\u201d Indeed, according to the chart, no demand walls per specific price ranges stand out.\n\nOther bullish indicators\n\nAnother bullish sign for Ethereum is that the 200 of its largest whales are currently holding 62.76 million ETH, which is over 50% of all the circulating supply and 30% more than they had one year ago, on November 21, 2022, as interest continued to increase.\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that about 94,700 new Ethereum addresses appeared on November 20, 2023, marking the highest amount of new address creation activity in more than four months since July this year, as Finbold reported on November 23.\n\n\ud83d\udc0b Ethereum Whales on a buying spree! \ud83d\udcb8@santimentfeed reports that the 200 largest Ethereum wallets now hold a combined 62.76M $ETH, currently worth $124.1B! They have accumulated 30.3% more coins since November 21, 2022 and now command 52% of Ethereum's circulating supply! \ud83d\udcca \u2014 OneArt (Crypto & NFT Wallet) (@art_wallet) November 22, 2023\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently changing hands at the price of $2,102.76, recording an increase of 2.09% in the last 24 hours, gaining 7.26% on its weekly chart, and adding up to the more significant advance of 17.77% across the previous month.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, the digital asset has managed to grow its price well beyond the average of $2,012.38 at which the above-mentioned addresses acquired the amount of ETH reported by Martinez and is not facing any difficult demand walls after its current price point, so his predictions may well come true.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "According to Rick Edelman, the \u201cdark chapter\u201d of FTX could see its end soon.\n\nHe also discussed significant topics and speculations surrounding ETFs.\n\nIn an interview on the \u201cUnchained\u201d podcast, host Laura Shin discussed various topics surrounding Exchange-Traded Funds [ETFs] with Rick Edelman, Founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\nCrypto overshadowing \u201cdark chapter of FTX\u201d\n\nThe recent downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX [FTT], has left a lasting impact on the crypto industry, akin to the Bernie Madoff scandal in traditional finance.\n\nWhile some financial advisers may still associate the FTX collapse with the face of crypto, the ongoing positive developments in the industry are gradually overshadowing this dark chapter.\n\nAs Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] prices surged, ETFs performed well, and major companies like Disney embraced NFTs, the narrative shifted.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs failed to impress financial advisers\n\nEdelman highlighted that the Bitcoin Futures ETFs, which have been available for a couple of years, failed to garner significant interest from financial advisers.\n\nDespite the initial hype surrounding their launch, advisers found little excitement in these funds, primarily due to the complexities and expenses associated with trading futures.\n\nRegardless, the lackluster response to Bitcoin Futures ETFs has set the stage for the much-anticipated launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEdelman emphasized that there is a widespread expectation in the financial industry that spot Bitcoin ETFs will elicit a far greater level of interest compared to their futures counterparts.\n\nThe fundamental difference between spot and futures ETFs lies in their accessibility and simplicity, making spot ETFs more attractive to advisers.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF launch: Logistics\n\nAs the eagerly awaited launch date for spot Bitcoin ETFs looms, financial watchdogs are gearing up for a potentially transformative moment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe 10th of January has been identified as a pivotal day, with Bloomberg analysts predicting the initiation of these groundbreaking investment vehicles.\n\nReflecting on the historical context, the launch of Bitcoin Futures ETFs stirred excitement. However, the impending spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a dozen issuers in contention, present a unique landscape.\n\nEdelman anticipated an initial surge as early adopters will seize the opportunity. Yet, he emphasized that sustaining this rapid influx might prove challenging.\n\nWhile the early adopters are poised to jump in fervently, the subsequent trajectory is expected to unfold over months and years rather than mere days. Edelman attributed this elongated timeline to the intricate logistical processes inherent in incorporating a new investment opportunity.\n\nHe also predicted that the winners in this race would be the investors. Notably, the founder drew parallels with the SEC\u2019s approach to gold ETFs, emphasizing the need for multiple approvals simultaneously to encourage healthy market competition.\n\nEthereum ETFs are anticipated to launch soon after\n\nThe conversation then shifted to Ethereum ETFs, anticipated to launch soon after Bitcoin. Edelman noted that while the crypto community buzzed with excitement, mainstream attention remained limited.\n\nHowever, he foresaw a future scenario where advisers, having dipped their toes into Bitcoin, would seek broader crypto exposure, with Ethereum emerging as a natural choice.\n\nIn Edelman\u2019s view, advisers and clients would realize the limitations of a Bitcoin-only approach, leading to a broader exploration of the crypto landscape.\n\nEthereum, as the second-largest digital asset, presented itself as a compelling choice, driven by its technological capabilities and potential for commercial applications."

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nThe crypto market continues to move higher, adding another 0.8% overnight to $1.44 trillion as Greed stays as a major driver right now, according to a popular sentiment indicator.\n\n\n\nFriday morning saw a fresh test of the $38K level for Bitcoin. It failed, but we continue to see the persistence of growth attempts and less and less deep retreats from local peaks. The dynamics of November lead us to believe that the chances of the price rising by another 2.5K and exceeding the $40K level are higher than the chances of it falling by the same amount to $35K.\n\n\n\nEthereum crossed the $2100 level, returning to the peak set on 10 November. There was a classic Fibonacci retracement with a 61.8% pullback from the initial rally. Breaking through the $2135 level will set up the main scenario of a 161.8% growth, which in this case is close to $2500.\n\nNews background\n\nThe SEC and BlackRock held a meeting to discuss the details of a spot bitcoin ETF. According to the memo, the management company showed a presentation outlining two possible redemption mechanisms for its iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nGrayscale updated the GBTC application to convert to an ETF and changed the ticker symbol to BTC. Bloomberg saw this as another sign of the company's ongoing negotiations with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC has no reason to prevent the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF, said SEC Commissioner Hester Pearce, known for her positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe agreements between Binance and the US authorities are favourable as they neutralise the systemic risk to the industry from a hypothetical collapse of the platform, JPMorgan said.\n\nNansen said the market's reaction to the Binance scandal and Changpeng Zhao's guilty plea was muted. This event did not lead to a significant flight of capital from the cryptocurrency platform."

Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEmbark on a crypto journey where Ethereum Classic (ETC) surges post-Ethereum\u2019s transition, Optimism (OP) experiences a 45% surge, and the spotlight shines on VC Spectra (SPCT). With a $2.4 million private seed sale success, VC Spectra promises quarterly dividends, buybacks, and exclusive ICO access.\n\nLet\u2019s find out more about which might be the best investment!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) experienced a significant 29% price surge to $19.71, driven by a substantial increase in hash rate.\n\nOptimism (OP) surged 45% to $1.79 on Nov 20, driven by strategic hires like Ryan Wyatt and innovations like Redstone.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s SPCT token achieved 725% ROI in presale Sateg 4, making it one of the top altcoins of 2023.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Thrives: Hashrate Surge and Price Rally\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has surged with renewed vigor following the Ethereum network\u2019s groundbreaking transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, rendering traditional mining obsolete. This pivotal moment catalyzed a substantial uptick in ETC\u2019s hash rate, soaring from 70.5 terahash/second to an impressive 158.3 TH/s.\n\nThe influx of miners diverting their computational power to Ethereum Classic (ETC) exemplifies its resilience and attractiveness within the crypto ecosystem. The heightened hash rate not only fortifies the security of the Ethereum Classic (ETC) network but also underscores the community\u2019s confidence in the project\u2019s viability.\n\nAs a direct consequence, the Ethereum Classic price (ETC) experienced a remarkable 29% surge, reaching $19.71 on November 20. This Ethereum Classic price surge showcases the market\u2019s positive response to the increased mining activity and underscores Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) role as a preferred choice for miners seeking alternative opportunities.\n\nThe impressive price rally aligns with Ethereum Classic\u2019s commitment to maintaining the principles of decentralization and security, solidifying its standing in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Analysts\u2019 Ethereum Classic prediction suggests that the Ethereum Classic price (ETC) could reach $22.46 in December.\n\nOptimism Crypto (OP) Surges 45% Amidst Strategic Developments\n\nIn a month, the price of the Optimism coin (OP) has surged by an impressive 45%, reaching $1.79 on November 20. This significant uptrend coincides with promising developments within the Optimism (OP) ecosystem, signaling a potentially bullish trajectory for the Optimism coin (OP).\n\nThe recent hiring of Ryan Wyatt, a seasoned professional with a background at Polygon Labs and YouTube, as Chief Growth Officer for Optimism Unlimited Ltd., showcases a strategic move to bolster ecosystem expansion and developer support.\n\nAdditionally, the unveiling of Redstone, an \u201calternative data availability\u201d network by blockchain developer Lattice, operating as a test network for cost-effective on-chain games and decentralized applications within the Optimism (OP) ecosystem, further strengthens the narrative of innovation and growth.\n\nAs Redstone pioneers a unique approach to data availability, its integration into the broader Optimism framework could contribute to increased efficiency and scalability, potentially influencing OP\u2019s upward momentum in the market.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts alike are closely watching these developments, anticipating positive implications for the future value and adoption of Optimism (OP). Analysts expect the Optimism coin (OP) to reach the $2 mark in December.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): Presale Success and Bullish Momentum\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) has made significant waves in the crypto sphere, recently securing an impressive $2.4 million in its private seed sale. This successful fundraising laid the foundation for its subsequent public presale, which has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nKicking off with an initial altcoin price of $0.008, VC Spectra\u2019s presale progressed through multiple stages, each marked by increasing token prices. The demand for SPCT tokens exceeded expectations, triggering a cascade effect. The price surged by an astonishing 725% to reach $0.066 in Stage 4, surpassing investors expectations.\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, VC Spectra is poised to exceed the projected end-of-presale value of $0.080. This unexpected surge makes VC Spectra (SPCT) one of the best altcoins in 2023.\n\nVC Spectra stands out as a decentralized hedge fund, rewarding users with quarterly dividends and buybacks fueled by its investment profits. Users not only gain access to exclusive new ICOs during seed/private sales but also enjoy voting rights within the VC Spectra platform.\n\nThe SPCT token, a BRC-20 standard token on the Bitcoin blockchain, serves multiple purposes, including decentralized trading, asset management, and transaction fee payments.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"

        "content": "Unlike traditional meme coins, Galaxy Fox integrates a gaming ecosystem that offers various earning opportunities.\n\nWith price gains everywhere, the cryptocurrency market has entered yet another bull market. Like the rest of the crypto market, $BNB and Ethereum have joined the rally, breaking above significant resistance levels.\n\nBut, after surpassing both $BNB and $ETH, a brand-new meme coin called Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) has become the best crypto to invest in right now. Let's find out the potential performances of these assets in the crypto bull market.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) Offers Massive Earning Opportunities To Investors\n\nMeme coins have built a reputation for outperforming the rest of the crypto market during bull markets. But, Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) isn't a regular meme coin. The project has integrated a gaming ecosystem and several earning opportunities to further boost its bullish potential. This made $GFOX one of the best crypto to invest in for the bull market.\n\nThe Galaxy Fox offers several opportunities for investors and gamers to make money within its ecosystem. This has attracted most of the crypto community to the project. One of the first methods to earn is through the web3 intergalactic runner game, dubbed Galaxy Fox.\n\nPlayers gain rewards for finishing missions and taking over new territory in the exciting virtual world of intergalactic foxes. The game will feature an intergalactic leaderboard that ranks the best players from different cosmos. A player will receive greater rewards the higher they place on this leaderboard.\n\nDigital assets and $GFOX tokens are the rewards gamers will earn. You can also make money with Galaxy Fox through $GFOX staking, the ERC20 coin that powers the ecosystem.\n\n$GFOX is priced at just $0.00066 in the beta crypto presale stage. Market experts have predicted that Galaxy Fox would be one of the best crypto to invest in right now. Because of its blend of meme coins and blockchain gaming, they have forecasted a 35x price increase over the next few weeks.\n\nEthereum and $BNB To See Minimal Gains Over the Next Few Weeks\n\nEthereum and BNB are two of the most recognizable names in the crypto space. They have built a reputation as some of the best cryptocurrency investments over the years. However, they have been recording slow price growth in recent times.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has consolidated following the break above the $2,000 resistance level. However, BNB has risen, reaching a new monthly high of $260 in November after dropping for several months. Both altcoins may see increases in value in the upcoming weeks, according to some analysts.\n\nA price target of $3,000 has been established for Ethereum. But before that, $ETH needs to overcome the resistance level of $2,150. The next significant objective for $BNB is $320. With gains of 48% and 24% looming, both Ethereum and BNB look set to be outperformed by Galaxy Fox by December's end.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nDespite being two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, $BNB and Ethereum look set to be outperformed by the newer Galaxy Fox. The unique gaming model and earning potential of Galaxy Fox have drawn a lot of users to the ecosystem.\n\nBecause the project is still in its beta presale stage, Galaxy Fox is ranked as the best crypto to invest in right now.

        "content": "Steven Nerayoff Lawsuits Will Reveal Facts Supporting Claims Against Key Ethereum Figures, Says Attorney\n\nIn a new chapter of the ETHGate saga, Steven Nerayoff\u2019s attorney, Michael Scotto, said they have ample evidence to back up forthcoming lawsuits against the US Government and additional private actors, as well as whistleblower filings that they intend to release, some of which will implicate major players in Ethereum\u2019s early days.\n\nIn an interview with Cryptonews.com, Scotto detailed how they plan to counter the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d surrounding his client with factual revelations in the lawsuits, which will be filed in New York State and Federal Courts.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, an early Ethereum insider, spent years battling government accusations of extortion before finally getting charges dismissed earlier this year. He is now seeking legal recourse.\n\nBATTLING SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION EVERYWHERE: @SenWarren, I advocate for strong US crypto regulations. PLEASE go after the bad actors in our space. But the DOJ, SEC, & FBI prosecuted me for 3 1/2 years for a crime THEY fabricated. Despite proving this, the sham prosecution continued\u2026 https://t.co/HlNE9Tp3dp pic.twitter.com/qQZxzo20ca \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 22, 2023\n\nScotto asserted that Nerayoff harbors no ill will toward Ethereum itself, which he still wants to see prosper, portraying Nerayoff as pro-crypto and pro-Ethereum philosophically. Nerayoff takes issue with how the project took shape and has objections over particular actions by specific leaders, however, he said.\n\nWhile the validity of Nerayoff\u2019s claims is still unconfirmed, Scotto said the forthcoming lawsuits will likely include charges of malicious prosecution and breach of contract over hundreds of millions in unpaid deals and that the whistleblower fillings will relate specifically to ETHGate.\n\nAs was seen in the recording Nerayoff published last week, he provided key strategic guidance to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015 on tackling mounting structural, legal, and financial problems.\n\nAn X post on November 15 from Nerayoff also hinted at the possibility of fraud being in the mix of allegations that will be revealed in the lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,\u201d he wrote in the post.\n\nThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit. 48-Hour Countdown: Ethereum Insider's Shocking Fraud Expose Looms \u2013 Crypto News Flash https://t.co/uvD6PjfcVJ \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nThough recognizing the need for change, Buterin seemed reluctant to make necessary choices in the recording. A restructuring plan was also proposed but never fully implemented.\n\nSteven Nerayoff Exonerated After Years Defending Against Charges\n\n\n\nScotto explained that his client was focused entirely on defending himself after the September 2019 arrest until finally getting the government to dismiss charges. According to Scotto, Nerayoff felt fighting for his life and reputation against wrongful allegations took priority over releasing the recordings of himself and Buterin earlier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say [he was] fighting for his life, and frankly we were only able to go on the offensive this past February when we filed our motion to dismiss,\u201d Scotto said. \u201cThe case was eventually dismissed on the government\u2019s motion because our motion proved they knew he was innocent and charged him anyway, and they ignored that evidence and simply said \u2018Oh yeah, we can\u2019t prove his guilt.'\u201d\n\nNow exonerated, Steven Nerayoff is going on the offense against parties he believes took advantage of the situation. Scotto said Nerayoff sat in court for years until he could fully clear his name.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to kind of coordinate those (the recordings and lawsuits)\u2026 And so that\u2019s coming shortly,\u201d Scotto told Cryptonews.com. \u201c\u2026The idea was we would put this out there because when those lawsuits became public, we didn\u2019t want people to then question who Steve was and what happened.\u201d\n\nSteve was innocent and we had the evidence to show the case was fabricated and his alleged co-conspirator was a govt informant. @JohnEDeaton1 commented on the dismissal. https://t.co/Tg5ToWsooN look to the east soon. \u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) November 17, 2023\n\nScotto said that the dismissal of charges against Nerayoff followed revelations that government officials knew he was innocent at least seven months prior to arresting him, and that his alleged co-conspirator was an FBI informant who conned Nerayoff out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nLawyer Hints at SEC Role in Ethereum Investigation\n\n\n\nScotto said the facts would illuminate \u201ccoincidences between certain events that were going on at the SEC and steps that were being taken\u201d against Nerayoff. He said one aspect of the lawsuits would deal with \u201cmalicious prosecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big one,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then a couple of breach of contract cases on some of these deals that people basically either took advantage of the situation or [were] a part of creating the situation in order to stiff Steve of literally hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nScotto said the full sequence of events will make clear that the malicious prosecution occurred.\n\nSoooo..given the news about Consensys, JPM , law suits and probable links to the SEC\u2026can we conclude that Ethereum IS a centralised, bankers shit coin ?\u2026 Answers on a post card to @GaryGensler and the @SECGov and it was projection onto #XRP all along #XRPArmy #XRPCommunity \u2014 MADDOG (@PMADDOGMAC) March 5, 2022\n\nWithin the next few weeks, Nerayoff is planning to release the Ethereum whistleblower filings and file the malicious prosecution lawsuit, according to Scotto, who maintained they have ample evidence to back claims of hundreds of millions in damages from broken deals.\n\nButerin and Lubin Silent Amid Accusations\n\n\n\nEthereum leaders have so far been publicly silent amid the bold accusations of shady activities. Scottor said he finds this lack of denial telling given the nature of the allegations.\n\nHe added that Nerayoff\u2019s frustrations also stem from parts of the crypto media declining to cover his exoneration and the questionable circumstances around it. He ultimately released the collection of five Buterin recordings directly on the blockchain\u2014decentralizing it\u2014to get the story out.\n\nEthereum Community Faces Moment of Reckoning\n\n\n\nIf true, these latest allegations may present a crisis moment for Ethereum as doubts multiply regarding its origins and Buterin\u2019s leadership. With the platform aspiring to be a Web3 backbone, this controversy could deepen existing concerns over stagnant Ether prices and developer frustrations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to other people to decide, but I think people will be able to judge based on these objective facts and conclusions that they can draw based on those facts,\u201d Scotto said."

(13/24) \u2014 Jarrod Watts (@jarrodWattsDev) November 23, 2023\n\nWatts outlined multiple issues on Twitter, that Blast currently has no operational network for transactions or bridges back to Ethereum. Instead, the Blast smart contract accepts user deposits and stakes them into Lido ETH staking and MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol to generate yield.\n\nBlast is backed by major VC firms like Paradigm and influencers in the crypto space. However, users must trust that Blast\u2019s team of pseudonymous and mostly unknown developers will eventually build the promised technology to unlock deposits.\n\nWatts showed the bridge could be set to any basic contract, which would then have access to all $335 million in staked assets. The contract is controlled by a multi-signature wallet held by 5 newly-created addresses.\n\nWhile admitting the chances of an exploit seem low, Watts concluded \u201cIf I had to guess, I don\u2019t think the funds will be stolen.\u201d"

        "content": "Blast, a newly introduced Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 network promising \u201cnative yield\u201d on ETH and stablecoin holdings, swiftly secured the position of the third-largest holder of staked ether in just three days post-launch, according to on-chain data.\n\nEtherscan data indicates that the platform has amassed over 140,000 staked Ethereum, valued at approximately $286 million, utilizing the liquid staking protocol Lido since its inception on Nov. 20. This accumulation represents roughly 1.5% of the total staked Ether volume.\n\nDebank\u2019s data further shows that the protocol\u2019s multi-sig wallet currently holds assets worth more than $335 million, comprising Lido\u2019s staked Ether and MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin DAI.\n\nControversy Surrounds Blast\u2019s Pyramid-Like System\n\nHowever, the rapid growth of Blast over the past three days has triggered strong criticism within the crypto community due to its pyramid-like Blast points system, which rewards early users based on the number of users they refer.\n\nDetails on the project\u2019s website outline that users receive an additional 16% of points when their referrals bring in more participants and an extra 8% if the subsequent level brings in additional users.\n\nAn intriguing aspect is that the inflows into the protocol remain one-directional, with no option for withdrawal until its slated launch in February next year.\n\nSimon Dedic, the CEO and managing partner of crypto investment firm MoonRock Capital, stated that Blast\u2019s unique selling point is its \u201cPonzi airdrop farming.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201c[To be honest] Blast_L2 is the perfect illustration of why non-crypto people hate Web3. [It is not]a technical advancement to any of the other L2s, nor does it offer any exciting applications to use on top of it. While disabling withdrawals.\u201d\n\nBesides its Ponzi-like structure, attention has been drawn to Blast\u2019s multi-sig wallet.\n\nPolygon engineer Jarrod Watts believes the protocol needs 3 out of 5 signatories to authorize suspicious actions. Watts highlighted that the addresses associated are new and have unknown identities.\n\nHowever, despite the inherent risks, Watts doubts the possibility of fund theft.\n\nSimilarly, Cos, the founder of SlowMist, noted that Blast operates as an upgradeable contract with a 3/5 multi-signature setup and lacks a time lock."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price breached $2,100 earlier today, continuing its strong rally that began last month.\n\nMany analysts attribute this latest move to increasing institutional interest and growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects as it continues to cement itself as the world\u2019s largest smart contract-enabled blockchain.\n\nWith exciting new projects like Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) launching their presales and gathering momentum, the broader crypto market could have an eventful few weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum Rallies Above $2,000 as Network Growth Accelerates\n\nAfter a dip to $1,900 last week, ETH\u2019s price has rebounded strongly, currently trading 10% higher than its recent low.\n\nEthereum\u2019s uptrend can be attributed to several key factors, including a surge in network activity.\n\nDaily active addresses, transaction fees, and total value locked (TVL) in DeFi have all notched gains, indicating a healthy and growing ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum maintains its dominance in the NFT market, with data indicating an 84% share of the NFT sales volume in Q2 2023.\n\nFinally, there are signs of increasing institutional investment in Ethereum, with prominent mutual fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity expressing their interest in launching spot ETH ETFs.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent lawsuit against Kraken, which did not allege that ETH was a security, has also boosted investor confidence.\n\nWhile regulatory issues remain in the background, Ethereum\u2019s technical strengths and network growth appear resilient as the ETH price rises.\n\nETH Price Outlook Remains Bullish Despite Lingering Competition\n\nWith Ethereum now trading above $2,000, the big question is whether this rally has legs or if it\u2019s becoming overextended.\n\nOn the bullish side, Ethereum\u2019s growing network and development roadmap suggest substantial room for growth.\n\nPlanned upgrades, such as \u201cdanksharding,\u201d have the potential to significantly enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum faces stiff competition from lower-cost Layer-1 blockchains like Solana and Avalanche.\n\nRecently, SOL and AVAX have shown strong performance, suggesting that investors might consider these tokens as viable alternatives to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s brand recognition is unmatched, and based on daily trading volume, it remains the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency, behind only Bitcoin and Tether.\n\nIf Ethereum can maintain its standing, a price target of $2,500 before the end of 2023 seems achievable.\n\nAlthough there may be some volatility in the crypto market, especially given the recent fiasco surrounding Binance and its former CEO, the fundamental strength of the Ethereum blockchain can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nBTCETF Presale Offers Exposure to Highly-Anticipated Crypto Market Milestone\n\nAs Ethereum charges higher, an intriguing new crypto project called Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) has been gaining traction in its presale phase.\n\nBTCETF is an ERC-20 token that aims to capitalize on the anticipation surrounding the approval of the first spot BTC ETF in the US.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s whitepaper, the token\u2019s maximum supply is 2.1 million, and 25% will be burned via five milestones related to the launch and growth of these ETFs.\n\nFor example, 5% of the supply gets burned if the SEC approves an application, and another 5% is destroyed once the ETFs reach $1 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBTCETF also imposes a 5% tax on transactions, which will decrease over time and eventually be phased out once Bitcoin\u2019s value hits $100,000.\n\nSo far, the community response to Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s presale has been very promising.\n\nThe presale has raised almost $1.6 million in under three weeks, leading to coverage from major crypto publications like Cointelegraph and BeInCrypto.\n\nThe presale price is still $0.0058 but climbs higher with each phase, offering investors a chance to get in early on a high-potential project.\n\nIf the first spot BTC ETF does get approved in the coming weeks, BTCETF\u2019s innovative tokenomics and real-world use cases could drive substantial upside, according to analysis from YouTuber Austin Hilton.\n\nFor crypto enthusiasts, this presale could be worth watching closely as it provides exposure to a potentially momentous event in the market\u2019s history.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Blast, a new Layer 2 (L2) solution on Ethereum, has rapidly gained traction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Since its launch earlier this week, it has achieved a Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding $300 million, per DefiLlama\u2019s data. The platform, created by Tieshun Roquerre, known as \u2018Pacman\u2019 and founder of the NFT marketplace Blur, introduces a unique yield generation model for ether and stablecoins, attracting significant investor attention.\n\nThis development marks a significant step in the Ethereum ecosystem, showcasing the growing interest in Layer 2 solutions. Blast\u2019s approach, focusing on native yield generation, is a fresh concept in the space and has been met with enthusiasm by both investors and users. The platform\u2019s ability to accumulate substantial assets quickly underscores its appeal in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlast\u2019s Obscure Governance Raises Transparency Issues\n\nDespite its impressive growth, Blast faces critical challenges and concerns. One of the primary issues is the platform\u2019s current restriction on withdrawals. Users cannot withdraw their funds until February 24 next year, raising questions about liquidity and asset control. This limitation could potentially impact user confidence, especially regarding the accessibility of their funds.\n\nThe governance structure of Blast further complicates its situation. Control over the platform is vested in a multisig contract managed by five signers with undisclosed identities. This lack of transparency raises concerns about accountability and trust, particularly in a market where user confidence is paramount. The absence of features such as a testnet, transaction capabilities, bridges, rollbacks, and sending transaction data to Ethereum further adds to these concerns.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Blast\u2019s architecture has been scrutinized for potential security vulnerabilities. Jarrod Watts, an engineer at Polygon, highlighted potential risks in the platform\u2019s \u201cenable transition\u201d function and the \u201cmainnetBridge\u201d contract. These vulnerabilities could, in theory, allow unrestricted access to all staked ETH and DAI, posing a significant threat to investors\u2019 assets.\n\nLegal experts have also discussed the regulatory aspect of Blast and similar projects. The inconsistent application of securities laws within crypto has been a longstanding issue. Legal figures like Gabriel Shapiro and Wassielawyer have expressed concerns over the disparity in the treatment of various crypto projects. While not directly referencing Blast, they pointed out the challenges in navigating the regulatory landscape, especially for projects that might be perceived as publicly marketing securities, including in the U.S.\n\nBlast Impacts Crypto, Raises Market Questions\n\nDespite these concerns, Blast\u2019s introduction of a native yield model and its achievement in TVL signify a notable advancement in the Layer 2 arena. The project, which has received a $20 million investment from entities like Paradigm and Standard Crypto, now ranks sixth among Layer 2 solutions by TVL, according to L2BEAT.\n\nMarc Zeller from Aave commented on the situation, noting the significant amount of TVL in Blast\u2019s multisig compared to other ecosystems. This observation underscores the impact of Blast on the broader crypto market, though it also hints at potential issues in the space.\n\nRead Also: Changpeng Zhao X Account Temporarily Suspended, Then Restored"

The second-largest crypto Ethereum, up 2% in the last 24 hours is trading at $2,104 considering the cumulative 7.1% increase in one week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price On The Bullish Offensive Bolstered By Whales On A Buying Spree\n\nEthereum price was able to uphold support at $1,930 backed by immense interest in the leading smart contracts token from whales. According to crypto analyst @ali_charts who shared the IOMAP chart from IntoTheBlock, \u201cEthereum overcame key resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044.\u201d Approximately 1.67 million addresses purchased 38.7 million ETH.\n\nThe up leg will likely extend toward $2,500 due to the reducing resistance and a strong support zone between $1,982 and $2,044. Holding above this demand area could propel Ethereum price to rally to new yearly highs.\n\n#Ethereum overcame a key resistance zone between $1,982 and $2,044.

This marked the highest level in three months, bringing total outflows in dollar value to $1 billion in only three weeks.\n\n\u201cOn November 22nd alone, $ETH had a netflow of -148.5k ETH at an average price of $2011. The last time a large netflow like this occurred was on October 30th, after which the price increased 19%,\u201d data by IntoTheBlock paints a bullish picture.\n\nEthereum has crossed the $2000 mark with a significant volume backing its movement.

Therefore, higher support, as established from the fundamental aspect of the market, is paramount for the continuation of the uptrend to $2,500.\n\nIf Ethereum price bows to selling pressure due to the double-top pattern a swing low could follow to sweep liquidity possibly as far as $1,900 ahead of the next breakout.\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that buyers have the upper hand. With a strength of 66 and still trending north, a return to the overbought region is plausible and could invalidate the bearish theory for a quick rebound above $2,500.\n\nRelated Articles"

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index added 4 points to 66 (Greed), though it\u2019s still some way off the indicator's November peak of 74.\n\nBitcoin bounces around in an ascending channel, hitting its three-week upper resistance of $37.8K on Wednesday evening. An intensifying sell-off thwarts attempts to heat the price, but the pullbacks have become less deep over the past three weeks, suggesting the building up of bullish sentiment. At the same time, this relative stabilisation in the range removes local overbought conditions, allowing to stick to gains of the previous advance. A break of resistance could see a quick rise above $40K.\n\nXRP received buyers' support on Wednesday after touching the 50-day moving average, giving it a chance to stabilise after a pullback of more than 20% from its early November peak.\n\nHowever, the buying of Ethereum on its dip below $2,000 on Wednesday was more notable. Active buying in the world's second most-capitalised coin took the price back to $2060, near the top of the range since the 10th of November.\n\nNews background\n\nGrayscale met with the SEC to discuss converting the GBTC ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF.

        "content": "Breaking: Nerayoff Follows Through, Releases 2015 Vitalik Buterin Recordings and Alleges Ethereum Corruption, Fraud\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto community has been rocked by allegations of Ethereum corruption and fraud stemming from co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Last week, early Ethereum insider Steven Nerayoff promised to disclose recordings from 2015 that would expose fraudulent activities by Buterin during Ethereum\u2019s troubled early days. Today, Nerayoff followed through, releasing five conversations between himself and Buterin, as well as a proposed \u201cRescue & Restructure Plan\u201d for the organization from 2015.\n\nIn an X post today, Nerayoff clarified, \u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit.\u201d\n\nThe recordings provide unprecedented insight into Ethereum\u2019s shaky beginnings, portraying a young Buterin seeking guidance from Nerayoff on navigating mounting challenges. They reveal flaws in Ethereum\u2019s structure, decision-making, and leadership in its critical formative stages. If substantiated, these revelations could irreparably damage Buterin\u2019s reputation and the public\u2019s confidence in Ethereum as doubts grow about its long-term viability.\n\nWith Ether prices still lagging below 2022 highs amidst this controversy, the stakes are sky-high. While the validity of Nerayoff\u2019s evidence still needs to be thoroughly vetted in the coming days, the immediate fallout highlights the need for radical transparency, sound judgment, and clear communication. These are essential pillars for any blockchain project eyeing mainstream adoption.\n\nFor Ethereum, the path forward no doubt requires restoring community trust, preventing fragmentation, and implementing strategies focused on platform stability rather than short-term gains.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nSummary and Analysis of the Buterin-Nerayoff Conversations\n\n\n\nThe conversations between Steven Nerayoff and Vitalik Buterin in 2015 cover a wide range of organizational issues plaguing Ethereum in its early stages. Nerayoff plays the role of an advisor, assessing Ethereum\u2019s deficiencies and proposing major changes to ensure its viability.\n\nA key area of concern highlighted in the recordings was Ethereum\u2019s financial management early on. Specifically, Nerayoff sharply criticized the decision not to hedge Ethereum\u2019s Bitcoin holdings as Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuated wildly in the early days.\n\nAs he told Nerayoff, \u201cThere was never a decision made not to hedge. It was just\u2026I mean basically a really huge amount of inertia is probably the only way you could describe it.\u201d\n\nNerayoff heavily critiqued Buterin in the recordings.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the position wasn\u2019t hedged in my opinion is inexcusable. Absolutely inexcusable,\u201d he replied.\n\nHis white paper was unworkable. Gavin fixed it in his yellow paper & he\u2019s the reason 1.0 got out the door. Vitalik is the reason 2.0 never got out the door. And with developers all on Ethereum being false promised scalability that would never come it held back all of crypto. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nTopics Covered\n\nThe discussions touched on several key challenges facing Ethereum, including:\n\nLack of operational infrastructure, especially in Switzerland which was vital for administrative functions\n\nConcerns about Ethereum\u2019s financial decisions, including failure to hedge and speculation on Bitcoin value\n\nLegal and regulatory risks related to money transfers, tax compliance, and promotion of questionable ICOs\n\nPoor internal structure with a lack of clear roles and disjointed teams\n\nIssues with co-founder conduct, communication, and competency\n\nNeed for rebranding and improved community outreach\n\nIntense competition in the blockchain landscape\n\nNerayoff as Advisor on Restructuring\n\nThroughout the conversations, Nerayoff positioned himself as an advisor guiding Buterin. Looking to Ethereum\u2019s future leadership, Nerayoff stressed the urgent need for an experienced executive.\n\n\u201cThe CEO needs to be able to make calls and if you have a CEO, in this type of company, there can be an interim CEO that we can find that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be deep into the technology, but I think your long term CEO does,\u201d he advised Buterin.\n\nHe provided blunt critiques of Ethereum\u2019s deficiencies and proposed radical solutions, including:\n\nComplete operational overhaul involving new executive hires, staff cuts, and redefined roles\n\nLegal and financial audits to identify compliance issues\n\nRelocation of the entire operation to Switzerland\n\nCreation of a new for-profit entity alongside the existing foundation\n\nRebranding and marketing campaign focused on developers\n\n\u201cYou have to decide first of all whether or not you\u2019re willing to do what it takes here. You have to decide whether or not the organization is more important than any individual, \u201d Nerayoff told Buterin during their conversation.\n\nButerin Seeking Solutions\n\nIn their conversations, Buterin acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s precarious situation and the merit of Nerayoff\u2019s proposals but seemed uncertain about how to implement the major changes required.\n\nButerin also admitted to mistakes in financial decisions and a lack of assertiveness in managing the team, deferring frequently to Nerayoff for strategic advice.\n\nIn assessing his leadership skills, Buterin said in the recordings, \u201cIf I had to describe my faults it would be, I was basically trying to abdicate responsibility the whole time.\u201d\n\nExamination of the \u2018Rescue & Restructure Plan\u2019\n\n\n\nThe \u201cRescue & Restructure Plan\u201d outlined by Nerayoff in 2015 provides further insight into the changes he proposed for getting Ethereum back on track. The plan called for a relocation to Switzerland, an executive and staff overhaul, a focus on legal and financial compliance, structural changes, and marketing and branding changes. Details for each category include:\n\nRelocation to Switzerland\n\nMove all operations to Switzerland to centralize control and meet legal obligations\n\nEliminate involvement of \u201cdisconnected\u201d co-founders resistant to relocating\n\nRenegotiate agreements between Swiss entity and related parties\n\nExecutive and Staff Overhaul\n\nHire experienced CFO and COO to provide \u201cadult supervision\u201d\n\nTerminate or reassign co-founders and staff causing issues\n\nReduce salaries and offer equity compensation\n\nIncentivize a recruiter to build out the team\n\nThough recognizing the need for change, Buterin appeared reluctant to make tough staffing choices.\n\n\u201cIf I have to bump up against people, I will, but the thing is, this is one issue I have. It\u2019s exactly the issue that I\u2019ve already said in our calls today a couple of times: basically, these Maltese (unknown) people are cool,\u201d he told Nerayoff in the recordings.\n\nLegal and Financial Compliance\n\nConduct an independent audit of all financial accounts\n\nReview for compliance issues with securities, tax, and money transfer laws\n\nEliminate promotional involvement with questionable ICOs\n\nArchive and annotate all communications for transparency\n\nStructural Changes\n\nStreamline roles and operations based on consultant review\n\nConsolidate fragmented teams and entities\n\nLaunch dedicated teams for initiatives like DAO creation\n\nConsider bringing back exiled strategic thinkers like Charles Hoskinson.\n\nButerin also admitted the aimlessness at Ethereum\u2019s core during their conversations, saying \u201cRight now, Ethereum isn\u2019t really a company, it\u2019s more of an idea, coupled with a nonprofit organization that happens to have some quantity of money attached to it that\u2019ll last us another year.\u201d\n\nBranding and Marketing\n\nComplete rebranding and marketing reset\n\nShowcase successful dApps and create developer support tools\n\nSpotlight Buterin\u2019s personal brand and technical strengths\n\nIn short, the proposed overhaul sought to remedy a wide array of intertwined issues that threatened the foundation\u2019s survival.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Reputation and Market Value\n\n\n\nThe release of the Buterin recordings and restructuring plan has generated intense discussion within the Ethereum community. Many see it as confirmation of long-held doubts about Buterin\u2019s competency during the platform\u2019s origins. Caution should be exercised until a more rigorous examination of the evidence can be conducted.\n\nButerin has already faced growing criticism in recent years as the price of Ether stagnated. His reputation as a visionary thought leader has steadily declined in some peoples\u2019 eyes.\n\nThe controversy also comes at a time when frustration was already high over Ethereum\u2019s failure to reach new price highs. The price of Ether has trended downward through the year despite broader cryptocurrency gains. It continues lagging well below its all-time highs, even as competitors like Solana make inroads.\n\nAdding to the woes are signs that the public\u2019s trust in Ethereum may be fracturing. The risk of splinter groups forming hard forks from the main chain has grown as criticisms mount. Without restored faith in Ethereum\u2019s leadership and direction, its cohesion could be in danger. This new alleged corruption and its unflattering portrait of ineptitude only accelerates the erosion.\n\nFollowing the release of recordings, Ethereum\u2019s price crashed by 4.70% and is currently trading at $1,962.68.\n\nWhile the long-term ramifications remain uncertain, the immediate impact is clearly detrimental for Ethereum. For a platform aspiring to be the backbone of Web3, these are significant setbacks on the road to mainstream adoption.\n\nIs Ethereum Safe?\n\n\n\nThe ramifications of the latest Ethereum scandal remain to be fully determined, but the risks for Ethereum are clearly huge. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation will need to promptly and thoroughly address the allegations if they hope to mitigate the damage.\n\nA point-by-point examination of the evidence presented by Nerayoff is critical. Any confirmed improprieties or incompetence by leadership should be transparently acknowledged. Swift action may be required, potentially including Buterin\u2019s resignation or removal depending on the severity.\n\nRemember this video when I drop the recording & what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures. Is Vitalik the savior they bill him as to make Ethereum scale or is he the reason it never scaled? Decide for yourselves. #CryptoJudas #InconvenientTruths https://t.co/BeGzOpYx4o \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nRestoring public trust will be a monumental challenge for Ethereum. A coherent communications strategy is needed to soothe concerns over Ethereum\u2019s stability and viability for the long term. The community must be reassured that careful steps are being taken to correct course and learn from past mistakes.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, employing the best talent and making sound technical decisions are also imperative. Ethereum\u2019s value rests on its capabilities as a decentralized platform. Its technological progress must not stall amidst organizational turmoil.\n\nWhile the public anger elicited by this scandal presents obstacles, it also offers opportunities for improvement. With wise guidance, Ethereum could emerge stronger by replacing ineffective leaders, mending community ties, and refocusing its mission. But without prudence and skillful management of the fallout, the once-bright future of this blockchain pioneer could swiftly dim."

        "content": "During the recovery of the altcoin market, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, has surged by 4%, pushing the ETH price beyond the $2,000 mark once again.\n\nEthereum Whale Accumulation Continues\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment said that as the Ethereum network growth shoots, the largest wallet addresses have accumulated more than 30% of the total ETH supply over the last year.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a recent development in the Ethereum space, the top 200 Ethereum wallets collectively possess 62.76 million ETH, valued at approximately $124.1 billion. Notably, these wallets have accrued 30.3% more coins since November 21, 2022. Furthermore, a surge in Ethereum wallet activity was observed, with a remarkable 94.7 thousand new ETH wallets created yesterday\u2014the most substantial increase since July.\n\nOn the other hand, the demand for Ethereum derivatives is also on the rise. Maarten Regterschot, an analyst contributing to CryptoQuant, has highlighted a noteworthy trend in the Ethereum (ETH) market. His analysis points to a pattern of \u201csystemic buying\u201d in Ethereum futures, characterized by a substantial rise in open interest. Notably, Ethereum futures have experienced an influx of $700 million, suggesting a deliberate accumulation of assets over a specific timeframe.\n\nETH Exchange Supply Declines\n\nSantiment data reveals that the supply of ETH tokens on exchanges has decreased by nearly 20% over the last six months. This decline in ETH supply on exchanges is at its lowest point in half a year, indicating a positive outlook for potential price increases in the altcoin. The reduced selling pressure on ETH suggests favorable conditions for upward movements.\n\nConcurrently, there is an uptick in activity from ETH wallets, a metric that gauges the demand for Ethereum among market participants and overall network engagement. Increased activity and the creation of new wallets during a price uptrend are often viewed as bullish indicators for the asset.\n\nETH Price to $3,000?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has gained momentum, surpassing the $2,000 support level and instilling confidence in traders with a bullish outlook. The recent rise from $1,930 signals a positive trajectory, hinting at a potential breakout towards the coveted $3,000 mark.\n\nSupporting the optimistic sentiment are golden cross patterns, with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing above both the 100-day EMA and the 200-EMA around two weeks ago. To sustain the uptrend, Ethereum\u2019s price faces crucial challenges at $2,130, where weakening resistance needs to be overcome, and $2,000, which must hold as a robust support level.\n\nThe successful breach of the $2,130 hurdle is pivotal for signaling increasing momentum and ensuring the continuation of the upward trend. Such a move could also negate the sell signal indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, potentially leading to another bullish breakout."

First and foremost, there are the whales. Santiment, an on-chain data expert, revealed that they have been loading up on ETH lately, more specifically, since November 21st.\n\nIndeed, ETH whales (or institutional investors) have increased their ether holdings by 30% over the past two days. This means that the top 200 Ethereum wallets currently represent a treasure of 62,760 ETH. That\u2019s $129 billion, considering the current price of the leading cryptocurrency: $2,060 per unit at the time this article was written.\n\nAdditionally, the growth in the number of ETH crypto wallets has also been a factor. Indeed, 94,700 new wallets have been created since July.\n\nHeading for $3,000?\n\n$4,878.26 was the price of an ETH during its all-time high (ATH) on November 10, 2021. There\u2019s still a long way to go before reaching this level for Ethereum\u2019s native crypto.\n\nIt must first aim for the $3,000 mark. Some analysts remain optimistic, particularly with an increase in demand for ether derivative products.\n\nMaarten Regterschot from CryptoQuant is among them. According to him, the conditions for an ETH bull run are currently aligned to dream of an ether breakout. He, for instance, noticed a significant influx of money into the derivatives market. An additional $700 million allocated around these Ethereum derivative products can only foster a positive sentiment regarding this altcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that huge quantities of ETH have recently left centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs). Santiment estimates they represent about 20% of the ether supply. And this is not without benefits: reducing selling pressure and confirming an Ethereum bull run.

        "content": "Explore Ethereum's rise, BNB's dominance in the bull market, and the unique community-driven spirit of GameStop Memes in decentralised finance.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, three coins have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike: Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and the newcomer making waves, GameStop Memes ($GSM). In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of Ethereum mining, explore the bullish trends in the crypto market, and uncover the unique features of GameStop Memes in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.\n\nEthereum: The Leading Crypto Ecosystem\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, has long been a frontrunner in the crypto sphere. Its revolutionary blockchain technology has opened the doors to many decentralized applications (DApps) and the world of decentralized finance. Ethereum mining, driven by its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, continues to be a focal point for crypto enthusiasts seeking to contribute to the network and earn rewards. The demand for Ethereum mining hardware has surged alongside the bull market, reflecting the growing interest in cryptocurrency. Miners seek efficient and powerful hardware to optimize their mining operations, contributing to the robustness of the Ethereum network.\n\nAs the crypto market gains momentum, Ethereum's value has soared, solidifying its position as a powerhouse in the crypto space.

With innovative features and a robust ecosystem, BNB has become a go-to choice for traders and investors navigating the crypto landscape.\n\nAs Ethereum mining gains traction, BNB's utility in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space adds another layer to the crypto narrative. The bull market has fueled BNB's rise, and its influence on the market dynamics cannot be ignored. GameStop Memes, while acknowledging the dominance of BNB in the crypto market, bring a unique narrative to the forefront. Its focus on community-driven initiatives and homage to the GameStop movement sets it apart, providing enthusiasts with a token that goes beyond market trends.\n\nGameStop Memes Sets Sailing\n\nAs we navigate the exciting landscape of Ethereum mining, ride the waves of the bull market, and explore the intricacies of crypto hardware, GameStop Memes emerges as a beacon of innovation in decentralized finance.

        "content": "Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to address the growing concerns surrounding identity management and data privacy. Its decentralized and secure nature offers a unique approach to managing and verifying digital identities, providing individuals with greater control over their personal information.\n\nOne of the key advantages of blockchain \u2013 based identity management which Ethereum is leading is its ability to eliminate centralized control over identity data.. Traditional identity systems often rely on centralized authorities, making them vulnerable to data breaches and identity theft. Blockchain, on the other hand, distributes identity information across a network of nodes, preventing any single entity from controlling or manipulating data. This decentralized approach enhances data security and reduces the risk of data leakages.\n\nEthereum, a prominent blockchain platform, has played a significant role in the development of blockchain-dependent identity solutions. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract features allow the creation of self-executing digital identities, enabling individuals to manage their own identity data and control access permissions. This approach empowers users to decide who can access their personal information and for what purposes.\n\nIn addition to its decentralized and secure nature, blockchain-based identity management can also improve efficiency and reduce costs. By automating identity verification processes and eliminating the need for intermediaries, blockchain can streamline transactions and save time and money. This can be particularly beneficial for organizations that frequently verify user identities, such as financial institutions and online service providers.\n\nA Guard Against Fraud\n\nIn developing countries, where bank customers have frequently reported identity theft and fraudulent transactions on their accounts, blockchain technology like Ethereum offers a solution to data privacy and security concerns. With Ethereum\u2019s decentralized and immutable nature, user data is secured and cannot be tampered with or accessed by unauthorized parties, preventing identity theft and financial fraud.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to mature and its adoption grows, its impact on identity management is expected to expand significantly. By providing a decentralized platform for managing digital identities, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact online and protect our personal information.\n\nBlockchain technology like Ethereum has the potential to empower individuals by providing them with greater control over their finances, data, and identity. It can also create opportunities for individuals to engage in the digital economy and benefit from its growth. As Ethereum continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more benefits emerge for individuals."

        "content": "TLDR\n\nNuggetRush is gaining attention with a 20% price surge, outperforming mainstream cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Polygon, and Ethereum.\n\nNuggetRush is positioned as a promising crypto investment with its play-to-earn platform and NFTs, which has boosted investor confidence.\n\nCardano is boosted by partnerships; Polygon by institutional adoption; and Ethereum by increased institutional interest.\n\nEven though DeFi companies like Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Ethereum (ETH) are some of the best mainstream cryptocurrencies, they\u2019ve also suffered strong competition from meme coins this year.\n\nMeme coins like NuggetRush (NUGX) have continued constant growth these past weeks, delivering a stellar performance in their presale. This new addition to the meme coin sector has enjoyed high demand during the event, displaying a strong potential to come through on promised profits.\n\nWhile we have seen value growth in ADA, ETH, and MATIC this month, the price of the NUGX token has grown by 20% in a shorter time frame.\n\nThe rise of NuggetRush has strengthened investor confidence in its crypto ICO, provoking forecasts of a tenfold price increase in NUGX. Now, investors are betting that NUGX\u2019s upside potential may trump that of ADA, MATIC, ETH, and MATIC.\n\nLet\u2019s see if NUGX is more promising than ADA, MATIC, and ETH.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) Is Positioned To Dominate The Meme Coin Sector Soon\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) has combined some cryptocurrency trends that are currently in demand. The platform\u2019s inclusion of features such as Web3, gameFi, staking, and gaming has made its NUGX token a utility-rich meme coin.\n\nUtility is something meme coins have been criticized for lacking, and the presence of it on NUGX gives NuggetRush an edge over competing DeFi companies because it will strengthen adoption and drive its value long-term.\n\nNuggetRush\u2019s play-to-earn platform will feature an impact gaming model that allows players to mine multiple locations in search of precious minerals. These mined minerals can then be traded or exchanged for real cash.\n\nThe DeFi gaming experience has a collection of the best NFTs to invest in baked into it. Gaming characters are also NFTs that can be traded on the platform\u2019s marketplace, and the rare RUSHGEMS collection can be traded in for real gold.\n\nThis offering has increased NuggetRush\u2019s recognition as the best crypto investment, especially as NFT holders can earn 20% APY when they stake their assets. The platform is currently on a fast-selling crypto ICO that allows investors to amass the NUGX token for a discount price of $0.012.\n\nNUGX\u2019s 20% growth from $0.01 to $0.012 in just weeks has boosted buying pressure and earned the project a milestone sale of over 49 million tokens and more than $500,000 raised.\n\nNUGX still has about 80% of its profits to hit before the end of the presale, making it the best crypto investment for the upcoming bull run.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nCardano\u2019s (ADA) Partnerships Could Deliver Anticipated Bullish Prices\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Cardano has been making waves in the crypto market lately.\n\nAlthough the platform has been under the shadow of Ethereum, Cardano has grown to secure strategic partnerships and include some innovative developments that continue to earn its developer adoption and investor interest in the ADA token.\n\nThe ADA token has maintained months of bullish prices, jumping by over 67% in two months. Analysts have shown optimism in ADA, considering the bullish momentum expected to enter the market by next year. But Cardano still faces strong competition.\n\nPolygon\u2019s (MATIC) Innovative Strides Point To New Highs\n\nPolygon offers highly promising upside potential. The Polygon protocol has experienced a significant surge in institutional adoption, pushing its price above prior highs, while the MATIC token saw dropping pricing for months.\n\nPolygon\u2019s scalability and inexpensive transaction fees are the reasons behind the surge of interest from institutions. The widespread bullishness that has returned to the market has also affected the performance of MATIC.\n\nThese variables have increased Polygon\u2019s momentum, leading to a recovery of over 96% in 30 days.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Institutional Interest Could Drive Its Value Higher\n\nETH maintained a strong value throughout the bearish prices that affected the market earlier this year. Despite unfavorable prices, ETH has experienced an amazing surge of more than 40% from the lows of last month.\n\nEthereum investors that left have returned, and institutional interest increased due to the bullish momentum that swept across the cryptocurrency space in October. Investors hope that the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF could set off the much-anticipated rise.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the profits that Cardano, Polygon, and Ethereum have predicted, NuggetRush\u2019s spectacular start has drawn attention to meme coins with exponential upside traction. The lower price of NUGX compared to MATIC, ADA, and ETH may appeal to investors drawn to innovative meme coins.\n\nDue to its selection of the best NFTs to invest in, quick presale success, and strong demand, NuggetRush is an excellent option for investors wishing to diversify their holdings and earn constant returns.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Also, Ether (ETHUSD) also rose on Friday to $2,131, close to a local high reached on Nov. 10.\n\nBitcoin is up over 127% so far this year but is still down 44.5% from its peak in 2021. The crypto\u2019s recent strength is supported by optimism that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund may be approved soon in the U.S.\n\nThe cryptocurrency briefly touched $38,000 earlier Friday morning but retreated to levels around $37,800. BTC has now held above the $38,000 threshold for a few hours and appears to be attempting to push higher. Other cryptocurrencies are also seeing price gains today with Cardano up 3.4% and Dogecoin up 3.5%. The price of Ether is now up 10% over the last week.\n\nOn Friday, Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN)\u2019s shares also rose on Friday, up 5.8% to $115.78 on pace to its highest close since May 4, 2022, according to Dow Jones market data. The company\u2019s shares are up 226.34% year-to-date, on pace for the best year on record.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees have reached their highest levels in six months. Per data from IntoTheBlock, they experienced a massive surge over the last three months. This sudden increase in fees is largely attributed to the growing interest in Bitcoin Ordinals, a novel application of the Bitcoin network. Russia Writes off $23bn Debt for Africa \u2013 Putin"

        "content": "Since its official launch in 2015, Ethereum has evolved into the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, presenting a compelling investment opportunity for astute investors.\n\nEthereum, conceptualized by software developer Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and subsequently launched in 2015, stands as an open-source blockchain technology.\n\nIts native cryptographic token, Ether (ETH), forms the backbone of this innovative platform, allowing developers to create diverse applications leveraging blockchain technology on the Ethereum network.\n\nBeyond its association with cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s impact extends across various industries, including insurance, logistics, and healthcare, where its technology fosters widespread innovation.\n\nWhile Ethereum faced initial turbulence, with some investors witnessing a temporary collapse in its net value, strategic individuals capitalized on the downturn by making significant investments during that period.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to emphasize that such a bold move carries inherent risks.\n\nExperts consistently caution against investing more than one can afford to lose, given the volatile and speculative characteristics of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in the cryptocurrency space is undeniable, owing to its colossal size and popularity as the primary network for decentralized applications. Noteworthy applications include NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and Metaverse apps, positioning Ethereum as a pivotal player in shaping the digital landscape.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum is considered relatively safe, with analysts highlighting the ongoing efforts of Ethereum developers to continually enhance the blockchain\u2019s power and utility.\n\nInvestors keen on capitalizing on Ethereum\u2019s growing adoption have various avenues, with the direct acquisition of Ethereum presenting the highest risk but also the potential for substantial profit due to its extreme volatility.\n\nFor a more diversified approach, investors can explore options such as purchasing Ethereum stock.\n\nThis encompasses managed funds specifically designed to invest in Ethereum, as well as companies deeply involved in Ethereum technology.\n\nWhile Bitcoin maintains its lead in terms of the value of coins in circulation, Ethereum is a close second, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $331 billion and garnering support from influential figures like Mark Cuban.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum has proven to be a lucrative investment opportunity. Consider an investor who allocated $1,000 to Ethereum in August 2015; this prudent decision would now be valued at an astonishing $2.23 million, underscoring the substantial returns achievable through strategic investment in Ethereum over the past six years."

        "content": "Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform, predicts Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, can soar above $36,800 by the decade\u2019s end based on total addressable market projects.\n\nIn an in-depth analysis covering Ethereum on November 23, the analytics platform laid out several reasons that will drive the coin to astronomical levels, nearly 18X from spot levels.\n\nEthereum Is King, Predicted To Process $14 Trillion In Value By 2030\n\nThe Token Terminal report cited strengthening network effects, increasing token scarcity, and successful transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus as possible price drivers accelerating the rally towards $36,800. The first-mover advantage and network effects, among others, have given Ethereum a competitive advantage over rival smart contract platforms, including Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).\n\n\n\nUsers can deploy decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions in these competing networks, mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and overly participate in web3 development. Even so, Token Terminal observes that despite Ethereum\u2019s limited scalability and fluctuating gas fees, which tend to rise in trending markets and intense network activity, discouraging engagement, it stands to dominate in the years ahead.\n\nQuantifying future adoption, Token Terminal estimates that by 2030, approximately half of the finance industry\u2019s trillion-dollar revenue will likely be flowing through Ethereum. To put a figure to this, the blockchain analytics platform estimates that over $14 trillion in value will be settled on-chain, with Ethereum as the preferred network.\n\nThe finance industry generates over $28 trillion in annual revenue, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%.\n\nAs it is, this mega valuation expected to flow through Ethereum is more than 10X the total crypto market when writing on November 2023. According to CoinMarketCap, it is slightly over $1.4 trillion with Bitcoin commanding roughly 51%.\n\nMaking projections from this outlook, the blockchain analytics platform noted that the expected adoption via emerging verticals, including identity, content streaming, and even the Internet of Things, could see ETH soar year-over-year in the next seven years.\n\nPotential Challenges That Might Slow Adoption\n\nStill, the study notes that challenges in the future might slow down adoption, potentially stifling growth and prices. Top of the list is the risk associated with regulation. As crypto finds adoption, the research notes that governments might try to interfere to maintain order.\n\nAt the same time, there could be unforeseen changes to the network design tradeoffs, the success and subsequent dominance of layer-2s forcing venture capitals to prioritize funding for off-chain projects and note those deploying on the mainnet.\n\nAdditionally, Token Terminal said even a bug being discovered on-chain, leading to losses and, thus, a dent in confidence, cannot be discounted in the long-term.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "In recent developments, Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has witnessed a substantial rise in its market value, surpassing the $2,000 mark and briefly outperforming Bitcoin. However, a growing legal controversy involving Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, has overshadowed this financial surge. Nerayoff has stirred the waters by claiming that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulators, which he calls \u201cETHGate.\u201d This controversy has emerged alongside Ethereum\u2019s notable resistance levels at $2,080 and $2,090.\n\nLegal turmoil surrounding Ethereum\n\nSteven Nerayoff, who played a pivotal role in Ethereum\u2019s early days, has recently been acquitted of extortion charges. Following his acquittal, he is now turning the tables, announcing a series of lawsuits against the US government and certain key figures associated with Ethereum. His attorney, Michael Scotto, has indicated that these legal actions aim to bring to light substantial evidence concerning regulatory authorities\u2019 alleged preferential treatment of Ethereum.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s legal team is preparing to challenge the allegations of wrongful charges and unresolved financial agreements. They hint at potential whistleblower revelations tied to ETHGate. These lawsuits aim to clear Nerayoff\u2019s name and challenge the narrative surrounding his involvement with Ethereum. While he claims no animosity towards Ethereum, Nerayoff is critical of specific aspects of its evolution and the conduct of some of its leaders.\n\nThe lawsuits are expected to cover claims of malicious prosecution and breach of contract, potentially involving hundreds of millions in unresolved deals. These cases could shed light on incidents involving Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015, along with allegations of fraud.\n\nImplications for Ethereum and Its Leadership\n\nThis legal challenge is crucial for Ethereum as its market value grows. The silence from Ethereum leaders in response to these accusations has only added to the controversy. The crypto community is closely monitoring the potential impact of these developments on Ethereum\u2019s market value and Buterin\u2019s leadership.\n\nSteven Nerayoff has expressed dissatisfaction with the media\u2019s response to his exoneration, and plans to use blockchain technology to release recordings that present his side of the story. This strategy could escalate the crisis for Ethereum, drawing more attention to the platform\u2019s origins and leadership.\n\nIn early 2015, discussions within Ethereum\u2019s leadership, including Nerayoff, centered around a \u201cRescue and Restructuring Plan,\u201d which covered various aspects such as relocation, staff review, compliance, department restructuring, and marketing overhaul. If Nerayoff\u2019s allegations hold, Ethereum might face a significant crisis.\n\nThe Ethereum community finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with potential repercussions on Ether\u2019s prices and growing concerns about its inception and leadership. The outcome of these legal battles and the revelations they might bring could significantly influence the future of Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market."
