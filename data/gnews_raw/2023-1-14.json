        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Jumped Over 10% in the Last 24 Hours - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe cryptocurrency market suddenly came to life on Friday night for the first time since FTX collapsed in early November. Nearly every asset was up big, and some with ties to FTX are significantly higher.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 0.56%) jumped 10.9% and is trading at $20,909 at 8 a.m. ET, surpassing the $20,000 level for the first time since FTX became insolvent in early November. Ethereum (ETH 0.04%) is up 10.1% in the last day to $1,540 and Solana (SOL -0.87%) is the big mover, popping 36.1% to $22.53. Over the past week, the cryptocurrencies are up 23.2%, 21.5%, and 69.9%, respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nMomentum can be a powerful force in cryptocurrencies, especially on the weekend. Trading on weekends often leads to some of the biggest moves, as traders take time off and there's less liquidity (buyers and sellers) in the market.\n\nFueling some of the moves is liquidations of short positions. According to coinglass.com, $730 million of short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours with $240 million of that being in Bitcoin, $261 million in Ethereum, and $26.3 million of Solana short trades.\n\nThe two macro news items this week were inflation data that showed a reduction in prices over the past month, leading to speculation the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising rates and may even be forced to lower rates sooner than expected. This pushed growth stocks and high-risk assets higher this week, but the momentum really hit crypto hard on Friday evening into Saturday morning.\n\nSince FTX got us here, it may in part be FTX that has driven the rally. By that, I mean that liquidators of FTX's assets have recovered $5 billion in assets to return to customers and they've been selling leveraged positions as quickly as possible. That added selling pressure to a market with lower liquidity, and when added to the short positions this can drop prices. But when they slow selling and short positions get liquidated (as they have today), the bounce higher can be swift.\n\nNow what\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies fundamentally comes down to supply and demand. Supply isn't rising very quickly, so demand is the key. When FTX collapsed and the crypto winter wore on, many investors and traders either gave up on the market or took short positions to take advantage of weakness. But over time there should be more and more users of the blockchain, helped lately by significant corporate interest.\n\nI think the long-term trend for cryptocurrencies is still higher, but the volatility seen over the last two months will continue. There needs to be more use cases that disrupt old businesses or create new businesses, and that's when mass adoption will come. That's why Solana is my top cryptocurrency long term, given its low costs and high speed. But a rising tide lifts all boats, and bullishness on crypto overall is helping everything trade higher today."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Bulls Are Turning to LSD - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nThe second week of the new year has been a heady week for the coins, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana racking up serious gains.\n\nZooming in closer, however, the market\u2019s biggest winners are none other than liquid staking tokens, also called \u201cliquid staking derivatives\u201d (LSD).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe tokens behind projects like Lido Finance (up 50.3%) and Rocket Pool (up 23.3%) have absolutely soared over the last few days. The reason? Ethereum devs are rolling up their sleeves ahead of a key upgrade to the network: Shanghai.\n\nLet\u2019s break that down.\n\nSince executing the merge last September, Ethereum has swapped to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This means no more power-hungry mining machines, and, in their place, so-called validators. Validators and miners effectively do the same thing, verifying transactions and ensuring little on-chain mischief occurs.\n\nStill, validators can be better distributed than miners due to their lower cost of capital and maintenance. Instead of having to buy out a multi-million-dollar mining farm somewhere in Siberia and hiring a team of engineers to keep those miners running non-stop, all you need to become a validator is 32 ETH and the know-how to keep a single node connected to the Ethereum network at all times.\n\n32 ETH, though, is still roughly $45,000 at press time, so it\u2019s a hefty sum. And that\u2019s where these LSD projects come into play.\n\nThey let you stake any amount of Ethereum you can afford. In exchange, they\u2019ll give you another token (Lido\u2019s staked ETH token is called \u201cstETH,\u201d for example) that can be put to use elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, you can earn as much as 301% when you stake your stETH in certain parts of the ecosystem, according to DeFi Llama. Its wide adoption in DeFi is likely one of the reasons why it\u2019s so popular; of this type of offering (excluding centralized exchange-based equivalents), Lido commands more than 88% of the LSD market.\n\nBeacon chain depositors over time. (Source: Dune)\n\nWhen compared with centralized platforms like Kraken, Bitcoin Suisse, or services like Staked.US, Lido still enjoys 28.9% of the market. Runner-up Kraken has just 5.57%.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the Shanghai update?\n\nLike the merge, Shanghai is another key upgrade to Ethereum. It will bundle several key improvements, but the most important is the one which will let the above-mentioned stakers finally withdraw their holdings from the network. Currently, that\u2019s not possible (and last year it had a lot of folks rattled about whether it would ever happen).\n\nThis meant that stakers who rushed into the Beacon Chain with their 32 Ethereum or a liquid-staking alternative with a smaller sum were basically depositing funds with merely a promise that one day they\u2019d be able to withdraw.\n\nNow, though, that promise appears to be approaching reality (and reducing stakers risks considerably).\n\nFor more evidence of folks rushing to try out LSDs, look no further than Lido overtaking DeFi\u2019s unofficial central bank MakerDAO as the largest DeFi protocol.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Sees Bitcoin and Ethereum Coming Out of the Current Market Crisis Stronger - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of US-based investment management firm Ark Invest sees public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum coming out ahead after the ongoing market crisis subsides.\n\nIn a letter dubbed \u201cWhat The Market Overlooked in 2022\u201d, sent to clients on Jan 12, Wood highlighted the breakthrough technologies that are already transforming the world, praising blockchain and digital wallets.\n\nThe crypto sector has faced various headwinds since Terra collapsed in mid-2021. More than six leading crypto firms have folded since then, with some like Voyager and BlockFi filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The collapse of FTX two months ago dealt a further blow to the sector, destroying billions of US dollars worth of user assets and threatening the future of more crypto firms.\n\nThis, however, did not interfere with the substratum of blockchain technology which continues to operate as intended, according to Wood.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, underlying public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have not skipped a beat in processing transactions, highlighting that their transparent, decentralized, and auditable ledgers could be a solution to the fraud and mismanagement associated with centralized, opaque institutions,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pundit also fronted Digital wallets as the next big thing, noting that they were replacing cash and credit cards. A recent report by California-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research estimated the global crypto market wallet market to grow to about $48.27 billion in 2030 from 2022 estimates of about $8.42 billion. Crypto wallets help users keep their crypto assets safe and secure by storing their private keys. They also allow users to send, receive and spend cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Digital wallets overtook cash as the top transaction method for offline commerce in 2020 and accounted for ~50% of global online commerce volume in 2021.\n\nWood Buys More Crypto-Related Shares\n\nFollowing the FTX collapse, the share of trading volume on decentralized exchanges, which allow investors to trade without a central intermediary spiked 37%. Centralized crypto exchanges such as Binance and Crypto.com also saw a drastic increase in outflows as investors took flight in fear of an FTX-like incident.\n\nWood continued to express hope in the crypto sector, scooping more Coinbase shares. According to her, unlike other exchanges, \u201cthe fallout from Terra/Luna\u2019s and FTX\u2019s collapses propelled Coinbase\u2019s share of fiat-based exchange volume (excluding Binance International) by 18 percentage points, from 22% in June to 40% in December.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Ark Invest purchased 74,792 shares of Coinbase (COIN) for around $3.28 million, bringing its total holdings to 8.596 million shares valued at around $408.7 million based on Coinbase\u2019s last closing price of $47.55 on Thursday. That stash now represents 2.92% of the firm\u2019s entire portfolio allocation."

        "title": "Polygon tests zero-knowledge rollups, mainnet integration inbound - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol Polygon (MATIC) is carrying out performance testing of zero-knowledge rollup (zk-Rollups) technology ahead of full integration with its mainnet.\n\nThe development of the technology, called Polygon zkEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), has been ongoing for over three years by the Polygon Hermez team. The team has already confirmed that zero-knowledge proofs are possible on Ethereum by generating over 12,000 zk-Proofs in a primary version of the zkEVM testnet.\n\nDavid Schwartz, project lead of Polygon zkEVM and PolygonID, unpacked the development of the functionality in correspondence with Cointelegraph. Layer-2 platforms have continued to evolve and improve functionality which has played a key role in driving Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nAs he explained, zero-knowledge rollups have increased the speed at which layer-2 platforms can achieve finality while ensuring secure validation of transactions with zero-knowledge technology. In blockchain terms, finality is the point at which a block of transactions is considered to have been permanently and irreversibly added to the blockchain:\n\n\u201cFinally, we have zkEVMs, such as Polygon zkEVM, that offer all the above in addition to the equivalence to Ethereum Virtual Machine with its advanced methods of zk-STARKs and zk-SNARKs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Schwartz, Polygon zkEVM includes the first complete source code available EVM-equivalent zkProver, which passes all Ethereum vector tests at over 99%. He described the completion of validity proofs for conventional user transactions as \u201cthe most challenging and rewarding effort\u201d since his team began developing its native zkEVM.\n\nTwo years ago, the Polygon team estimated that developing zk-Rollups with EVM compatibility would take up to ten years. Given the strides made, the team describes zkEVM as the end game, combining advances with layer-2 scalability and fast finality. This offers a myriad of benefits to users when adding greater throughput and lower fees.\n\nCointelegraph also queried the difference between Polygon zkEVM and fellow Ethereum layer-2 scaling network StarkNet\u2019s proprietary ZK-SNARK and ZK-STARK technology. As previously reported, Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge, or zk-SNARKS, primarily increases scalability by batching thousands of transactions with a single proof to confirm validity on-chain.\n\nRelated: What the Ethereum Merge means for the blockchain\u2019s layer-2 solutions\n\nSchwartz said the main difference between the projects is that zkEVM focuses on natively scaling the Ethereum ecosystem instead of other zk-Rollups just scaling transactions and enhancing performance in a different VM format.\n\nPolygon\u2019s approach purports to meet the classification of a type 2 zkEVM described by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in August 2022. As per Buterin\u2019s summary, type 2 zkEVMs aim to be fully compatible with existing applications, but make minor modifications to Ethereum for easier development and faster proof generation. Schwartz added:\n\n\u201cIn contrast, StarkNet is positioned as a Type 4, introducing a new high-level language and requiring transpilers to translate solidity code into their language.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Schwartz welcomed the opportunity to have more benchmarks and source code available from other projects in order to learn from different approaches. Activity on Ethereum layer-2 solutions continues to grow, with blockchain data showing that transaction volume Arbitrum and Optimism overshadowed transactions on the Ethereum mainnet going into 2023."

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain is the second biggest blockchain in the world. It\u2019s also the poster boy, as it were, of flexibility. The chain hosts hundreds of dApps and thousands of transactions are completed on it every day. Ethereum can host this number of transactions because it has smart contract compatibility, which means anyone can build anything they want on it via a contract.\n\nBut there\u2019s one problem. The popularity of Ethereum means that there are too many projects built on it. Since Ethereum has a scalability problem, the chain struggles to complete all these transactions in time. This means that people experience slow and buggy transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. It also means that the transaction fees can rise to unviable heights.\n\nThis was a huge structural problem for Ethereum as it meant that it couldn\u2019t fulfill its potential. However, the solution to this problem wasn\u2019t to tinker with Ethereum\u2019s code to make it faster. It was to create a new parallel chain.\n\nPolygon was that new and parallel chain. The Polygon chain is a fast parallel blockchain that\u2019s running alongside Ethereum. It\u2019s a side chain of Ethereum that makes it faster and connects users, at the same time, to all the projects on Ethereum.\n\nAside from the fact that Polygon is hitched onto the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s just like every other Layer-1 (L1) blockchain. This means it also has a consensus mechanism, blocks, and validators.\n\nPolygon, like Ethereum, runs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This means that validators have to stake their MATIC tokens\u2014 which means they agree not to use or sell them\u2014 and hope that the system picks one of the validators to validate a particular block.\n\nValidators of Polygon then validate the new block of transactions and add them to the accepted pile. In exchange for this, they get a cut of the newly minted MATIC. Validators who are malicious or mischievous will lose much of their staked MATIC, and this incentivizes honest behavior amongst validators."

But no one really knows what\u2019s going on under the hood or what a Catalytic Converter does.\n\n(Except my mechanic Rico, that mfer is the Car Whisperer.)\n\nThe important thing you need to know is there are different cars for different use cases.\n\nYou don\u2019t wanna use a Fiat car for your 8-person family.

Unless you wanna end up stranded and on an improv episode of Survivor.\n\nYou get the point \u2013 different cars for different cases.\n\nBlockchains are the same way. There is no \u201cone-blockchain-fits-all.\"\n\nOne blockchain might be faster, while another is more secure. One might be better for NFTs, while another is better for decentralized finance apps.\n\nWhich is exactly why we\u2019re big believers that the future of crypto is multichain.\n\nSo today, we\u2019re presenting the Milk Road Blockchain Show. Where we\u2019ll take a look under the hood to better understand some of the blockchains and what they\u2019re good for.\n\nAnd we\u2019re teaming up with a special friend to make it all happen\u2026\n\nthirdweb \u2013 they provide tools for companies and developers to build Web3 apps. thirdweb doesn\u2019t just think the future of crypto is multichain, they\u2019re building tools compatible with over 10 different blockchains, including every single EVM chain.\n\nFirst up, we got\u2026\n\nBITCOIN\n\nBitcoin is la creme-de-la-creme of crypto. When you think of Bitcoin, you think of things like\u2026.\n\nLuxury. Security. Durability. And of course, OG status.\n\nSo it\u2019s only right to compare Bitcoin to\u2026 *drumroll* \u2026The Bentley.\n\nHere\u2019s how Bitcoin and Bentleys are similar:\n\n1/ Both are slow to produce\n\nBentleys might be fast, but they\u2019re one of the slowest producing manufacturers out there.\n\nIn total, it takes 400+ hours to produce one single Bentley Mulsanne. ~136 hours are spent just on the interior trim.\n\n(Almost as long as my wife takes on her eyeliner. As she says, \"Beauty takes time\u201d.)\n\nBitcoin is the same way \u2013 it's the slowest blockchain out there.\n\nIt can only process 7-10 transactions per second and the average transaction time is ~10 minutes. (But those numbers are on a good day \u2013 when the stars are aligned, the moon is full, and LeBron is hitting all his 3\u2019s.)\n\nSometimes transactions can take up to 60 minutes. Which is why all Bitcoin users know this pain\u2026\n\n2/ Both take a lot of energy & work to produce\n\nFun fact: it takes ~45 people to build one single Bentley W12 engine. And some of those lucky people have to go through a 600-point checklist before the final sign-off.\n\nIn other words, it takes a f*ck ton of energy & work to make the Bentley go vroom.\n\nBitcoin is the same way. Its what\u2019s called a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. Now, we won\u2019t go into all the nitty gritty details of what PoW is, but all you need to know is\u2026\n\nIt takes a lot of work & energy to maintain the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUses 7x more energy than Google\u2019s global operations\n\nUses more energy than countries like Denmark, Chile, Finland, and the Netherlands\n\n1 BTC transaction uses as much energy as 50 days of power for the avg US house\n\nBut all this time & energy are needed. And that\u2019s because\u2026\n\n3/ Both are secure & durable\n\nYou see, blockchains have a trilemma between being scalable, being decentralized, or being secure. And they can only pick 2 out of those 3\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like the college trilemma \u2013 you have to pick between good grades, a good social life, or good sleep. Which is why the Milk Man was living on Red Bull and 26-minute power naps. (Don\u2019t try this at home, kids.)\n\nWhat Bitcoin lacks in scalability, it makes up for in security & decentralization. It\u2019s one of the most secure & durable blockchains out there. It\u2019s lasted 14+ years and hasn\u2019t had a major hack take it down, yet.\n\nBentleys are similar \u2013 they\u2019re all about durability & security. ~80% of all Bentleys ever created are still functional (#BuiltDifferent).\n\nThey even have bullet-proof cars for celebs & royalty like Queen Elizabeth (R.I.P.), James Bond, and the Milk Man.\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n4/ Both are symbols of luxury & have unique use cases\n\nBitcoin & Bentley are both expensive.\n\nBTC hit an all-time high of $69k and has the largest market cap out of any crypto\n\nBentleys can cost up to ~$300,000\n\nIn other words, if someone owns Bitcoins or Bentleys\u2026 you\u2019ll know it. They\u2019ll be at your nearest Country Club or SoHo House talking about it. And yes, I\u2019ll eavesdrop to hear how many they own.\n\nWhich makes Bentleys & Bitcoin good for one thing.\n\nBentleys are a good weekend-flex car. You aren\u2019t gonna use a Bentley to drive in the city much or use it to help you move.\n\nBitcoin is good as a secure, decentralized, financial asset. Do you like money but don\u2019t like the government? Bitcoin is your answer.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t really going to use the Bitcoin blockchain for NFTs or Decentralized applications.\n\nThat\u2019s where other blockchains come in\u2026\n\nETHEREUM\n\nEthereum can do a lot of things. You can build DeFi apps. You can create NFTs. You can use it as a financial asset.\n\nIt\u2019s a multi-purpose chain. So it\u2019s only right to compare Ethereum to\u2026 Toyota.\n\nHere\u2019s how Ethereum & Toyota are similar:\n\n1/ Both are versatile\n\nToyotas are used for anything and everything.\n\nGot kids? Say Hello to the Toyota Sienna. The King of all Mini Vans.\n\nWant speed? Look no further than the Toyota Supra.\n\nWant comfort & convenience? Roll up in the Toyota Corolla.\n\nWant to pull a mountain? The Toyota Tundras got your back.\n\nWant to save the environment? Have no fear, the Toyota Prius is here.\n\nEthereum is the same way. All the most popular NFTs, DeFi apps, etc are on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThat\u2019s because Ethereum is scalable. Remember the blockchain trilemma? Well, Vitalik and the Ethereum founders decided to prioritize scalability above all.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all thanks to something called smart contracts. In simple terms, they\u2019re computer programs stored on the blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nIt lets users transact securely & anonymously without having to go through a central authority. Smart contracts are at the core of everything on Ethereum. (DeFi apps, NFTs, etc all use em\u2019.)\n\n2/ Both are eco-friendly\n\nRemember how much work & energy it takes to complete a Bitcoin transaction?\n\nWell, Ethereum is the opposite. It\u2019s now running on what\u2019s called Proof-of-Stake (PoS,) which a lot less energy consuming than PoW.\n\nEthereum used to use PoW, but it made the switch over to PoS last year during The Merge.\n\nWhy? By using PoS, Ethereum is using 99.99% less energy than it did before. In other words, it went from a Toyota Supra (sports car) to a Toyota Prius (eco-friendly, hybrid car.)\n\nWe won\u2019t go through all the specifics here, but if you wanna learn more about it here\u2019s an amazing thread by our friend Jon Wu. The best part is he explains it like a mechanic with a Brooklyn accent\u2026 fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and how they promise to scale the Ethereum network and reduce gas fees. It\u2019s a little confusing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to explain ETH L2 to you like a mechanic from Brooklyn: \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd27 https://t.co/EHcWo3UOFO \u2014 jonwu.eth (@jonwu_)\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\n3/ Both are super popular, which means it can get expensive to use\n\nEthereum has become one of the most used blockchains.\n\nThe most popular NFT collections like Bored Ape, Crypto Punks, etc and DeFi apps like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave are all on Ethereum. Which is great\u2026\n\nExcept for the fact that the more popular Ethereum has become, the more expensive it is to use the blockchain to complete transactions. No bueno.\n\nWhen things are busy on the Ethereum blockchain, it can sometimes cost you up to $100+ just in transaction fees. It\u2019s one of the big downsides of using Ethereum right now.\n\nWhich is where Layer 2s come in\u2026\n\nLAYER 2s\n\nTo help explain, let\u2019s go back to the Toyota comparison. Toyotas are one of the most popular cars out there. And it\u2019s now become the most used car for\u2026\n\nUber rides.\n\nBut as more people use Uber, the more expensive it gets. AKA if you\u2019re using Uber on a Friday night, you\u2019re gonna need to take out a loan from the bank beforehand.\n\nThat\u2019s where Layer 2s come in. You can think of them as yellow taxi cabs.\n\nSure, they\u2019re not as convenient or prestigious and sometimes smell like vomit from the drunk guy the night before. BUT\u2026\n\nThey make it cheaper, faster, and more scalable to do transactions on Ethereum. And there are a few L2s that have been making some noise recently:\n\nARBITRUM\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup. It makes transactions a lot cheaper & faster.\n\nTo compare, sending ETH will cost ~$0.05 on Arbitrum vs $0.82 on Ethereum's main network. (16x cheaper)\n\nAnd our friends at thirdweb tell us Arbitrum has put up big numbers on their supported blockchain. There have been 10k+ transactions, 500+ unique smart contracts, and 400+ unique deployers.\n\nPOLYGON\n\nPolygon is a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform. And it was a top contender for MVP (Most Valuable Protocol) of 2022.\n\nIt had the biggest partnerships of the year \u2013 including with Starbucks, JP Morgan, and Disney. And its usage & adoption has exploded recently.\n\nNumber of transactions on Polygon smart contracts (deployed on thirdweb.)\n\nOctober: 166,481\n\nNovember: 232,203\n\nDecember: 592,738\n\nOPTIMISM\n\nOptimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain \u201cbuilt by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s also seen a huge spike in activity recently. Optimism transactions on thirdweb jumped 6,000% month on month in December. They had 350k+ transactions, 400+ unique contracts, and 100+ deployers.\n\nIn a nutshell: The Layer 2 Wave is here. A bunch of DeFi apps, NFT collections, etc are all being built using L2s on Ethereum.\n\nSOLANA\n\nSolana is built for one thing\u2026 speed. The creators of Solana were a lot like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.\n\nThey feel the need, the need for speed.\n\nSo, it\u2019s only right to compare Solana to\u2026 The Alfa Romeo.\n\nHere\u2019s how Solana & Alfa Romeo are similar:\n\n1/ They\u2019re both super fast\n\nAlfa Romeo can hit the speed of 200 mph and can hit 0-to-60 in under 3.6 seconds.\n\nSolana is one of the fastest blockchains out there. It can complete ~65k transactions per second. It\u2019s 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin. 4,000 times faster than Ethereum. 2x faster than a bullet or Usain Bolt.\n\nIf you wanna go fast, use Solana. It\u2019s currently used a lot by game developers and users that prefer a faster blockchain.\n\nBut be warned. With speed comes\u2026\n\n2/ Both have performance issues\n\nSolana and Alfa Romeo are both known to break down more than the McDonalds ice cream machine.\n\nSolana went down 8 times last year\n\nAlfa Romeos are known for breaking down at least once within the first few months of usage. If you don\u2019t know where your local car shop is, you will now.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWell ladies & gents, that\u2019s a wrap for this year's Milk Road Car Show. And remember, the future is multichain. There will always be different chains for different cases.\n\nThere are a bunch of blockchains we didn\u2019t cover here, so if you\u2019d want a Part 2 reply to this email with \u201cEncore please!\u201d\n\nFor blockchains to grow, they need developers.

        "content": "After collapsing more than 80 percent over the course of last year, Solana is having a stellar in 2023. The price of SOL has more than doubled this month, rising more than 58 percent to $23.70 in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko.\n\nNot only that, but the once-celebrated \"Ethereum killer\" saw its highest trading volume since the week of the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which crashed Solana along with most of the crypto market in November.\n\nIt's a remarkable rebound for Solana. Less than a month ago, SOL was closing out the year down 94 percent, hitting a two-year low of $8.17 and dropping out of the top twenty coins, per CoinGecko data.\n\nNow, Solana briefly bumped Polygon MATIC out of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, which cleared $9 million on Saturday afternoon. Its price is also at its highest point since FTX fell. In one 24-hour period last weekend alone, Solana jumped 21 percent.\n\nCan I just say, I\u2019m proud of all you that have been GRINDING through this ass kicking. Appreciate all of you that put it out there each day for $SOL Really it\u2019s all of you that make this place that special. It\u2019s why I choose to be here, it\u2019s really the chain that feels like \ud83c\udfe0 \u2014 Topo Gigio | topo.sol (@TopoGigio_sol) January 16, 2023\n\nSolana Surges 16% as Doge-Themed SHIB Rival BONK Takes Off\n\nSolana's recent run of good news was boosted by BONK, a Solana-based meme token, which set off a flurry of buzz around Christmas and pushed the price of SOL to a seven-day high at the turn of the new year. Coin collectors seemed eager to celebrate a new dog-themed entry into the marketplace, alongside Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Ethereum-based token Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nBONK logged an eye-popping 3,300% spike in the first week of the year\u2014albeit to $0.00000487, according to CoinGecko. While a subsequent five-trillion token burn didn't keep BONK on an upward trajectory, its price sliding 69 percent last week, it's still sitting atop a $57 million market cap. In fact, its price even rose 20% over the past 48 hours.\n\nStory continues\n\nHelium Founder Explains Why the Crypto Wireless Network Is Moving to Solana\n\nAnother contributing factor may be the planned migration of Helium to Solana. Announced in September, the price of SOL saw a small bump as a result, while Helium saw its native token value fall. But the team behind Helium\u2014a distributed wireless network that offers users crypto tokens as rewards for sharing their home internet service\u2014has presented a unified front in favor of the long-term benefits that Solana will provide.\n\n\u201cYou can do stuff and it happens instantaneously,\u201d Nova Labs CEO Amir Haleem told Decrypt, praising Solana's much-celebrated transaction speed, and saying development work will be \u201cquite a lot easier.\""

        "title": "How to connect the Avalanche network to MetaMask? - TradingView",
        "content": "One of the main properties advanced in blockchain technology is interoperability, the art of different blockchains communicating with one another. Interoperability is crucial when it comes to exchanging data and assets such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or cryptocurrencies while enjoying the best of two or more platforms to save on fees, for example, or transact faster.\n\nThe Avalanche blockchain is an interoperable, versatile platform and cryptocurrency network that addresses scalability, security and decentralization issues with a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) governance type. It was developed by Ava Labs, a New York-based research and development company, to launch decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise blockchain applications.\n\nIt is powered by its native token, AVAX, and has smart contract functionality that puts it in direct competition with Ethereum. The PoS platform\u2019s smart contracts primarily support decentralized applications (DApps) and autonomous blockchains with fast transaction processing times, a reward structure incentivizing participation, and advanced interoperability.\n\nAvalanche interaction with Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystems is facilitated by the crypto wallet MetaMask, a software that as many as 10 million people use. It can be downloaded as a browser extension on Chrome and Firefox or as an iOS and Android mobile phone app. Before interacting with Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and DApps, users need to add the Avalanche network to their MetaMask wallet, and this guide will show them how to do it.\n\nHow to set up MetaMask?\n\nMetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to connect with DApps besides storing Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens. Connecting MetaMask to Avalanche allows AVAX users to enjoy all the DApps Ethereum has to offer without leaving the Avalanche network. The Avalanche interoperability also makes the network more accessible for developers to build on since it shares its smart contract programming language, Solidity, with Ethereum.\n\nIt needs to be noted that there are three blockchains on the Avalanche network: the Exchange Chain (X-Chain), the Contract Chain (C-Chain) and the Platform Chain (P-Chain).\n\nThe Avalanche X-chain\u2019s primary use is to send and receive AVAX and cannot be employed on Web3 platforms or added to Web3 wallets like MetaMask. The P-Chain is the metadata blockchain on Avalanche that coordinates validators, keeps track of active Subnets \u2014 sovereign networks that define their own rules regarding their membership and tokenomics \u2014 and enables the creation of new Subnets.\n\nOnly the Avalanche default smart contract C-Chain wallet is compatible with MetaMask, an essential piece of information to bear in mind since, if you select the wrong chain when adding Avalanche to MetaMask, you may lose your coins.\n\nTherefore, to transfer AVAX from an Avalanche wallet, a user\u2019s tokens need to be in the C-Chain wallet or use an exchange wallet integrated with C-Chain, such as Binance. If the token does not reside in the C-Chain, it can easily be transferred internally from any of the other two Avalanche blockchains by paying a small transaction fee.\n\nMetaMask can be added as an extension to Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave browser and iOS or Android on mobile from the MetaMask website; however, for the purpose of this article, the Chrome extension will be considered.\n\nUsers must verify the legitimacy of the MetaMask website to avoid being tricked by scams and compromised web pages. Downloading the right extension from the official website is strictly recommended.\n\nFrom the MetaMask website, click \u201cDownload for Chrome\u201d and \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d to add the extension. Further steps are listed below:\n\nInstall the MetaMask Chrome extension and click \u201cGet Started\u201d on the MetaMask welcome page.\n\nYou can import your existing cryptocurrency wallet, but you\u2019ll need to enter the wallet seed phrase; then click on the \u201cImport wallet\u201d option.\n\nYou can also set up a new wallet by clicking on the \u201cCreate a wallet\u201d button. Here, you must create a secure password to access the wallet from your device.\n\nEssential information about your seed phrase will be displayed on the next page, and you\u2019ll have to pay particular attention to it. The seed phrase, or recovery phrase, is a crucial security feature and backup for your cryptocurrency wallet. It will allow you to access your wallet with your tokens even if you lose or forget your password.\n\nNext, click on the lock button to view the seed phrase. Take note of the words in the proper order, store them securely offline, and never share them with anyone. Your assets may be at risk if someone compromises your device and gets access to your seed phrase.\n\nThe system will ask you to repeat the seed phrase on the next page; make sure you select the words in the correct order.\n\nClick \u201cConfirm\u201d to finish and then \u201cAll Done\u201d to access your new wallet.\n\nThe process described above will connect MetaMask automatically to Ethereum. However, you must complete the steps highlighted below to add the Avalanche network to MetaMask.\n\nHow to set up the Avalanche network on MetaMask?\n\nConnecting MetaMask to Avalanche is a rather straightforward process. Once you\u2019ve logged in to the MetaMask wallet, click on the Ethereum mainnet drop-down menu and select Custom RPC, as shown below.\n\nCointelegraph\n\nYou will be redirected to the \u201cAdd a network\u201d page, where you\u2019ll need to add the following information:\n\nNetwork Name: Avalanche Network\n\nNew RPC URL: https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc\n\nChainID: 43114\n\nSymbol: AVAX\n\nExplorer: https://snowtrace.io/\n\nYou can view the \u201cAdd a network\u201d requirements to use MetaMask on Avalanche here:\n\nCointelegraph\n\nClick on \u201cSave\u201d to complete the process. You\u2019re now ready to use MetaMask on Avalanche and all its DeFi and Web3 applications.\n\nHow to send AVAX tokens to MetaMask?\n\nAfter connecting the Avalanche network to MetaMask, you can send your AVAX coins from an Avalanche wallet to your MetaMask wallet. Remember that only the C-Chain is compatible with MetaMask.\n\nLog in to your Avalanche wallet and transfer your tokens to the C-Chain blockchain if they reside on the P- or X-Chain blockchains.\n\nSimply click \u201cCross Chain\u201d on the left menu bar and select \u201cC-Chain\u201d as the destination chain.\n\nEnter the amount you wish to transfer and click \u201cConfirm.\u201d A small transaction fee will be added to the final amount.\n\nYou can now send the AVAX coins to MetaMask by clicking on \u201cSend\u201d from the left menu. Cointelegraph\n\nSelect \u201cC Contract\u201d as the source chain and enter the amount you want to send to MetaMask. Cointelegraph\n\nNow go to your MetaMask wallet and copy the address, which you will paste into the Avalanche wallet in the \u201cTo Address\u201d field. Cointelegraph\n\nCheck whether you have sufficient gas for the transaction fee.\n\nConfirm and finalize the transaction.\n\nOnce the transaction is confirmed, you will be able to view the AVAX coins in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nWhat other wallets are compatible with Avalanche?\n\nMetaMask is surely the versatile DeFi wallet for running smart contracts and DApps; however, AVAX can be transferred, stored, staked and exchanged in other cold and hot wallets. With over 90 million verified users worldwide, the Coinbase wallet is a secure and easy-to-use hot wallet to exchange, earn and store AVAX. Security is enhanced through the software\u2019s two-factor authentication making it a safe wallet to use for both beginners and advanced users.\n\nThe Trust Wallet is another hot wallet that supports all DeFi programs, including NFT storage, Web3 capabilities, staking, swaps and purchases. It supports the Avalanche C-Chain in addition to many other blockchains so that DApps could be bridged to AVAX easily. This hot wallet is one of the most utilized among Web3 enthusiasts because of its user-friendly interface and versatility.\n\nLedger Nano S or X cold wallets both support Avalanche, and users can access and store their AVAX tokens through all Avalanche chain addresses. Cold wallets are recommended over hot wallets, as the private keys to access the cryptocurrency are stored offline in a hardware device, making it difficult for hackers and malicious actors to steal them."

        "content": "Shiba Inu Team announced the launch of the beta L2 blockchain platform (Shibarium) that aims to lower gas fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nTransactions on Shibarium occur \u201coff-chain\u201d and are communicated back to the Ethereum blockchain, which allows for lower costs and faster processing times.\n\nShibarium also provides a robust development framework for the community to build their vision into the blockchain, and has potential uses in gaming, social media, education, and supply chains.\n\nThe platform also supports Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and has a native token, $BONE, which will be used to pay for gas transactions and reward validators and delegators within the protocol. $BONE can currently be obtained through ShibaSwap and other platforms, and is expected to gain more attention and adoption as the launch of Shibarium approaches.\n\nA new blockchain platform, Shibarium, is set to launch as a solution for high gas fees on the Ethereum network from the Shiba Inu team.\n\n\ud83c\udf56 Introduction to Shibarium: Shiba Inu's Layer 2 Network \u2014 Rejoice #ShibArmy! Shibarium Beta is about to be launched, and through this article we want to introduce some basic concepts in order to provide clarity to the community.\n\n\n\nRead more: https://t.co/xWyPaVlQQ4 \u2014 Shib (@Shibtoken) January 15, 2023\n\nThe launch of Shibarium is to solve a common barrier for users looking to make small transactions in their day-to-day lives, with added fees of $50-$100 on top of a fractional $15 purchase, making it impractical and unrealistic for many to use these digital assets in their daily transactions.\n\nShibarium is a Layer 2 blockchain, meaning that transactions occur \u201coff-chain\u201d and are communicated back to the Ethereum blockchain. This allows the Shibarium blockchain to handle the majority of the processing work, which in turn reduces bandwidth and lowers costs and processing time for users.\n\nBeyond the cost and speed benefits, Shibarium\u2019s development framework provides robust functionality to allow the community to build their vision into the blockchain. Decentralized Applications (dApps) are a critical component of the expansion of Web 3, and their uses are nearly endless. Gaming, social media, education, and supply chains are just a few of the many potential uses for dApps on Shibarium.\n\nThe platform also supports Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with the ability to create chain-specific NFTs. These tokens can be used for a variety of applications such as event tickets, in-game items, art and music, and digital real estate.\n\nShibarium and $Bone\n\nShibarium, the highly anticipated Layer 2 blockchain platform, has also announced that its native token, $BONE, will be used to pay for gas transactions and reward validators and delegators within the protocol.\n\nSince its launch in July 2021, the main function of $BONE has been linked to governance, but, according to the team, it will now also play a crucial role in the upcoming Shibarium launch.\n\nValidators and Delegators are assigned a percentage of a token called $BONE that are distributed each time a specific time is reached. They will also be given a portion of another token called TREAT. A commission is a fee taken by the validator for the operation and maintenance of the node. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of tokens staked by each of them, after validator commissions.\n\nThe total supply of $BONE is 250 million, with 20 million of those tokens reserved to reward validators and delegators in the coming years. The allocation of these tokens was determined through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) process, which was voted on by the Shiba community.\n\n$BONE can currently be obtained through ShibaSwap and other decentralized and centralized platforms, and its contract address is:\n\n0x9813037ee2218799597d83d4a5b6f3b6778218d9.\n\nAs the launch of Shibarium approaches, $BONE is expected to gain more attention and adoption as it will be at the forefront of gas transactions and rewards within the protocol."

        "title": "Polygon (MATIC) Bull Run As Final Testnet For Zero-Knowledge Rollups Approaches - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Polygon, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, is currently conducting performance evaluations of its zero-knowledge roll-up technology prior to its official integration with the mainnet, as per a recent report.\n\nIn October 2022, Polygon announced the launch of its zero knowledge-EVM public testnet, a scaling tool designed to facilitate lower-cost transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPolygon zkEVM: Now with more throughput and less latency. But how?\n\n\n\nRecursion makes proofs smaller. Aggregation makes them correct. Batches of proofs are also 150% larger. pic.twitter.com/3Hi9H2uasT \u2014 Polygon ZK (@0xPolygonZK) January 13, 2023\n\nThe company hopes that the introduction of zero-knowledge (ZK) roll-up technology will make Polygon the leading scalable system for Ethereum. It had previously announced plans to launch the zkEVM public testnet over the summer at ETHCC in Paris, with a mainnet launch planned for early 2023.\n\nThe new technology deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK roll-up, allowing developers to use their existing smart contracts from Ethereum without additional programming.\n\nAccording to the latest report:\n\nThe team has confirmed that zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented on Ethereum by successfully generating over 12,000 zk-proofs in a primary version of the zkEVM testnet.\n\nThis development is poised to have a major impact on the Ethereum ecosystem, as it allows for greater privacy and security for transactions on the network.\n\nDavid Schwartz, the leader of Polygon zkEVM and PolygonID, provided insight into the progress of the technology in correspondence. He stated that Layer-2 platforms have become more advanced and enhanced the features of Ethereum, significantly contributing to its scalability.\n\nHe emphasized that by utilizing zero-knowledge technology in roll-ups on layer-2 platforms, transaction finality can be reached more rapidly while maintaining the security of the validated transactions through the use of zero-knowledge methods.\n\nAdditionally, Schwartz said Polygon zkEVM has a zkProver that passes all Ethereum tests at 99% and is the first complete EVM-equivalent source code available.
