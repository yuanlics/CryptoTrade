        "title": "Cardano vs Ethereum: The Ultimate Comparison - Blockgeeks",
        "content": "Cardano vs Ethereum are two leading blockchain platforms that have gained significant attention in the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized applications (dApps). These platforms have revolutionized the way we use apps, with Bitcoin being the most popular cryptocurrency. As the creation and development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology continue to reshape various industries, many investors and developers find themselves comparing Cardano and Ethereum, two popular decentralized application platforms, to determine which platform is better suited for their needs in the world of bitcoin.\n\nUnderstanding the differences and similarities between Cardano and Ethereum, two popular cryptocurrencies, is crucial for making informed decisions about investment opportunities, application development, and utilizing the power of blockchain technology. Whether you are interested in investing in bitcoin or exploring other cryptocurrencies, taking the time to understand these key players in the market is essential. Both software platforms offer a series of services and applications, but their underlying philosophies, mechanisms, and design vary significantly. When considering time and investment choices, it is important to understand these differences.\n\nBy delving into these aspects, such as the ethereum foundation, software, philosophy, and pow, we aim to provide you with valuable insights that will help you navigate the world of blockchain investments effectively.\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum: A Comparison\n\nWhen comparing Cardano and Ethereum in terms of their work blockchain and blockchain network, there are several key points to consider. Both platforms utilize software to power their respective networks. Let\u2019s explore the main differences between these two cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Blockchain, in terms of technology, governance, and scalability, and understand how these variances impact their respective ecosystems.\n\nTechnology\n\nCardano, with its scientific approach to blockchain development, is well-regarded in the field of eth. It utilizes a layered architecture that separates the settlement chain layer from the computational chain layer. This design allows for greater flexibility and security within the chain platform. On the other hand, Ethereum follows a single-layer chain architecture where both settlement and computation occur on the same layer.\n\nCardano employs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, which aims to be more energy-efficient compared to Ethereum\u2018s current proof-of-work system. The implementation of Ouroboros ensures that transactions on the Cardano blockchain are validated by participants who hold a stake in the network.\n\nGovernance\n\nIn terms of governance, Cardano takes a more decentralized approach compared to Ethereum. It emphasizes community involvement through its unique voting system. Stakeholders can participate in decision-making processes by submitting proposals and voting on important protocol upgrades or changes.\n\nEthereum has traditionally relied on a more centralized governance model with decisions made by core developers and foundation members. However, there have been recent efforts within the Ethereum community to transition towards a more decentralized governance structure through initiatives like Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nScalability\n\nScalability has been a significant challenge for both Cardano and Ethereum due to their increasing popularity and usage. However, they employ different strategies to address this issue.\n\nCardano aims to achieve scalability through its use of sidechains or \u201chydra heads.\u201d These sidechains allow for parallel processing of transactions while maintaining interoperability with the main Cardano blockchain. This approach enables higher transaction throughput without compromising security and decentralization.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is undergoing a major upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2, which aims to improve scalability through the implementation of a new consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (PoS). This upgrade will also introduce shard chains, allowing for increased transaction processing capacity.\n\nHow Ethereum Differs from Cardano\n\nEarly Mover Advantage\n\nEthereum, being one of the earliest blockchain platforms, has a significant advantage in terms of its position and influence in the industry. It was launched back in 2015 and quickly gained popularity among developers and users alike. Its early adoption allowed it to establish a strong network effect, attracting a large community and fostering the development of numerous decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform.\n\nOn the other hand, Cardano is a relatively newer player in the blockchain space. Launched in 2017 by IOHK, it aims to provide a more secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications. While Cardano may lack Ethereum\u2018s first-mover advantage, it compensates with its rigorous academic approach and commitment to scientific research.\n\n.\n\nDevelopment Processes: Decentralized vs Centralized\n\nAnother distinguishing factor between Ethereum and Cardano is their development processes. Ethereum\u2019s development is driven by its creator, Vitalik Buterin, along with an open-source community of developers worldwide. Updates or changes to Ethereum\u2018s protocol require a consensus among the community, which can sometimes lead to delays or disagreements.\n\nIn contrast, Cardano takes a more structured and methodical approach to development. It follows a peer-reviewed research process, where proposals are thoroughly examined and validated by experts before implementation. This rigorous approach ensures that changes made to Cardano\u2019s protocol are well-vetted and scientifically grounded.\n\nCardano is divided into different layers: the settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL). This separation allows for greater flexibility and modularity in development, enabling easier upgrades without disrupting the entire network.\n\nKey Similarities between Cardano and Ethereum\n\nShared Goals: Decentralization, Security, and Smart Contract Functionality\n\nCardano and Ethereum may have their differences, but they also share some common goals. One of these shared objectives is decentralization. Both platforms aim to create a decentralized ecosystem where power is distributed among the network participants rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few entities. By achieving decentralization, they strive to eliminate single points of failure and enhance the security and resilience of their networks.\n\nAnother similarity between Cardano and Ethereum lies in their focus on security. Both platforms recognize the critical importance of ensuring the safety of user funds and protecting against potential vulnerabilities or attacks. They employ various measures such as rigorous code audits, bug bounties, and regular upgrades to address security issues promptly.\n\nFurthermore, both Cardano and Ethereum offer smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions that automatically execute when those conditions are met. This feature enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of these platforms, opening up a world of possibilities for innovative solutions across various industries.\n\nCommitment to Fostering Innovation through Developer Communities\n\nBoth Cardano and Ethereum understand the significance of developer communities in driving innovation within their ecosystems. They actively encourage developers to contribute by providing tools, resources, and support for building on their respective platforms.\n\nEthereum has established itself as a pioneer in this regard with its vast developer community. It offers an extensive set of development tools like Solidity (a programming language), Remix IDE (an integrated development environment), and Truffle Suite (a development framework). These tools empower developers to create smart contracts and dApps efficiently.\n\nSimilarly, Cardano places great emphasis on fostering its own developer community through initiatives like Project Catalyst. This program allows developers to submit proposals for funding projects that will contribute to the growth of the Cardano ecosystem. By involving developers directly in decision-making processes, Cardano aims to create a collaborative environment that encourages innovation and drives the platform forward.\n\nImportance of Interoperability for Both Ecosystems\n\nInteroperability is a crucial aspect for both Cardano and Ethereum. It refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other seamlessly. Achieving interoperability allows for the exchange of assets, data, and services across multiple platforms, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nCardano recognizes this importance and has been working on its own interoperability solution called \u201cHydra.\u201d This technology aims to enable seamless communication between different blockchains while maintaining security and scalability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has made significant progress in achieving interoperability through projects like Polkadot and Cosmos. These initiatives focus on creating bridges between various blockchains, facilitating cross-chain transactions and data transfers.\n\nAdvantages of Cardano\n\nAcademic Research and Scientific Rigor\n\nCardano sets itself apart by placing a strong emphasis on academic research and scientific rigor throughout its development process. This means that the team behind Cardano is committed to conducting thorough research, analyzing data, and implementing evidence-based solutions. By taking this approach, Cardano aims to ensure that its platform is built on solid foundations, making it more reliable and secure.\n\nOuroboros: Enhanced Security and Scalability\n\nOne of the key advantages of Cardano is its unique proof-of-stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Unlike other blockchain networks that rely on energy-intensive mining processes, Cardano uses a more efficient consensus mechanism. Ouroboros allows users to participate in the network\u2019s security and validation process based on the number of coins they hold. This not only reduces energy consumption but also enhances the overall security and scalability of the network.\n\nWith Ouroboros, Cardano achieves a high level of decentralization by ensuring that no single entity has control over the majority of the network\u2019s resources. This helps prevent malicious attacks and makes it more difficult for any individual or group to manipulate the system for their own gain.\n\nMulti-Layered Architecture for Seamless Upgrades\n\nCardano\u2019s multi-layered architecture is designed with future upgrades in mind. The platform consists of two main layers: the settlement layer and the computation layer. The settlement layer handles transactions and ensures secure value transfer, while the computation layer enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to run on top of Cardano.\n\nThis modular design allows for seamless upgrades without disrupting existing functionalities or compromising security. It enables developers to introduce new features or improvements to specific layers without affecting the entire ecosystem. As a result, Cardano can adapt to changing needs and technological advancements while maintaining stability.\n\nBy embracing a multi-layered architecture, Cardano provides flexibility for developers who want to build and deploy their own dApps on the platform. This opens up a world of possibilities for innovation and collaboration within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nDisadvantages of Cardano\n\nSlower Pace of Development\n\nCardano, while a promising blockchain project, has faced criticism for its relatively slower pace of development compared to other platforms like Ethereum. Some users and investors have expressed concerns that the team behind Cardano may not be able to deliver updates and improvements at the same speed as their competitors. This could potentially impact the platform\u2019s ability to keep up with the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nChallenges for New Projects\n\nAnother potential disadvantage of Cardano is the challenges faced by new projects seeking to build on top of its infrastructure. As Cardano is still evolving and developing, there may be limitations or uncertainties in terms of compatibility and stability. This can make it more difficult for developers to create and launch their own decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform.\n\nFurthermore, due to its relatively smaller user base compared to more established platforms like Ethereum, new projects building on Cardano may struggle to gain traction and attract users. Network effects play a significant role in the success of blockchain platforms, and lower adoption rates could limit the growth potential for projects built on Cardano.\n\nLower Adoption Rates\n\nWhile Cardano has made significant strides in establishing itself as a reputable blockchain platform, it still lags behind Ethereum in terms of adoption rates. Ethereum has a larger community of developers, users, and projects already built on its network. This wider adoption provides a network effect that attracts more participants and increases liquidity within the ecosystem.\n\nThe lower adoption rates for Cardano can result in limited opportunities for collaboration between different projects within its ecosystem. It may take longer for developers to access necessary resources or find support from an active community when troubleshooting issues or seeking guidance.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nExtensive Ecosystem of dApps\n\nEthereum has established itself as a leading blockchain platform, thanks to its extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). These dApps cover various sectors such as finance, gaming, and supply chain management. With Ethereum\u2018s smart contract functionality, developers can create innovative and autonomous applications that run on the blockchain.\n\nStrong Community Support\n\nOne key factor contributing to Ethereum\u2018s success is its strong community support. The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the development and promotion of the platform, has played a crucial role in fostering this support. The foundation provides grants for research and development projects, which encourages innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the active and passionate community surrounding Ethereum has contributed significantly to its growth over the years. Developers from around the world collaborate on GitHub repositories, share ideas on forums like Reddit and Discord, and organize conferences such as Devcon to discuss advancements in blockchain technology. This vibrant community ensures that Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nScalability Solutions\n\nScalability has been an ongoing challenge for many blockchain networks, including Ethereum. However, several solutions are being implemented to address this issue. Layer 2 protocols like Plasma and state channels allow for off-chain transactions while ensuring security through periodic validation on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum 2.0 is a major upgrade currently underway that aims to enhance scalability by transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This upgrade will introduce shard chains that can process transactions in parallel, significantly increasing network capacity.\n\nPioneering Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum has paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), revolutionizing traditional financial systems by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. DeFi applications built on top of Ethereum offer various services like lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoins.\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, Ether (ETH), plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem. It serves as collateral for loans, facilitates liquidity on DEXs, and powers decentralized applications. The rise of DeFi has attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors, further fueling Ethereum\u2018s growth.\n\nMover Advantage\n\nBeing one of the first blockchain platforms to gain widespread adoption, Ethereum has a significant mover advantage over its competitors. Its established network effect, developer community, and extensive dApp ecosystem make it an attractive choice for businesses and developers looking to build on the blockchain.\n\nWhile other blockchains like Cardano offer promising features and advancements, Ethereum\u2018s head start gives it an edge in terms of adoption and infrastructure development. However, competition within the blockchain space is fierce, with new platforms emerging regularly. Therefore, Ethereum must continue to innovate and evolve to maintain its position as a leading blockchain platform.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum\n\nScalability Limitations\n\nOne major concern with Ethereum is its current scalability limitations. As the network has grown in popularity, it has experienced issues such as high gas fees and network congestion. Gas fees are transaction fees paid by users to execute smart contracts or transfer tokens on the Ethereum network. The increasing demand for transactions has led to a surge in gas fees, making it costly for users to interact with the platform.\n\nSecurity Risks with Smart Contracts\n\nAnother potential disadvantage of Ethereum lies in the security risks associated with smart contracts. While smart contracts offer decentralized and automated execution of agreements, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. One notorious example is the infamous DAO attack in 2016, where an exploit allowed hackers to drain millions of dollars from a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on top of Ethereum. This incident highlighted the need for thorough auditing and testing of smart contracts before they are deployed on the blockchain.\n\nChallenges for Developers\n\nDevelopers working with Ethereum often face challenges due to frequent updates and changes in the protocol. As Ethereum evolves, new versions are released that may introduce breaking changes or require developers to modify their applications accordingly. These updates can be time-consuming and may disrupt ongoing projects or require additional resources for maintenance and adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, developing on Ethereum requires learning Solidity, a programming language specific to writing smart contracts on the platform. This creates a barrier for developers who are already proficient in other languages but need to invest time and effort into acquiring Solidity skills.\n\nAccount Fees\n\nWhile account fees were not mentioned as an explicit talking point, it\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum does have costs associated with creating and managing user accounts. When users want to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) or perform transactions on Ethereum, they need to create an account through which they can access these services. However, creating an account requires paying a small fee known as \u201cgas\u201d which covers the computational resources needed to create and maintain the account.\n\nAlthough these fees are generally low, they can still be a barrier for users with limited financial means or those who frequently interact with the network. This aspect should be taken into consideration when evaluating Ethereum\u2018s usability and accessibility.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, after comparing Cardano and Ethereum, it\u2019s clear that both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses. Cardano offers a more secure and scalable blockchain with its unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Ethereum has the advantage of being the first-mover in the smart contract space and enjoys widespread adoption.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Cardano and Ethereum depends on your specific needs and priorities. If you value security and scalability, Cardano may be the better option for you. On the other hand, if you prioritize network effects and a robust ecosystem, Ethereum might be the way to go.\n\nRegardless of which platform you choose, it\u2019s important to stay informed about the latest developments and advancements in this rapidly evolving industry. Keep an eye on both Cardano and Ethereum as they continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with blockchain technology.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Cardano?\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications (dApps).

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) price reclaims $2K as data shows a surge in network activity - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) price is trading slightly higher on Nov. 23, maintaining support above the $2,000 level after briefly retesting $1,930 on Nov. 21. Over the past week, Ether\u2019s price has increased by 2.5%, while the total market capitalization has grown by 0.5%. This uptrend can be attributed to improved decentralized applications (DApps) metrics, increased protocol fees and Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the nonfungible token (NFT) market.\n\nTo assess whether Ether can sustain its $2,000 price point, one must consider the repercussions of Binance\u2019s recent regulatory challenges following its plea deal with the United States Department of Justice.\n\nInvestor fear drops as Ethereum network conditions improve\n\nBinance leads in Ether spot trading volume, accounting for 30% of ETH futures contracts\u2019 open interest. The closure of Binance\u2019s $2.35 billion worth of ETH derivatives contracts within a short period could have significant consequences. Despite initial analyses showing minimal changes in spreads and liquidity, Binance witnessed net outflows of $1.53 billion between Nov. 21 and Nov. 23, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nThe regulatory landscape presents risks and opportunities. Some view Binance\u2019s actions as evidence of sufficient reserves, while others are concerned about the $4.3-billion fine facing Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao. Notably, Bitcoin advocate Luke Broyles advised followers to withdraw their coins from exchanges.\n\nAnyone that claims to know which snowflake will cause the avalanche is naieve.\n\n\n\nHowever... The #Binance $4.3 BILLION fine is a really big snowflake atop a really big pile of snow.\n\n\n\nAct accordingly.\n\nSelf custody now.#Bitcoin \u2014 Luke Broyles (@luke_broyles) November 23, 2023\n\nEven if Binance continues operations and safeguards all client assets, the long-term effects of full compliance and increased scrutiny remain uncertain. Additionally, the relationship between Binance and stablecoins like Tether (USDT), TrueUSD (TUSD) and Binance USD (BUSD) raises further questions.\n\nGovernment agencies gaining access to previously undisclosed money laundering and terrorist financing operations through Binance, including fiat payment gateways and banking partners, increases the likelihood of regulatory actions against stablecoin providers. This news has been particularly detrimental to Ethereum, given Binance\u2019s status as the third-largest ETH staker, with $1.24 billion in deposits, according to DefiLlama.\n\nHowever, recent regulatory developments also offer some positives. Binance\u2019s move toward full compliance reduces the risk associated with unregulated exchanges, making it more likely for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) instruments for cryptocurrencies. Leading industry mutual fund managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, have recently expressed interest in launching Ether spot-based ETFs.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Kraken on Nov. 20, which lists 16 cryptocurrencies as securities, excludes Ether. This omission reduces the likelihood of regulatory actions against the Ethereum Foundation and entities involved in the 2015 initial coin offering (ICO), providing a silver lining amid regulatory uncertainties.\n\nEthereum network health and NFT markets surge\n\nAssessing the Ethereum network\u2019s health, Ethereum DApps achieved a total value locked (TVL) of $26 billion on Nov. 23, representing a 5% increase from the previous week, according to DappRadar. However, a hack significantly impacted dYdX, resulting in a 16% decline in the protocol\u2019s deposits.\n\nTop blockchains by active addresses and DeFi TVL. Source: DappRadar\n\nWhile Ether\u2019s market capitalization of $248 billion trails behind Bitcoin\u2019s $728 billion, the two networks generate similar protocol revenues. Over the past seven days, the Bitcoin network has collected $57.5 million in fees, compared to Ethereum\u2019s $54.3 million. These figures do not include ecosystem fees from platforms like Lido, Uniswap or Maker protocols.\n\nEthereum also reclaimed its leadership position in NFT sales, recording $12.6 million in transactions within 24 hours. Despite a brief period where Bitcoin led in NFT activity, Ethereum remains the preferred blockchain for prominent NFT projects.\n\nThe positive performance from Ethereum on Nov. 23 can be attributed to improved on-chain metrics, growing expectations of a spot ETF approval and reduced regulatory concerns stemming from the 2015 ICO.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

As ETH approaches a well-known resistance level that has stymied its progress multiple times in the past, the crypto community is watching with bated breath to see if this test will result in a definitive breakthrough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe resistance level in question has acted like a ceiling for Ethereum's price, capping its upward momentum on several occasions. Now, as ETH inches closer to this barrier once again, the stakes are high. A successful break above this level could confirm a bullish trend, potentially propelling the price to new highs.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests that if Ethereum manages to sustain a breakout above this resistance, we could witness an accelerated move toward the next major psychological level. The key will be a strong closing above the resistance on significant volume, which would likely attract more buyers into the market, further fueling the upward trajectory.\n\nAn interesting aspect to consider is the market's reaction to recent news events, such as the departure of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) from Binance. Contrary to some expectations, CZ's stepping down has not had a detrimental impact on the market. Instead, it may have alleviated some regulatory concerns, removing a potential risk factor and possibly contributing to a healthier market environment for major assets like Ethereum.\n\nThe Fibonacci extension levels and previous high points could serve as markers for where the price might head. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break through, it may retest lower support levels, but the overall trend still appears to be leaning toward the positive, given the recent market resilience."

        "content": "Ethereum has seen a surge in new demand.\n\nTop ETH wallets have increased their holdings significantly since the year began.\n\nNew demand for leading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] climbed to a four-month high on 20th November, data from Santiment showed.\n\nAccording to the data provider, the daily count of new ETH addresses created that day totaled 94,703, marking a 33% surge from the previous day\u2019s 70,968.\n\nThe uptick in demand for ETH coincided with its rally back above $2000 on 19th November, following two days of trading below this crucial price level.\n\nWhales have \u201cshunned\u201d ETH since April\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of ETH\u2019s whale activity since the year began revealed a decline in the volume of coin purchases made by whale addresses since April.\n\nData sourced from Santiment showed that since 16th April, the cumulative count of ETH addresses that hold between 1,000 and 10,0000 coins have dwindled.\n\nAt 6464 addresses at press time, the number of whales that comprise this ETH investor cohort has declined by 10% in the last seven months.\n\nRegarding smaller whales that hold between 1 and 10,000 ETH coins, their number has also fallen by 1.12% since 10th May.\n\nInterestingly, while many whales have stayed their hands from accumulating ETH since the beginning of Q2, the top 200 ETH wallets have steadily bought the altcoin.\n\nSince 1st January, the ETH\u2019s supply held by this cohort of investors has increased by 97%. For context, these addresses currently hold a total of 62.76 million ETH, valued at approximately $124.1 billion.\n\nThey have accumulated 30.3% more coins since 21st November 2022, despite the persistent decline in ETH\u2019s value in the year\u2019s first half.\n\nETH stalls under $2000\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $1,984. With resistance formed at the $2000 price level, ETH\u2019s price has oscillated within a narrow range in the last week.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe coin\u2019s Choppiness Index observed on a daily chart confirmed the sideways trading pattern. This indicator measures the volatility of a financial asset over a certain period of time.\n\nAt 62.70 and in an uptrend at press time, the coin\u2019s Choppiness Index showed that ETH\u2019s price was not moving in a clear direction and instead fluctuated within a relatively narrow range."

        "content": "What Can You Buy with Ethereum? 9 Best Things to Spend ETH on\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nEthereum is emerging as a popular payment method across online merchants. This leads us to the question \u2013 what can you buy with Ethereum?\n\nIn this guide, we discuss how to spend Ethereum and the top nine things to buy with this leading cryptocurrency.\n\nTop 9 Things to Buy with Ethereum\n\nHere are some of the best things to buy with Ethereum right now:\n\nLuxury Cars Presale Cryptocurrencies Luxury Watches Clothing and Accessories Property Gaming Consoles Electronic Gadgets Artwork Crypto Mining Equipment\n\nAll of the above items can be purchased on Crypto Emporium, one of the most popular online retailers for shopping with Ethereum.\n\nHow to Spend Ethereum \u2013 The Best Things to Buy With Cryptocurrency\n\nThe use cases for Ethereum are continually expanding. Not only can crypto holders trade their Ethereum tokens but also buy products and services.\n\nIn this section, we take a closer look at what you can buy with Ethereum in 2024.\n\n1. Luxury Cars\n\nThe global luxury car market is projected to reach $1.03 trillion by 2031. This increasing demand for luxury collectible cars has encouraged many automobile dealers to accept Ethereum payments. Today, it\u2019s possible to buy everything from budget cars to supercars with Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, customers are not required to find a local dealer to buy cars with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. Instead, online platforms like Crypto Emporium make the process simple. This eCommerce platform lists cars from 45 leading brands.\n\nThis covers a wide range of luxury and high-performance car brands, including Lamborghini, Tesla, Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, Citroen, Dacia, Toyota, and Ford. In other words, there is something for all budgets and preferences.\n\nFor example, we found the highly sought-out supercar, Bugatti Centodieci, listed for $13 million. Cost-effective models, such as the Dacia Sandero and Ford Focus, are also available for less than $25,000. On top of new models, Crypto Emporium also features a great collection of classic vintage cars.\n\nMoreover, Crypto Emporium will handle all the paperwork associated with the car purchase. The platform will also ship the car directly to the customer\u2019s doorstep. Altogether, Crypto Emporium offers buyers a convenient and hassle-free experience when buying cars with Ethereum.\n\n2. Presale Cryptocurrencies\n\nOne of the most significant use cases of Ethereum is to buy other digital assets. However, this doesn\u2019t mean ETH holders must engage in trading. Rather, those who prefer a long-term investment strategy can consider crypto presales.\n\nBy investing in presales, investors get early access to new cryptocurrency projects before they are launched on public exchanges. This means investors can get new digital tokens at a lower price and potentially reap high returns.\n\nBelow, we discuss the two best crypto presales to invest in right now.\n\nLove Hate Inu \u2013 Innovate Blockchain-Based Voting Platform\n\nLove Hate Inu is a new crypto project that allows users to vote on polls. It employs a vote-to-earn mechanism to reward voters for their contributions. In other words, users can generate revenue by simply sharing their opinions on social topics.\n\nThe Love Hate Inu platform is built on the Ethereum network. Its crypto-based infrastructure ensures that all poll entries are recorded on the blockchain \u2013 facilitating increased transparency and security. This way, Love Hate Inu will capitalize on the growth of the online software survey market.\n\nLove Hate Inu has also launched a native digital token, LHINU. Investors can use LHINU tokens to create polls on Love Hate Inu. LHINU will also serve as the reward currency for voters. Moreover, users are required to stake LHINU tokens to obtain voting rights on the platform.\n\nIn fact, the amount of LHINU tokens will determine the user\u2019s voting power. The Love Hate Inu presale was launched on March 7, 2023, and has already raised over $4.5 million. Currently, investors can buy Love Hate Inu tokens for $0.000115. The price will increase to $0.000145 once LHINU is listed on an exchange.\n\nDeeLance \u2013 Decentralized Recruiting Platform With Metaverse Integration\n\nDeeLance is another presale project that has taken the crypto world by storm. DeeLance is building a new decentralized platform connecting clients and freelancers. Crucially, this platform runs on blockchain technology and charges low fees to workers and employers.\n\nFor instance, platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr charge up to 20% in freelancing fees. On the other hand, freelancers on DeeLance will only pay 10% of the contract value. Deelance is also much cheaper for clients, especially when compared to Upwork and Fiverr.\n\nMoreover, the platform allows freelancers to submit work as NFTs. This way, freelancers can transfer ownership of the work. Moreover, freelancer payments are processed in DLANCE, the platform\u2019s utility token. DLANCE tokens can also be used to rent office spaces in the DeeLance metaverse, purchase virtual land, or create advertising spaces.\n\nDLANCE tokens are now available via presale, offering early investors a significant discount. Currently, investors can buy DLANCE tokens for $0.025, and the price will increase in the upcoming stages. This ensures that early investors can lock in an immediate upside.\n\n3. Luxury Watches\n\nMany collectors consider investing in luxury watches with cryptocurrencies a smart financial move. This is because some timepieces can appreciate in value over time, making them a worthy addition to any investment portfolio.\n\nCrypto Emporium offers an extensive range of luxury watches for crypto holders to choose from. The collections are from 17 brands, including Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Cartier.\n\nCustomers can find rare, in-demand models like the Rolex Daytona Rainbow Pave Factory and the Richard Mille 11-03 Rose Titanium Chronograph. There is also a wide range of Patek Phillip models accessible to Ethereum holders. The price range varies depending on the brand.\n\nFor instance, we found a Citizen Eco-Drive Chandler available for just $240. On the other hand, the Richard Mille RM-011 FM \u2018Felipe Massa\u2019 Asia Exclusive 50 Limited is listed for $611,800.\n\n4. Clothing and Accessories\n\nThe fashion industry is also embracing cryptocurrencies. Luxury brands such as Gucci and PacSun have started accepting Ethereum payments. That said, those looking for multiple fashion brands under one roof might consider Crypto Emporium\n\nCrypto Emporium sports an impressive selection of clothing and accessories for men and women. This includes activewear, t-shirts, shorts, jackets, dressers, and more. We also found that there are both high-end brands and budget options.\n\nFor instance, shoppers can choose between a Burberry Leather Trimmed Hooded Coat at $7,864, or a simple pair of black leggings available for just $20. Customers will also find many choices in the accessories department and a dedicated section for women\u2019s jewelry.\n\nThe top brands featured on Crypto Emporium include Alexander McQueen, Balmain, Fendi, Gucci, Versace, Burberry, and Prada. There is also a range of apparel inspired by cryptocurrencies. This includes a Bitcoin Logo Trucker Hat and a DOGE Astronaut Sweatshirt.\n\n5.

A 10-bedroom manor in Girona, Spain, is listed at $2.7 million, whereas a 1-bedroom villa in Gili Meno, Bali, is available for $70,000.\n\nThe platform also has a dedicated international team to arrange all the legal support required to handle the paperwork. This makes it easier for buyers to navigate different countries\u2019 property and tax laws \u2013 all from the comforts of home.\n\n6.

As such, gaming consoles such as PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch are in high demand with crypto holders. And Crypto Emporium offers access to all top models at competitive prices.\n\nFor instance, the PlayStation 5 is on offer with a 9% discount, at $1,139.

And its growing adoption has also encouraged many merchants to accept ETH as payment.\n\nThere are many benefits to spending Ethereum online, which we discuss below.\n\nGlobal Currency\n\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency, which means that it can be used to make purchases from anywhere in the world. This is particularly useful for shopping, allowing people to buy products from other countries.\n\nIn fact, financial experts speculate that the popularity of blockchain payments could threaten SWIFT.\n\nAfter all, blockchain networks don\u2019t rely on third parties to process transactions. This means cryptocurrencies like Ethereum promote an efficient and decentralized borderless payment system.\n\nSpeedy Transactions\n\nUsing Ethereum also has a significant advantage over fiat money, as transactions can be processed within minutes. In fact, \u2018the Merge\u2019 has brought down the transaction time of Ethereum to just seconds.\n\nThis is much faster than the hours or even days fiat transactions can take to settle. Moreover, the timescales for fiat payments can be even slower when it comes to international transactions, making ETH a much more efficient alternative.\n\nHigh Security\n\nCompared to other payment methods, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum also offer greater security. Fiat payments require personal information, such as credit card details, which can put buyers at risk.\n\nFrom retailers\u2019 perspective, issues like chargebacks can occur, allowing payments to be revoked after products have been delivered.\n\nIn contrast, cryptocurrencies eliminate these concerns by making payments irreversible and not requiring personal identification for transactions.\n\nIs it Safe to Buy Things With Ethereum?\n\nMaking payments with Ethereum is highly secure because transactions are handled directly from one wallet to another. In other words, retailers and online stores don\u2019t have access to the private keys of the buyer\u2019s wallet. Instead, buyers are in full control of the transaction.\n\nThat being said, when considering how to spend Ethereum safely, crypto investors should do their due diligence. This is because not all platforms that accept Ethereum are reputable. Therefore, when considering where you can spend Ethereum, ensure the platform is credible.\n\nIn contrast, Crypto Emporium has been in business since 2018 and has served hundreds of thousands of customers. This is why Crypto Emporium ranks as the best place to spend Ethereum online.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize, we have explored what can you buy with Ethereum in 2024. Regarding retailers, Crypto Emporium is the preferable option when shopping with ETH.\n\nThis online store offers a huge range of goods, such as clothing, mobile phones, luxury watches, TVs, and even real estate.\n\nAdditionally, shoppers can claim 4% cashback on all purchases. We also like that Crypto Emporium has been in business since 2018 \u2013 so it has expertise in dealing with ETH purchases.\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat can I use my ETH for?\n\nEthereum can be used to buy thousands of items on Crypto Emporium \u2013 including watches, smartphones, TVs, and cars.\n\nWhat can I buy with Ethereum?\n\nWhen exploring what you can buy with Ethereum, consider Crypto Emporium\u2019s range of electronics, designer clothing, luxury watches, cars, and more.\n\nWhere to spend Ethereum?\n\nThe best place to spend Ethereum is Crypto Emporium, a popular eCommerce platform that offers a vast selection of quality products and services.\n\nCan I use Ethereum to buy things?\n\nYes, Ethereum can be used to buy products on Crypto Emporium, including artwork, smartphones, cameras, watches, designer bags, and more.\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

This issue, initially discovered a few months ago, was formally reported to InfStones in July 2023. InfStones has since confirmed that they have resolved the issue.\n\nOver the course of the last 24 hours, Lido DAO contributors were made aware of an earlier platform vulnerability affecting an active Node Operator using the Lido on Ethereum protocol (InfStones).\n\n\n\nMore information here: https://t.co/WeIVeVBpCp \u2014 Lido (@LidoFinance) November 22, 2023\n\nYou might also like: Bloomberg: BlackRock and Grayscale meeting with SEC about Bitcoin ETF issuance\n\nThe core of the concern was the potential unauthorized access to root-level privileges on up to 25 validator servers. These servers, not necessarily linked to the Lido protocol, could have exposed sensitive information, including key materials, to external threats. It remains uncertain whether the servers or keys connected to Lido validators were compromised.\n\nCurrently, Lido DAO\u2019s team is collaborating closely with InfStones to conduct a thorough investigation into the breach. This effort aims to ascertain the full extent and potential repercussions of the incident. In the context of this incident, Web3 security experts at Holborn have observed a noticeable increase in the frequency and severity of off-chain attacks in recent times.\n\nThe experts emphasize that this latest incident underscores the need for continuous and comprehensive auditing of infrastructure to preemptively identify and mitigate such vulnerabilities.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Movement Labs announces M2, the first Move VM-based L2 for Ethereum.\n\nM2 incorporates Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\nM2 promises over 145k transactions per second, boosting Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nAs the Ethereum network grapples with scalability challenges, its ecosystem actively seeks and implements innovative solutions. This rich and vibrant ecosystem of projects and developers gives Ethereum the edge over other networks.\n\nMost recently, Movement Labs announced M2, the first Move Virtual Machine (VM)-based Layer Two (L2) solution for Ethereum. The solution offers enhanced performance, security, and scalability for the network.\n\nMovement Labs\u2019 M2 Addresses Ethereum Scalability\n\nOn Tuesday, November 22, in a significant development for the Ethereum network, Movement Labs announced the launch of M2. The technology is the first Move Virtual Machine (VM) Layer Two (L2) solution, integrated with Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\nThis announcement marks a notable stride in addressing the longstanding scalability issues faced by Ethereum. Known for its diverse range of applications, Ethereum has often grappled with high transaction costs and slower processing times, presenting challenges to its scalability and efficiency.\n\nM2 promises a transformative solution to these challenges. It is engineered to enhance Ethereum\u2019s transaction capacity substantially, with the capability of theoretically processing over 145,000 transactions per second. This efficiency is set to mitigate network congestion, high transaction fees, and slow processing times.\n\nThe core innovation of M2 lies in its integration of the Move VM, known for its robust security features. Moreover, the Move VM fosters a developer-friendly environment and Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\nThe influence of M2 extends beyond the Ethereum network. Movement Labs aims to foster a more interconnected blockchain environment by integrating with various blockchain networks and virtual machines. This effort enhances liquidity and accessibility across the broader blockchain spectrum.\n\nWhat Sets Move VM in M2 Apart\n\nM2\u2019s integration of the Move Virtual Machine (VM) introduces advanced technical features tailored for enhanced smart contract functionality. Unlike traditional smart contract environments, the Move VM offers a unique resource model that treats assets as singular and uncopyable, reducing the risks of double-spending and accidental loss. This model is particularly advantageous for financial applications and NFTs, where asset integrity and authenticity are paramount.\n\nCelestia\u2019s contribution to M2 through its modular data availability layer is another crucial aspect. This technology separates consensus from data availability, allowing for more flexible and scalable blockchain architectures. In M2, Celestia\u2019s system enables the distribution and storage of data in a more efficient and less resource-intensive way.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAdopting new technologies like M2 often comes with a learning curve for developers and users. Ensuring widespread adoption may require significant community engagement, education, and support efforts.\n\nM2 is part of a broader landscape of Layer Two solutions being developed for Ethereum. These alternative solutions with unique features and approaches contribute to a diverse ecosystem.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFor the broader blockchain community, M2\u2019s launch is a testament to the ongoing innovation and collaboration within the space. It highlights the potential of new technologies to address fundamental challenges and opens up new possibilities for blockchain applications and services\n\nRead more about L2 solutions for Ethereum:\n\nTypes of Layer 2: Comparing Different Ethereum Scaling Solutions\n\n\n\nRead more about Binance\u2019s settlement with US authorities:\n\nBinance Set to Thrive Post $4.3B Settlement: Analysts"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Price Regain $3000 by Year End? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto market witnessed high volatility and selling pressure this week primarily attributed to the recent departure of Changpeng Zhao, from the CEO position of Binance Exchange. The sell-off occurred amid allegations from the Department of Justice (DoJ) accusing Binance and Zhao of non-compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering regulations. The ripple effect pushed the Ethereum coin to $1900 but an immediate counterattack from buyers has managed to regain the $2000 psychological mark.\n\nThe second largest crypto, down 1.04% in the last 24 hours to $2,077 and 20% over the last four weeks, swept liquidity at $1,930 as investors reacted to the developments at Binance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe former Binance CEO resigned following a $4.3 billion settlement agreement with the Department of Justice (DoJ) and on the condition that CZ pleads guilty to violating anti-money laundering regulations and does not hold an executive position at the company.\n\nAlthough CZ will be allowed to retain his stake in Binance, his exit has touched many who feel that his impact contributed immensely to the growth the crypto market has achieved over the years.\n\nRecommended for you: Binance Coin Price Prediction As BNB Nurtures 25% Bullish Move\n\nCan Ethereum Price Ignore Fed Minutes And Rally To $3,000?\n\nMarket participants are likely to rally behind Ethereum price, especially with the token trading above the $2,000 support. This move from $1,930 assures traders that Ether has a strong bullish outlook\u2014one that could trigger a larger breakout toward the coveted $3,000 level.\n\nSeveral indicators back the bullish theory, starting with a couple of golden cross patterns formed when the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) crossed above the 100-day EMA (blue) and the 200-EMA (purple) roughly two weeks ago.\n\nThe breakout to $3,000 will greatly depend on two key levels; the validity of support at $2,000 and weakening resistance at $2,130. A break above this hurdle is critical to the uptrend\u2019s continuation as it shows that ETH price is backed by increasing momentum.\n\nThis could also help invalidate the sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACd) indicator. With a bounce from the immediate support level at 50, the MACD could rebound thus, prompting another bullish breakout.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price outlook is surprisingly strong despite the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes of the November 1 meeting which revealed a collective take by the committee members that although the economy grew at a stronger rate in Q3 and remains resilient, inflation \u201cremained well above the Committee\u2019s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.\u201d\n\nAll participants echoed the need to retain the restrictive economic policy if the Fed is to achieve its long-term goal of returning inflation to the desired 2%. The committee agreed to focus on the current data to inform the decisions on interest rates in upcoming meetings.\n\nThere was no mention of when the Fed could consider rate cuts. However, it is unlikely the committee will hike interest rates again this year. Overall, the US economy is still under the microscope, with inflation said to be \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nThis outlook could be sufficiently bearish for risk asset classes like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, at the moment, a buoyant Ether has the potential to close the gap to $3,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Staked supply was 23.6% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nETH\u2019s exchange balance was barely 12% of the total coins in circulation.\n\nUsers have shown significant interest in Ethereum [ETH] staking since the Shapella Upgrade went live earlier this year.\n\nAs of this writing, 28.6 million yield-generating coins were locked up on the network, accounting for 23.6% of ETH\u2019s total circulating supply, as per a Nansen dashboard.\n\nStaked supply sees a sharp increase\n\nUsers moved towards the yield-bearing mechanism after gaining more control over their staked ETH, including the ability to unstake them at any time.\n\nThe increased share of staked ETH in comparison to total ETH trading volume demonstrated the extent of investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nData shared by IntoTheBlock CEO Jesus Rodriguez revealed that the deposited amount was 1.4% of the trading volume as of 21 November.\n\nWhile 1.4% may appear to be a very small portion, a better way to look at it is to compare staked supply to exchange supply.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data, a fascinating divergence was observed between the two in 2023.\n\nThe supply locked away in Ethereum\u2019s deposit contract charged to new highs. In contrast, the ETH available for active trading sank to new depths.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s exchange balance was barely 12% of the total coins in circulation, the lowest in more than seven years.\n\nETH rewards continue to drop\n\nThese findings underlined that people were taking ETH out of the market and using it as an investment to earn yield. The surprising part was that all of this happened despite the fact that staking awards have reduced over time.\n\nAccording to Beaconcha.in, the annualized financial return per validator was just 3.68%. down from 8.61% seen in May.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe rewards were inversely related to the amount of ETH deposited and the number of stakers involved. Put simply, the more the number of stakers, the more thinly the yield gets spread out.\n\nAt press time, ETH regained the $2,000 level after slipping below to $1,949 during U.S. trading hours.

        "content": "Over $6.51 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options are due to expire on Nov. 24, potentially indicating heightened trading activity.\n\nA vast number of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire on Nov. 24, potentially influencing market dynamics. This comes in the wake of the U.S. DOJ\u2019s recent criminal charges against the Binance and its hefty $4.3 billion fine.\n\nSpecifically, about 108,000 BTC options are nearing their expiration date. These options carry a Put Call Ratio of 0.83, indicating a slightly higher inclination towards call options (betting on price increase) than put options (betting on price decrease).\n\nThe \u2018max pain point\u2019 for these options is $33,000, which is the price level where the collective holders of the options contracts would experience the most financial loss. The total notional value of these BTC options is a staggering $4.04 billion.\n\n24 Nov Options Data\n\n108k BTC options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.83, a max pain point of $33,000 and a notional value of $4.04 billion.\n\n1.2 million ETH options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.71, a max pain of $1,700 and a notional value of $2.47\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fhrOpr6bnE \u2014 [email protected] (@BTC__options) November 23, 2023\n\nIn parallel, approximately 1.2 million ETH options are also approaching expiration. These have a Put Call Ratio of 0.71, further leaning towards call options. The max pain point for these ETH options is set at $1,700, with a notional value amounting to $2.47 billion.\n\nThe concept of \u2018max pain\u2019 in options trading is crucial to understand. It refers to the price level at which the total value of options (both calls and puts) expiring on a certain date will cause the maximum financial loss to the option holders. This concept is often used by traders to assess potential market movements as options near their expiration dates.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nWhen BTC options are set to expire, it means that the contracts, which give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) by a specified date (the expiration date), are reaching the end of their validity period.\n\n#Bitcoin options seem to have a major impact on $BTC price!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Call options are dominating the options market as Bitcoin prepares for a significant $3.8 billion options expiry.\n\n\n\nThis dominance could significantly impact BTC's price trajectory in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/SeFjoANJmw \u2014 Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) November 23, 2023\n\nOn the expiration date, these options must be either exercised or they will become worthless. If the market price of Bitcoin is favorable relative to the strike price, the option holder may choose to exercise the option to buy Bitcoin at this lower price. Conversely, if the market price is below the strike price of a put option, the holder may exercise the option to sell Bitcoin at the higher strike price.\n\nThe impending expiration of these options could result in heightened trading activity and potentially unpredictable price movements in the market. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, especially in light of the recent legal actions against Binance, which have already injected notable volatility into the market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "DeFi gathering momentum, Ethereum Gas Fees Rising: Why Is Uniswap (UNI) Stuck? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum is picking up momentum based mainly on how gas fees have been trending in the first three weeks of November, data from Kaiko shows. Even so, despite Uniswap (UNI) spearheading the revival, looking at the gas attributed to its activities over this period, UNI prices remain stagnant below $5.6, with bulls failing to edge higher, breaking to new 2023 highs.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Rising, DeFi Revival?\n\nAccording to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the average gas fees on Ethereum hit multi-month highs last week. The platform expressly notes that the primary driver has been Uniswap\u2019s activities, reading from the rising transaction volumes from meme coins, including GROK. This, in turn, pushed block space demand higher, increasing gas fees.\n\nGas fees remain volatile but generally higher in the first three weeks of November. As of November 20, Ycharts data shows that the average cost of sending a transaction stood at 45.13 Gwei, nearly 100% from November 19, when it was at 24.84 Gwei. This is a significant jump from 17.66 Gwei in late October 2023.\n\nGas fees and how ETH and DeFi token prices react are directly correlated as DeFi and other on-chain activities like non-fungible token (NFT) minting and trading rise; gas fees usually expand in trending markets.\n\nAccordingly, the recent expansion in gas fees could suggest that the markets could be preparing for a leg up, and tokens of critical protocols, including Uniswap or Aave, could benefit.\n\nDeFi TVL Rising, But Uniswap Is Stuck Below $5.6\n\nAs of writing, the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi protocols stands at over $46.6 billion as of November 21, according to DeFiLlama. This increase is nearly $5 billion more than in early November and up from $37 billion in mid-October.\n\nEthereum remains a choice platform for deploying DeFi apps despite the relatively gas fees pinned to mainnet scaling challenges. The pioneer smart contract blockchain manages $25.4 billion in TVL, whereas Uniswap is one of the largest protocols with $3.216 billion in TVL.\n\nUNI prices are up 30% from mid-October when writing on November 21. However, bulls have been unable to break above the November highs at around $5.6. From the daily chart, trading volume, and thus participation, has been tapering even though prices have been edging higher.\n\nThis formation suggests that the uptrend was behind low momentum and sustainability. Technically, there could be more gains if there is a solid close above November highs with expanding volumes. In that case, UNI could expand, retesting 2023 highs of around $7.2.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "In a recent announcement, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, revealed plans to delist Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) cross margin and isolated margin pairs. This strategic move, effective from Nov. 28, is part of Binance's efforts to address mounting legal challenges within the digital assets industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe affected pairs are directly associated with BUSD, a stablecoin developed in collaboration with Paxos. Isolated margin borrowing on these pairs will be suspended on Nov. 28, followed by the closure of auto-settled user positions and the cancellation of pending orders on Dec. 7.\n\nPressure rise\n\nThis decision follows allegations by the U.S. SEC, which previously classified BUSD as a security. In response, both Paxos and Binance promptly halted the further minting and circulation of the stablecoin. This reflects the ongoing adjustments made by crypto exchanges to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn a parallel development, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the founder of Binance, has stepped down from his role. This decision is part of a broader agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle criminal charges against the exchange. Richard Teng has been named as the new CEO in the midst of this transitional period.\n\nCZ's guilty plea earlier this week, related to charges of operating an unlicensed money transfer business, conspiracy and violating restrictions, resulted in a significant $4.3 billion fine for Binance. As the crypto space grapples with these regulatory challenges, the implications for the market are uncertain.\n\nThe delisting of major pairs and the leadership change at Binance underscore the growing regulatory pressures faced by crypto exchanges globally, highlighting a pivotal moment for the industry."

This figure means that the top 200 Ethereum wallets now command approximately 52% of the total ETH supply.\n\nThe whale buying spree has not been the only bullish development for Ethereum though as there has been a marked increase in the number of new ETH wallets that are being created. Santiment notes that on Tuesday, November 21, a total of 94,700 new wallets were created on the network, a new 4-month high. This could point to a return of interest in the ecosystem and adoption could trigger a price recovery.\n\nETH On The Cusp Of Recovery\n\nAlthough the price of Ethereum has been hit hard following the news of Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao hitting the space hard, it has maintained a reasonable price level just below $2,000. This ensures that forecasts are still valid and the chances of recovery remain high.\n\nCrypto analyst FieryTrading has forecasted that the Ethereum price could cross back into the $2,350 territory soon. The analyst notes that the [rice had been on a continuous consolidation trend following the rise from $1,500 to $2,100. Given this, FieryTrading expects the altcoin to break out of its current \u2018bull-flag\u2019 as the market rallies.\n\n\u201cBull-flags are bullish continuation patterns, to bullish price action is the most likely result from this pattern,\u201d FieryTrading explains. Once this breakout happens, then the analyst places the \u201cTarget at 2400$ for the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nETH is currently sitting at $1,996 at the time of this writing with small losses of 0.45% in the last 24 hours. It is performing better than Bitcoin which has fallen 2.24% in the same timeframe to trade at $36,480.\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAccording to the latest data from 100eyes Crypto Scanner, Ethereum is approaching a horizontal support point at around $1,925.\n\nThis follows a dynamic 24-hour trading period where Ethereum's price fluctuated between $1,940.08 and $2,018.93, currently standing at $1,989.80.\n\nThis represents a 1.2% increase compared to the previous day, with its market capitalization now at approximately $239 billion and a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $23 billion.\n\nMore buying opportunities?\n\nHorizontal support is a significant concept in the trading of cryptocurrencies. It refers to a price level at which a downward trend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand.\n\nNow that Ethereum nears this key level of $1,925, investors and traders are closely monitoring its movement for potential buying opportunities or signs of a further price drop.\n\nThe top altcoin dropped in tandem with other major cryptocurrencies on Tuesday due to the bombshell Binance news.\n\nTraders are still greedy\n\nDespite this, Ethereum's current sentiment remains in 'greed' territory, with the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index indicating a score of 56 \u2014 suggesting that market sentiment is still optimistic.\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, ETH is up by 66% since the beginning of the year. This robust increase is a potential factor contributing to the prevailing optimistic sentiment among investors, even as the cryptocurrency approaches its horizontal support level.\n\nEthereum's performance over various periods has shown a mixed trend, with a 5-day decrease of 2.84% but an 11.34% rise over the past month and an 18.20% increase in the last three months."

        "content": "A CryptoQuant Analyst has identified a significant systemic buying trend in Ethereum, suggesting a rising influx of strategic investments into the blockchain network.\n\nAnalyst Reveals Ethereum Systemic Buying Trend\n\nA crypto market observer and a contributing analyst at CryptoQuant, Maarten Regterschot has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to publish a systemic buying trend he witnessed in Ethereum. The analyst presented a chart indicating that one or more investors have been engaging in Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) buying on Ethereum futures.\n\nRegterschot stated that the linear increase in open interest in Ethereum suggests that there has been systemic buying of ETH assets for an extended period of time. He revealed that approximately $700 million has already been added to the market.\n\n\u201cSomeone(s) are TWAP-buying on Ethereum futures. This linear growth in open interest indicates systematic buying over a certain period. There is $700 million added so far,\u201d Regterschot said.\n\nSystemic buying in this context involves crypto investments made at regular and periodic intervals. TWAP on the other hand is the measure of an asset\u2019s average price over a specific time period.\n\nThis systemic buying trend suggests a growing demand for ETH by investors over a long period. The trend also coincides with the latest Ethereum developments in the crypto space, including the growing applications on Ethereum Spot ETFs and its potential approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe analyst has not revealed insights into the motives behind this systemic buying of Ethereum. However, the developments could become a catalyst for a potential bullish momentum for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nETH Price Holds $2000 Mark\n\nThe price of Ethereum has seen multiple upticks within the last few months, allowing the cryptocurrency to finally cross the $2,000 mark. According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum\u2019s price is up by 2.3% and trading at $2,062 at the time of writing. Although its overall market capitalization is down by 23.31%, the cryptocurrency has been experiencing a fair amount of price increases recently.\n\nAs the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the US SEC looms next year, many investors are currently holding their crypto assets as they gear up for a possible bull run. There have also been several optimistic price projections for the ETH token. Some analysts have predicted that the price of the cryptocurrency will reach $2,250 if it succeeds in crossing multiple resistance levels.\n\nETH price falls to $2,055 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Decrypt, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This is a significant surge in the past few days.\n\nCrypto market gains $60b after Binance fallout\n\nThe broader crypto market also shows signs of recovery following the massive news of Binance\u2019s landmark settlement and the loss of its founder, Changpeng Zhao.\n\nBitcoin has rebounded over 5% from Nov. 22 lows, with other altcoins like Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also posting sizable gains.\n\nThe total crypto market cap now stands at $1.48 trillion, adding over $60 billion since yesterday.\n\nThis rebound seems driven by optimism that the regulatory uncertainties surrounding crypto might be resolved, particularly following the recent developments with Binance.\n\nSome analysts say the settlements, while harsh, could provide much-needed clarity for the crypto sector\u2019s future progress.\n\nAdditionally, macroeconomic factors like stabilizing inflation data have supported a risk-on environment for crypto as an asset class.\n\nWhile risks remain, the market is regaining footing.\n\nYou might also like: Netflix director allegedly YOLOs $4m of allocated series budget on Dogecoin\n\nBitcoin Minetrix raises $4.2 million\n\nAs the market stabilizes, attention is turning to a project in its presale phase \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s whitepaper, Bitcoin Minetrix is a decentralized cloud mining platform that allows users to stake BTCMTX and earn BTC rewards.\n\nIts \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model gives users mining power based on token holdings, eliminating upfront costs, fixed contracts, and hidden fees associated with traditional cloud mining firms.\n\nBeing an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, users can stake BTCMTX simply by connecting an Ethereum-compatible wallet.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s potential is closely tied to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024.\n\nAs mining rewards get cut in half, Bitcoin could enter a bull run that sends miner profits soaring.\n\nBTCMTX exposes users to this potential scenario without the need for expensive mining equipment.\n\nThe project has raised $4.2 million from over 5,400 Telegram community members.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is ranked third on CoinSniper.net and second on ICOBench.com.\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix roadmap includes plans for a mobile app, exchange listings, and partnering with cloud mining providers.\n\nVisit the Bitcoin Minetrix presale\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Higher activity and increase in new wallet creation during a price uptrend is typically considered bullish for the asset.\n\nActive Addresses and New Addresses created in ETH\n\nEthereum price crossed the $2,000 psychological barrier, early on Tuesday, and the altcoin is likely to extend its gains. The next significant price level for Ethereum is $2,200, the last time the altcoin traded above $2,200 was in May 2022."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum were mostly trading sideways on Wednesday after news that Binance's boss stepped down from the world's largest crypto exchange and pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations sent the BNB token plummeting.\n\nCoinGecko data showed that Bitcoin was trading for $36,609 as of this writing\u2014a drop of 2% in the past day. Over the past seven days, it's up 0.3%.\n\nWhile Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset, was up by more than 3%, trading hands for $2,034.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Binance's BNB, the fourth biggest digital asset and the utility token for Binance's exchange, was continuing to drop\u2014and fast\u2014Wednesday morning Eastern Time. It had dropped in price by over 11% and was priced at $231 per token.\n\nYesterday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao agreed to step down from his role at the company as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The settlement also stipulates that the exchange has to make a complete exit from the U.S.\u2014that includes its Binance US exchange and the U.S. customers who were trading on the dotcom exchange.\n\nAs a result, traders are selling their BNB holdings. Approximately $3.3 billion worth of BNB has changed hands in the past 24 hours, almost all of it on Tether (USDT) trading pairs, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThere's a very short list of times BNB volume has been higher: During the 2021 bull market, after TerraUSD collapsed in May 2022 and the day Binance announced it had a tentative agreement to acquire FTX before calling the deal off. FTX filed for bankruptcy days later.\n\nOther major coins and tokens such as Avalanche, XRP, and Dogecoin all dipped in price. AVAX is suffering the most, having dropped 9% in the past day. XRP and DOGE have each fallen 2% since yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecentralized exhange Uniswap's UNI token surged in price, though, and was at the time of writing priced at $5.66\u2014a 12% 24-hour jump.\n\nThe DOJ said Tuesday that the crypto brand didn't have sufficient anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer controls in place. As a result, the platform was used by terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers wanting to move funds.\n\nBinance agreed to pay a $4 billion settlement\u2014one of the biggest corporate penalties in U.S. history\u2014and exit the American market. Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nMaarten Regterschot, a CryptoQuant contributing analyst, pointed out a significant trend in the Ethereum (ETH) market.\n\nHis observations reveal a \"systemic buying\" pattern in Ethereum futures that is characterized by a noticeable increase in open interest.\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum futures have seen an addition of $700 million so far, indicating a strategic accumulation of assets over a period.\n\nUnderstanding TWAP-buying\n\nTWAP, or time-weighted average price, is a strategic approach employed primarily by large-scale traders or institutional investors.\n\nIt involves spreading out the purchase of assets over a specified period to achieve an advantageous average price, thus reducing the impact on the market price.\n\nThe recent development could signal a bullish sentiment among major investors and could potentially influence Ethereum's market trajectory.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price nears key support level\n\nEthereum's current trading pattern is of particular interest as it approaches a key support level, identified around $1,925.\n\nSupport levels are crucial in trading, signifying a price point where a downward trend could pause due to increased demand.\n\nDespite recent price swings, with Ethereum oscillating between $1,940 and $2,018, it has notably stayed above the $2,000 mark at the time of reporting.\n\nThis persistence near the support level might indicate a robust market sentiment for Ethereum, presenting potential buying opportunities. However, it also raises a cautionary note since any break below this level could lead to further price declines."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2023, Blast, a new second-layer solution on Ethereum (ETH), caused unprecedented hype on social media. By press time, over $87 million in liquidity is injected into this on-chain bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is Blast, novel Ethereum staking L2: Highlights\n\nBlast L2 protocol attempts to change the way Ether (ETH) is staked on-chain. It employs a number of eccentric mechanisms designed to offer more profitable and seamless staking for ETH holders.\n\nBlast is promoted as a second-layer protocol on top of Ethereum (ETH), the largest programmable blockchain.\n\nPer the statement of its team, Blast automatically stakes all injected crypto in Lido and redistributes staking rewards between investors if its L2.\n\nAlso, users who bridge stablecoins, automatically get USDB, Blast's auto-rebasing stablecoin, to enjoy additional yield from MakerDAO's on-chain T-bill protocol.\n\nBlast team will enable withdrawals on Feb. 24, 2024, while redemption of Blast Points is set to kick off in May.\n\nThe project siphoned over $87 million in Ether and stablecoins in less than 24 hours upon launch.\n\nImage by 21 Shares via Dune Analytics\n\nBy press time, its TVL metric demonstrates over 20,000% daily growth, which makes it arguably the fastest growing L2 in Ethereum (ETH) history.\n\nBlast, most overhyped Ethereum L2 in Q4, 2023\n\nBlast, a novel L2 on Ethereum, is attempting to make ETH staking more profitable via the concept of \"native yield.\"\n\nBlast L2: Basics\n\nBlast is the second-layer solution on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Per its official statement, Blast is developed by contributors of Blur, a dominant NFT marketplace. Also, it is said to be funded by heavyweight VCs Paradigm, Standard Crypto and Primitive Ventures with the participation of top angel investors Andrew Kang and Santiago Santos.\n\nSimply put, the protocol attempts to offer more inclusive and profitable staking for ETH and stablecoin holders than its competitors.\n\nWith Blast, ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2. Ether-denominated yield from an L1 staking protocol (initially Lido) is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nBlast attempts to integrate real-world assets into the ETH staking process. All of its customers who inject stablecoins get USDB, Blast's native asset. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO protocol pegged to U.S. 10-year T-bills.\n\nBlast L2: When will the token arrive?\n\nBlast released a three-step timeline for its operations:\n\nEarly access (already live from Nov. 21): Bridge goes live, Blast Points distribution starts. Mainnet launch (expected on Feb. 24, 2024): dApps go live, ETH withdrawals enabled by team. Redemption (expected in May 24, 2024): Blast Points redemption activated.\n\nUsers will only be able to withdraw what they inject into Blast three months after the start of its early access campaign.\n\nBlast Ethereum L2: Risks\n\nBesides the high volatility of cryptocurrency and other \"regular\" considerations necessary for crypto investors, there are some extra risks associated with the project so far:\n\nNobody can predict the price of Ether and associated assets on the day of the unlocking; the stakes-USD-denominated valuation can either spike or shrink.\n\nAirdrop of token is not guaranteed; its rules are also yet to be announced.\n\nInterest in building dApps on this L2 cannot be predicted.\n\nAs such, users should be extra cautious when working with every early-stage cryptocurrency protocol."

Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEmbark on a crypto journey where Ethereum Classic (ETC) surges post-Ethereum\u2019s transition, Optimism (OP) experiences a 45% surge, and the spotlight shines on VC Spectra (SPCT). With a $2.4 million private seed sale success, VC Spectra promises quarterly dividends, buybacks, and exclusive ICO access.\n\nLet\u2019s find out more about which might be the best investment!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) experienced a significant 29% price surge to $19.71, driven by a substantial increase in hash rate.\n\nOptimism (OP) surged 45% to $1.79 on Nov 20, driven by strategic hires like Ryan Wyatt and innovations like Redstone.\n\nVC Spectra\u2019s SPCT token achieved 725% ROI in presale Sateg 4, making it one of the top altcoins of 2023.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Thrives: Hashrate Surge and Price Rally\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has surged with renewed vigor following the Ethereum network\u2019s groundbreaking transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, rendering traditional mining obsolete. This pivotal moment catalyzed a substantial uptick in ETC\u2019s hash rate, soaring from 70.5 terahash/second to an impressive 158.3 TH/s.\n\nThe influx of miners diverting their computational power to Ethereum Classic (ETC) exemplifies its resilience and attractiveness within the crypto ecosystem. The heightened hash rate not only fortifies the security of the Ethereum Classic (ETC) network but also underscores the community\u2019s confidence in the project\u2019s viability.\n\nAs a direct consequence, the Ethereum Classic price (ETC) experienced a remarkable 29% surge, reaching $19.71 on November 20. This Ethereum Classic price surge showcases the market\u2019s positive response to the increased mining activity and underscores Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) role as a preferred choice for miners seeking alternative opportunities.\n\nThe impressive price rally aligns with Ethereum Classic\u2019s commitment to maintaining the principles of decentralization and security, solidifying its standing in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Analysts\u2019 Ethereum Classic prediction suggests that the Ethereum Classic price (ETC) could reach $22.46 in December.\n\nOptimism Crypto (OP) Surges 45% Amidst Strategic Developments\n\nIn a month, the price of the Optimism coin (OP) has surged by an impressive 45%, reaching $1.79 on November 20. This significant uptrend coincides with promising developments within the Optimism (OP) ecosystem, signaling a potentially bullish trajectory for the Optimism coin (OP).\n\nThe recent hiring of Ryan Wyatt, a seasoned professional with a background at Polygon Labs and YouTube, as Chief Growth Officer for Optimism Unlimited Ltd., showcases a strategic move to bolster ecosystem expansion and developer support.\n\nAdditionally, the unveiling of Redstone, an \u201calternative data availability\u201d network by blockchain developer Lattice, operating as a test network for cost-effective on-chain games and decentralized applications within the Optimism (OP) ecosystem, further strengthens the narrative of innovation and growth.\n\nAs Redstone pioneers a unique approach to data availability, its integration into the broader Optimism framework could contribute to increased efficiency and scalability, potentially influencing OP\u2019s upward momentum in the market.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts alike are closely watching these developments, anticipating positive implications for the future value and adoption of Optimism (OP). Analysts expect the Optimism coin (OP) to reach the $2 mark in December.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT): Presale Success and Bullish Momentum\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) has made significant waves in the crypto sphere, recently securing an impressive $2.4 million in its private seed sale. This successful fundraising laid the foundation for its subsequent public presale, which has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nKicking off with an initial altcoin price of $0.008, VC Spectra\u2019s presale progressed through multiple stages, each marked by increasing token prices. The demand for SPCT tokens exceeded expectations, triggering a cascade effect. The price surged by an astonishing 725% to reach $0.066 in Stage 4, surpassing investors expectations.\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, VC Spectra is poised to exceed the projected end-of-presale value of $0.080. This unexpected surge makes VC Spectra (SPCT) one of the best altcoins in 2023.\n\nVC Spectra stands out as a decentralized hedge fund, rewarding users with quarterly dividends and buybacks fueled by its investment profits. Users not only gain access to exclusive new ICOs during seed/private sales but also enjoy voting rights within the VC Spectra platform.\n\nThe SPCT token, a BRC-20 standard token on the Bitcoin blockchain, serves multiple purposes, including decentralized trading, asset management, and transaction fee payments.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund"

        "content": "Steven Nerayoff Lawsuits Will Reveal Facts Supporting Claims Against Key Ethereum Figures, Says Attorney\n\nIn a new chapter of the ETHGate saga, Steven Nerayoff\u2019s attorney, Michael Scotto, said they have ample evidence to back up forthcoming lawsuits against the US Government and additional private actors, as well as whistleblower filings that they intend to release, some of which will implicate major players in Ethereum\u2019s early days.\n\nIn an interview with Cryptonews.com, Scotto detailed how they plan to counter the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d surrounding his client with factual revelations in the lawsuits, which will be filed in New York State and Federal Courts.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, an early Ethereum insider, spent years battling government accusations of extortion before finally getting charges dismissed earlier this year. He is now seeking legal recourse.\n\nBATTLING SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION EVERYWHERE: @SenWarren, I advocate for strong US crypto regulations. PLEASE go after the bad actors in our space. But the DOJ, SEC, & FBI prosecuted me for 3 1/2 years for a crime THEY fabricated. Despite proving this, the sham prosecution continued\u2026 https://t.co/HlNE9Tp3dp pic.twitter.com/qQZxzo20ca \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 22, 2023\n\nScotto asserted that Nerayoff harbors no ill will toward Ethereum itself, which he still wants to see prosper, portraying Nerayoff as pro-crypto and pro-Ethereum philosophically. Nerayoff takes issue with how the project took shape and has objections over particular actions by specific leaders, however, he said.\n\nWhile the validity of Nerayoff\u2019s claims is still unconfirmed, Scotto said the forthcoming lawsuits will likely include charges of malicious prosecution and breach of contract over hundreds of millions in unpaid deals and that the whistleblower fillings will relate specifically to ETHGate.\n\nAs was seen in the recording Nerayoff published last week, he provided key strategic guidance to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015 on tackling mounting structural, legal, and financial problems.\n\nAn X post on November 15 from Nerayoff also hinted at the possibility of fraud being in the mix of allegations that will be revealed in the lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,\u201d he wrote in the post.\n\nThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit. 48-Hour Countdown: Ethereum Insider's Shocking Fraud Expose Looms \u2013 Crypto News Flash https://t.co/uvD6PjfcVJ \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nThough recognizing the need for change, Buterin seemed reluctant to make necessary choices in the recording. A restructuring plan was also proposed but never fully implemented.\n\nSteven Nerayoff Exonerated After Years Defending Against Charges\n\n\n\nScotto explained that his client was focused entirely on defending himself after the September 2019 arrest until finally getting the government to dismiss charges. According to Scotto, Nerayoff felt fighting for his life and reputation against wrongful allegations took priority over releasing the recordings of himself and Buterin earlier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say [he was] fighting for his life, and frankly we were only able to go on the offensive this past February when we filed our motion to dismiss,\u201d Scotto said. \u201cThe case was eventually dismissed on the government\u2019s motion because our motion proved they knew he was innocent and charged him anyway, and they ignored that evidence and simply said \u2018Oh yeah, we can\u2019t prove his guilt.'\u201d\n\nNow exonerated, Steven Nerayoff is going on the offense against parties he believes took advantage of the situation. Scotto said Nerayoff sat in court for years until he could fully clear his name.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to kind of coordinate those (the recordings and lawsuits)\u2026 And so that\u2019s coming shortly,\u201d Scotto told Cryptonews.com. \u201c\u2026The idea was we would put this out there because when those lawsuits became public, we didn\u2019t want people to then question who Steve was and what happened.\u201d\n\nSteve was innocent and we had the evidence to show the case was fabricated and his alleged co-conspirator was a govt informant. @JohnEDeaton1 commented on the dismissal. https://t.co/Tg5ToWsooN look to the east soon. \u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) November 17, 2023\n\nScotto said that the dismissal of charges against Nerayoff followed revelations that government officials knew he was innocent at least seven months prior to arresting him, and that his alleged co-conspirator was an FBI informant who conned Nerayoff out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nLawyer Hints at SEC Role in Ethereum Investigation\n\n\n\nScotto said the facts would illuminate \u201ccoincidences between certain events that were going on at the SEC and steps that were being taken\u201d against Nerayoff. He said one aspect of the lawsuits would deal with \u201cmalicious prosecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big one,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then a couple of breach of contract cases on some of these deals that people basically either took advantage of the situation or [were] a part of creating the situation in order to stiff Steve of literally hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nScotto said the full sequence of events will make clear that the malicious prosecution occurred.\n\nSoooo..given the news about Consensys, JPM , law suits and probable links to the SEC\u2026can we conclude that Ethereum IS a centralised, bankers shit coin ?\u2026 Answers on a post card to @GaryGensler and the @SECGov and it was projection onto #XRP all along #XRPArmy #XRPCommunity \u2014 MADDOG (@PMADDOGMAC) March 5, 2022\n\nWithin the next few weeks, Nerayoff is planning to release the Ethereum whistleblower filings and file the malicious prosecution lawsuit, according to Scotto, who maintained they have ample evidence to back claims of hundreds of millions in damages from broken deals.\n\nButerin and Lubin Silent Amid Accusations\n\n\n\nEthereum leaders have so far been publicly silent amid the bold accusations of shady activities. Scottor said he finds this lack of denial telling given the nature of the allegations.\n\nHe added that Nerayoff\u2019s frustrations also stem from parts of the crypto media declining to cover his exoneration and the questionable circumstances around it. He ultimately released the collection of five Buterin recordings directly on the blockchain\u2014decentralizing it\u2014to get the story out.\n\nEthereum Community Faces Moment of Reckoning\n\n\n\nIf true, these latest allegations may present a crisis moment for Ethereum as doubts multiply regarding its origins and Buterin\u2019s leadership. With the platform aspiring to be a Web3 backbone, this controversy could deepen existing concerns over stagnant Ether prices and developer frustrations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to other people to decide, but I think people will be able to judge based on these objective facts and conclusions that they can draw based on those facts,\u201d Scotto said."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nA new Ethereum project called Blast was announced on Monday claiming to be a Layer 2 network and promoting attractive staking yields. However, Polygon protocol engineer Jarrod Watts has called into question Blast\u2019s legitimacy, stating it is \u201cnot an L2.\u201d\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Blast has locked over $335 million in ETH and DAI in the last few days.\n\nBlast is not an L2. The Blast smart contract:\n\n1/ Accepts funds from users.\n\n2/ Stakes users' funds into protocols like LIDO. There's no testnet, no transactions, no bridge, no rollup, and no sending of transaction data to Ethereum. It's not an L2. (13/24) \u2014 Jarrod Watts (@jarrodWattsDev) November 23, 2023\n\nWatts outlined multiple issues on Twitter, that Blast currently has no operational network for transactions or bridges back to Ethereum. Instead, the Blast smart contract accepts user deposits and stakes them into Lido ETH staking and MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol to generate yield.\n\nBlast is backed by major VC firms like Paradigm and influencers in the crypto space. However, users must trust that Blast\u2019s team of pseudonymous and mostly unknown developers will eventually build the promised technology to unlock deposits.\n\nWatts showed the bridge could be set to any basic contract, which would then have access to all $335 million in staked assets. The contract is controlled by a multi-signature wallet held by 5 newly-created addresses.\n\nWhile admitting the chances of an exploit seem low, Watts concluded \u201cIf I had to guess, I don\u2019t think the funds will be stolen.\u201d"

        "content": "Breaking: Nerayoff Follows Through, Releases 2015 Vitalik Buterin Recordings and Alleges Ethereum Corruption, Fraud\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto community has been rocked by allegations of Ethereum corruption and fraud stemming from co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Last week, early Ethereum insider Steven Nerayoff promised to disclose recordings from 2015 that would expose fraudulent activities by Buterin during Ethereum\u2019s troubled early days. Today, Nerayoff followed through, releasing five conversations between himself and Buterin, as well as a proposed \u201cRescue & Restructure Plan\u201d for the organization from 2015.\n\nIn an X post today, Nerayoff clarified, \u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit.\u201d\n\nThe recordings provide unprecedented insight into Ethereum\u2019s shaky beginnings, portraying a young Buterin seeking guidance from Nerayoff on navigating mounting challenges. They reveal flaws in Ethereum\u2019s structure, decision-making, and leadership in its critical formative stages. If substantiated, these revelations could irreparably damage Buterin\u2019s reputation and the public\u2019s confidence in Ethereum as doubts grow about its long-term viability.\n\nWith Ether prices still lagging below 2022 highs amidst this controversy, the stakes are sky-high. While the validity of Nerayoff\u2019s evidence still needs to be thoroughly vetted in the coming days, the immediate fallout highlights the need for radical transparency, sound judgment, and clear communication. These are essential pillars for any blockchain project eyeing mainstream adoption.\n\nFor Ethereum, the path forward no doubt requires restoring community trust, preventing fragmentation, and implementing strategies focused on platform stability rather than short-term gains.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nSummary and Analysis of the Buterin-Nerayoff Conversations\n\n\n\nThe conversations between Steven Nerayoff and Vitalik Buterin in 2015 cover a wide range of organizational issues plaguing Ethereum in its early stages. Nerayoff plays the role of an advisor, assessing Ethereum\u2019s deficiencies and proposing major changes to ensure its viability.\n\nA key area of concern highlighted in the recordings was Ethereum\u2019s financial management early on. Specifically, Nerayoff sharply criticized the decision not to hedge Ethereum\u2019s Bitcoin holdings as Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuated wildly in the early days.\n\nAs he told Nerayoff, \u201cThere was never a decision made not to hedge. It was just\u2026I mean basically a really huge amount of inertia is probably the only way you could describe it.\u201d\n\nNerayoff heavily critiqued Buterin in the recordings.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the position wasn\u2019t hedged in my opinion is inexcusable. Absolutely inexcusable,\u201d he replied.\n\nHis white paper was unworkable. Gavin fixed it in his yellow paper & he\u2019s the reason 1.0 got out the door. Vitalik is the reason 2.0 never got out the door. And with developers all on Ethereum being false promised scalability that would never come it held back all of crypto. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nTopics Covered\n\nThe discussions touched on several key challenges facing Ethereum, including:\n\nLack of operational infrastructure, especially in Switzerland which was vital for administrative functions\n\nConcerns about Ethereum\u2019s financial decisions, including failure to hedge and speculation on Bitcoin value\n\nLegal and regulatory risks related to money transfers, tax compliance, and promotion of questionable ICOs\n\nPoor internal structure with a lack of clear roles and disjointed teams\n\nIssues with co-founder conduct, communication, and competency\n\nNeed for rebranding and improved community outreach\n\nIntense competition in the blockchain landscape\n\nNerayoff as Advisor on Restructuring\n\nThroughout the conversations, Nerayoff positioned himself as an advisor guiding Buterin. Looking to Ethereum\u2019s future leadership, Nerayoff stressed the urgent need for an experienced executive.\n\n\u201cThe CEO needs to be able to make calls and if you have a CEO, in this type of company, there can be an interim CEO that we can find that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be deep into the technology, but I think your long term CEO does,\u201d he advised Buterin.\n\nHe provided blunt critiques of Ethereum\u2019s deficiencies and proposed radical solutions, including:\n\nComplete operational overhaul involving new executive hires, staff cuts, and redefined roles\n\nLegal and financial audits to identify compliance issues\n\nRelocation of the entire operation to Switzerland\n\nCreation of a new for-profit entity alongside the existing foundation\n\nRebranding and marketing campaign focused on developers\n\n\u201cYou have to decide first of all whether or not you\u2019re willing to do what it takes here. You have to decide whether or not the organization is more important than any individual, \u201d Nerayoff told Buterin during their conversation.\n\nButerin Seeking Solutions\n\nIn their conversations, Buterin acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s precarious situation and the merit of Nerayoff\u2019s proposals but seemed uncertain about how to implement the major changes required.\n\nButerin also admitted to mistakes in financial decisions and a lack of assertiveness in managing the team, deferring frequently to Nerayoff for strategic advice.\n\nIn assessing his leadership skills, Buterin said in the recordings, \u201cIf I had to describe my faults it would be, I was basically trying to abdicate responsibility the whole time.\u201d\n\nExamination of the \u2018Rescue & Restructure Plan\u2019\n\n\n\nThe \u201cRescue & Restructure Plan\u201d outlined by Nerayoff in 2015 provides further insight into the changes he proposed for getting Ethereum back on track. The plan called for a relocation to Switzerland, an executive and staff overhaul, a focus on legal and financial compliance, structural changes, and marketing and branding changes. Details for each category include:\n\nRelocation to Switzerland\n\nMove all operations to Switzerland to centralize control and meet legal obligations\n\nEliminate involvement of \u201cdisconnected\u201d co-founders resistant to relocating\n\nRenegotiate agreements between Swiss entity and related parties\n\nExecutive and Staff Overhaul\n\nHire experienced CFO and COO to provide \u201cadult supervision\u201d\n\nTerminate or reassign co-founders and staff causing issues\n\nReduce salaries and offer equity compensation\n\nIncentivize a recruiter to build out the team\n\nThough recognizing the need for change, Buterin appeared reluctant to make tough staffing choices.\n\n\u201cIf I have to bump up against people, I will, but the thing is, this is one issue I have. It\u2019s exactly the issue that I\u2019ve already said in our calls today a couple of times: basically, these Maltese (unknown) people are cool,\u201d he told Nerayoff in the recordings.\n\nLegal and Financial Compliance\n\nConduct an independent audit of all financial accounts\n\nReview for compliance issues with securities, tax, and money transfer laws\n\nEliminate promotional involvement with questionable ICOs\n\nArchive and annotate all communications for transparency\n\nStructural Changes\n\nStreamline roles and operations based on consultant review\n\nConsolidate fragmented teams and entities\n\nLaunch dedicated teams for initiatives like DAO creation\n\nConsider bringing back exiled strategic thinkers like Charles Hoskinson.\n\nButerin also admitted the aimlessness at Ethereum\u2019s core during their conversations, saying \u201cRight now, Ethereum isn\u2019t really a company, it\u2019s more of an idea, coupled with a nonprofit organization that happens to have some quantity of money attached to it that\u2019ll last us another year.\u201d\n\nBranding and Marketing\n\nComplete rebranding and marketing reset\n\nShowcase successful dApps and create developer support tools\n\nSpotlight Buterin\u2019s personal brand and technical strengths\n\nIn short, the proposed overhaul sought to remedy a wide array of intertwined issues that threatened the foundation\u2019s survival.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Reputation and Market Value\n\n\n\nThe release of the Buterin recordings and restructuring plan has generated intense discussion within the Ethereum community. Many see it as confirmation of long-held doubts about Buterin\u2019s competency during the platform\u2019s origins. Caution should be exercised until a more rigorous examination of the evidence can be conducted.\n\nButerin has already faced growing criticism in recent years as the price of Ether stagnated. His reputation as a visionary thought leader has steadily declined in some peoples\u2019 eyes.\n\nThe controversy also comes at a time when frustration was already high over Ethereum\u2019s failure to reach new price highs. The price of Ether has trended downward through the year despite broader cryptocurrency gains. It continues lagging well below its all-time highs, even as competitors like Solana make inroads.\n\nAdding to the woes are signs that the public\u2019s trust in Ethereum may be fracturing. The risk of splinter groups forming hard forks from the main chain has grown as criticisms mount. Without restored faith in Ethereum\u2019s leadership and direction, its cohesion could be in danger. This new alleged corruption and its unflattering portrait of ineptitude only accelerates the erosion.\n\nFollowing the release of recordings, Ethereum\u2019s price crashed by 4.70% and is currently trading at $1,962.68.\n\nWhile the long-term ramifications remain uncertain, the immediate impact is clearly detrimental for Ethereum. For a platform aspiring to be the backbone of Web3, these are significant setbacks on the road to mainstream adoption.\n\nIs Ethereum Safe?\n\n\n\nThe ramifications of the latest Ethereum scandal remain to be fully determined, but the risks for Ethereum are clearly huge. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation will need to promptly and thoroughly address the allegations if they hope to mitigate the damage.\n\nA point-by-point examination of the evidence presented by Nerayoff is critical. Any confirmed improprieties or incompetence by leadership should be transparently acknowledged. Swift action may be required, potentially including Buterin\u2019s resignation or removal depending on the severity.\n\nRemember this video when I drop the recording & what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures. Is Vitalik the savior they bill him as to make Ethereum scale or is he the reason it never scaled? Decide for yourselves. #CryptoJudas #InconvenientTruths https://t.co/BeGzOpYx4o \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nRestoring public trust will be a monumental challenge for Ethereum. A coherent communications strategy is needed to soothe concerns over Ethereum\u2019s stability and viability for the long term. The community must be reassured that careful steps are being taken to correct course and learn from past mistakes.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, employing the best talent and making sound technical decisions are also imperative. Ethereum\u2019s value rests on its capabilities as a decentralized platform. Its technological progress must not stall amidst organizational turmoil.\n\nWhile the public anger elicited by this scandal presents obstacles, it also offers opportunities for improvement. With wise guidance, Ethereum could emerge stronger by replacing ineffective leaders, mending community ties, and refocusing its mission. But without prudence and skillful management of the fallout, the once-bright future of this blockchain pioneer could swiftly dim."

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nCrypto market capitalisation rose 2.4% in 24 hours to $1.42 trillion, with gains across a vast range of altcoins from +0.4% (BNB) to +15.6% (Uniswap). The Crypto Fear and Greed Index added 4 points to 66 (Greed), though it\u2019s still some way off the indicator's November peak of 74.\n\nBitcoin bounces around in an ascending channel, hitting its three-week upper resistance of $37.8K on Wednesday evening. An intensifying sell-off thwarts attempts to heat the price, but the pullbacks have become less deep over the past three weeks, suggesting the building up of bullish sentiment. At the same time, this relative stabilisation in the range removes local overbought conditions, allowing to stick to gains of the previous advance. A break of resistance could see a quick rise above $40K.\n\nXRP received buyers' support on Wednesday after touching the 50-day moving average, giving it a chance to stabilise after a pullback of more than 20% from its early November peak.\n\nHowever, the buying of Ethereum on its dip below $2,000 on Wednesday was more notable. Active buying in the world's second most-capitalised coin took the price back to $2060, near the top of the range since the 10th of November.\n\nNews background\n\nGrayscale met with the SEC to discuss converting the GBTC ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale officials announced they signed a fund servicing agreement with Bank of New York Mellon. The institution will act as GBTC's counterparty, facilitating the issuance and redemption of shares.\n\nIn a joint statement with the DOJ, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Binance had paid for its greed and non-compliance with the law.\n\nBinance will remain one of the largest crypto exchanges for two to three years. The agreements with US authorities are a positive outcome despite the lack of SEC inclusion, Matrixport believes.\n\nMt. Gox's creditors will start receiving payments before the end of this year, the bankrupt exchange's trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi assured. However, given the large number of creditors, the payouts will likely continue until 2024. Mt. Gox's creditors have been expecting repayment for nearly a decade, and the payment deadline has been repeatedly postponed.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto exchange HTX (formerly Huobi) and the HECO network were hacked. Unknown persons withdrew assets worth $110 million. The head of HTX has already confirmed the fact of the hack.\n\nLastly, former Revolut VP of development Hannes Graah, ex-employee of Coinbase and Spotify, backed by Galaxy Digital, will launch the Zeal cryptocurrency wallet in Q1 2024."

Let's find out the potential performances of these assets in the crypto bull market.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) Offers Massive Earning Opportunities To Investors\n\nMeme coins have built a reputation for outperforming the rest of the crypto market during bull markets. But, Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) isn't a regular meme coin. The project has integrated a gaming ecosystem and several earning opportunities to further boost its bullish potential. This made $GFOX one of the best crypto to invest in for the bull market.\n\nThe Galaxy Fox offers several opportunities for investors and gamers to make money within its ecosystem. This has attracted most of the crypto community to the project. One of the first methods to earn is through the web3 intergalactic runner game, dubbed Galaxy Fox.\n\nPlayers gain rewards for finishing missions and taking over new territory in the exciting virtual world of intergalactic foxes. The game will feature an intergalactic leaderboard that ranks the best players from different cosmos. A player will receive greater rewards the higher they place on this leaderboard.\n\nDigital assets and $GFOX tokens are the rewards gamers will earn.

However, they have been recording slow price growth in recent times.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has consolidated following the break above the $2,000 resistance level. However, BNB has risen, reaching a new monthly high of $260 in November after dropping for several months. Both altcoins may see increases in value in the upcoming weeks, according to some analysts.\n\nA price target of $3,000 has been established for Ethereum. But before that, $ETH needs to overcome the resistance level of $2,150. The next significant objective for $BNB is $320. With gains of 48% and 24% looming, both Ethereum and BNB look set to be outperformed by Galaxy Fox by December's end.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nDespite being two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, $BNB and Ethereum look set to be outperformed by the newer Galaxy Fox. The unique gaming model and earning potential of Galaxy Fox have drawn a lot of users to the ecosystem.\n\nBecause the project is still in its beta presale stage, Galaxy Fox is ranked as the best crypto to invest in right now.

        "content": "During the recovery of the altcoin market, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, has surged by 4%, pushing the ETH price beyond the $2,000 mark once again.\n\nEthereum Whale Accumulation Continues\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment said that as the Ethereum network growth shoots, the largest wallet addresses have accumulated more than 30% of the total ETH supply over the last year.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a recent development in the Ethereum space, the top 200 Ethereum wallets collectively possess 62.76 million ETH, valued at approximately $124.1 billion. Notably, these wallets have accrued 30.3% more coins since November 21, 2022. Furthermore, a surge in Ethereum wallet activity was observed, with a remarkable 94.7 thousand new ETH wallets created yesterday\u2014the most substantial increase since July.\n\nOn the other hand, the demand for Ethereum derivatives is also on the rise. Maarten Regterschot, an analyst contributing to CryptoQuant, has highlighted a noteworthy trend in the Ethereum (ETH) market. His analysis points to a pattern of \u201csystemic buying\u201d in Ethereum futures, characterized by a substantial rise in open interest. Notably, Ethereum futures have experienced an influx of $700 million, suggesting a deliberate accumulation of assets over a specific timeframe.\n\nETH Exchange Supply Declines\n\nSantiment data reveals that the supply of ETH tokens on exchanges has decreased by nearly 20% over the last six months. This decline in ETH supply on exchanges is at its lowest point in half a year, indicating a positive outlook for potential price increases in the altcoin. The reduced selling pressure on ETH suggests favorable conditions for upward movements.\n\nConcurrently, there is an uptick in activity from ETH wallets, a metric that gauges the demand for Ethereum among market participants and overall network engagement. Increased activity and the creation of new wallets during a price uptrend are often viewed as bullish indicators for the asset.\n\nETH Price to $3,000?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has gained momentum, surpassing the $2,000 support level and instilling confidence in traders with a bullish outlook. The recent rise from $1,930 signals a positive trajectory, hinting at a potential breakout towards the coveted $3,000 mark.\n\nSupporting the optimistic sentiment are golden cross patterns, with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing above both the 100-day EMA and the 200-EMA around two weeks ago. To sustain the uptrend, Ethereum\u2019s price faces crucial challenges at $2,130, where weakening resistance needs to be overcome, and $2,000, which must hold as a robust support level.\n\nThe successful breach of the $2,130 hurdle is pivotal for signaling increasing momentum and ensuring the continuation of the upward trend. Such a move could also negate the sell signal indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, potentially leading to another bullish breakout."

        "content": "Blast, a brand new Ethereum Layer 2 network, has drawn a startling amount of interest and security concerns due to a surge of investors using the network to bridge their assets.\n\nBlast Hits $123 Million In TVL\n\nBlast recently announced its mainnet access on X (formerly Twitter). The L2 network built by Pacman Blur has gained a staggering amount of attention from crypto investors following the declaration.\n\n\u201cIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. We\u2019ve raised $20m from Paradigm and StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more,\u201d Blast stated.\n\nBlast recorded over 23,368 users in just 24 hours of announcing the imminent launch of its mainnet. The influx of investors pushed Blast\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) to $81 million in a single day.\n\n\u201c23,368 users have joined the Blast Community in the past 24 hours. Thanks to them, Blast has reached $81 Million in TVL in one day! We\u2019re excited to share more with community members soon. There\u2019s much more to come,\u201d Blast said.\n\nPresently, Blast has recorded over $123 million in TVL from assets bridged by investors. This unexpected surge in bridging demands has raised concerns especially due to the unusual conditions attached to the bridging process.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAccording to Blast, users can only access the Ethereum L2 network after receiving an invitation code. The network has also stated that users will not be able to withdraw their bridged funds until February 2024.\n\nWhile the unconventional bridging conditions have raised some red flags, many investors continue to express their interest by actively bridging their assets\n\nDetails About New Ethereum L2 Network\n\nBlast has outlined several important details of its bridging and staking processes. The Ethereum L2 network highlighted the potential yield benefits of investors when they bridge their ETH tokens and stablecoins. The network has also stated that investors who stake their ETH can gain profits over time as their assets grow in their Blast wallets.\n\n\u201cOnce you have access, you can bridge to earn yield (4% for ETH + 5% for stablecoins) and Blast Points ahead of the Mainnet launch in February (2024). Early access members get more points based on how much they bridge and who they invite,\u201d Blast stated.\n\nThe L2 network added:\n\nSpecifically, Blast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2\u2019s users and dapps. We\u2019ve redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically.\n\nAdditionally, Blast has expanded its bridging capabilities to a diverse range of digital assets. According to the L2 network, investors can bridge beyond ETH and opt for stablecoins such as USDT, DAI, and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just ETH on Blast that earns yield. Stablecoins do too. When you bridge stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and DAI to Blast, it\u2019s deposited in on-chain T-Bill protocols like MakerDAO, and the yield is passed back to Blast users via USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin,\u201d Blast stated.\n\nETH price regains support above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Metaverse Post, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, the stars may be starting to align for the number 2 cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto recovers quickly\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s joint US DOJ and Treasury enforcement action against Binance and its leader Changpeng Zhao, the crypto market took a bit of a tumble. However, Wednesday has dawned brightly for the crypto market, and ethereum is starting to look strong.\n\n$ETH bull flag\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nIn the short term 4-hour time frame it can be seen that $ETH is in a flag and is approaching the top for a potential breakout to the upside.

        "content": "Wed 22 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nA recent report from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) reveals that 19 large banks have heavily invested in crypto, amounting to 9.4 billion euros, with Ripple making a notable presence alongside giants Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe crypto XRP gains popularity among banks\n\nWhile the banking sector has long been reluctant toward cryptocurrencies, it seems that mindsets have radically changed. According to the recent report from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), 19 large banks have massively invested in crypto at the level of 9.4 billion euros.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin (31%) and Ethereum (22%) dominate the portfolios, but XRP has also emerged with 2% of the total investments, equivalent to 188 million euros.\n\nThe increasing presence of XRP in the investment strategies of these institutions is notable. Even though it remains behind BTC and ETH, the XRP token has climbed to the third place among the favoured cryptocurrencies. This interest can be explained by several factors.\n\nOn one hand, Ripple has won several legal battles against the SEC, thereby reassuring investors about the long-term viability of XRP. On the other hand, Ripple continues to expand its cross-border payment services to new banks around the world. Its RippleNet network, which uses XRP, is now accessible in several countries.\n\nOther altcoins emerging in banks\n\nIn addition to the dominant trio BTC-ETH-XRP, the BCBS report reveals the growing presence of other crypto-assets like DOT, ADA, or LTC in the banking portfolios.\n\nTogether, they still represent only 5% of the allocations, but this shows that financial institutions are beginning to diversify their digital assets beyond dominant coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe increasing integration of public blockchains within banking strategies reflects a paradigm shift: banks are increasingly adopting innovations from decentralized finance.\n\nWith nearly 10 billion euros already invested in crypto, there is no doubt that this is just the beginning. The appetite of institutional investors for these new digital assets will probably only grow in the coming years. The banking sector could soon become one of the main drivers of mass adoption of cryptocurrencies like XRP.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced a crucial partnership with Atomic Wallet to expose its tokens to over five million users. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) saw a price surge after BlackRock took a significant step ahead in the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, a new coin is gaining traction as it aims for a $100 million market cap.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what this new emerging crypto coin is and why some crypto enthusiasts are looking into it and considering it a contender for the cryptos to watch out for!\n\nShiba Inu Announces Integration With Atomic Wallet, SHIB Soars\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Shiba Inu confirmed the integration of Atomic Wallet, a prominent non-custodial decentralized wallet, into its platform. This integration marks a strategic move for Shiba Inu, allowing the wallet's expansive user base of 5 million to access the Shibarium blockchain seamlessly.\n\nThe announcement highlights Atomic Wallet's newfound support for Shibarium-native cryptocurrencies, including SHIB, LEASH, and BONE. Since its launch in August, Shibarium has rapidly gained adoption, processing nearly 3.5 million transactions within its initial 90 days.\n\nFollowing the news of the integration, the market responded with a notable surge in the price of Shiba Inu. On November 15, the SHIB price stood at $0.000008343, and after the announcement, SHIB experienced a substantial increase of 9.7%, reaching $0.000009156 by November 16. But has since experienced a decrease in price to $0.000007947 as of November 22.\n\nPer SHIB price prediction, some enthusiasts anticipate a bullish trajectory for Shiba Inu. Projections indicate that SHIB could experience an impressive surgeby 2024.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run, coupled with the positive impact of recent partnerships and integrations.\n\nHowever, a more conservative forecast suggests that SHIB may maintain a more modest level in 2024, acknowledging the potential influence of bearish sentiments in the market.\n\nBlackRock Registers Ishares Ethereum Trust in Delaware\n\nIn a pivotal move on November 9, 2023, Blackrock took a significant step in the crypto space by formally recording its Ishares Ethereum Trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations.\n\nThe official document, dated November 9, identifies the trust as statutory and acknowledges Blackrock Advisors as the filing party. This development has sparked speculation among market watchers, hinting that Blackrock may be strategically positioning itself to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThis move follows the firm's earlier submission for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, for which regulatory approval from the SEC is still pending.\n\nThe market's immediate response to this news has been substantial, with the price of Ethereum experiencing a notable surge. On November 9, ETH was trading at $1,884.20. However, post-announcement, ETH soared by 10% to $2,018.66 as of November 22.\n\nPer ETH price prediction, Ethereum's future appears promising.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nRebel Satoshi: A New Meme Coin Aiming for the $100 Market Cap\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ) has emerged as more than just a meme coin; it's a passionate force aiming to disrupt the status quo and achieve a remarkable $100 million market capitalization. As crypto enthusiasts seek the next hidden gem, Rebel Satoshi positions itself as a unique blend of playfulness, purpose, and the potential for substantial returns.\n\nAt its core, Rebel Satoshi represents a movement, a call to rebellion against centralized systems and the entrenched elite. Inspired by historical figures like Satoshi Nakamoto and Guy Fawkes, Rebel Satoshi carries the torch of defiance and unity.\n\nThe $RBLZ token, an ERC-20 standard asset, becomes the symbolic embodiment of this mission, signifying unity against the established norms in the crypto space.\n\nKey features of $RBLZ include staking rewards, deflationary characteristics, meme coin status, a limited collection of 9,999 rare and exclusive NFTs, and governance within the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem.\n\nCurrently in the Early Bid Round of its public presale with a price of $0.010, the company says that $RBLZ is poised to list on exchanges at $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

        "content": "Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to address the growing concerns surrounding identity management and data privacy. Its decentralized and secure nature offers a unique approach to managing and verifying digital identities, providing individuals with greater control over their personal information.\n\nOne of the key advantages of blockchain \u2013 based identity management which Ethereum is leading is its ability to eliminate centralized control over identity data.. Traditional identity systems often rely on centralized authorities, making them vulnerable to data breaches and identity theft. Blockchain, on the other hand, distributes identity information across a network of nodes, preventing any single entity from controlling or manipulating data. This decentralized approach enhances data security and reduces the risk of data leakages.\n\nEthereum, a prominent blockchain platform, has played a significant role in the development of blockchain-dependent identity solutions. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract features allow the creation of self-executing digital identities, enabling individuals to manage their own identity data and control access permissions. This approach empowers users to decide who can access their personal information and for what purposes.\n\nIn addition to its decentralized and secure nature, blockchain-based identity management can also improve efficiency and reduce costs. By automating identity verification processes and eliminating the need for intermediaries, blockchain can streamline transactions and save time and money. This can be particularly beneficial for organizations that frequently verify user identities, such as financial institutions and online service providers.\n\nA Guard Against Fraud\n\nIn developing countries, where bank customers have frequently reported identity theft and fraudulent transactions on their accounts, blockchain technology like Ethereum offers a solution to data privacy and security concerns. With Ethereum\u2019s decentralized and immutable nature, user data is secured and cannot be tampered with or accessed by unauthorized parties, preventing identity theft and financial fraud.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to mature and its adoption grows, its impact on identity management is expected to expand significantly. By providing a decentralized platform for managing digital identities, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact online and protect our personal information.\n\nBlockchain technology like Ethereum has the potential to empower individuals by providing them with greater control over their finances, data, and identity. It can also create opportunities for individuals to engage in the digital economy and benefit from its growth. As Ethereum continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more benefits emerge for individuals."

        "title": "What is Blast: the million-dollar Ethereum L2 cofounded by Blur - OKX",
        "content": "If you're someone who prefers to HODL their portfolio for the long haul, staking and generating passive yield may be at the top of your agenda. With so many staking protocols to choose from, you'll practically be spoilt for choice, as they potentially bring satisfying rewards and security that reassures you of your staking decision.\n\nRecently, an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution that allegedly offers native yield has been making a splash in the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene. Enter Blast: the L2 solution with over $300 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and 50,000 users as of November 2023. As an ever-growing pool of users are hopping aboard the Blast bandwagon, it begs the question \u2014 are these benefits too good to be true?\n\nFrom explaining Blast as an L2 solution to digging deeper into its smart contract specifics, here's everything to know about Blast and its explosive overnight success as an Ethereum L2 solution.\n\nWhat is Blast?\n\nAs the market's only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins, Blast is the result of Blur's founder Tieshun Roquerre recognizing a need for a new L2 optimistic rollup solution with native yield. While Blast is still in early access, it's attracted the attention of yield hunters due to its promises of up to 5% and more. This is thanks to extra Blast rewards in the form of USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin. USDB can then be swapped to USDC once Blast rewards are distributed in May 2024.\n\nHow does Blast work?\n\nWith rewards of up to 5%, one has to wonder where Blast is getting this yield from. To quell the worries of Blast skeptics, Roquerre has been fully transparent with the way the bridged stablecoins and ETH are being handled. In a public Blast thread on X, the L2 optimistic rollup solution has clearly stated its yield sources. Here's a breakdown of how Blast works and how users will interact with the L2 solution:\n\nUsers can deposit ETH, stETH, DAI, USDC or USDT. These deposits are locked until February 2024, when Blast's mainnet and DApps go live.\n\nUSDT deposits are swapped into DAI via Curve Finance's 3pool while USDC deposits are converted to DAI via MakerDAO.\n\nThese user deposits are then converted into yield bearing assets. Blast natively participates in ETH staking and will stake the deposited ETH on Lido, where it's converted to stETH and staking yields about 4% APY.\n\nETH deposited and staked with Blast is auto rebasing, meaning it's meant to maintain a stable price and protect holders from potential inflation.\n\nStablecoins are deposited into on-chain treasury bill protocols like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate contract. These claim to yield about 5% APY and will be returned to Blast users via USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin.\n\nSince Blast is in early access for the next couple of months, participation is limited to invite codes. Users get more Blast points based on how much they bridge and who they invite.\n\nWhy's Blast so popular? The pull factor of Blast's yield and star power\n\nA minimum of 4% yield on ETH and stablecoin deposits\n\nWith the current state of staking on L2s, some crypto natives may feel that the possible yield gained doesn't justify locking up one's digital assets on-chain for staking. As the newest Ethereum L2 on the block, Blast is seeking to offer more lucrative staking for ETH and stablecoin holders than its competitors. Since the baseline interest rate on existing L2s is 0%, assets on L2s are basically depreciating over time thanks to inflation. Armed with native yield, Blast offers a compelling alternative solution by providing at least 4% APY and more in Blast rewards.\n\nBlur-related FOMO\n\nAnother reason Blast has racked up so much TVL in such a short amount of time is perhaps due to the fear of missing out. As Blast is headed by Blur's founder, crypto natives are undoubtedly going to jump on Blast because of how successful Blur became in taking on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Speaking of reputable names, top venture capitalist firms like Paradigm and Standard Crypto have also joined the fray by raising $20 million for Blast. This has undoubtedly created a dilemma where users are tempted to deposit on Blast with the justification that big money is also doing it.\n\nHonesty in how Blast will operate\n\nFinally, Blast has been the talk of the town in the staking space because it has seemingly laid all its cards on the table when it comes to overall transparency. From clearly stating where the deposits will be staked to listing out when the Blast mainnet goes live and when rewards will be distributed, Blast's refreshing honesty is a contrast to what we sometimes see in shady DeFi projects that try to fool users through the door with high and unsustainable yields while minimizing overall communication.\n\nWhat are the risks of depositing on Blast?\n\nWhile some may welcome what Blast offers since staking on L2 typically provides 0% yield, some eagle-eyed commentators are saying otherwise by pointing out some red flags.\n\nThe safety of user deposits\n\nRight from the getgo, Blast displays some signs of security weakness. Its smart contracts are owned by a 3-of-5 Safe multisig wallet and the active signers of said wallet are funded by an account with ties to degenerate NFT trading activity. According to a thread posted by user harls.eth, the funds are linked to a wallet littered with questionable NFT buys. While some Blast users may brush this off, such ties don't exactly paint Blast in the best light. With the amount of cyberhacks happening in late 2023, all it takes is a smart contract bug to trigger a massive withdrawal of millions of deposits and cause heartbreak for thousands of users.\n\nThe Blast rewards framework\n\nA big reason crypto natives are going all out to secure a Blast invite is because of the additional yield gained by depositing their ETH and stablecoins. By promising yields above what typical risk-free rates offer, this definitely checks the boxes of yield hunters looking to maximize their DeFi gains.\n\nDigging deeper into Blast's current reward framework reveals other red flags worth mentioning. In its current early access state, deposits into Blast are one-way with no way of withdrawing until Blast's mainnet goes live. Additionally, Blast is promising rewards as a bonus for users who participate early. While it does sound lucrative, these rewards are points for an L2 solution that's yet to be released. This echoes the critique by Cinneamhain Ventures' Adam Cochran, who claims Blast is a platform with one-way deposits.\n\nLeaderboard and Spins system resembling a pyramid marketing scheme\n\nAdditionally, Blast has a Leaderboard and Spins mechanic that should inspire caution. Essentially, it's a recruitment system that encourages existing users to 'recruit' more users to sign up in hopes of forming a Squad of Blast users. By convincing invitees to deposit, users earn bonus luck, which contributes to their overall odds of gaining more Blast points when they play the Spins minigame. Each week, users will get a fixed amount of Spins, which is a card-flipping minigame that grants you extra points based on your luck.\n\nTo summarize these mechanics, the more ETH one's overall Squad is worth, the more invites one gets. With more deposits, users can increase their luck when interacting with Super Spins and reap more Blast points. This structure of getting more interested individuals to pile on later in order for the earliest Blast users to benefit has been criticized as a form of Ponzi scheme by some in the crypto community. At a minimum, traders should note that it might be tough for Blast to maintain its current TVL levels without rewarding users to keep them around.\n\nThe future of Blast L2: what can users look forward to?\n\nAlthough there isn't an official roadmap yet for the future of Blast besides dates relating to its mainnet launch and reward distribution, Roquerre's recent thread has declared that Blast is meant to complement the Blur ecosystem. It also aims to help its users avoid asset depreciation, reduce NFT transaction costs, and launch NFT perps. Blast's future ambitions would allow it to be beneficial to all DApps since an L2 with native yield opportunities like Blast will unlock possibilities for the entire on-chain economy. Roquerre then extends the benefits to Perps, DEXes, lending, NFTs, and SocialFi as potential benefactors.\n\nShould you deposit on Blast?\n\nAs every individual has their own levels of risk tolerance and trading plans to stick to, there's no hard-and-fast rule that you should or shouldn't consider depositing ETH and stablecoins on Blast. Ultimately, one should weigh both benefits and risks before coming to a personal decision.\n\nFor those won over by Roquerre and his ambitions, Blast succeeding as an L2 solution definitely doesn't seem to be far fetched as he might be able to replicate Blur's success with Blast. Those who do so could be rewarded with bonus Blast point yields and the ability to say they were one of the early access depositers.\n\nOn the flipside, Blast certainly does display its fair share of risks. From its aggressive recruitment structure to the sustainability of its future rewards, many doubters are claiming that Blast is getting ahead of itself by delivering a marketing narrative without launching an actual L2 product.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nCan Blast keep its explosive momentum going? That seems to be a question many crypto natives and critics are asking as Blast's TVL numbers beat the odds and increase by the millions each day. As hype and anticipation builds behind the L2's impending launch, it'll certainly be interesting to see how Blast plays out.\n\nOverall, the synergy between Blur and Blast will definitely be interesting as Blur has stated that it plans to test and deploy its L2 apps on Blast. Whether this'll result in a thriving ecosystem that takes the crypto world by storm is another story. As an Ethereum L2 optimistic rollup solution that offers native yield, Blast has hit the ground running in gaining adoption among diehard Blur fans and yield hunting crypto natives. Ultimately, only time will tell if they're able to stick the landing and establish themselves as one of the leaders in the L2 space.\n\nKeen to see how Blast's success impacts Blur prices?

        "title": "Ethereum: A Strategic Investment for Savvy Investors - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Since its official launch in 2015, Ethereum has evolved into the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, presenting a compelling investment opportunity for astute investors.\n\nEthereum, conceptualized by software developer Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and subsequently launched in 2015, stands as an open-source blockchain technology.\n\nIts native cryptographic token, Ether (ETH), forms the backbone of this innovative platform, allowing developers to create diverse applications leveraging blockchain technology on the Ethereum network.\n\nBeyond its association with cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s impact extends across various industries, including insurance, logistics, and healthcare, where its technology fosters widespread innovation.\n\nWhile Ethereum faced initial turbulence, with some investors witnessing a temporary collapse in its net value, strategic individuals capitalized on the downturn by making significant investments during that period.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to emphasize that such a bold move carries inherent risks.\n\nExperts consistently caution against investing more than one can afford to lose, given the volatile and speculative characteristics of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in the cryptocurrency space is undeniable, owing to its colossal size and popularity as the primary network for decentralized applications. Noteworthy applications include NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and Metaverse apps, positioning Ethereum as a pivotal player in shaping the digital landscape.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum is considered relatively safe, with analysts highlighting the ongoing efforts of Ethereum developers to continually enhance the blockchain\u2019s power and utility.\n\nInvestors keen on capitalizing on Ethereum\u2019s growing adoption have various avenues, with the direct acquisition of Ethereum presenting the highest risk but also the potential for substantial profit due to its extreme volatility.\n\nFor a more diversified approach, investors can explore options such as purchasing Ethereum stock.\n\nThis encompasses managed funds specifically designed to invest in Ethereum, as well as companies deeply involved in Ethereum technology.\n\nWhile Bitcoin maintains its lead in terms of the value of coins in circulation, Ethereum is a close second, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $331 billion and garnering support from influential figures like Mark Cuban.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum has proven to be a lucrative investment opportunity. Consider an investor who allocated $1,000 to Ethereum in August 2015; this prudent decision would now be valued at an astonishing $2.23 million, underscoring the substantial returns achievable through strategic investment in Ethereum over the past six years."

        "content": "\n\nEs ist durchaus nicht neu, dass B\u00f6rsen ihre Netzwerke starten. Denn der aktuelle Trend, auf Ethereum aufzubauen, macht die Einf\u00fchrung eines Tokens \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig, was strategisch gesehen eine regulatorische \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung im aktuellen Umfeld vermeidet. Demzufolge gehen wir davon aus, dass konforme B\u00f6rsen dieses Modell nachahmen und die Gelegenheit ergreifen werden, im kommenden Zyklus aus einer diversifizierten Einkommensquelle Kapital zu schlagen.\n\nAbbildung 4: Einsatz von neuen Anwendungen \u00fcber ETH-Skalierungsl\u00f6sungen hinweg\n\nverabschiedet. DVT ist ein Mechanismus, der die Verantwortlichkeiten f\u00fcr die Schl\u00fcsselverwaltung und das Signieren von Krypto-Transaktionen auf mehrere Parteien verteilt, um einzelne Fehlerpunkte zu reduzieren und die Ausfallsicherheit der Validatoren zu erh\u00f6hen. So wird LIDO, das fast ein Drittel der eingesetzten ETH ausmacht, k\u00fcnftig durch die Integration von DVT-Modulen in die Protokolle Obol und SSV ein vielf\u00e4ltigeres Profil von Knotenbetreibern einf\u00fchren und damit der Debatte \u00fcber den unerw\u00fcnschten Einfluss auf den Validierungsprozess und die Blockproduktion auf Ethereum den Boden entziehen.\n\nNeben der Diversifizierung der Knotenbetreiber sorgt diese Implementierung daneben f\u00fcr mehr Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit bei Validierungsausf\u00e4llen oder Zensurversuchen. Auf der anderen Seite stellen SSV- und Obol-Netzwerke neue technische Funktionen dar, so dass es unerl\u00e4sslich ist, im Hinblick auf alle unvorhergesehenen Schwachstellen, die sie einf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnten, wachsam zu bleiben.Abbildung 5: Dominanz der Entit\u00e4ten, die auf das Ethereum-Netzwerk setzen\n\nMit Verweis auf eine \u201epolitische Polarisierung\u201c und bestehende Haushaltsdefizite stellte die Ratingagentur Moody\u2019s der US-Wirtschaft eine negative Prognose aus und senkte ihr Kreditrating von stabil auf negativ. Die Renditen f\u00fcr 10- und 30-j\u00e4hrigen Staatsanleihen stiegen am Montag an, was sich auf die Portfolios der Anleger auswirkte und das Ausleihen von Geld f\u00fcr die Regierung verteuerte. F\u00fcr den Fall, dass die US-Regierung ihre Bundesschulden von aktuell \u00fcber 33,7 Billionen Dollar nicht einh\u00e4lt, k\u00f6nnte der Weg in eine Rezession f\u00fchren. Die aktuelle Hausse von Bitcoin unter diesen Bedingungen st\u00fctzt das Narrativ von Absicherung gegen Inflation \u2013 wenngleich sicher auch Spekulationen um einen potenziellen Spot-ETF in den USA dabei beteiligt sind.\n\nAbbildung 6: Rendite von 30-j\u00e4hrigen US-Staatsanleihen im Vergleich zu Bitcoin (YTD)\n\n\n\nQuelle: Yahoo Financesn\n\nNEAR: Partnerschaften f\u00fcr engere Zusammenarbeit mit Ethereum\n\nBei NEAR handelt es sich um eine Blockchain-Plattform, die eine skalierbare und entwicklerfreundliche Umgebung f\u00fcr dezentrale Anwendungen (DApps) anbietet. Der Entwickler, die NEAR Foundation, k\u00fcndigte nun eine Kooperation mit Polygon Labs an, um einen sogenannten \u201ezkWASM Prover\u201c, also ein Tool, das Zero-Knowledge-Proofs speziell im Kontext des Programmierstandards WebAssembly (WASM) erm\u00f6glicht zu entwickeln. WASM-basierten Netzwerke sollen k\u00fcnftig ihre Abrechnungen auf Ethereum validieren und dessen bew\u00e4hrte Sicherheitsgarantien nutzen k\u00f6nnen. WebAssembly stellt eine Alternative zur Ethereum Virtual Machine von Ethereum dar. Diese Zusammenarbeit ist f\u00fcr Entwickler:innen, die das Polygon CDK verwenden, von entscheidender Bedeutung, da sie die M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Erstellung anpassbarer Netzwerke \u00fcber die EVM-Beschr\u00e4nkungen von Ethereum hinaus erweitert. Sie erm\u00f6glicht die Nutzung von Technologien wie Sharding, die derzeit auf Ethereum nicht m\u00f6glich sind und bietet \u00fcber Polygons Shared Layer Zugang zur Liquidit\u00e4t von Ethereum. Diese Integration bietet einen strategischen Vorteil f\u00fcr Nicht-EVM-Entit\u00e4ten, da sie die Interkonnektivit\u00e4t zwischen inkompatiblen Blockchain-Systemen f\u00f6rdert. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat sie das Potenzial, die ZK-EVM-Nutzerbasis von Polygon zu erh\u00f6hen und die L\u00fccke zu Ethereum und Near-Netzwerken zu schlie\u00dfen. Abbildung 7: T\u00e4glich aktive Nutzer:innen von Near (wei\u00df) im Vergleich zu Polygon ZK-EVM (lila) und Ethereum (grau)\n\n\n\nQuelle: Artemis\n\nDie NEAR Foundation stellte zudem auch ihre neue Datenverf\u00fcgbarkeitsl\u00f6sung NEAR DA vor. Diese soll Ethereum-Skalierungsl\u00f6sungen ein kosteneffizientes Mittel zum Einstellen von Daten bieten. Herk\u00f6mmliche Blockchains vereinen alle wichtigen Funktionen wie Abrechnung, Konsens, Ausf\u00fchrung und Datenverf\u00fcgbarkeit, was Netzwerke mit zunehmender Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ineffizient macht. Der modulare Ansatz konzentriert sich stattdessen auf die Trennung einiger weniger intensiver Prozesse, wie z. B. das Einstellen von Daten auf Ethereum zum Nachweis ihrer G\u00fcltigkeit, um L2-Blockchains bei der Rationalisierung ihres Betriebs zu helfen.\n\nIm Fall von Near es deren Blogpost zufolge nun voraussichtlich 8000-mal billiger, einen Satz an \u201ecalldata\u201c, also Eingabedaten, die f\u00fcr eine Smart Contract-Transaktion ben\u00f6tigt werden, zu verwenden, als auf Ethereum. Near ist nun das zweite Protokoll, das einen solchen modularen Ansatz anbietet, nachdem das Krypto-Projekt Celestia Ende Oktober die Einf\u00fchrung des Mainnets angek\u00fcndigt hat. Dies ist eine wichtige Entwicklung, um das Ethereum-\u00d6kosystem weiter zu skalieren und von den monolithischen Architekturen, die komplexer und weniger flexibel sind, unabh\u00e4ngiger zu werden.\n\nRechtliche Hinweise:\n\nDas in diesem Beitrag enthaltene Material dient ausschlie\u00dflich Informationszwecken. 21.co und die verbundenen Unternehmen empfehlen keine Ma\u00dfnahmen auf der Grundlage dieser Informationen.

        "content": "Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform, predicts Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, can soar above $36,800 by the decade\u2019s end based on total addressable market projects.\n\nIn an in-depth analysis covering Ethereum on November 23, the analytics platform laid out several reasons that will drive the coin to astronomical levels, nearly 18X from spot levels.\n\nEthereum Is King, Predicted To Process $14 Trillion In Value By 2030\n\nThe Token Terminal report cited strengthening network effects, increasing token scarcity, and successful transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus as possible price drivers accelerating the rally towards $36,800. The first-mover advantage and network effects, among others, have given Ethereum a competitive advantage over rival smart contract platforms, including Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).\n\n\n\nUsers can deploy decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions in these competing networks, mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and overly participate in web3 development. Even so, Token Terminal observes that despite Ethereum\u2019s limited scalability and fluctuating gas fees, which tend to rise in trending markets and intense network activity, discouraging engagement, it stands to dominate in the years ahead.\n\nQuantifying future adoption, Token Terminal estimates that by 2030, approximately half of the finance industry\u2019s trillion-dollar revenue will likely be flowing through Ethereum. To put a figure to this, the blockchain analytics platform estimates that over $14 trillion in value will be settled on-chain, with Ethereum as the preferred network.\n\nThe finance industry generates over $28 trillion in annual revenue, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%.\n\nAs it is, this mega valuation expected to flow through Ethereum is more than 10X the total crypto market when writing on November 2023. According to CoinMarketCap, it is slightly over $1.4 trillion with Bitcoin commanding roughly 51%.\n\nMaking projections from this outlook, the blockchain analytics platform noted that the expected adoption via emerging verticals, including identity, content streaming, and even the Internet of Things, could see ETH soar year-over-year in the next seven years.\n\nPotential Challenges That Might Slow Adoption\n\nStill, the study notes that challenges in the future might slow down adoption, potentially stifling growth and prices. Top of the list is the risk associated with regulation. As crypto finds adoption, the research notes that governments might try to interfere to maintain order.\n\nAt the same time, there could be unforeseen changes to the network design tradeoffs, the success and subsequent dominance of layer-2s forcing venture capitals to prioritize funding for off-chain projects and note those deploying on the mainnet.\n\nAdditionally, Token Terminal said even a bug being discovered on-chain, leading to losses and, thus, a dent in confidence, cannot be discounted in the long-term.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
