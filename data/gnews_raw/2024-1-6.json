        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC 2.11%) soared by more than 150% last year, investors are now looking far and wide for cryptocurrencies that might be able to outperform Bitcoin in 2024. One intriguing candidate is Ethereum (ETH 1.19%), which is still the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency with a whopping $270 billion market cap.\n\nWhile Ethereum might not get the same hype as Bitcoin, it's certainly worth a closer look, especially if some of the catalysts expected to push Bitcoin higher fail to materialize. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nJust about everyone agrees that investor anticipation of a new spot Bitcoin ETF is the key factor pushing Bitcoin higher right now. The underlying logic makes sense: A new regulated financial product for investing in Bitcoin should attract money from both retail and institutional investors. If institutional investors with trillions of dollars of assets under management allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that could result in literally tens of billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin. That would almost certainly cause the price of Bitcoin to soar.\n\nBut there are several problems with that argument, says JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.05%). In a December research note to clients, JPMorgan Chase specifically pointed out that much of the hype around the Bitcoin ETF might be undeserved. For one, spot Bitcoin ETF products exist elsewhere in the world (in both Canada and Europe), and they have experienced relatively weak demand. What's to say that the U.S. market will be different?\n\nMoreover, there are other Bitcoin investment products to choose from right now. Popular choices include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 4.57%) and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO 4.38%). So instead of huge flows of new money into Bitcoin, we might just see a reshuffling of money out of existing Bitcoin investment products and into the new spot Bitcoin ETF. The net impact, in that case, would not be nearly as great as some are now predicting.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second major catalyst for Bitcoin is the approaching halving event. This event, which occurs only once every four years, is coming up in April, and it's likely to be one of the most talked-about developments in the crypto market this year. In three past halvings, the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen again. In fact, some are now predicting that Bitcoin could push through the $100,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut keep in mind that a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street think that much of the Bitcoin halving's impact might already be priced in. If you buy into the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all publicly available information is already factored into prices, then maybe the halving will be a non-event.\n\nAfter all, the entire market knows when the halving is going to take place. There are websites with clocks counting down the seconds. And the entire market has plenty of historical data to work with. Granted, the crypto market may not be as efficient as the equity market at pricing in information, but it's safe to say that every major Wall Street firm is aware of the implications of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe case for Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum may not have the same kinds of catalysts as Bitcoin, it is working on significant improvements to its overall blockchain architecture. Ethereum has not really delivered on everything it originally promised for The Merge, when it transitioned to a much more energy effective network. This year might be an opportunity to reassure investors that everything is still on track. If these improvements lead to lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and higher overall throughput, it could make Ethereum much more attractive to investors.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is more likely to benefit from increased development activity in crypto than Bitcoin. That's because Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, is active in just about every major niche of the blockchain and crypto world, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. During the long crypto winter that set in during 2022, many of these areas went into hibernation. But in a crypto spring, they could come back to life.\n\nAnd the better buy is...\n\nI've tried to make a compelling case for Ethereum, but if forced to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum, I'm still going with Bitcoin. Yes, the new spot Bitcoin ETF might be overhyped. And yes, the Bitcoin halving cycle might be underwhelming this time around. But with so much institutional investor support behind it now, Bitcoin is closer to going mainstream than at any time in its history. If there's just one crypto to buy in 2024, it's Bitcoin."

        "title": "How will Ethereum price react to Bitcoin ETF approval? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is moving closer to its Bitcoin (BTC) ETF decision deadline on Jan. 10, with the market hopeful about approval. This pivotal event could have wide-ranging implications on the crypto market, including the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum ETF hopes\n\nApproving a Bitcoin ETF could set a regulatory precedent to ease the path for other crypto-based ETFs. The reasoning is that a Bitcoin ETF approval would likely involve establishing a framework that could be applicable to other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nIn December 2023, the SEC delayed its decision on several pending Ethereum ETF applications in the U.S. to May 2024. This includes the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF, and the spot Ethereum ETF lodged by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nThese delays are part of the SEC's process, which involves gathering public input before deciding whether these ETFs should be listed. Nonetheless, they also appear amid the commission's attempt to categorize some proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum is not named as a security in any of the SEC's recent lawsuits targeting crypto exchanges. The commission has also not challenged Ethereum's classification through the ETF registration process with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days.\n\n\n\nNOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nThat raises the potential of seeing a spot Ethereum ETF approved in the U.S. by May 2024, a likely boost for ETH prices.\n\nEthereum-Bitcoin correlation\n\nProviding a Bitcoin ETF approval does not become a sell-the-news event, Ether's price is well-positioned for a rally because of its consistent correlation with BTC's price in recent years.\n\nETH/USD and BTC/USD's daily correlation coefficient chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFundamentally, it means a Bitcoin ETF approval may trigger a substantial increase in crypto exposure among traditional investors. In turn, that will likely lead to a surge in ETH price as the market anticipates increased demand.\n\nThe #Ethereum supply crisis on exchanges is worsening day by day.\n\n\n\nEvery day, supply is getting tighter, which indicates even stronger demand for #ETH.\n\n\n\nMassive gains ahead. pic.twitter.com/k0SQJAUDHW \u2014 Leon Waidmann | On-Chain Insights (@LeonWaidmann) January 6, 2024\n\nConversely, a delay or denial may result in short-term bearish pressure as the market adjusts to the setback. A recent Bitwise survey found that only 39% of U.S.-based financial advisers believe a Bitcoin ETF will be approved this year.\n\nEthereum price technicals hint at correction\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ETH's price is treading near the resistance trendline of its prevailing rising wedge pattern ahead of the Bitcoin ETF decision. A delay or denial could result in the price correction toward the wedge's lower trendline near $1,865 by February.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe $1,865 level coincides with ETH's 0.236 Fibonacci line and its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave).\n\nRelated: Key elements to watch on the Ethereum network roadmap\n\nOn the other hand, an ETF approval may have Ethereum invalidate its rising wedge setup altogether in favor an ascending triangle reversal pattern, as shown below.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe triangle's upside target is near $3,870 by March, up 75% from current price levels, and coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci line.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum on-chain data shows that the current exit queue has a wait time of 5 days and 4 hours.\n\nCelsius announced that it would be unstaking its existing ETH holdings in order to offset restructuring costs.\n\nThe collective value of ETH set to be removed from the Ethereum validator chain is over $1.09 billion.\n\nEthereum Shanghai update introduced the option to withdraw the ETH staked by investors, essentially giving validators the option to exit the market. Since then, Friday marked the biggest day for the network as it noted the highest count of validator exits in the queue, all thanks to Celsius\n\nEthereum validator backlog\n\nEthereum is witnessing a historical moment. For the first time since it activated the withdrawal of staked ETH, a mass exit event can be witnessed. At the time of writing, the chain had an exit queue of 15,358 validators, and the expected wait time is presently five days and 4 hours.\n\nThis means that any validator that attempts to exit now will have to wait for five days before they can get their 32 ETH back. Furthermore, based on the value of one validator staking being 32 ETH, the chain is set to note an outflow of $1.09 billion worth of staking over the next few days.\n\nEthereum validator exit queue\n\nHowever, despite being such a humungous figure, it will barely make a dent in the network or sway the price action. This is because, at the moment, Ethereum has over 905,000 validators, and the total amount staked on the network is 28.8 million ETH. This represents nearly 24% of the entire circulating supply of the digital asset.\n\nThe reason behind the backlog\n\nCelsius, a prominent name in the crypto space until its bankruptcy in July 2022, is in the process of restructuring the entire company. This includes asset distribution, for which Celsius has begun recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity.\n\nConsequentially, the company announced that it would be unstaking all its existing ETH holdings in order to offset the costs it has been facing throughout the restructuring process. It also addressed the backlog caused by this decision, stating that the process would take a few days given the enormous amount of ETH set to be unstacked."

        "content": "Ethereum, one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies within the digital assets realm, recently gained significant traction across the broader crypto market following a noteworthy transaction on Saturday. According to the on-chain data floating over the crypto horizon, Paradigm, an institutional liquidity network, dumped substantial amounts of ETH to Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s leading crypto exchanges.\n\nThe dumping of Ethereum to the aforementioned CEX soon nabbed noteworthy attention among crypto market enthusiasts globally as the transaction surfaced within the market amid the token\u2019s price drop. Intriguingly, Ethereum\u2019s price today traded briefly in the green, fueling market optimism. However, with the transaction emerging within the crypto landscape, the price promptly went downwards, curating a hurricane of speculations for the cryptocurrency.\n\nadvertisement\n\nParadigm\u2019s ETH Transfer To CEX: Report\n\nAccording to the data unveiled by Lookonchain, a platform streamlining on-chain metrics, Paradigm deposited 6,500 ETH, worth $14.67 million, to Coinbase today, January 6, 2024. Intriguingly, Paradigm accumulated these ETH at phenomenal price lows.\n\nMoreover, as per past market data, Paradigm seems to be mirroring smart money addresses, gathering colossal amounts of ETH amid bearish market sentiments and thereafter selling the same in bullish markets. Concerning this, even today\u2019s ETH deposit was accumulated at a price low when ETH was evaluated at less than $500. Now, as the price crosses $2,200, Paradigm appears to have sold the aforestated number of ETH to Coinbase, garnering notable profits.\n\nAlso Read: OpenAI & Microsoft Face Another Lawsuit Amid NYT Woes Over AI Training\n\nEthereum Price Dips\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price noted a marginal drop of 0.81% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,236. Moreover, this dip was further accompanied by a weekly drop of 2.83%, followed by a monthly fall of 1.66%.\n\nIntriguingly, today\u2019s price briefly traded in the green, amassing significant attention among crypto market traders and investors globally. However, it soon started moving downwards, aligning with Paradigm\u2019s massive selloff around the same time period.\n\nAlso Read: Solana (SOL) Price Falls Below $95 Amid Wider Crypto Sell-Off"

        "content": "Arbitrum, a prominent Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution, has been on a remarkable upward trajectory since the launch of its native token, ARB, in March 2023. The past 30 days witnessed a staggering 74% surge in ARB\u2019s value, underscoring the growing market interest in the protocol.\n\nNotably, Arbitrum\u2019s daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume has experienced a significant surge, propelling the protocol to surpass Ethereum (ETH) for the first time in this key metric.\n\nThis milestone highlights Arbitrum\u2019s increasing adoption and recognition for its scalability within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum Sets New DEX Records\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Arbitrum\u2019s daily DEX volume reached an impressive $1.834 billion over the past 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s volume of $1.444 billion. Analyzing DefiLlama\u2019s data, it becomes evident that Arbitrum\u2019s growth extends beyond daily DEX volume alone.\n\nThe weekly change in ARB\u2019s value soared by 32.58%, showcasing the token\u2019s strong performance in the market. Moreover, Arbitrum\u2019s seven-day volume reached an impressive $6.804 billion, indicating robust trading activity on the protocol.\n\nIn terms of total value locked (TVL) in DEX, Arbitrum accounted for $1.297 billion, constituting 33.40% of the total TVL. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s TVL stood at $5.92 billion, making up 26.29% of the total. This demonstrates Arbitrum\u2019s growing prominence as users increasingly recognize its potential for efficient and secure decentralized trading.\n\nARB\u2019s Financial Metrics Soar\n\nFurther demonstrating the growth of the protocol\u2019s ecosystem, token terminal data shows that Arbitrum\u2019s market capitalization (in circulation) has increased by an impressive 83.84% to $2.56 billion.\n\nThe revenue generated by Arbitrum over the past 30 days has also experienced remarkable growth, with a 79.82% increase to reach $11.66 million.\n\nFurthermore, looking at the fully diluted market capitalization, Arbitrum has witnessed an identical 83.84% rise to reach $20.07 billion.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s revenue on an annualized basis has seen a significant boost, surging by 101.67% to reach $141.81 million. This figure represents the projected revenue for a full year based on the current monthly revenue, underscoring the protocol\u2019s sustained growth.\n\nIn terms of fees generated, Arbitrum\u2019s 30-day figures have surged by 79.82% to reach $11.66 million, demonstrating the protocol\u2019s ability to capture a significant share of transactional fees within its ecosystem.\n\nOn an annualized basis, fees have soared by 101.67% to reach $141.81 million, further validating the protocol\u2019s revenue growth and economic potential.\n\nNevertheless, the protocol\u2019s native token, ARB, is trading at $1.8962, down over 8% in the past 24 hours and below its all-time high (ATH) of $2.11 set on Thursday. Despite this pullback, it is still up 36% over the past 14 days, demonstrating the token\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

While ETH saw an increase of about 90%, SOL surged by nearly 1000%, and AVAX rose by over 200%.\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s growing speculation that 2024 could be a pivotal year for Ethereum, possibly pushing its boundaries further.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nCredible Crypto, a respected figure in cryptocurrency analysis and trading, recently shared ambitious predictions for Ethereum in 2024. Through the digital platform X, he conveyed his belief that ETH could reach a minimum of $10,000 this year. This projection would signify a substantial 343% rise from its current value.\n\nAdditionally, he presented a maximum target of $20,000 for ETH in 2024, indicating a potential growth of 786%. Examining recent trends, Credible Crypto pointed to a price bottom near $2,100 for ETH. He expects a possible rise to $2,160 before targeting a breakthrough above the $2,400 resistance level. This positive perspective aligns with data from the blockchain analytics firm, santiment santiment On-Chain , which suggests an increased accumulation of Ethereum by major holders.\n\nWhat are the Ethereum Whales Up To?\n\nSantiment\u2019s data indicates that the top 150 self-custody wallets now hold a record 56.25 million ETH. In contrast, the amount held in exchange wallets is at its lowest since June 2018, standing at 9.46 million ETH. When combined, these top 150 holders collectively own 65.71 million ETH, marking a new high in their holdings. As of the latest update, Ethereum is valued at $2,255.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2024: Can Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Roadmap Lead ETH to $5000?\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Potential Growth\n\nEthereum\u2019s potential ascent to $10,000 in 2024 is based on several factors. Firstly, there\u2019s anticipation of a positive market reaction if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin undergoes its halving event. Such developments could trigger a market momentum similar to the one observed in 2021. If Bitcoin achieves a new peak, it\u2019s likely that Ethereum will follow a similar path.\n\nAdditionally, the potential approval of an ETH ETF, with interest from significant entities like BlackRock and the SEC\u2019s acknowledgement of Ethereum\u2019s commodity status, may facilitate a more favorable environment for Ethereum, potentially aiding its upward trajectory."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s robust development continued with confirmed testnet upgrades.\n\nETF developments and changing options market sentiment added more layers to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nDespite recent market volatility, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] development activity remained robust, as highlighted in the latest Ethereum developers\u2019 call, ACDE#178.\n\nThe testnet upgrade timelines for Dencun were confirmed, with Goerli on 17th January, Sepolia on 30th January, and Holesky on 7th February.\n\nConcerns were raised about the tight schedule and the 13-day gap between Goerli and Sepolia, prompting further discussions.\n\nWhat next\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum community is gearing up for the Prague/Electra (Pectra) upgrade, with debates centered on prioritizing Verkle as the sole focus or concurrently increasing work on Verkle while shipping a smaller feature fork.\n\nThe final decision will hinge on community consensus and ongoing discussions in future meetings.\n\nACDE#178 just wrapped up (hello 2024!): we confirmed the testnet upgrade timelines for Dencun, appetite for Verkle as the next L1 prio, and had an open floor for other proposals for the Prague upgrade. Agenda: https://t.co/iHrS7vkmhH\n\nStream: https://t.co/oZPtQ5pO5W Recap below: https://t.co/Q8ZXH6Uhbq \u2014 \u064b (@lightclients) January 4, 2024\n\nThe potential impact of these developments on Ethereum is significant, indicating a commitment to ongoing improvement and innovation within the network. The upcoming upgrades are poised to enhance Ethereum\u2019s capabilities and overall functionality.\n\nMoreover, these upgrades could have an impact on price movement. Due to this, there is some volatility to be expected from ETH down the road.\n\nThe ETF hype continues\n\nAnother aspect that could add to the volatility would be Ethereum-based ETFs.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that the SEC\u2019s approval of the Ethereum futures ETF last year hinted at accepting ETH as a commodity, potentially paving the way for an ETH spot ETF launch in 2024.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s final decision on VanEck, ARK 21Shares, and Hashdex Ethereum Spot ETFs is expected in May 2024, introducing new dynamics to Ethereum\u2019s market.\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days. NOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nTrading behaviors\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for ETH fell from 0.37 to 0.35, indicating shifting sentiments in the options market. This change suggests an optimistic view among investors, showing that most traders haven\u2019t been affected by the prospects of increased volatility in the future.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,361.39, reflecting a -1.21% decline in the last 24 hours.\n\nDespite short-term fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects appear positive, driven by ongoing development efforts, potential ETF developments, and evolving market dynamics."

        "content": "For over a month, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum(ETH) has been trading sideways resonating between two horizontal levels of $2140 and $2400. Despite a heavy sell-off on January 4th, the ETH price showcased its sustainability above the $2140 support which is above the safety net of 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. The combined support could offer buyers an opportunity to revive the exhausted bullish momentum and extend the recovery trend.\n\nWill Market Correction Push Ethereum Price Below $2000\n\nA bullish breakout from $2400 will release the buildup of bullish momentum\n\nA confluence of several technical levels creates strong support at $2140\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 45% gain.\n\nAmid the increasing uncertainty in the crypto market, the Ethereum price witnessed another reversal from the $2400 resistance. In the last five days, the coin price plunged 7.5% to currently trade at $2247.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe buyers are obtaining suitable support at the combined support of $2140 and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Such a degree of correction indicates the buyers continue to have an upper hand over this asset which may result in a stronger bounce back.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is showing signs of moving closer to the approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. This progress is marked by the submission of amended 19b-4 filings by exchanges that are expected to list these ETFs.\n\nWith a high possibility of spot Bitcoin approval next week, the newcomers can look for bullish reversal opportunities at $2140 support. A potential bounce back from this support could push the coin price 7% to challenge $2400, whose breakout will better confirm an uptrend continuation.\n\nThe post-breakout rally could surge the ETH price to $2675 and higher.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nSource: Coingape| Bitcoin Vs Ethereum Price\n\nIn recent market trends, Bitcoin and Ethereum have both shown a pattern of gradual recovery with higher highs and lows. However, the ETH price has somewhat underperformed, evidenced by the formation of a new lower high in its price trajectory. The anticipated approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to provide a significant boost to Bitcoin\u2019s market sentiment, potentially increasing its appeal to a broader range of investors and strengthening its market position.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The 20-and-50-day EMA continues to act as dynamic support to ETH price\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover state MACD (blue) and signal(orange) reflect a correction mode that is active\n\nRelated Article:"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto trader says one Ethereum (ETH) rival that performed extremely well last year is on the verge of another massive rally.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 235,200 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) could increase nearly 47% from its current value.\n\n\u201cSOL gearing up for the run to new highs. One does not simply fade a 35% liquidation dump in the strongest uptrend of all the top 10 coins in a bull run.\u201d\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while the correction happens in a three-wave pattern.\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests Solana is in the process of printing a five-wave pattern to the upside that will cause SOL to cross the $145 level.\n\nSolana is trading for $98.70 at time of writing, down nearly 7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that the newer layer-1 blockchain project Sei Network (SEI) could soon hit the $1 level after completing a three-wave correction.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s starting to go parabolic, all dips are constantly three-wave moves down with no signs of slowing down yet. $1 feels programmed at this point.\u201d\n\nSEI is trading for $0.72 at time of writing, down nearly 8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes a breakout is incoming for Lido DAO (LDO), a crypto project that aims to allow users to stake Ethereum without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure. He also says LDO is making gains against Bitcoin (LDO/BTC).\n\n\u201cI have a love/hate relationship with LDO but I think it\u2019s finally going for the price discovery breakout. There\u2019s also weekly bullish divergence on the BTC pair.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he suggests that LDO is about to take out the key resistance level at $3.17, and its value against Bitcoin could soon soar to 0.000140 BTC ($6.16).\n\nLDO/BTC is trading for 0.00007549 BTC ($3.32) at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The total time taken to fully exit and receive staked ETH surged over 13.5 days.\n\nThe backlog was likely created by Celsius Network.\n\nWaiting time for Ethereum [ETH] validators to withdraw their staked ETH shot up dramatically in the last 24 hours, reaching levels not seen since the option was made available following the Shapella Upgrade last year.\n\nUnstaking queue gets crowded\n\nAs of this writing, a validator would have to wait for nearly five days to exit the network and become eligible for withdrawals, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of validatorqueue.com dashboard revealed.\n\nThe waiting time surged due to an exponential jump in validators in the exit queue. Indeed, the backlog increased to over 16,766 on the 5th of January, compared to just 26 a day before.\n\nMoreover, the total time taken to fully exit and receive the staked amount was more than 13.5 days, AMBCrypto discovered using data from rated.network.\n\nAs per the withdrawal mechanism, validators need to raise an exit request manually to be eligible for full withdrawals i.e, getting both initial deposits plus profits.\n\nHowever, upon completion of the process, they lose the right to validate transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCelsius slows down ETH unstaking operations\n\nApparently, the backlog was created as a result of bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network\u2019s plans of going ahead with its unstaking plans.\n\nThe company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2022, said that it was rebalancing assets. This was to ensure Celsius had sufficient liquidity under the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nAMBCrypto noticed using Nansen data that about 31.5% of all the ETH waiting for withdrawal was initiated by Celsius. Moreover, the 53.8% share by Figment was also linked to Celsius, as per popular on-chain researcher Tom Wan.\n\nOverall, the amount of staked ETH was 29.19 million as of this writing, with as many as 910,225 active validators.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nSigns of FUD?\n\nTypically, such large-scale unlockings are taken with a pinch of salt by market participants. Well, this was because of the belief that they would be sold off.\n\nPerhaps the anxiety played into the minds of weak hands as ETH slipped 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. But it remained to be seen if the FUD gets bigger in the days to come."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) transaction fees surged in 2023 and continue at higher levels. Facing expensive transaction costs, people started seeking more efficient cryptocurrencies to use as payment, like Litecoin (LTC).\n\nIn this context, monthly payment data by one of the largest cryptocurrency payment services, BitPay, evidences this phenomenon.\n\nNotably, the platform\u2019s users favored Litecoin by 38.25% in December, surpassing Bitcoin (23.24%) and Ethereum (10.45%). This trend started in November 2023 when LTC dominated 34.52% of BitPay payments, against 30.55% using BTC.\n\nPayment count by cryptocurrency. Source: BitPay\n\nAdditionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) got fourth place with 7.38% of BitPay users\u2019 transactions in December 2023. Followed closely by Bitcoin Cash (BCH), with 6.18%; Polygon (MATIC), with 5.09%; and Circle USD (USDC), with 2.07%.\n\nBitPay relevancy on cryptocurrency payments\n\n\u201cBitPay is the leading crypto payment processor in the world.\u201d \u2014 BitPay\n\nBitPay\u2019s relevancy is notable, with reportedly 390,401 crypto transactions processed over the last six months. In December, the platform processed 51,896 payments with cryptocurrencies, of which 19,850 used Litecoin.\n\n6-month and 30-day crypto transactions processed.

This amount accrues for 25.28% of LTC\u2019s market cap, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin had $15.88 billion sent in 418,600 transactions, for 1.86% of its capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s volume was lower than $3 billion, representing less than 1% of its market cap. Nevertheless, the number of transactions on the Ethereum network surpassed the 1 million daily mark.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin transactions data. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nIn closing, Litecoin started earning protagonism in the realm of cryptocurrency payments. This is mostly due to Bitcoin\u2019s inefficiencies as a medium of exchange, with users migrating to more efficient alternatives."

        "content": "ETH stored off exchanges outweighted the custodial coins.\n\nA 50% rally may open if exchange inflow reduces and volatility remains high.\n\nThe number of large addresses holding Ethereum [ETH] held on non-exchange wallets tapped a new All-Time High (ATH), AMBCrypto noted.\n\nIn the same vein, the top 150 exchange wallets have been decreasing. On-chain data from Santiment also showed that the exchange wallets could be on the verge of hitting the lowest point since June 2018.\n\nAt press time, the supply held by the top non-exchange addresses was 43.41 million. This increase is a sign that many market participants are buying ETH at a fast rate.\n\nAlso, keeping the altcoin in self-custody and shredding the number held on exchanges means that the intent to sell was almost non-existent.\n\nSellers need to take a break\n\nThis was evident in Ethereum\u2019s price action. As of this writing, ETH changed hands at$2,261, due to the drawback experienced on the 3rd of January. But with rising accumulation, the coin might be on its way to retest the $2,444 resistance.\n\nIf ETH hits and breaks the resistance, there is a high chance that the price will cross the $2,500 mark. In the long term, many predictions agree that the altcoin price would melt faces.\n\nBut the projected rally might not happen in the short term. This was because of the exchange inflow and outflow. At the time of writing, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow was 36,000. On the other hand, the exchange outflow was 25,000.\n\nAMBCrypto uncovered that the recent selling pressure Ethereum faced was the reason the inflow outpaced the outflows. If ETH is starting to eye $2,500, then the selling pressure must decrease.\n\nETH is volatile but promising\n\nLike the exchange flow, the Ethereum seven-day Realized Volatility showed that buying the coin for the short term could be risky. Realized Volatility shows the standard deviation of returns from the mean return of a market.\n\nWhen the value is low the Realized Volatility indicate a phase of low risk in that market. As a measure of the log returns over a certain window, the metric reading at 58.18% indicated that price fluctuations might be extreme for now.\n\nSo, traders targeting short-term gains may need to halt opening long or short contracts for now. If they do, they could end up biting their fingers in regret.\n\nHowever, the mid to long term looks promising for the Ethereum clan. This was confirmed by the state of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as shown by the daily chart.\n\nAs of this writing, the 50 EMA (blue) had crossed over the 200 EMA (yellow). This position is considered bullish for those planning on HODLing ETH. Should the position remain the same, then ETH may jump 50% in a few months while crossing the $3,000 mark.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAnother indicator considered is the Supertrend. At press time, the Supertrend indicator was below ETH\u2019s price. This confirms the bearish trend initially mentioned.\n\nBut as highlighted earlier, the trend is not a sign for traders to open short positions, irrespective of the RSI\u2019s decrease."

According to Whale Alert, crypto whales have suddenly shifted $780 million worth of virtual currencies, nearly $500 million of which was Bitcoin to new wallets.\n\nWhale Alert data says that the BTC transactions include the following transfers:\n\nSource: U.Today\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whales Celebrate New Year With 4.2M Transfer\n\nThe reasons behind the latest whale moves are unknown, as the entire crypto global market cap is down today. The crypto whales are possibly just transferring around assets, or perhaps holding on for a potential spike in the overall market. With SEC approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs possibly coming next week, the entire crypto market may see a significant uptick. Hence, this may just be a preparatory move for these crypto wallets.\n\nOther significant values in the latest whale transaction outside of Bitcoin include over $150,000,000 in Ethereum. Nearly $100 Million worth of Dogecoin was also moved to unknown wallets, and $30 millions XRP was transferred to other exchanges, according to the whale tracker."

        "content": "Arbitrum Surpasses Ethereum Mainnet in Milestone Achievement Jan 6, 2024\n\nArbitrum Surpasses Ethereum Mainnet in Milestone Achievement\n\nIn a noteworthy development highlighting the escalating adoption of Ethereum layer 2 blockchains, Arbitrum, the largest in terms of market capitalization, has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing the Ethereum mainnet. This milestone was marked by Arbitrum\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume exceeding that of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, a first for Arbitrum or any layer 2 blockchain. According to DefiLlama data, Arbitrum\u2019s DEX volume reached $1.8 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s by nearly $400 million.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Impressive Growth and Achievements:\n\nArbitrum\u2019s recent success is part of a broader surge in the blockchain\u2019s performance. In the past week, Arbitrum achieved three all-time highs in total value locked (TVL), DEX volume, and the spot price of its native token, ARB. TVL, indicating the investments locked in a blockchain or DeFi protocol, surged, making Arbitrum the leader in net inflow of investor funds among all layer 2 blockchains, securing $365 million in the last seven days. Ethereum still leads in this metric with $705 million, as reported by DefiLlama.\n\nChallenges Faced by Arbitrum:\n\nDespite these accomplishments, Arbitrum has faced challenges, including several outages. The most recent occurred in December and was attributed to issues with the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer, a component used to verify, organize, and transfer transaction bundles to the Ethereum mainnet for finality. It\u2019s noteworthy that similar problems were faced by ZkSync, another Ethereum layer 2, around Christmas.\n\nLayer 2 Growth Across Ethereum Ecosystem:\n\nBeyond Arbitrum\u2019s gains, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s have witnessed substantial growth. With a combined TVL of $20.7 billion, these layer 2 networks surpass the TVL of all other layer 1 networks, excluding Ethereum, which stands at $19.7 billion. However, it\u2019s essential to note a discrepancy in TVL valuation sources, as L2Beat includes the market value of native tokens in layer 2 figures, whereas DefiLlama considers only the value of investments in layer 1 blockchains\u2019 decentralized finance markets.\n\nPositive Impacts on Ethereum Mainnet:\n\nWhile some layer 2s show signs of challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance, these developments are not necessarily detrimental to the mainnet. On the contrary, they contribute positively to Ethereum\u2019s economic outcomes. Increased validator earnings result from layer 2 networks paying fees when rolling up bundled transactions to the Ethereum mainnet for finality. This process contributes to the deflationary mechanisms for Ether token supply, aligning with Ethereum\u2019s overall strategy for reducing net Ether token inflation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nArbitrum\u2019s achievement in surpassing Ethereum\u2019s mainnet in trading volume showcases the growing prominence of layer 2 blockchains. Despite challenges, the successes of layer 2 networks contribute positively to Ethereum\u2019s economic landscape, reinforcing its position as a leader in the blockchain industry."

        "title": "Ethereum Giga Whales On A Historic Buying Spree \u2013 Here\u2019s How Much ETH They\u2019ve Bought - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree for a while now, which is an indication of their sustained support for the king of altcoins. These whale buys have particularly increased in the past few weeks. On-chain data from Santiment reveals Ethereum\u2019s largest private wallets now hold an all-time high of 56.25 million ETH, representing 46.8% of the crypto\u2019s total circulating supply.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulate Record Amounts Of ETH\n\nEthereum is currently trading in a range, as price action shows the crypto trading between the higher end of $2,434 and the lower end of $2,127 in the past 30 days. However, the crypto is now showing signs of recovery after a recent price recovery and is now building strong momentum above $2,200.\n\nAmidst the price theatrics, Ethereum whales have been buying more ETH into their wallets to push the total count to new highs upon new highs. At the same time, these whales have been withdrawing from exchanges, causing ETH on exchange-owned addresses to drop to their lowest levels in over five years.\n\nAccording to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, a record 65.71 million ETH, representing 54.67% of the total circulating supply is now held by top addresses. Out of this figure, 56.25 million ETH belong to the top 150 self-custodial wallets. Consequently, the top 150 exchange-linked wallets now hold 9.46 million ETH, nearing its lowest level since June 2018.\n\nIncreasing Whale Accumulation: Possible Explanation\n\nThe crypto industry went through a strong price surge in the last quarter of 2023, flipping the optimism around most cryptocurrencies bullish. Continued whale acquisitions can be linked to an anticipated continuation of the price growth in 2024, with the imminent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in the US lurking in the background.\n\nETH market cap currently at $268 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe accumulation from Ethereum\u2019s largest whales is a good sign for the long-term price, as it signals they believe the price will continue to increase. Their buying power also helps to establish price support by reducing the supply of ETH for sale.\n\nSpotonchain recently showed that an Ethereum whale, identified as \u20180x931\u2019, bought 21,192 ETH worth approximately $48 million at an average price of $2,265. The recent purchase now puts the whale\u2019s total buys at 79,500 ETH since January 2023 and is now sitting on $36.84 million unrealized profit.\n\nAt the same time, liquid staking protocols witnessed steady deposits throughout 2023. Data from DeFiLlama shows that 12.3m ETH ($27.585 billion) are currently locked in ETH liquid staking derivatives. This represents an 80% growth from 6.8 million ETH locked in January 2023.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin ended 2023 on a thoughtful note after he shared his vision for the network. Acknowledging how certain challenges were limiting Etherum\u2019s growth, he proposed an upgrade that could eliminate design weaknesses, lower gas fees, and make staking more profitable for node validators.\n\nThe announcement boosted Ethereum\u2019s performance, and some traders have predicted that ETH could even rise by 141% in the coming months.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is another token that finished 2023 with a record presale. InQubeta is a platform where startups can find investors to back their artificial intelligence-based projects. It sports cutting-edge features and a security framework that complies with international standards.\n\nShortly after its launch, it made its way to analysts\u2019 best cryptocurrency ICO lists with its presale growth. Its ICO has so far raised $7.9 million.\n\nInQubeta: Empowering an ecosystem of AI startups\n\nInQubeta enables people to safely invest in startups and shape the future of AI innovation. It has a simple investment model that takes care of all stakeholders\u2019 requirements.\n\nUsing Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, InQubeta provides a transparent NFT marketplace that allows fractional investment. By purchasing a fraction of the NFT, a user can invest in a part of a startup\u2019s project. All transactions, including the sale of NFTs and deduction of taxes, are conducted in terms of InQubeta\u2019s native cryptocurrency, the QUBE token.\n\nThe total supply of QUBE is fixed at 1.5 billion, and the QUBE token is built on the ERC-20 standard.\n\nMore than half of the supply has been allocated for public sale, while the rest goes towards operations. The remaining stock of tokens is used for paying legal advisors, and developers, funding marketing campaigns, injecting liquidity into the network, and paying staking rewards.\n\nThe QUBE token has a deflationary character that\u2019s handy for countering the impact of inflation. The model reduces supply whenever inflation is high. As demand exceeds the supply, the price remains stable. If the supply surges when markets are volatile, the supply is pruned by destroying excess tokens in circulation.\n\nInQubeta leverages a decentralized governance structure for decision-making. The model favors a community-driven approach where all stakeholders participate in decisions. If anyone has a suggestion on how to improve the InQubeta protocol, they can run it by the community. The suggestions are discussed and then put to a vote.\n\nAs token holders have voting rights, they participate in the process to decide if the suggestions should be implemented.\n\nStartups and investors can communicate through InQubeta\u2019s NFT portal. The marketplace facilitates fractional investment in startup projects. The NFTs are based on the offers created by companies for investors. They stand for the rewards that an investor can gain by backing a startup\u2019s project.\n\nFunding aside, these startups can bank on InQubeta to guide them in areas like business development, legal support, and mentorship. InQubeta ropes in experts in various fields to assist startups in expanding operations.\n\nInnovators can connect AI experts and investors to gain insights about the sector. They could seek legal and accounting support to avoid financial challenges during their growth journeys.\n\nThe team has mapped several initiatives for 2024 to ramp up the platform. These include rolling out a staking dApp, getting the QUBE token listed on exchanges, and adding multi-chain capabilities to the network.\n\nAccording to analysts, InQubeta is among the altcoins to watch out for, and its presale success is just a peek into its future potential.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposes new Ethereum vision to tackle design weakness\n\nEthereum is a full-scale ecosystem that can be leveraged for deploying dApps, crypto tokens, NFTs, blockchains, and other decentralized infrastructure. Due to Ethereum\u2019s versatility and flexibility, it can be used in combination with other leading technologies like zero-knowledge solutions.\n\nIts native token, ETH, is used for all transactions on the network. These transactions are confirmed through the proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\n\nEthereum is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2024 as it can open multiple new avenues for developers. Its co-founder Vitalik Buterin is known for his keen insight into the blockchain industry. He recently hinted at a new vision for Ethereum, which fixes its design weaknesses.\n\nTraders have forecasted a record 141% upside for ETH as it has come up with many new interesting updates and remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies preferred by many users across the world.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnalysts often recommend Ethereum and InQubeta, as these tokens can end all your concerns about deciding what cryptos to buy now. These two tokens can be added to diversify portfolios and potentially register huge gains in the long term.\n\nEthereum is a developer-friendly blockchain technology, and InQubeta is a user-friendly platform for AI startups. Together they prove that cryptocurrencies are not a convoluted affair. Instead, they are quite straightforward assets that promote financial independence.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands for $2,251.76, up 0.81% in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth has been mixed with many uncertainties as it has exhibited a stronger-than-expected correlation with Bitcoin in recent times. Rebounding to its current level from a 24-hour low of $2,219.78, Ethereum\u2019s short-term growth trend has trailed that of Bitcoin but the revived interest from its whales can change the narrative moving forward.\n\nOther crucial on-chain metrics include the Daily Active Addresses which, according to the crypto analytics platform, IntoTheBlock (ITB) is up by 2.21% to 480,990. The ITB data also confirmed the Ethereum (ETH) whales transaction which has seen a 15.83% jump in the past 24 hours with over $4.79 billion traded.\n\nEthereum Getting Interesting Updates\n\nWhile the Ethereum (ETH) whales outlook shows interesting trends ahead owing to the shrinking supply by these accumulations, Ethereum is also getting a series of other fundamentals that can ultimately help bolster the network moving forward.\n\nAs reported earlier, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at one of the latest focuses that the Layer-2 scaling solutions resident on the blockchain should focus on. This focus should be hinged on developing Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for these L2s in the hope of bolstering further adoption and ease of use.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is also anticipating a spot ETF product that might see the light of day if spot Bitcoin ETF is approved as currently widely speculated."

        "title": "What Is NEO and How Is It Used? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is NEO?\n\nNEO is a blockchain developed to fully digitize assets and identities through smart contracts, which will facilitate the emerging smart economy. In the theory behind a smart economy, digital assets and digital identities are seen as being essential to improving the quality of life for everyone.\n\n\n\nNEO aims to automate digital asset management through smart contracts, with the eventual goal of building a distributed, network-based, smart economy system using decentralized applications.\n\nKey Takeaways NEO is a blockchain ecosystem designed to be used to build a smart economy.\n\nNEO has two native tokens. NEO is used to establish ownership and management roles in the blockchain, and NEO Gas is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nNEO defines a smart economy as one that uses smart contracts to manage and secure digital identities and assets.\n\nUnderstanding NEO\n\nNEO was founded as AntShares by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang in 2014. It was rebranded to NEO in June 2017. It is a blockchain-based platform that supports two native tokens, NEO and NEO Gas. The NEO project's blockchain is designed to digitize identities and assets and use smart contracts to track and transfer ownership\u2014a smart economy.\n\nNEO originally described its smart economy system as:\n\nDigital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy.\n\nDigital Assets\n\nDigital assets are not only digital property but are also physical assets tokenized by transferring their value to the blockchain and having it issue a token for each asset. Tokenization creates a decentralized, trustworthy, traceable, and transparent manner for asset management, free of intermediaries and their associated costs.\n\nUsers can record, buy, sell, exchange, or circulate various assets. NEO developers believe this digitization supports asset protection because they are registered on its platform, giving them a validated digital identity.\n\nDigital Identity\n\nDigital identity enables verifiable key information about participating individuals, organizations, and other entities that exist in the digital context. The developers believe that securing individual information through blockchain, consensus mechanisms, and encryption methods is essential as life becomes more and more digital.\n\nNEO and NEO Gas are not minable cryptocurrencies. There will only be 100 million NEO\u201450 million of which went to fund-raising supporters, and the remaining 50 million are for developers, cross investments, and contingencies. NEO Gas is awarded for blockchain work and transaction fees. However, you can purchase NEO on exchanges.\n\nNEO uses the Public Key Infrastructure standard (X.509) as a guide for managing identities by creating encrypted private and public keys used to verify identities. Digital identities can be verified using facial recognition, fingerprints, voice, SMS, and multi-factor identification methods.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are code that automatically execute transactions and agreements between different parties. Smart contracts remove the requirement for third-party involvement because transfers are automatically completed. They also allow traceability, transparency, and transaction irreversibility.\n\nHow Is Neo Different From Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nNEO maintains a clear distinction from other standard blockchain platforms in its focus on being regulatory-compliant and a development platform for decentralized applications. It also uses a different consensus mechanism than Bitcoin and Ethereum, called delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT).\n\nDelegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance\n\nRather than use a system like proof-of-work where random numbers are generated in a competitive bid to open a new block on the blockchain, Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBZT) designates nodes in consensus rounds using a \"staking\" method similar to proof-of-stake to achieve a majority agreement of more than two-thirds.\n\nTo address the issue of non-reliable validators (the Byzantine General Problem), consensus nodes with NEO Gas staked are randomly chosen for consensus rounds to validate transactions and open new blocks.\n\nThe NEO dBFT is reportedly capable of achieving 1,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Bitcoin's much slower three to seven TPS.\n\nEthereum\n\nWhile digitized assets and smart contracts are popular on the Ethereum blockchain, the third key feature of what it calls \u201cdigital identity\u201d separates NEO from the rest. Every participant operating on the NEO platform must have a unique digital identity that can be verified\u2014which means that you must enter information unique to you to receive a public key, somewhat reducing the anonymity provided by other blockchains.\n\nEthereum is designed to be scaled for any application a person can think of, be it new currencies, non-fungible tokens, decentralized apps, or something as of yet uninvented. NEO claims to be focused on facilitating a smart economy.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created to be a decentralized digital currency and uses proof-of-work in its consensus mechanism. It has one cryptocurrency that is used as a reward for mining\u2014the process of validating transactions and opening new blocks on the chain. The NEO network is less dependent on processing power for validation, so transaction costs and times are much lower.\n\n\n\nIs NEO a Good Crypto? Whether NEO is a good crypto depends on your risk tolerance, cryptocurrency outlook, and what you intend to use it for. It might increase in value, or it might not. NEO is designed to track and transfer asset ownership but also has a market value.\n\nHow Many NEO Coins Are Left? There were 50 million coins issued to project backers, and 15 million are held for contingencies. In addition, there are 20 million being used to incentivize developers and 15 million for cross-investing in other projects. No other coins will be issued, but NEO is available on some exchanges.\n\nWhat Is NEO in Crypto? NEO is a cryptocurrency used to incentivize the development of the NEO smart economy blockchain.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNEO is a blockchain designed to create a smart economy by digitizing assets and identities and introducing interoperability\u2014the ability for different blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum: How Celsius\u2019 latest move might impact your ETH holdings - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Celsius has decided to unstake its ETH holdings to repay its creditors.\n\nThe last week has seen a decline in demand for ETH.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network [CEL] announced plans to unstake its Ether [ETH] holdings as a part of its ongoing restructuring process.\n\nIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nThe beleaguered crypto lender, which has been in bankruptcy court since it made its Chapter 11 filing in July 2022, noted that it has initiated a process of recalling and rebalancing assets to guarantee that it has sufficient liquidity to offset its liabilities under the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nCelsius added that the unlocking event is expected to take place within the next few days. It further said that eligible creditors will receive in-kind distributions of Bitcoin [BTC] and ETH as per the approved restructuring plan.\n\nEthereum at risk?\n\nAccording to data from Nansen, 32% of ETH coins awaiting withdrawal are currently linked to Celsius. This accounts for a substantial 206,300 ETH, valued at about $468.5 million based on the leading altcoin\u2019s current price.\n\nWith such a large volume of coins ready to be released onto the market, some believe that it would put downward pressure on ETH\u2019s price. Others, however, opined that it might benefit the ETH market once Celsius concludes its restructuring efforts.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH exchanged hands at $2,250. The alt has witnessed a 5% drop in value in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe coin\u2019s momentum indicators observed on a 24-hour chart have trended downward since the year began, suggesting a decline in buying momentum since then. At press time, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 48.82, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 54.74.\n\nIts Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) spotted below the zero line confirmed that traders have increasingly removed liquidity from ETH markets. Fears of a blanket SEC rejection of Bitcoin ETFs could be driving this capital removal.\n\nA significantly positive correlation exists between BTC and ETH. Hence, should the rejection result in a decline in BTC\u2019s price, ETH\u2019s price is sure to witness a retraction as well.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe coin\u2019s negative directional index (red) rested above the positive directional index (green) at the time of writing. This suggested that selling pressure exceeded coin accumulation.\n\nThese lines have been so positioned since 3rd January, corresponding with the decline in demand."

        "title": "Tether Investors' Surge Towards Mollars, Ethereum\u2019s New Store-of-Value Token - Baltimore Post-Examiner",
        "content": "A new cryptocurrency, still in its initial coin offering (view ico here) stage & scheduled to debut on the Ethereum Blockchain in 2024, is quickly gaining a lot of notoriety among crypto enthusiasts. Branded \u201cMollars\u201d, this crypto project aims to position itself as the ERC-20 network\u2019s new Bitcoin or being more technical, a decentralized Store-of-Value token.\n\nThe token remains in its presale phase and has been steadily accumulating sales each day, nearing the completion of its initial funding round. Notably, among the communities expressing significant interest in Mollars are the holders of Tether (USDT).\n\nWhat Are Store of Value Tokens?\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects about cryptocurrencies is that, even though at their core they are different from commodities like gold or assets like stock, they are still able to fulfill the roles of these types of assets with a faster and more decentralized exchange platform.\n\nStore-of-Value (SoV) cryptocurrencies are inherently characterized by their limited supply, akin to precious commodities such as gold. These digital tokens, exemplified by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) , possess a predetermined maximum issuance, fostering scarcity similar to finite resources. This scarcity factor contributes to their perception as a secure and enduring form of value storage. It also fosters trust and utility akin to traditional assets, despite their intangible nature. The confidence in their finite supply reinforces their role as reliable instruments for wealth preservation in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nWhat Makes Mollars an SoV?\n\nMollars boasts several key features that solidify its standing in the crypto market. Firstly, its decentralized nature aligns with the ethos of cryptocurrencies, having no central ownership, thereby promoting trust and autonomy among users.\n\nWith a capped total supply of only 10,000,000 tokens, scarcity plays a pivotal role in establishing its value, making it one of the [SOV] cryptos with the most limited supply to ever enter the blockchain. The token\u2019s debut on the ERC-20 leverages the network\u2019s technological prowess, offering advanced transactional capabilities and minimal fees, appealing to investors seeking efficiency and cost-effectiveness in their transactions.\n\nThis scarcity, combined with Ethereum\u2019s robust infrastructure, positions Mollars as a potential safe haven from external volatility, potentially attracting both Ethereum blockchain enthusiasts and investors seeking long-term value preservation in a digital asset.\n\nTether Investors Are Buying Mollars\n\nAnalyzing Mollars\u2019 presale address, it is easy to spot a recent spike of buyers who are Tether ($USDT) holders. Every day, USDT investors are acquiring thousands of dollars in $MOLLARS.\n\nAs a stablecoin pegged to the dollar, Tether is commonly used as a medium between crypto and fiat, due to its stability. However, these types of crypto are unable to serve as an SoV digital currency due to the fact that it is \u2018centralized\u2019 around the U.S. Dollar.\n\nPerhaps for this reason, these holders are opting to acquire a currency that is positioning itself for tremendous growth as it enters the market, and also becomes the unofficial SoV for the World\u2019s most active and largest blockchain.\n\nUnderstanding Mollars Presale: Potential 10.000% ROI\n\nAfter only a couple of weeks, the project\u2019s presale has already sold nearly 60.000 tokens. This means that those who are looking to buy the currency have limited time to obtain $MOLLARS at $0.30.\n\nThe thirty-cent offer is limited to the first 100.000 tokens sold on the presale. Its second phase will offer the token for $0.40.\n\nIf the project can reach the presale hard cap, $MOLLARS will debut on the market with a price of $0.62. This means that investors obtaining the token at $0.30 can reach a 100% ROI right at the listing date.\n\nHowever, the true potential for holding this new token lies beyond its ICO. As an ownerless, safe, and limited supply token, Mollars has the potential to become the blockchain\u2019s go-to asset when investors are looking to keep their money stored in an asset that is poised to become deflationary over time.\n\nThe overwhelming interest from Tether holders during its presale could also symbolize a shift in investment approach in the market today. As the entire market grows in adoption, utility, and popularity, the idea of holding a crypto pegged to a fiat currency could become obsolete in the future.\n\nAs Mollars emerges as an alternative for everyone in the Ethereum Blockchain, and if it succeeds in becoming the platform\u2019s Store of Value, today\u2019s worth of $0.30 could be over 100 times higher.\n\nDiscuss the latest updates on Mollars with other token presale investors via social community reddit (r/MollarsToken).\n\nView the latest stats or purchase $MOLLARS before it lists on a public crypto exchange via Mollars.com \u2014 the official website."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is in a state of constant evolution, with both established players and new entrants vying for investor attention. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is looking poised for a significant surge in 2024. Meanwhile, the emergence of new meme coins, like Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ), signals an intensifying competition in the meme coin arena, which is currently dominated by Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Predictions\n\nEthereum has been a trailblazer in the crypto realm, known for its smart contract functionality and potential to revolutionize various industries. After recovering from the downturn of 2022, ETH is on the cusp of another potential rally. Experts from FieryTrading suggest that a breakout from its bullish triangle pattern could propel ETH to $5,000 by the close of 2024 or early 2025. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan further fueled the optimism, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade, which could elevate its price to a staggering $8,000 by 2026. Even the notable crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that while ETH might see minor corrections, it could touch the $3,400-$3,800 range in Q1 2024.\n\nDissenting Voices and Market Indicators\n\nHowever, not everyone is aboard the Ethereum hype train. Renowned trader Peter Brandt remains sceptical, emphasizing Ethereum\u2019s challenges with gas prices and its comparison with Bitcoin as a store of value. Additionally, market watchers have been keeping a keen eye on the ETH spot Ether ETF\u2019s potential approval, a development that could further boost Ethereum\u2019s value, with predictions suggesting a target of $3,210.05 by Q1 2024.\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ) vs. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nWhile Ethereum continues its upward trajectory, the meme coin arena is witnessing fresh competition. Dogecoin, one of the top altcoins, with its iconic Shiba Inu branding, has long been the poster child of meme coins. However, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ) is emerging as a formidable contender. Built on the Ethereum network, which offers robust security and functionality, Rebel Satoshi has quickly gained traction. With over 92 million $RBLZ sold and $1,000,000 raised, its citizens round 3 has exceeded the coveted $1.2 million mark. What sets Rebel Satoshi apart is its commitment to safety; its smart contracts have undergone rigorous auditing by the esteemed Source Hat auditing firm. This is one of the many reasons why it is regarded as the best meme coin.\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi Opportunity\n\nFor those looking to explore the meme coin space, Rebel Satoshi presents a promising opportunity. As it gears up to challenge giants like DOGE, early investors could potentially reap substantial rewards. Being on the Ethereum network further fortifies its credibility, given Ethereum\u2019s stature as one of the top crypto coins globally. If the current momentum is any indication, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s journey is one that investors won\u2019t want to miss.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum gears up for a potential rally, new entrants like Rebel Satoshi are injecting fresh energy into the meme coin space. As always, while the crypto market promises lucrative opportunities, it\u2019s crucial for investors to conduct their due diligence and stay informed. Whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s ascent or Rebel Satoshi\u2019s emergence, the crypto landscape continues to be as dynamic and exciting as ever.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

        "content": "ETH was down by more than 1.5% in the last seven days.\n\nIf ETH initiates a bull rally, it might face resistance near $2,300 and $2,400.\n\nThe year 2024 began on a sweet note as Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] value surged above $2,400. However, the king of altcoins witnessed a price correction, pushing its value under $2,300 once again.\n\nWhile this happened, an interesting whale activity occured.\n\nEthereum\u2019s chart turns red\n\nAfter a comfortable beginning in 2024, ETH fell victim to a price correction on the 3rd of January. Because of the price correction, ETH\u2019s value plummeted by more than 1.6% in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,243.76 with a market capitalization of over $269 billion. Amidst this, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet highlighting an intriguing development.\n\nAs per the tweet, Paradigm deposited 6,500 ETH on Coinbase, which was worth more than $14.6 million. If historical data is to be considered, Paradigm has always bought ETH during bear markets and sold ETH in bull markets to earn profits.\n\nTherefore, since Paradigm dumped ETH, does this mean a larger sell-off is on its way?\n\nAre whales selling Ethereum?\n\nAMBCrypto planned to check Ethereum\u2019s whale activity to see how they were behaving. Notably, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, posted a tweet on the 6th of January, which revealed a promising development.\n\nAs per the tweet, in the past month, Ethereum whales bought over 410,000 ETH, worth nearly $1 billion. This showed that the whales were stockpiling ETH in hopes of a bull rally.\n\nOur analysis of Santiment\u2019s data painted a similar picture. AMBCrypto found that whale activity around the token remained high, as evidenced by the spike in its Whale Transaction Count.\n\nIts supply held by top addresses also increased last week, meaning that whales were accumulating more ETH until press time.\n\nNot only the whales, but the market at large also seemed to have been buying Ethereum. The token\u2019s Supply on Exchanges dropped last week, while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased.\n\nAlso, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data showed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average, clearly reflecting high buying pressure.\n\nTo top it off, ETH\u2019s Coinbase Premium was in the green, which meant that buying sentiment was dominant among US investors at press time.\n\nIt was interesting to note that on the one hand, buying pressure on ETH was increasing, while on the other hand, the blockchain\u2019s network activity declined.\n\nAMBCrypto had earlier reported that BNB Chain [BNB] has surpassed Ethereum in terms of user activity over the past month. As per the data, only 1.28 million active addresses transacted on Ethereum, witnessing a 13% drop in user activity.\n\nWill high buying pressure initiate a bull rally?\n\nWhile buying pressure increased and prices sank, ETH\u2019s derivatives market metrics somewhat turned bullish. For example, ETH\u2019s Open Interest dropped along with its price. Such instances indicate an increased chance of a trend reversal.\n\nIts BitMEX Funding Rate also declined last week, and market sentiment around the token remained bearish, as shown by the dip in Ethereum\u2019s Weighted Sentiment.\n\nIf we consider that ETH will soon begin a bull rally, it would still have quite a few barriers to overcome to skyrocket its price. To find that, AMBCrypto took a closer look at ETH\u2019s liquidation heatmap.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOur analysis found that if a bull run is bound to happen, ETH would face a strong resistance level near the $2,300 mark. And if it goes above that level, then ETH\u2019s would face its next barrier at $2,400.\n\nThe last time ETH\u2019s price touched those levels, its liquidation spiked sharply."

This substantial profit margin signals a considerable bullish position, showcasing the investor\u2019s confidence in Ethereum\u2019s prospects.\n\nThis surge in holdings by the largest non-exchange wallets has been steadily rising since April 2023, even during market downturns, showcasing a consistent pattern of accumulation.\n\nConcurrently, according to Santiment, the holdings of top exchange-bound wallets remain relatively stagnant at 9.46 million ETH, signalling minimal movement of coins to exchanges for selling purposes.\n\nIs a bullish price move imminent amid Spot ETF speculations?\n\nThe contrasting behaviours between the self-custodial whales and those tied to exchanges suggest differing strategies significant Ethereum investors pursue.\n\nThe continual accumulation by the self-custodial whales hints at a potential optimistic outlook for Ethereum\u2019s long-term trajectory.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s current price hovering around $2,250, lagging behind Bitcoin\u2019s recovery from the recent market crash, the ongoing accumulation trend among Ethereum\u2019s largest wallets indicates a sustained interest and confidence among these significant investors.\n\nAmid these whale accumulations, the overarching optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has emerged as a notable market catalyst. The anticipated bullish sentiment accompanying a potential ETF approval for Bitcoin might trigger a broader market rally, potentially influencing Ethereum\u2019s price surge and aligning with BTC\u2019s movement."

This represented a 50% growth in month-over-month (MoM) fees paid by its users to use its network.\n\nFrom these fees, the chain saw a revenue of $2 million from these fees.\n\nDue to its lower user activity, Ethereum\u2019s fees and revenue climbed by just 10% in the last month, according to data from Token Terminal\n\nBNB on a weekly chart\n\nAt the time of writing, BNB traded at $305.80, logging a 31% price rally in the last month, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe coin\u2019s price assessed within a wider time frame (weekly) showed that despite the 3% price correction recorded in the last week, accumulation persisted.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) rested above their center lines, suggesting that buying activity exceeded distribution. As of this writing, RSI was 67.22, while the Money Flow Index (MFI) was 71.69.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nShowing that the bulls were in control of the market, BNB\u2019s positive directional index (green) rested significantly above its negative directional index (red).

When these averages are so positioned, it is generally considered an indication of an upward trend."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is currently finding it difficult to rally higher following weeks of aggressively bullish price action. Yet, there are still several support levels nearby that could keep the cryptocurrency from dropping lower.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been on the rise since breaking above the 200-day moving average and the large descending channel. While ETH is still trading above the key $2,000 level, it is going through a consolidation phase below the $2,400 level, failing to climb higher.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index is also hovering around the 50% level, pointing to an equilibrium in momentum. As a result, the short-term price action heavily depends on whether the cryptocurrency drops below the $2,000 level or successfully breaks above the $2,400 level to target the $2,700 resistance zone.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has been oscillating between the $2,100 and $2,400 levels over the last month. Following the recent rapid drop toward the former area, ETH has rebounded and is consolidating in the middle of the range.\n\nTherefore, while the market structure is still relatively bullish, things could go either way, depending on the direction of the potential breakout from the mentioned range.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum has undergone a significant uptrend in recent months, surging from below $1K to over $2.4K. Currently, the price is exhibiting uncertainty about its future trajectory, prompting a closer look at futures market sentiment for valuable insights.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, counting the number of open futures contracts regardless of trade direction. Higher values indicate confidence among futures traders regarding the trend, while lower values suggest uncertainty. Additionally, increased open interest correlates with heightened price volatility, raising the likelihood of liquidation cascades.\n\nWhile the price has been on an upward trend, open interest has consistently risen, indicating a bullish market sentiment. However, a recent phase of sideways consolidation has coincided with a notable decline in open interest. This suggests that many long positions have been flushed out, indicating a healthy futures market, potentially paving the way for a renewed impulsive trend. The direction of the upcoming trend, however, remains uncertain until the funding rate metric experiences a notable move, either above or below one."

        "content": "Trader Peter Brandt Revises Ethereum (ETH) Bearish View; InQubeta (QUBE) & Injective (INJ) Beckon as an Exciting Opportunity\n\nEthereum (ETH) recently hit the headlines after veteran crypto trader Peter Brandt said that the bearish predictions about the cryptocurrency over an ascending triangle chart pattern were not correct.\n\nBrandt contradicted the prediction due to a recent rise above an ascending triangle wedge pattern in Ethereum\u2019s price chart. The wedge pattern is marked by trend lines connecting the highs and lows of a price series.\n\nIn other news, InQubeta (QUBE) and Injective (INJ) have been posting impressive growth. While Injective is a decentralized protocol for managing assets, InQubeta is an Ethereum-based platform that helps startups raise funds for AI projects.\n\nIn a short period, InQubeta has gained an edge over other altcoins and has made a splash globally. Its cryptocurrency ICO has so far raised $7.8 million.\n\nInQubeta: Where startup finance meets blockchain\n\n\n\nInQubeta has been designed for startups who believe in artificial intelligence\u2019s potential to disrupt the future. The decentralized platform supports startups who have put projects on the backburner due to a fund shortage.\n\nIt has emerged as one of the best altcoins for 2023 by demonstrating the far-reaching impact of DeFi. InQubeta\u2019s native cryptocurrency QUBE is the official medium of exchange for the network. The QUBE token is powered by the ERC-20 standard.\n\nWhile the InQubeta team has generated 1.5 billion QUBE tokens, only 65% of the total supply will be used for public sale. What\u2019s left will go towards operating the platform and for meeting expenses like legal fees, paying developers, marketing activities, distributing rewards, and infusing liquidity into the platform.\n\nThe QUBE token has a multi-faceted model which includes a deflationary character. Due to limited availability, the token demand remains high despite inflation. If there is a sudden hike in supply, the excess tokens are burned to make it scarce again.\n\nInQubeta leverages a decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) model to distribute the responsibilities of decisions. Such a model brings together community members to decide on key matters. If a stakeholder thinks of a protocol change, it\u2019s pitched as a proposal.\n\nAll proposals have to undergo a review process and are then put to a vote. QUBE token holders have special voting rights to participate in the process. They help prevent unnecessary changes by exercising good judgment.\n\nThe AI sector is an upcoming industry and InQubeta could gain an early mover advantage by providing startups with easy access to funds.\n\nInjective to host \u2018End of the Year Treasure Hunt\u2019\n\n\n\nInjective is a Layer 1 blockchain that can help developers create future-ready dApps. Its native token is represented by the ticker INJ. Injective\u2019s stellar performance in the past has drawn the attention of crypto users worldwide and it\u2019s now considered an unmissable opportunity.\n\nIt recently hit the headlines after it announced its plans to host the \u2018End of the Year Treasure Hunt\u2019. The competition invites participants to discover 12 hidden words. The Top 3 players will share a prize pool and other goodies. The prize pool is supported by Injective-related dApps.\n\nThe participants will have to interact with the dApps, complete tasks, and find the secret words.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shares revised roadmap\n\n\n\nRecommended by experts as a top crypto to invest in, Ethereum is a leading blockchain technology that supports a wide range of decentralized infrastructures including sidechains, dApps, and cryptocurrencies. Its native token ETH is used for settling all payments on the network. These transactions are validated using the proof-of-stake consensus protocol.\n\nAnalysts who have been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s performance have an optimistic view of its prospects. Recently, noted crypto trader Peter Brandt also revised his outlook and said the recent bearish predictions about the ETH token might not be correct as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price had managed to move above an ascending triangle pattern.\n\nIn a recent development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also shared a revised roadmap for the cryptocurrency. Buterin did not specify a deadline or time frame for the roadmap. According to reports, the updated roadmap will tackle Ethereum\u2019s design weakness which has prompted a surge in Layer 2 networks.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nEthereum, InQubeta, and Injective have braved the flurry of new altcoins in 2023 with their robust performances. The three cryptocurrencies added more zeros to their patrons\u2019 bank balances with their cutting-edge features and high growth potential.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 recent predictions about the three tokens reflect their optimism. If you are looking to ramp up your crypto portfolio this year, these cryptocurrencies might be just what you need.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale"

Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) also saw some respectable profit taking on the market. However, all the assets show stable performance. Meanwhile, Pushd (PUSHD) has entered the new stage of its presale launch.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) Enter New Market Stage\n\nSolana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been perceived as competitors as both blockchains build out their respective robust smart contract platforms with a variety of decentralized applications. Solana (SOL), for instance, has risen in value by 1,100% from January to December 2023, while Ethereum (ETH) is up by approximately 80% within the same time frame.\n\nThe start of 2024 has seen Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) undergo a period of price adjustment, with SOL and ETH experiencing a 17% and 3% decrease in their trading value over the last two weeks, respectively. This trend reflects a strategic move by Solana investors to capitalize on their investments, while Ethereum maintains a steady, though unhurried, progression at the beginning of the year. Notably, prominent crypto influencer Raoul Pal holds an optimistic view on the future trajectory of these cryptocurrencies. He suggests that both Solana and Ethereum have the potential to revisit their peak prices within the year, particularly if a bull market is stimulated by the anticipated Bitcoin halving in April. This event, often a significant milestone in the crypto market, could potentially herald a period of robust growth for these leading digital assets.\n\nIs a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Approval Imminent?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) holders are most definitely bullish in 2024, especially as speculations of an imminent approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission intensify. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) rallied throughout 2023 off the back of the speculation, with the token recording a 160% increase in price from January to December 2023. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently ordered prospective Bitcoin ETF aspirants to make certain changes to their filings ahead of a crucial week which hint at an approval in the making.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) Enteres Presale\n\nThe Pushd (PUSHD) new stage presale is live. Pushd is building the world\u2019s first viable decentralized alternative to Web2 ecommerce platforms. The Pushd marketplace features low platform fees, minimal listing charges and KYC processes, and a user experience tailored for both crypto natives and newbies. PUSHD presale investors are incentivized by revenue sharing on the Pushd marketplace, giving them a bigger income the more PUSHD tokens they hold.\n\nAccording to developers, PUSHD is on pace to sell out stage 2 of its presale token allocation. With over 8,000 registrants and counting, PUSHD is quickly gaining its market share.\n\nFind out more about the Pushd presale at their official website."

        "title": "3 Crypto Predictions for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a brutal crypto winter in 2022, the resurgence that swept through the crypto asset class in 2023 was more than refreshing. With signs that a bull market might be looming ahead, 2024 is shaping up to be a year for the history books.\n\nWhile they might seem outlandish, here are three predictions for the upcoming year. Remember, this is crypto -- stranger things have happened.\n\nIt's still Bitcoin's year\n\nLet's cut to the chase: Bitcoin (BTC 2.11%) might have a better 2024 than it did in 2023. With the first prediction for the new year, Bitcoin should hit a new all-time high.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin's rise could be attributed to the anticipated approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and fresh interest in novel use cases like Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based equivalent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile these two catalysts helped renew sentiment across the crypto market, they will likely prove to be minor accelerants compared to what 2024 has in store. The most influential development pushing Bitcoin toward an all-time high is the upcoming halving. Hardwired into Bitcoin's code, the halving reduces Bitcoin's inflation rate in half roughly every four years. Currently sitting at 1.75%, in April of this year it will fall to 0.85%.\n\nHistorically, halvings have been significant drivers of price appreciation as demand must adjust to a diminished inflation rate. In years that a halving occurred, Bitcoin has grown by more than 128% on average. A jump of this magnitude would put Bitcoin's price at $99,000 -- a new all-time high.\n\nTo take it a step further, this halving will be unlike any other. For most of Bitcoin's history, the rate of freshly mined supply more or less kept up with demand. But that shifted recently. Currently, only 2.3 million coins are available on exchanges for purchase, a level not seen since 2017. As a result, the upcoming halving will be the first time in history that there are fewer available coins than at the previous halving. With an unprecedented supply shock inbound, don't be surprised if Bitcoin hits six figures in 2023.\n\nThe Bitcoin renaissance continues\n\nCategorized as a Layer 2 blockchain since it operates in tandem with a Layer 1 blockchain, Stacks (STX -3.13%) unlocks Bitcoin to take on new use cases and realize its true potential as the foundation of a decentralized economy.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the popularity of Ordinals sparked interest in building Bitcoin-based solutions, allowing it to take on use cases beyond just a store of value. As general interest transformed into a movement, Stacks became a natural beneficiary with its Bitcoin compatibility and rose more than 200% in 2023. Yet this is just scratching the surface of what may come in 2024.\n\nScheduled to go live in April, the Nakamoto Release will unveil novel functionality that allows Bitcoin holders to swap their Bitcoin for a new asset, sBTC, and then use that token across the DeFi economy. Once finishing their DeFi activities, holders can seamlessly redeem their sBTC for the original BTC. Since sBTC's price is pegged to BTC, there is no slippage, and best of all, the exchange process is done in a decentralized and secure fashion through the use of smart contracts, preserving Bitcoin's distinct characteristics.\n\nFor the second prediction of 2024, expect Stacks to double in value and become a top 20 most valuable cryptocurrency. With the Bitcoin renaissance gaining steam, Stacks is in an ideal position to continue growing and claim the spotlight.\n\nEthereum is overdue for a run\n\nWhile Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies rode waves of momentum in 2023, Ethereum (ETH 1.22%) more or less watched from the sidelines. It still jumped an admirable 80% but paled in comparison to other notable altcoins like Solana, which made gains of more than 900%, and Avalanche, which jumped 250%.\n\nBut this might change in 2024 as Ethereum is scheduled to get another critical upgrade. Known as EIP-4844 and expected to be released in the second half of the year, the upgrade will reduce transaction costs and boost throughput to 100,000 transactions per second, effectively solving two of the main challenges hampering Ethereum's maturation. Building off of The Merge from 2022, a previous upgrade that switched the blockchain from proof of work to proof of stake, EIP-4844 is just one out of a series of upgrades that aims to \"grow Ethereum until it's powerful enough to help all of humanity.\"\n\nDespite its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum remains the premier blockchain for novel use cases of cryptocurrencies such as decentralized finance, NFTs, yield farming, and more. When considering the added benefit EIP-4844 will bring to the ecosystem, my third prediction for 2024 is that it should be the year that Ethereum reminds the crypto world that it is the undisputed home of decentralized finance and makes a run of historic magnitude."

        "content": "The Polygon NFT volume has outranked that of Solana (SOL) in the past 24 hours. According to data from CryptoSlam, the popular Ethereum-based Layer-2 scaling protocol now ranks in the third position after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), sending Solana to the 4th position.\n\nInteresting Polygon NFT Figures\n\nCryptoSlam data shows that Polygon has recorded a daily sales volume worth $9,986,754 in the past 24 hours, a figure that is more than double that of Solana which comes in at $4,116,667. While the Polygon NFT sales volume has jumped by 43% in 24 hours, that of Solana has slumped by more than 17%, giving rise to the flippening.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPolygon also has a higher wash sales figure compared to Solana with this metric coming in at $858,631 as compared to $175,493. Cumulatively, the total sales volume including the regular sales and wash sales comes in at $10,845,385 for Polygon NFTs and $4,292,160.\n\nThe total number of traders that helped Polygon achieve this rare feat is 12,283. An interesting trend presented itself in this regard as the total traders on Solana are far more than 13,560, underscoring how relatively more valuable the Non-Fungible Tokens being traded on Polygon are.\n\nConversely, Polygon NFT trader count outpaces the 7,002 buyers on the Bitcoin network and the 10,551 buyers on Ethereum as of the time of ranking. This NFT data positions Polygon as the best-performing non-layer-1 network in the top 5 which was completed by the Avalanche Network.\n\nThe growth of Inscriptions on Polygon might account for this massive NFT sales volume recorded thus far.\n\nCrypto Industry\u2019s Transient Growth Phases\n\nDespite being a nascent ecosystem, the crypto industry is seeing increased competition among participants that is reminiscent of the mainstream financial world.\n\nWeeks ago, Solana made the headlines as a top venue for NFT and DeFi trading activities after surpassing Ethereum in both daily and weekly DEX volumes respectively. This feat is unprecedented, seeing Ethereum still dominates the ecosystem in different aspects.\n\nWith Polygon outpacing Solana, signs are there that layer-2 solutions are attaining maturity, a trend that has spurred Vitalik Buterin to call for the development of customized Name Service for these protocols to enhance their adoption and usability.\n\nThis current milestone is part of a unique growth trend in Polygon which as reported earlier also extends to growing daily active users."

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies dipped on Sunday evening, fueled by market anxiety over how Bitcoin would react to the potential approval or denial of the United States\u2019 inaugural spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD -0.63% $43,804 Ethereum ETH/USD -1.69% $2,207 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -3.36% $0.078\n\nWhat Happened: According to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, most applicants are expected to receive approval within the week, provided they have met the regulator\u2019s requirements before Dec. 29.\n\nOn Jan. 5, key players in the Bitcoin Spot ETF race, such as BlackRock, Grayscale, 21Shares, and others, submitted 19b-4 amendments in response to the SEC\u2019s request. The 19b-4 filing represents one of the last stages in the SEC\u2019s approval process. This step could potentially pave the way for the first-time approval of the funds in the U.S. this week, as Reuters reported, citing sources.\n\nBalchunas notes that the final S-1 documents from the asset managers are due at 8 am on Monday.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Siacoin SC/USD +21.04% $0.009752 Bitget Token BGB/USD +0.69% $0.61 Stacks STX/USD +0.64% $1.62\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.66 trillion, marking a 4.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures showed little change Sunday night following a down week for the major averages in 2024. Traders are anticipating inflation data and big bank earnings in the week ahead. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped by 35 points, or 0.1%. Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures saw increases of 0.14% and 0.21%, respectively.\n\nCongressional leaders announced a deal on Sunday, agreeing on a $1.59 trillion top-line spending to prevent a potential government shutdown.\n\nThese developments come after the year-end rally, during which a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve raised concerns among investors about equities being overbought. Additionally, a strong December jobs report and Fed meeting minutes indicating uncertainty about the future of rate cuts added to these worries.\n\nThe December consumer price index is scheduled for release on Thursday, and the producer price index is due on Friday. These reports will provide insight into whether the Fed\u2019s efforts to bring inflation down to its 2% target are succeeding.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe predicts a significant impact on the crypto markets due to the Bitcoin ETF. \"Approx. $30-60 billion in liquidity flowing into the markets, through which Bitcoin will face a bull cycle comparable to the http://Dot.com bubble or Gold in 2004-2011.\"\n\nAnalyst PlanB predicts a 10x price surge for Bitcoin (BTC), citing multiple bullish indicators.\n\n\"Bitcoin's growth used to be 100x in the first couple of bull markets, but lately that has slowed down a little bit to 10x, a little bit under 10x. I don't expect diminishing returns because we're at 2 or 3% adoption, and if we follow the logistic S-curve and Metcalfe's law, we can't have diminishing returns below 50% adoption, so we'll have exponential growth for a couple more years. I expect a nice 10x that brings it to somewhere in the $100,000 to $1 million range.\"\n\nAs we near ETF week, brace for significant volatility in the Bitcoin market, with alternative cryptocurrencies being influenced by its movements. This prediction comes from CrediBull Crypto, another pseudonymous analyst.\n\n\"For ETH- something like this seems most plausible and should coincide with the local breakdown on ETH/BTC mentioned in my post below. It would make sense for BTC to break local highs following ETF approval while alts led by ETH lag a bit and then ultimately follow BTC up.\"\n\nData from Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, has indicated, \u201cBitcoin is mildly declining as the weekend kicks off, and there may be some volatility ahead with whale transactions hitting their highest level since June 12, 2022. When whale activity spikes, prices often foreshadow a breaking cycle.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nTLDR\n\n1. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the top crypto assets for 2024 because of their large market cap and huge following.\n\n2. NuggetRush has amazed investors with its P2E gaming and raised over $1.5 million in the current presale.\n\n3. BNB and Cardano have seen immense growth at various crypto exchanges for their smart contracts.\n\nCrypto analysts are optimistic that the crypto industry will grow significantly as we step into January 2024. Many new cryptos have entered the market alongside the veterans to give cut throat competition. To make things easier, we have curated the list of top 5 cryptocurrencies for this month. The list includes prominent names like Bitcoin and Ethereum along with newcomers like NuggetRush, Cardano, and BNB. Let\u2019s find out more about them in detail.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nBitcoin is the Undisputed Champion\n\nThere is no doubt that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency worldwide. It continues to hold the top ranking by crypto market cap. There will always be a huge demand for this cryptocurrency because it has a limited supply of 21 million coins. Its value has soared beyond the $43,000 mark and continues to grow further.\n\nWith many large businesses accepting Bitcoin payments, it is the best crypto investment which is safe, reliable, and expected to increase further. You don\u2019t have to worry about exchange rates or country borders because it works the same all over the world.\n\nEthereum: The Smart Contract Pioneer\n\nEthereum stands out in the crypto world for its unique features. It\u2019s a platform where you can create and run applications. It has a unique process called smart contracts which are like digital agreements. They are used while sending or receiving money in the form of crypto coins. This helps to reduce the middleman involved in the transactions and make this simpler.\n\nYou must be wondering why I should invest in Ethereum? Well, what makes it a top crypto pick is that it\u2019s always reinventing itself with new updates. For instance, Ethereum is moving towards being more eco-friendly, reducing its energy use significantly. This adaptability not only makes Ethereum a trailblazer in crypto but also hints at its potential to stick around for the long haul.\n\nNuggetRush: The Rising Star in P2E Gaming\n\nNuggetRush is gaining attention for its unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) model that combines gaming with investing. Players can earn real rewards through their virtual gold mining game. NuggetRush stands out as the best crypto to buy in 2024 for its innovative approach, attracting not just crypto investors but also gamers. The integration of NFT staking and a zero-tax policy on transactions add to its appeal.\n\nNuggetRush is built on the Ethereum network with a total supply of 500,000,000 NUGX tokens. It has already seen considerable interest in its presale, with expectations of significant gains upon the official launch. Security is a key focus for NuggetRush, with its smart contracts audited to ensure safe operations. As the P2E gaming sector grows, NuggetRush is poised for significant growth in 2024.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nBinance Coin (BNB): The Exchange-Driven Crypto\n\nBinance Coin is a smart pick for investors for several reasons. Firstly, it\u2019s tied to Binance, which is the best crypto exchange worldwide and gives BNB solid backing with a high degree of trust. Using BNB can save you money on Binance because when you trade there, paying with BNB often gets you a discount on fees. That\u2019s like having a coupon for your crypto trades!\n\nIt\u2019s used in Binance\u2019s decentralized exchange, known as Binance DEX, adding more ways to use it. Plus, Binance constantly updates and improves BNB\u2019s technology, making it more efficient and user-friendly. BNB also has a limited supply. This scarcity can drive up its value as more people want it but there\u2019s only so much to go around. You can use it for various things like investing in new projects on Binance\u2019s launchpad.\n\nCardano: The Research-Driven Blockchain\n\nCardano stands out as one of the best crypto for beginners for its scientific approach to blockchain development. It\u2019s super eco-friendly and doesn\u2019t use much energy, so it\u2019s better for our planet. This is a big deal because being green is important nowadays.\n\nThen, there\u2019s its science-based approach. Cardano\u2019s development is all about heavy-duty research and peer review. This means a lot of smart people check and double-check everything, making it really solid and reliable. Another big plus is its potential for growth. Cardano is always improving, adding new features and updates. This means it could become more useful and valuable over time. And let\u2019s not forget, it\u2019s got a strong community. Lots of people believe in Cardano and support it. This community can help push Cardano to new heights in 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nLooking at the crypto world for January 2024, there are five options for investors. Each one is different. If you\u2019re thinking of investing, these are great choices, but remember to think about how much risk you\u2019re okay with and what you want from your investment. If you like the trustworthiness of community-driven memecoins, go for NuggetRush and start earning by playing the game.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website"

Solana (SOL): The Scalability Giant\n\nSolana has garnered significant attention in the crypto space for its impressive speed and scalability. Often referred to as the \u201cVisa for digital assets,\u201d Solana\u2019s institutional adoption and scalability advantages have made it a strong contender. It excels in the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and its market performance in 2023, along with its technical capabilities, make it an attractive investment.Solana\u2019s ability to process a high number of transactions per second sets it apart.

Avalanche distinguishes itself by offering robust support for DeFi and decentralized applications (dApps), with a particular emphasis on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).Despite mixed DeFi metrics in Q2 2023, Avalanche demonstrates potential, particularly in the field of asset tokenization. As DeFi continues to evolve and expand, Avalanche aims to provide a platform that can accommodate the growing demand for decentralized financial services.\n\nIn Conclusion: Retik Finance Shines Bright\n\nWhile Solana and Avalanche are formidable alternatives to Ethereum, Retik Finance stands out with its innovative approach to DeFi.

Here are some other features of its ecosystem:\n\nLending Protocol: The lending protocol establishes money markets designed for lending and borrowing.\n\nSwap: A DeFi swap that simplifies token trading, ensuring the lowest fees for seamless transactions.\n\nVaultX: VaultX serves as a multichain yield optimizer, offering an avenue to generate compound interest on your crypto holdings.\n\nThe PLX token powers all these features and serves as the main currency on Pullix. If you hold it, you will receive reduced trading fees and exclusive access to certain assets. But Pullix will also bring tremendous passive income opportunities. Through its \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d model, you will gain a portion of Pullix\u2019s daily revenue if you stake the PLX token.\n\nAs a result, investors are stockpiling this altcoin, which is currently valued at just $0.07. In Stage 5 of its presale, projections suggest a potential 580% surge before the presale concludes. Moreover, there\u2019s speculation among experts of a remarkable 100x surge after its listing on exchanges in Q1 of 2024.\n\nEthereum Classic News\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) recently unveiled significant news with its latest announcement. On December 12, the platform revealed that it was scheduled to complete its spiral network upgrade by January 31, 2024. This upgrade aims to align Ethereum Classic\u2019s protocol with the Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum, bringing protocol parity between the two.\n\nRegarding the altcoin\u2019s value movement, it jumped from $19.86 on December 3 to $20.35 on January 3. Moreover, the Ethereum Classic crypto now sits above its 21 and 50-day EMAs \u2013 good bullish signs.\n\nBecause of this, market analysts remain confident as they predict Ethereum Classic trading at the $33.68 level in February 2024.\n\nQuant Price Prediction\n\nAccording to analyst Crypto Jon, Quant (QNT) will experience a surge to $1,000 in 2024. As per CoinMarketCap, the Quant price has increased from $100 on December 3 to $126 on January 3. Its trading volume has also spiked on the daily charts, rising by 24% and now sitting at $33,661,161.\n\nThe technical indicators for Quant crypto also show 23 technical indicators in green. Moreover, this altcoin\u2019s Fear & Greed index rating shows a 70 (Greed), which paints a bright future for Quant.\n\nAs a result, experts in the crypto field forecast a potential surge to $152.89 for Quant before the end of February 2024.\n\nHow Does Pullix Outshine Ethereum Classic and Quant?\n\nPullix stands out thanks to its low market cap when taking a closer look at these altcoins. Currently, PLX has a market cap of $14M, drastically lower than Ethereum Classic ($2.9B) and Quant\u2019s ($1.5B). In other words, PLX will surge much faster as fewer new funds are needed.\n\nSince Pullix will also enter many resilient markets like the Forex market, which saw a daily volume of $6.6T in 2019, its long-term growth potential is stellar. Because of this, savvy investors are now looking at PLX as one of the top altcoins.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 7 High-Potential Cryptos Set to Shoot to the Moon in 2024 - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nThe crypto market looks set to grow a lot over the next year. The total market cap is projected to reach an impressive $3.2 trillion, while the global number of crypto owners is anticipated to surge as high as 950 million, as per the latest Bitfinex Alpha report. This growth is underpinned by several on-chain metrics suggesting the market's transition from a bear to a bull run, highlighted by the over 159% surge in Bitcoin (BTC) prices over the past year.\n\nAmidst this optimistic outlook, several cryptocurrencies are emerging as potential leaders for 2024. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are notable for their robust platforms and technological advancements. Meanwhile, ScapesMania (MANIA) is also gaining attention as a promising project.\n\nRide The Wave Of Innovation With ScapesMania\n\nWhile some are facing an uncertain future, the trajectory of a presale project is far easier to predict. ScapesMania (MANIA) is a well-balanced, meticulously designed project that acts as a gaming ecosystem. Through DAO governance, backers will be able to influence and benefit from a multi-billion-dollar industry. A wide range of features paired with the best technology, a professional team, and a long-term, highly ambitious vision can make ScapesMania the next big thing in crypto. Presale discounts and stage bonuses only add to the project's appeal.\n\nPresale is Live Now \u2013 Join Now for a Chance to Benefit with MANIA\n\nBacked by an award-winning developer crew, ScapesMania stands for transparency. The project can achieve this not just by bringing big innovation to the game, but by putting its community front and center. Driving customer engagement and making sure that everyone benefits through great tokenomics and generous rewards is what makes ScapesMania the project with a bright future ahead.\n\nPresale is Live, Learn More About Major Benefits\n\nEthereum (ETH): Navigating the Path of Expansion and Potential Milestones\n\nEthereum (ETH) has witnessed a significant rise in its market value, particularly with the expected approval of BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF. The price of Ethereum (ETH) has jumped 79% in the past year.\n\nIf this trend continues, Ethereum (ETH) is projected to experience price fluctuations ranging from $2,244 up to $6,373 in 2024. Ethereum (ETH) shows promise, yet its future remains unpredictable.\n\nMarket watchers are buzzing with the idea that if the ETF gets the green light, we could see Ethereum (ETH) price leap past $28,000, which is a pretty big deal considering where it stands now. The deflationary burn mechanism and expected surge of liquidity from the ETF are poised to dramatically boost its value. Nonetheless, market forecasts also suggest a potential upper limit in the forthcoming market cycle, with a more modest peak around $10,000.\n\nSolana (SOL): Navigating Market Dynamics and Anticipated Growth\n\nSolana (SOL) has demonstrated a remarkable upward trajectory, exhibiting robust market performance. Solana (SOL) is making waves with its lightning-fast transactions, quickly becoming a heavyweight in the tough world of crypto. Amidst the market's ups and downs, Solana (SOL) has impressively pushed past key challenges, grabbing the spotlight from investors and traders.\n\nWith predictions placing its value between $98.93 and $230.54 in 2024, Solana (SOL) stands on the verge of a significant increase in value, propelled by its sophisticated technology and strategic market presence.\n\nAlthough the road ahead has some bumps, Solana (SOL) has potential. Despite these obstacles, the allure of cryptocurrency, coupled with Solana (SOL) inherent strengths, points to a promising future valuation.\n\nOsmosis (OSMO): Carving a Niche in DeFi Leadership\n\nOsmosis (OSMO) has demonstrated a remarkable rebound over the past three months, marked by a surge in price and a transition into a robust recovery phase. This upward movement is bolstered by its increasing total value locked and trading volume, highlighting Osmosis' (OSMO) growing prominence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm.\n\nOsmosis (OSMO) is expected to see a significant increase in 2024 if it continues on its current trajectory. The annual low is estimated to be around $1.70, with a potential high of up to $5.18. The outlook for Osmosis (OSMO) is quite positive, indicating a strong upward trend and substantial momentum over the next year.\n\nWith its strategic alliance with Umee, Osmosis (OSMO) is poised for potential further advancement. Yet, to keep its edge post-merger, Osmosis (OSMO) must navigate the choppy waters of market volatility with steady progress. To prosper, Osmosis (OSMO) needs to integrate effectively within the expansive Cosmos network and resonate with its user community. For Osmosis (OSMO) to succeed in the competitive DeFi landscape, it must seamlessly assimilate into the Cosmos ecosystem and captivate its user base.\n\nSpotlight on Emerging Cryptocurrencies: Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial to look beyond the giants and consider emerging tokens like Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), and Arbitrum (ARB). Far from merely surfing the current of innovation, these tokens are forging their own formidable waves worthy of your scrutiny.\n\nRender (RNDR) has seen a meteoric rise with a 812% price increase in 2023, reaching nearly $5. This surge, backed by solid technical indicators, positions Render (RNDR) for continued growth. However, the $5.5 resistance level is a critical point to watch, as any rejection could lead to a downturn.\n\nOptimism (OP) is reimagining Ethereum scaling with a focus on supporting key protocols and prioritizing simplicity and public benefit. Although facing volatility, Optimism (OP) expanding community points to positive momentum. However, Optimism (OP) must navigate the competitive and volatile crypto market to realize its full potential.\n\nBy partnering with Solend, Sui (SUI) is making serious moves, boldly stepping beyond the confines of its home base in the Solana network. By embracing the Move programming language and harnessing parallel processing, Sui (SUI) is stepping up its game in both security and speed. As Sui (SUI) ventures into new territories, its ability to scale effectively while maintaining security will be crucial.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) stepped up the game in blockchain, really making strides with its layer-2 tech to help things run smoother and faster. As Arbitrum (ARB) gains traction, it's got to keep pushing boundaries and show it can play the long game against tough rivals and tricky tech hurdles.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe buzz is real: experts are betting big on crypto, expecting the market to soar and potentially hit a whopping $3.2 trillion in value this year. This optimism is fueled by a surge in Bitcoin prices and an expected increase in global crypto ownership to nearly a billion users. Against this upbeat backdrop, a handful of cryptos are stepping up as leaders, each packing its own punch and looking ripe with opportunity.\n\nEthereum (ETH) gearing up for a big leap, with the enthusiasm around its ETF nod and tech upgrades possibly sending its value through the roof. Riding the wave of its lightning-fast transaction speeds, Solana (SOL) is gearing up for some serious growth. Osmosis (OSMO) is making waves in the DeFi world, bouncing back with strength and showing signs it could really skyrocket in value. Cryptocurrencies like Render (RNDR), Optimism (OP), Sui (SUI), and Arbitrum (ARB) are on the rise too. Each brings fresh features to the table with serious growth potential. These seven digital currencies are like hidden gems in the vast crypto universe, each with a shot at soaring to remarkable heights as they evolve and expand.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "ChatGPT Signals Prime Buying Moment: Meme Moguls (MGLS), Optimism (OP), And Ethereum (ETH) On The Radar - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIf you are looking for a massive earning opportunity in 2024, Meme Moguls is the best option. Its ongoing presale is in great demand. Therefore, its presale MGLS tokens are selling out rapidly. Meanwhile, other projects like Optimism and Ethereum have also experienced moderate growth. So, let\u2019s see what experts say.\n\nOptimism\u2019s Adoption Grows 20%\n\nOptimism has been moving on a green path for the past many weeks. Subsequently, Optimism\u2019s market value has witnessed a surge of 123% in the past month. Hence, the current trading price of Optimism has jumped to $3.86.\n\nOne of the prime reasons behind Optimism\u2019s rise is its increased adoption. As per the latest on-chain data, the total value locked in its smart contracts has reached $5.65 billion. This also makes it the second largest layer-2 rollup, only behind Arbitrum.\n\nBesides, the transaction volume of Optimism has also increased. In the past three months, its transaction volume has grown by 20%. The data indicates that the network can witness a further increase in its value.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Exchange Supply Hits An All-time Low\n\nThe latest market data indicate that Ethereum can experience a price increase in the coming weeks. According to the latest data from Santiment, the supply of Ethereum on exchanges has hit an all-time low.\n\nCurrently, the supply of ETH on exchanges is 8.04% of its total circulation. As per experts, a decline in exchange supply is a bullish development. It implies that Ethereum investors want to hold their tokens, and not sell them.\n\nMeanwhile, the market price of Ethereum has increased by 10% in the past month. Therefore, the current value of Ethereum has jumped to $2,370.85.\n\nMeme Moguls Presale Growth Eyes Moon\n\nMost meme coins currently available in the market do not have any tangible utility. Their price increase relies on hype and speculations, making them vulnerable to market fluctuations. Therefore, although the meme coins sector has shown tremendous profitability, more than 55% of crypto investors doubt its future. Solving this issue, Meme Moguls, a new play-to-earn meme coin, has entered the market.\n\nMeme Moguls will roll out a gaming-based ecosystem, where people can learn and earn. It will introduce a simulated investing game, where players can participate in virtual stock trading. Players will win meme rewards, cash prizes, and additional perks.\n\nIt has built an environment that will give the feel of real-life trading. Take the Beat the Market game mode as an example. Here, users will be required to beat the market performances of indices and win rewards. Notably, Meme Moguls will give $100,000 in virtual cash to each player to complete challenges. So, what are you waiting for? Just grab this free money.\n\nThe platform\u2019s native crypto will be MGLS. Its owners can earn additional income by staking their tokens to the liquidity pool of the platform. Additionally, the project will have a Farming program that will let users earn coins. To prevent any pullouts and maintain stability, Meme Moguls\u2019 liquidity pools will be locked for five years, and team tokens for two years.\n\nThe presale phase of the platform is currently undergoing stage 4. Until now, the price of MGLS tokens has already surged from $0.0019 to $0.0027. However, as per market watchers, the value of the project can soar by 100x in the first year.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nFox journalist Eleanor Terrett has hinted at upcoming investigations related to XRP and Ethereum. Her focus stems from discussions within the crypto community, particularly centering on a 2021 proposal by Jimmy Vallee. Vallee suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve might buy back XRP tokens at an ambitious $30,000 each.\n\nEthereum\u2019s History Under Scrutiny\n\nSteven Nerayoff\u2019s allegations about Ethereum and its DAO hack have caught attention. Vallee has called for these matters to be highlighted on Fox. Digital Asset Investor also supports the idea of discussing the Ethereum DAO hack on Fox, suggesting it might be portrayed as an inside job.\n\nTerrett\u2019s remarks also brought back past claims against Ethereum\u2019s co-founders, including Vitalik Buterin. While there were talks of a major Fox report, no concrete developments have emerged yet.\n\nGreat question @StevenNerayoff I can\u2019t imagine they wouldn\u2019t want the scoop on the DAO being an inside job by the Ethereum Foundation as you seem to be saying. https://t.co/ppvCLhf7ll \u2014 Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) January 4, 2024\n\nUnresolved Questions Remain\n\nIn 2016, the Ethereum DAO faced a significant hack, resulting in the loss of millions in ETH. The hack\u2019s origin remains a topic of speculation. Terrett intends to explore both the DAO hack and the controversial ETH Gate theory further this year.\n\nXRP\u2019s High-Stakes Proposal: Is the FED Interested?\n\nTerrett also revisited a proposal suggesting that the Federal Reserve could buy back XRP at a high rate of $30,000 per token. This proposal envisioned XRP as a global currency, supported by major governmental institutions.\n\nHowever, doubts surround this idea. Ripple\u2019s CTO, David Schwartz, has criticized the proposal, questioning its legitimacy. Some key figures within the XRP community, like John Deaton, have distanced themselves from the idea, viewing it as unlikely. Yet, XRP supporter Eri believes the proposal is worth investigating.\n\nI can't wait for the FRAUD story on a $30k per token Federal Reserve buyback of #XRP. \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/o2R7IK1Qkz \u2014 \ud83c\udf38Crypto Eri \ud83e\ude9dCarpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) January 4, 2024\n\nTerrett\u2019s Comments Spark a Discussion\n\nDespite the proposal fizzling out due to negative reactions and being dismissed as improbable, Terrett\u2019s recent mention has reignited interest in this theory within the XRP community. Pro-XRP figures, including Eri, have shown anticipation for Terrett\u2019s potential investigation. However, uncertainty looms over the seriousness of Terrett\u2019s statements and whether they signal a genuine investigative endeavor or are merely a response to ongoing discussions and criticisms within the crypto community."

        "title": "Ethereum's liquid staking protocols experience remarkable growth, surpassing $27 billion in value - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The landscape of liquid staking protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem has experienced significant growth over the past six months, indicating a robust upward trend in both the volume and value of Ether (ETH) deposits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance in liquid staking\n\nAs of January 6, 2024, Ethereum-based liquid staking protocols have locked in 12.31 million ETH, a substantial increase from the 10.16 million recorded on July 5, 2023. This rise translates to an impressive value growth from $19.69 billion to $27.49 billion. Lido Finance, a leading player in this domain, has also seen a dramatic rise in Ethereum holdings, amassing 1.7 million ETH since July 2023, holding over 75% of the total deposited Ethereum.\n\nLiquid staking protocols are revolutionizing how investors interact with Ethereum, allowing them to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity. This is achieved through derivative tokens like Lido\u2019s STETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s RETH, representing the staked capital and accrued rewards. These tokens can be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nKey players and market dynamics\n\nThe past six months have witnessed notable shifts in the liquid staking space. Lido\u2019s Ethereum reserves have increased by 21.16%, accounting for a staggering 9.26 million ETH. On the other hand, Rocket Pool\u2019s holdings have grown from 810,502 ETH to 1.09 million. Binance\u2018s liquid staking protocol has exponentially increased, with its Ethereum holdings skyrocketing by 981%, from 72,077 ETH to 779,785 ETH.\n\nThis period also observed shifts in market positions among various protocols. Coinbase\u2019s staking service, previously the second-largest, has now fallen to the fifth position. New entrants like Mantle and Swell have risen in the ranks, holding 174,532 and 142,725 ETH, respectively. Stakewise has seen a modest increase in its Ethereum holdings, from 91,910 to 97,199 ETH.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nThe addition of 2.15 million ETH, valued at $4.83 billion, across the top 27 liquid staking protocols signifies a strong and growing interest in Ethereum-based liquid staking. This trend highlights the increasing trust and participation in Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanisms, which is a crucial aspect of the network\u2019s security and functionality.\n\nEthereum\u2019s leading position in the liquid staking market is a testament to its robust ecosystem and the confidence it commands among investors. As Ethereum continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, the liquid staking sector is likely to witness further growth and diversification, playing a vital role in the broader DeFi landscape.\n\nThe momentum behind Ethereum and its liquid staking protocols shows no signs of abating, pointing to a vibrant and dynamic future for Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem. As investors continue to seek avenues for passive income generation within the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking protocols stand out as a compelling and increasingly popular option."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts have been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2018s recent market movements as large investors, often referred to as \u201cwhales,\u201d have acquired a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) in the past month.\n\nWith over 410,000 ETH worth nearly $1 billion in total, this development has sparked interest and speculation within the crypto community.\n\nEthereum whales are on the move\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ethereum whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency, have been active in accumulating more ETH over the past month.\n\nThe data suggests that these whales have collectively acquired over 410,000 ETH, which currently translates to nearly $1 billion in market value.\n\nMarket impact and implications\n\nThis substantial influx of capital into Ethereum has not gone unnoticed in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced increased demand and rising prices as a result of these whale purchases.\n\nWhile some might view this as a positive sign of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future, it has also raised questions and concerns regarding potential market manipulation.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Ethereum by Whales has led to a debate within the crypto community about the motives behind these purchases. Some argue that whales are accumulating ETH as a long-term investment, anticipating future price appreciation.\n\nOthers speculate that these large purchases could be part of a broader strategy, potentially aimed at influencing the market.\n\nMarket dynamics and whales\u2019 influence\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature has always been one of its defining features. However, the concentration of a significant portion of ETH in the hands of a few whales raises questions about the extent of their influence over the market.\n\nLarge-scale transactions by whales can trigger volatility and affect price movements, leading to concerns about market stability and fairness.\n\nThe accumulation of substantial amounts of cryptocurrency by whales has caught the attention of regulators worldwide. Governments and financial authorities are increasingly focusing on the cryptocurrency space, aiming to establish regulations that ensure fair and transparent market practices. The actions of Ethereum whales may contribute to the urgency of these regulatory efforts.\n\nThe recent activity of Ethereum whales has led to divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community. Some investors view these large purchases as a positive sign of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s technology and its potential to disrupt traditional finance. Others remain cautious, emphasizing the need for transparency and equitable market practices.\n\nMarket reaction and price trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced fluctuations in response to the significant whale activity. While the overall trend has been upward, the market has witnessed periods of heightened volatility. This dynamic underscores the potential impact that large-scale transactions by whales can have on Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nThe debate surrounding Ethereum whales and their influence on the cryptocurrency market is likely to continue. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves and matures, it is essential to address concerns related to market manipulation, transparency, and investor protection.\n\nThis ongoing discussion highlights the need for a robust regulatory framework to ensure the long-term sustainability and integrity of the cryptocurrency market."

        "title": "Celsius Prepares to Unstake $470M in Ethereum, Bringing Hope to Customers - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Eligible Celsius creditors are expected to start receiving their compensation in the coming days after months of unnecessary pain caused by Alex Mashinsky and his team.\n\nThe withdrawal of over 200k ETH should not have a significant impact on the price action and network security as there are more than 28 million staked by over 900k validators.\n\nCelsius Network, one of the crypto firms that went down during the 2022 winter and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, is in the final stages of its restructuring plan.\n\nThe distressed cryptocurrency lending platform has in the recent past been detailing the process to repay the eligible creditors. Already, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has charged former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky for falsely promising a safe investment through unregulated securities. Nonetheless, Mashinsky has been a free man through a $40 million bail with the trial scheduled to happen in September 2024.\n\nThe collapse of Celsius sent shockwaves through the entire cryptocurrency industry as the company had lent out over $8 billion and had around 1.7 million customers at the time of its bankruptcy. With a $1.2 billion deficit and $167 million in cash at the time of bankruptcy, Celsius was forced to liquidate some of its assets along the way including GK8 digital asset custody platform.\n\nCelsius Creditors to Receive Payment Soon\n\nAfter months of waiting, Celsius creditors should start receiving their funds in the coming days after the distressed crypto firm announced on Friday that the unstaking of Ether has been initiated. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, almost a third of the ETH in the pending withdrawal queue belongs to Celsius.\n\nMoreover, Celsius expects to receive a total of 206,300 ETH, which is worth approximately $470 million at the current exchange rate. Meanwhile, Celsius announced that eligible creditors will receive in-kind distributions of Bitcoin and Ether in the coming days as outlined in the court process.\n\nNotably, Celsius has accrued a significant amount of Ether through the staking process, which will be used to offset some of the costs incurred during the restructuring process.\n\nCelsius will unstake existing ETH holdings, which have provided valuable staking rewards income to the estate, to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nIn the future, Celsius intends to only focus on Bitcoin mining, which is in accordance with the restructuring plan. The company announced last November that the new mining entity dubbed NewCo will be publicly traded and intends to retain some of the assets.\n\nETH Market Impact and Price Analysis\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has grown over the years to a mature industry capable of providing liquidity to institutional investors via over-the-counter process (OTC). However, the significant Celsius unstaking of Ether in the coming days will involve an in-kind distribution of assets, thus giving creditors the will to sell at their will through different web3 channels.\n\nAs a result, Ether\u2019s selling pressure could significantly increase in the coming weeks amid high-impact news from the spot Bitcoin ETF decision in the United States.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ETH/USD on the daily time frame has been forming a reversal pattern, with a possible triple top and a bearish divergence on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). In case of a possible selloff triggered by the Celsius unstaking, ETH/USD could find a solid support range between $1,900 and $2,100. Moreover, ETH has experienced significant resistance around $2,433 and has dropped about 5 percent in the past week to trade at $2250\n\n."

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2: historical record for $21 billion TVL - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The total value locked (TVL) of Ethereum has recently reached its all-time high, recording an impressive figure of 21.16 billion dollars. This represents a significant increase of 333% compared to the beginning of January 2023.\n\nDespite the significant increase in TVL in Layer-2, Ethereum prices remain stable at $2,245, marking a 54% decrease compared to the peak recorded in November 2021, when they reached $4,878. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nTVL: Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 reaches a new all-time high\n\nAs anticipated, according to the data provided by the L2beat platform, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystem has recently reached a new record in Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching $21.16 billion on January 3rd.\n\nThis figure even exceeds the amount locked in all decentralized finance protocols (DeFi) in January 2021.\n\nThe TVL layer-2 has experienced a 34% increase in the last month, reaching the current level of 20.8 billion dollars, positioning itself just below the recorded peak.\n\nDuring the last year, the TVL layer-2 has recorded a significant growth of 333%, starting from around 4.8 billion dollars at the beginning of January 2023.\n\nIn comparison, DeFi markets have seen a 38% increase in terms of TVL during the same period, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nOn January 4th, the analyst Metaquant interpreted this scenario as a rotation from layer-1 ecosystems to layer-2 solutions on Ethereum. Solana and Avalanche, competitors of Ethereum, have recorded increases in recent weeks, but now they seem to be slowing down.\n\nIn addition to the TVL layer-2 peak, there is a constant increase in daily active addresses, level 2 fees, and market capitalization of level 2 stablecoins.\n\nHowever, ETH prices have remained in the background due to the focus elsewhere, as highlighted by the analyst who predicts:\n\n\u201cOnce the price of (ETH) increases, everyone will return to Ethereum and layer-2 solutions.\u201d\n\nFinally, the data shows that Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 TVL surpasses the sum of all other layer-1 chains, as reported by analyst \u201cJosh,\u201d who highlights the future return of investors to Ethereum and layer-2 solutions.\n\nArbitrum One leading the Layer-2 market\n\nAnyway, it is Arbitrum One that confirms itself as the market leader with about 10 billion dollars of TVL, holding almost 50% of the market share.\n\nOptimism (OP Mainnet) instead ranks second with $5.8 billion in TVL and a market share of 28.7%.\n\nThe other layer-2 platforms are relatively smaller, with Metis Andromeda and Base occupying the third and fourth positions respectively, each with around 750 million dollars of TVL.\n\nPectra and all the upcoming evolutions of the Ethereum network\n\nOn January 4th, during the first All Core Devs Execution (ACDE) meeting of 2024, Ethereum developers outlined the path of Pectra in empowering decentralization through the implementation of Verkle Trees.\n\nDuring the session, the dates for the test network distributions of Dencun were established, with the initial launch on Goerli set for January 17th. Subsequent distributions will follow on Sepolia and Holesky on January 30th and February 7th respectively.\n\nDespite concerns from some dissidents regarding the short 13-day time window to make changes post Goerli, the next ACDE call is scheduled for January 18th.\n\nThis will provide flexibility in planning in case adjustments to the approach are needed.\n\nIn addition, an Ethereum customer provider tweeted the following:\n\n\u201cMost other clients believe that the timing, although ambitious, is acceptable.\u201d\n\nThey are waiting for the release of the clients for Goerli in the next week, followed by Sepolia/Holesky in the week of January 22nd, provided that everything goes as planned.\n\nDencun, through the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, aims to significantly reduce transaction fees for Layer 2 rollups by replacing call data with lower gas-consuming blobs.\n\nThis step will have a positive impact on the availability of data on Layer 2, contributing to shaping the future of the Ethereum network."

        "content": "Solana, one of the biggest competitors of Ethereum is again in highlights. This time, its co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s post got all the attention, expressing confidence that the blockchain can address growing Decentralized App (DApp) demand without layer-2 solutions.\n\nYakovenko Found Layer-2 Solution Irrelevant\n\nThe blockchain prominently becomes a subject of discussion, mainly in terms of adding layer-2 solutions. Yakovenko took the X platform to make it clear and uncovered the blockchain\u2019s core mission.\n\n\u201cAdding a Layer-2 solution to the Solana blockchain is possible but irrelevant\u201d, said Yakovenko.\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s design operates on the hybrid consensus mechanism, fulfilling all the requirements related to scalability without depending on additional layers.\n\nDespite layer-2 solutions, the blockchain is heavily focused on its mission to synchronize a global atomic state machine. Yakovenko is confident that the blockchain is potent enough to fulfill the rising DApps demands with a layer-1 solution. With this focus, Anatoly sidelines the role of layer-2 options.\n\nAnatoly hopes to achieve the goal, as quickly as the laws of physics allow.\n\n\u201cLayer-2 solutions like side chains and zero-knowledge proofs have enough potential, but don\u2019t contribute to blockchain\u2019s atomic global state machine\u201d, Anatoly explained.\n\nThe atomic global state machine system, on the other hand, focuses on boosting blockchain efficiency and scalability. However, Yakovenko hasn\u2019t restricted the developer\u2019s team to working with the layer-2 solutions.\n\nThe only purpose of the blockchain is to offer a high-performance and low-cost environment for DApps.\n\nEthereum And Layer-2 Solution\n\nEthereum, one of the most powerful blockchain platforms heavily relies on layer-2 solutions, mainly to resolve issues associated with the high transaction fees and congestion. Layer 2 solution emerging as a good option in terms of the potential to offload transactions from the main blockchain and maintain compatibility with the smart contacts.\n\nOptimism and Arbitrium best represent layer-2 solutions\u2019 potentials and advantages.\n\nIn addition, L2Beat facts represent, the combined total value locked (TVL) of around $20 Billion for layer-2 solutions. Also, On January 5, Arbitrium managed around $10 Billion in assets, making the layer-2 solution more qualified for Ethereum scaling.\n\nThe blockchain is all prepared to ride with a layer-2 solution and decided not to increase the gas fees from the 30 Million Gwei level. It was decided during the developer call.\n\nIn addition, the adaptation of the layer-2 solution will no doubt enhance the user experience by providing low gas fees, and more transactions per second with all transactions irreversible registered on the mainnet.\n\nAnalysts concluded the delay in on-chain scaling initiatives for off-chain methods, mainly sidechain and off-chain rails.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not provide any financial, investment, or other advice.

        "title": "New ICO Token's +950000% ROI Potential Makes BONK, ETH, & Shiba Inu Traders Invest Fast & Big - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Bonk Inu (BONK), Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Tether (USDT), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) cryptocurrency traders appear to all agree on one thing currently; Mollars initial Coin offering has a +10,000% ROI prediction that\u2019s worth learning about.\n\nMentioned as the New Bitcoin by crypto media giant CryptoPotato and the top ICO for 2024, according to ICOHolder.com\u2019s hot list, Mollars is the future for Ethereum-blockchain users. It\u2019s a solution that can\u2019t be ignored by the intelligence of millions of crypto wallets on the ERC-20 network. No longer will crypto traders lose money in horrendous fees to buy Bitcoin as Mollars will make it so Ethereum-Blockchain users can have a store-of-value token with low minting numbers on-chain.\n\nMollars is an Intelligent Solution For Ethereum Users\n\nWhile to the novice, saving money on $BTC cross-chain swapping may not seem much. However, Bitcoin has seen fees in 4th quarter 2023 that were the worst in 2 years. Last November, the average Bitcoin trader lost nearly $39 per $BTC transaction. The founding coin\u2019s fees have gotten so bad, they now exceed all other blockchains according to a report from DailyCoin.\n\nApparently this issue was analyzed long before it was reported. And Ethereum crypto guru plotted the creation of the \u201cMollars Saves Dollar\u201d movement and $MOLLARS token concept to rid Ethereum-blockchain users of the hassle of cross-chain swaps for the $BTC and loss of major money to fees. That movement & concept materialized into the launch of the Mollars.com initial coin offering, which offers the $MOLLARS token in the presale stage to foster infrastructure and stability for the New Bitcoin for Ethereum users.\n\nTether (USDT), Ethereum (ETH), & Bonk Inu (BONK) Traders Buying The Most Mollars ICO Tokens\n\nTraders who buy now via Mollars.com private exchange, get the new ERC-20 token at the discounted rate of US$0.30. This is half the price of what it will cost on it\u2019s first public crypto exchange, US$0.62.\n\nThe ROI yields of just over +100% are appetizing to any investor. As word spreads through the crypto newsphere, Investors are coming from all cryptocurrency groups. However, the most notable investments are coming from Ethereum (ETH), Bonk Inu (BONK), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency holders. Tether holders most notably perhaps, have seen a spike of over +900% in sales in the last 7 days. That group is followed by Ethereum & Bonk Inu traders who have risen by nearly +600% each.\n\nInvestor buys are likely to keep rising as predictions are released by different blog analysts and independent sources. Mollars tokens will be limited to 10,000,000 [million] tokens total supply for eternity. This stat is particularly appetizing to crypto investors because that is half of the supply of Bitcoin [21-million], a crypto coin that\u2019s yielded over +20,000,000% returns on investments to ICO investors of 2011. With the $MOLLARS token offering an intelligent solution to a well-noted issue for $BTC investors on the Ethereum-blockchain, it\u2019s almost certain thousands will fancy the \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019 over the old.\n\nWildcard Prediction Suggests ROI Yields Of +950,000% Long-Term\n\nLong term, if $MOLLARS were to follow the trajectory of $Bitcoin, a simple & long-shot analysis would suggest the token could return nearly +950,000% ROI.\n\nThis wildcard prediction comes from the formula of Bitcoin having a +20,000,000% ROI yield on 21-million tokens. That yield is 1-million percent less than the total tokens, over 13 years. This means that in the same time frame, 10-million Mollars tokens could have a +9,500,000% yield \u2014 simply reverse engineering the logistics of the $BTC yields and applying it to Mollars.\n\nIt may sound crazy, but Bitcoin was crazy to most in 2011. At US$0.30 cents, it\u2019s much better to lose $3 on 10 coins than miss the next Bitcoin for certain.\n\nOther key statistics about the Mollars token revolve around its decentralization. The ERC-20 token will have no owner. Also, the full minted supply will be sold on exchange and no one will be gifted tokens from the supply ever. The $MOLLARS token anyone holds, including founder or developers, will have to be purchased in the ICO or once on public exchange, fair trade to all.\n\nThe total fundraising goal of the Mollars initial coin offering is US$2,000,000 according to the official Whitepapers. If that hard cap is reached, half of funds will go towards the token\u2019s CEX liquidity pool. The other half will go towards a token culture catalyzing web3 product\u2019s development, marketing, brand value and equity building, and other long-term infrastructure needs that will be pre-set and run in autonomy before and after CEX listing.\n\nOnce the $2-Million-dollar hardcap is met, the Mollars ICO will end or on the deadline of May 2024. Analysts across various websites predict this token presale will likely end early based on current buyer growth however.\n\nOnly 4-million tokens will be sold at the discounted rate during the $MOLLARS initial coin offering. That is 40% of the total token supply being minted [ever] of the store-of-value token. If sold-out, it leaves only 6-million tokens for the public crypto trading exchanges to sell. A sell-out of the 4-million presale tokens during the 6 months of this ICO makes it highly plausible that the remaining 6-million tokens could be sold out during the 7 months to remain in 2024 after the ICO\u2019s official deadline.\n\nIf sold-out in 2024, any prediction above from crypto analysts about $MOLLARS token could materialize, including the yields of +950,000% ROI. In layman\u2019s terms, that\u2019s a 950x on initial coin offering investments.\n\nBiggest Investors Thus Far In Mollars ICO\n\nNearly 100,000 $Mollars tokens have already been purchased via Mollars.cc. The daily buy averages are increasing weekly.\n\nThe top buyers of the ICO to date, according to the Initial Coin Offering\u2019s Tether (USDT) & Ethereum (ETH) transaction addresses, both purchased over US$2,000 of the mollars token.\n\nOn Friday, one Ethereum trader invested 1.15 $ETH into $MOLLARS. This one transaction amounts to US$2,575 or ~8584 Mollars tokens. If the investor holds long term and the \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019 leaps to 950x the current value, their 1.15 Ethereum tokens would yield a staggering $2.44-million-dollar return on investment.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 3rd, a Tether (USDT) trader decided to start their New Year\u2019s holiday by making a potential life changing investment of over US$2,000 as well. This is the second biggest investment spotted on the Mollars transaction list. This 2nd place trader invested $2,050 worth of $USDT in a total of 3 transactions \u2014 $1000, $1000, and $50. Their investment of 2,050 USDT will net a profit of a whopping $1.94-Million-dollars if the investors hold long term and the wildcard prediction is found to be true.\n\nCrypto Shrimps & Dolphins but Smart Investors\n\nRegardless, both trades will have the chance to double their investments in a few months once this ICO launches on a public crypto exchange by May of 2024. Also, for both traders to have thousands of dollars to invest, which is more than many people have in their bank account to their name in 2024, they must have some sort of financial intelligence to have obtained such amounts for investment.\n\nSee the latest in trader discussion about Mollars on the official subreddit community, r/MollarsToken. This is open to the public and a great way to get unmoderated thoughts from real cryptocurrency investments.\n\nGet the latest sales stats on this dollar-saving Bitcoin-alternative\u2019s token pre-sale or purchase token via Mollars.cc."
