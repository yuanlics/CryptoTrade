Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been a focal point for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, and its latest chart is a pivotal moment for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As ETH approaches a well-known resistance level that has stymied its progress multiple times in the past, the crypto community is watching with bated breath to see if this test will result in a definitive breakthrough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe resistance level in question has acted like a ceiling for Ethereum's price, capping its upward momentum on several occasions. Now, as ETH inches closer to this barrier once again, the stakes are high. A successful break above this level could confirm a bullish trend, potentially propelling the price to new highs.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests that if Ethereum manages to sustain a breakout above this resistance, we could witness an accelerated move toward the next major psychological level. The key will be a strong closing above the resistance on significant volume, which would likely attract more buyers into the market, further fueling the upward trajectory.\n\nAn interesting aspect to consider is the market's reaction to recent news events, such as the departure of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) from Binance. Contrary to some expectations, CZ's stepping down has not had a detrimental impact on the market. Instead, it may have alleviated some regulatory concerns, removing a potential risk factor and possibly contributing to a healthier market environment for major assets like Ethereum.\n\nThe Fibonacci extension levels and previous high points could serve as markers for where the price might head. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break through, it may retest lower support levels, but the overall trend still appears to be leaning toward the positive, given the recent market resilience."

        "title": "Ethereum: Whales make themselves known amidst price rise - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "ETH whales are slowly accumulating.\n\nThe altcoin can be said to be undervalued.\n\nAddresses holding 10,000 Ethereum [ETH] tokens, and more have started topping up the amount of ETH held in the portfolio, AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of Glassnode\u2019s data revealed. As of the 9th of November, 1064 addresses held 10,000 ETH or more.\n\nBut at the time of writing, the count had increased. Although the rate at which the number is climbing seemed slow, it affected ETH\u2019s price. At press time, ETH changed hands at $2,036. This value amounted to a 4.46% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nBuying is not yet for retail\n\nRecently, there have been complaints from market players about ETH\u2019s slow movement compared to other altcoins. So, the whale accumulation, alongside the increase in price, may have brought some sort of relief to ETH retail holders.\n\nShould the large accumulation continue, then ETH might stabilize above $2,000. In a case where the accumulation becomes rapid, the altcoin might be able to reclaim $2,100. But is this cohort following the same path as the whales?\n\nOn evaluating the balance of addresses in the 1-100 Ethereum cohort, AMBCrypto found out that a large part had refrained from accumulating. A situation of this sort implies that retail Ethereum holders are not bullish on the short-term price action.\n\nFurthermore, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score had risen to 0.40. This metric is a function of the difference between the market cap and the realized cap. It is also responsible for indicating if a cryptocurrency is undervalued or overvalued compared to its fair value.\n\nWhen the MVRV Z-Score is above seven, it means that investors have made a lot of profit. When the metric is below zero, it indicates that the market is bleeding. Therefore, ETH\u2019s press time MVRV ratio showed that the altcoin is close to being undervalued.\n\nLittle by little, ETH moves\n\nSo, long-term ETH holders have the opportunity to become profitable, as long as the cryptocurrency remains in their portfolio. For the short term, one metric that could be valuable to evaluate is the Seller Exhaustion Constant.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nUsing the 30-day price volatility, the Seller Exhaustion Constant detects if a cryptocurrency has the potential to create high losses or otherwise. At the time of writing, the metric was 0.055. A close look at the chart below showed that it had exited the danger zone (red) at the time of writing.\n\nTherefore, ETH\u2019s price at $2,000 could be considered healthy for buying. Also, the altcoin may resist a significant plunge in as much as the Seller Exhaustion Constant does not fall to the reading it was around the first few weeks in October."

        "title": "Exploring Ethereum: a comprehensive look at ETH and its ecosystem - OKX",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered what Ethereum is and how it's different from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized network of computers worldwide that follows a set of rules known as the Ethereum protocol. This network serves as a platform for creating and using applications, communities, organizations, and digital assets, allowing anyone to do so without relying on a centralized power. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), pays for network activities, including the computation necessary to build and run decentralized apps (DApps) and organizations on Ethereum.\n\nThat's only scratching the surface about Ethereum, and in this article, we take a close look at the ecosystem, its native token, and how Ethereum is impacting the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nTL;DR\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows smart contracts and DApps with its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), used for transactions.\n\nETH, launched in 2015, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is essential for Ethereum network operations.\n\nEthereum's smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, facilitating automated, secure, and efficient transactions and applications without intermediaries.\n\nThe Merge has caused Ethereum to move to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which has significantly affected ETH issuance and energy consumption. This shift has had a massive impact on the network's sustainability and ETH's economic model.\n\nDespite challenges like competition from other blockchains, scalability issues, high transaction fees, regulatory risks, and security threats, Ethereum's future looks bright. This is due to numerous technological enhancements and advances in token standards.\n\nWhat's Ethereum and how does it differ from Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are fundamental cryptocurrencies that have helped accelerate the transformation of blockchain. However, the technologies are significantly different in their aim and operation. Ethereum uses blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, but also serves as a platform for DApps by applying smart contracts. These contracts are programmed to execute the conditions of an agreement automatically \u2014 an action that's directly included in the code.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, was created as a decentralized alternative to fiat currency. It aims to be a store of value and a medium of exchange. Blockchain technology creates a decentralized accounting ledger for Bitcoin transactions, removing the need for a single authoritative body.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum's blockchain is built to do even more. Through this platform, developers can build and launch various applications. This can be anything from video games to intricate financial systems. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is used to execute and manage transactions within this environment.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has become a base for thousands of crypto token projects, each using the technology to power their own DApps.\n\nWhat ultimately separates Ethereum from Bitcoin is its technical basis. Ethereum has a faster block time than Bitcoin, meaning it can process transactions in less time. This is necessary for applications that demand rapid transaction speeds.\n\nFor many, the comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin is rooted in the distinction between their respective capabilities. Where Bitcoin is mainly a medium of exchange, Ethereum is more of a development platform with added features like smart contracts. This has resulted in a significant market cap for cryptocurrencies operating on decentralized blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is ETH?\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin created ETH, which has since become the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value behind Bitcoin. Unlike conventional currencies, ETH isn't regulated by any governing body. The token is a tradable asset class on multiple crypto exchanges.\n\nETH stands out in the crypto space because it's not just a medium of exchange or a store of value. ETH is used to run operations on the Ethereum network, such as executing smart contracts and DApps. To perform these processes, users must pay a fee in Ether, often called \"gas,\" given to miners to incentivize them to validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nETH plays an essential part in the maturing DeFi environment, which aims to reproduce and modernize traditional financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without intermediaries. ETH is widely employed as collateral, a form of currency, and a unit of account in various economic protocols in DeFi.\n\nTraders and users hold ETH for various reasons: some \"hodl\" it long term, speculating on the growth of the Ethereum network and the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Others use it more actively for trading and accessing the network's capabilities.\n\nTo sum up, ETH is an essential component of the Ethereum network and the basis of the DeFi space.\n\nHow do Ethereum's smart contracts work?\n\nEthereum is renowned for its smart contracts. These contracts don't follow conventional guidelines. Instead, their terms are encoded into computer code. Smart contracts are located on the Ethereum blockchain, an open system that guarantees the underlying action or agreement will be carried out without disruption, control, deception, or outside influence.\n\nSmart contract functionality\n\nImagine a smart contract as a vending machine. When you choose a product (a digital deal or contract), you pay the necessary amount of ETH and the machine (the smart agreement) will instantly execute the deal in line with the encoded requirements. This system removes the need for intermediaries such as lawyers or brokers, which minimizes expenses and boosts effectiveness.\n\nThe power of automation in blockchain\n\nWhen the set parameters are fulfilled, smart contracts can autonomously enforce and complete the obligations of a deal. This way, these contracts can automate the administrative and transactional processes. This capability is game-changing in areas like finance, real estate, and legal operations, where complex agreements are common.\n\nDApps and beyond\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain serves as the base for various DApps. These applications are hosted on a peer-to-peer network instead of a single computer. The advantages of using DApps built on Ethereum are bolstered by blockchain technology's security, reliability, and transparency. From DeFi to NFTs, the range of applications is rapidly increasing.\n\nEthereum's smart contracts provide a reliable, clear, and efficient approach to supporting digital purchases and arrangements, creating change that could influence many industries positively.\n\nWhat are the real-world applications of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum's most notable use is in DeFi, which encompasses smart contract-powered loans and other financial activities. Ethereum stands out because of its decentralization, transparency, automation, and immutability, making it suitable for many different applications across various industries.\n\nBanking, crowdfunding, and web hosting are just some of the ways Ethereum has changed how people transact and interact. For example, Ethereum offers new ways of processing loans, borrowing, and trading digital assets.\n\nSmart contracts on Ethereum can be used to set up trustless and secure crowdfunding initiatives. At the same time, prediction markets employ the technology to create decentralized platforms for forecasting the results of events. Ethereum has also been used to create decentralized web services, spotlighting its influence in multiple domains.\n\nEthereum's blockchain technology supports various real-world applications across different industries, and several companies are actively leveraging its capabilities:\n\nTake-Two: In August 2023, the publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto gaming franchise announced the development of Sugartown, a Web3 game built on Ethereum. Sugartown's plot follows three agricultural animals that, by chance, open a wormhole from another world to Sugartown, allowing odd creatures known as Ora\u2019s to enter the city. Using their inventiveness, the Ora\u2019s turn Sugartown into a lively destination that offers enjoyable activities and amusements.\n\nING : The Dutch bank has been involved in multiple Ethereum-based projects. One example is Komgo, which aims to optimize trading documents. ING is also a part of Fnality, a payments settlement consortium, and has been working on Bamboo, a bilateral letter of credit.\n\nTD Ameritrade: As a brokerage firm, TD Ameritrade has embraced Ethereum by supporting ErisX, a CFTC-regulated spot exchange that leverages Ethereum smart contracts. What's more, the firm allows customers to trade Ethereum futures through the platform.\n\nThe above examples show how Ethereum's blockchain can enable secure, open, and effective trading of digital assets, the production of NFTs, and underpin a variety of financial activities.\n\nHow does Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake affect ETH?\n\nEthereum's shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), known as \"The Merge,\" has had a profound impact on the issuance and economics of ETH:\n\nPre-merge issuance:\n\nMiners issued ~13,000 ETH/day under PoW.\n\nAnnual inflation rate was approximately 4.61%.\n\nPost-merge issuance:\n\nIssuance reduced to validators issuing ~1,700 ETH/day under PoS.\n\nAnnual inflation rate now approximately 0.52%.\n\nTotal new ETH issuance down by ~88%.\n\nSustainability:\n\nThe Merge eliminated energy-intensive mining activities.\n\nValidators require a smaller reward, contributing to lower issuance.\n\nETH burning:\n\nTransactions require a base fee that gets burned, removing ETH from circulation.\n\nOn days of high network demand, the burning can offset the daily ETH issuance, potentially leading to deflation.\n\nValidator economics:\n\nValidators are incentivized to withdraw rewards over 32 ETH.\n\nWithdrawal limits are in place to maintain network stability.\n\nThe switch to PoS has significantly cut ETH's inflation rate and enhanced the blockchain's sustainability. The supply and demand for ETH is now affected by less issuance and the burning of transaction fees, which may sometimes result in net-zero inflation or deflation.\n\nWhat are the risks and challenges facing Ethereum and ETH?\n\nMany believe the risks and challenges that could affect Ethereum and ETH center on issues with functionality and value.\n\nCompetition from other blockchains\n\nNetworks like Solana and Cardano, which offer faster and cheaper transactions, are emerging as competitors that could potentially erode Ethereum's market share. However, one positive from increased competitive pressure is the potential for fresh innovation.\n\nScalability and storage\n\nAs Ethereum's blockchain increases, it's faced with scalability issues. The need for large storage capacity is growing faster than for Bitcoin. If this need is not managed effectively, it could result in the network exceeding the available resources which could cause problems with performance.\n\nHigh transaction fees\n\nEthereum's network can be too costly for transactions with little monetary value due to high fees. This could restrict its use to only those transactions with higher values, potentially impeding its day-to-day utility.\n\nRegulatory risks\n\nRegulations surrounding the DeFi and NFT segments running on Ethereum could change. If these segments are prohibited or limited in their use of Ethereum, it could diminish demand for transactions on the network.\n\nSecurity threats\n\nEthereum's layered architecture is susceptible to a variety of attacks:\n\nReplay attacks : hackers can copy and use transaction details again if crucial factors such as timestamps and nonces aren't handled correctly.\n\nFalse top-up attacks : errors in the confirmation process of tokens traded on platforms can result in the theft of possessions.\n\nHoneypot attacks : scam contracts that trick users into thinking they can steal ETH when in fact they lose it.\n\nShort URL attacks : bad input validation in exchanges can make transfer amounts look bigger than they are.\n\nAirdrop hunting attacks : these attacks involve the exploitation of airdrop functions to accumulate wealth illicitly.\n\nArbitrary storage writing attacks : the potential for attackers to change the data stored in smart contracts.\n\nGas exhaustion denial of service attacks: agreements that use up all the gas in a block, leaving no room for processing other transactions.\n\nWhat's the future outlook for Ethereum and ETH?\n\nA combination of market analysis, recent technological developments, and new innovations in token standards are shaping the future outlook for Ethereum and ETH.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nEthereum's price is predicted to hover between $1,800 and $1,900 throughout 2023, with resistance at $1,760 and potential dips to $1,600. The average trading price is expected to be around $1,880.75, and some analysts predict returns of around 5%. An ascending triangle technical trading setup indicates a bullish trend, suggesting Ethereum's rally could continue.\n\nBy November 2023, forecasts anticipate a value increase of 4.3%, reaching approximately $2,038.14. The market sentiment at November 2023 was neutral to bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a state of \"Greed.\"\n\nTechnological developments\n\nEthereum's transition from PoW to PoS with The Merge has reduced its energy consumption and improved security. Further upgrades, such as Danksharding, are expected to enhance Ethereum's scalability, speed, and efficiency, potentially strengthening its position in the crypto space.\n\nWith these technological advancements and a robust developer community, Ethereum is expected to sustain its growth and success.\n\nInnovation in token standards\n\nA notable innovation in 2023 is the introduction of ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts (TBA). This new Ethereum token standard significantly expands the functionality of NFTs, enabling them to act as their own smart contract accounts.\n\nThis overcomes the limitations of the previous ERC-721 standard by allowing for seamless interactions and improving the real-world usability of digital assets.\n\nEthscriptions\n\nEthscriptions are a new innovation on the Ethereum blockchain. They offer a way to share data \u2014 currently only images \u2014 without the need to create ERC-721 tokens. They differ from NFTs in their use of calldata for storage, lower creation and transfer costs, and their native hosting on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum Follow Protocol (EFP)\n\nBrantly Millegan proposed the EFP in spring 2023. The protocol allows users to follow each other natively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe vision is to build an essential social graph structure that's focused on Ethereum and can be incorporated with pre-existing platforms like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\n\nEthereum's future looks encouraging, bolstered by positive market movements, regular upgrades to its technology, and the emergence of new token standards that should help improve the platform's usefulness and features.\n\nBecause of this, Ethereum has the potential to keep growing and become an even more significant player in the world of digital currencies. As with all projects and tokens, it's wise to continue researching and following updates to Ethereum to stay up to speed with its developments.\n\nThe final word\n\nEthereum stands out as an influential platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, powered by Ether (ETH).\n\nThe shift from PoW to PoS with the arrival of The Merge demonstrates Ethereum's dedication to progress and sustainability. This is seen in the network's growing scope of uses beyond transactions, paving the way for further DeFi innovation. Despite certain obstacles, such as scalability issues and rival protocols, Ethereum continues to push forward and find new users.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve with new technological advancements, its impact on the digital and financial landscape is poised to grow. What future do you envision for Ethereum in this rapidly changing ecosystem?"

        "content": "What Can You Buy with Ethereum? 9 Best Things to Spend ETH on\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nEthereum is emerging as a popular payment method across online merchants. This leads us to the question \u2013 what can you buy with Ethereum?\n\nIn this guide, we discuss how to spend Ethereum and the top nine things to buy with this leading cryptocurrency.\n\nTop 9 Things to Buy with Ethereum\n\nHere are some of the best things to buy with Ethereum right now:\n\nLuxury Cars Presale Cryptocurrencies Luxury Watches Clothing and Accessories Property Gaming Consoles Electronic Gadgets Artwork Crypto Mining Equipment\n\nAll of the above items can be purchased on Crypto Emporium, one of the most popular online retailers for shopping with Ethereum.\n\nHow to Spend Ethereum \u2013 The Best Things to Buy With Cryptocurrency\n\nThe use cases for Ethereum are continually expanding. Not only can crypto holders trade their Ethereum tokens but also buy products and services.\n\nIn this section, we take a closer look at what you can buy with Ethereum in 2024.\n\n1. Luxury Cars\n\nThe global luxury car market is projected to reach $1.03 trillion by 2031. This increasing demand for luxury collectible cars has encouraged many automobile dealers to accept Ethereum payments. Today, it\u2019s possible to buy everything from budget cars to supercars with Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, customers are not required to find a local dealer to buy cars with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. Instead, online platforms like Crypto Emporium make the process simple. This eCommerce platform lists cars from 45 leading brands.\n\nThis covers a wide range of luxury and high-performance car brands, including Lamborghini, Tesla, Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, Citroen, Dacia, Toyota, and Ford. In other words, there is something for all budgets and preferences.\n\nFor example, we found the highly sought-out supercar, Bugatti Centodieci, listed for $13 million. Cost-effective models, such as the Dacia Sandero and Ford Focus, are also available for less than $25,000. On top of new models, Crypto Emporium also features a great collection of classic vintage cars.\n\nMoreover, Crypto Emporium will handle all the paperwork associated with the car purchase. The platform will also ship the car directly to the customer\u2019s doorstep. Altogether, Crypto Emporium offers buyers a convenient and hassle-free experience when buying cars with Ethereum.\n\n2. Presale Cryptocurrencies\n\nOne of the most significant use cases of Ethereum is to buy other digital assets. However, this doesn\u2019t mean ETH holders must engage in trading. Rather, those who prefer a long-term investment strategy can consider crypto presales.\n\nBy investing in presales, investors get early access to new cryptocurrency projects before they are launched on public exchanges. This means investors can get new digital tokens at a lower price and potentially reap high returns.\n\nBelow, we discuss the two best crypto presales to invest in right now.\n\nLove Hate Inu \u2013 Innovate Blockchain-Based Voting Platform\n\nLove Hate Inu is a new crypto project that allows users to vote on polls. It employs a vote-to-earn mechanism to reward voters for their contributions. In other words, users can generate revenue by simply sharing their opinions on social topics.\n\nThe Love Hate Inu platform is built on the Ethereum network. Its crypto-based infrastructure ensures that all poll entries are recorded on the blockchain \u2013 facilitating increased transparency and security. This way, Love Hate Inu will capitalize on the growth of the online software survey market.\n\nLove Hate Inu has also launched a native digital token, LHINU. Investors can use LHINU tokens to create polls on Love Hate Inu. LHINU will also serve as the reward currency for voters. Moreover, users are required to stake LHINU tokens to obtain voting rights on the platform.\n\nIn fact, the amount of LHINU tokens will determine the user\u2019s voting power. The Love Hate Inu presale was launched on March 7, 2023, and has already raised over $4.5 million. Currently, investors can buy Love Hate Inu tokens for $0.000115. The price will increase to $0.000145 once LHINU is listed on an exchange.\n\nDeeLance \u2013 Decentralized Recruiting Platform With Metaverse Integration\n\nDeeLance is another presale project that has taken the crypto world by storm. DeeLance is building a new decentralized platform connecting clients and freelancers. Crucially, this platform runs on blockchain technology and charges low fees to workers and employers.\n\nFor instance, platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr charge up to 20% in freelancing fees. On the other hand, freelancers on DeeLance will only pay 10% of the contract value. Deelance is also much cheaper for clients, especially when compared to Upwork and Fiverr.\n\nMoreover, the platform allows freelancers to submit work as NFTs.

And its growing adoption has also encouraged many merchants to accept ETH as payment.\n\nThere are many benefits to spending Ethereum online, which we discuss below.\n\nGlobal Currency\n\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency, which means that it can be used to make purchases from anywhere in the world. This is particularly useful for shopping, allowing people to buy products from other countries.\n\nIn fact, financial experts speculate that the popularity of blockchain payments could threaten SWIFT.\n\nAfter all, blockchain networks don\u2019t rely on third parties to process transactions. This means cryptocurrencies like Ethereum promote an efficient and decentralized borderless payment system.\n\nSpeedy Transactions\n\nUsing Ethereum also has a significant advantage over fiat money, as transactions can be processed within minutes. In fact, \u2018the Merge\u2019 has brought down the transaction time of Ethereum to just seconds.\n\nThis is much faster than the hours or even days fiat transactions can take to settle. Moreover, the timescales for fiat payments can be even slower when it comes to international transactions, making ETH a much more efficient alternative.\n\nHigh Security\n\nCompared to other payment methods, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum also offer greater security. Fiat payments require personal information, such as credit card details, which can put buyers at risk.\n\nFrom retailers\u2019 perspective, issues like chargebacks can occur, allowing payments to be revoked after products have been delivered.\n\nIn contrast, cryptocurrencies eliminate these concerns by making payments irreversible and not requiring personal identification for transactions.\n\nIs it Safe to Buy Things With Ethereum?\n\nMaking payments with Ethereum is highly secure because transactions are handled directly from one wallet to another. In other words, retailers and online stores don\u2019t have access to the private keys of the buyer\u2019s wallet. Instead, buyers are in full control of the transaction.\n\nThat being said, when considering how to spend Ethereum safely, crypto investors should do their due diligence. This is because not all platforms that accept Ethereum are reputable. Therefore, when considering where you can spend Ethereum, ensure the platform is credible.\n\nIn contrast, Crypto Emporium has been in business since 2018 and has served hundreds of thousands of customers. This is why Crypto Emporium ranks as the best place to spend Ethereum online.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize, we have explored what can you buy with Ethereum in 2024. Regarding retailers, Crypto Emporium is the preferable option when shopping with ETH.\n\nThis online store offers a huge range of goods, such as clothing, mobile phones, luxury watches, TVs, and even real estate.\n\nAdditionally, shoppers can claim 4% cashback on all purchases. We also like that Crypto Emporium has been in business since 2018 \u2013 so it has expertise in dealing with ETH purchases.\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat can I use my ETH for?\n\nEthereum can be used to buy thousands of items on Crypto Emporium \u2013 including watches, smartphones, TVs, and cars.\n\nWhat can I buy with Ethereum?\n\nWhen exploring what you can buy with Ethereum, consider Crypto Emporium\u2019s range of electronics, designer clothing, luxury watches, cars, and more.\n\nWhere to spend Ethereum?\n\nThe best place to spend Ethereum is Crypto Emporium, a popular eCommerce platform that offers a vast selection of quality products and services.\n\nCan I use Ethereum to buy things?\n\nYes, Ethereum can be used to buy products on Crypto Emporium, including artwork, smartphones, cameras, watches, designer bags, and more.\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "title": "DeFi gathering momentum, Ethereum Gas Fees Rising: Why Is Uniswap (UNI) Stuck? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum is picking up momentum based mainly on how gas fees have been trending in the first three weeks of November, data from Kaiko shows. Even so, despite Uniswap (UNI) spearheading the revival, looking at the gas attributed to its activities over this period, UNI prices remain stagnant below $5.6, with bulls failing to edge higher, breaking to new 2023 highs.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Rising, DeFi Revival?\n\nAccording to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the average gas fees on Ethereum hit multi-month highs last week. The platform expressly notes that the primary driver has been Uniswap\u2019s activities, reading from the rising transaction volumes from meme coins, including GROK. This, in turn, pushed block space demand higher, increasing gas fees.\n\nGas fees remain volatile but generally higher in the first three weeks of November. As of November 20, Ycharts data shows that the average cost of sending a transaction stood at 45.13 Gwei, nearly 100% from November 19, when it was at 24.84 Gwei. This is a significant jump from 17.66 Gwei in late October 2023.\n\nGas fees and how ETH and DeFi token prices react are directly correlated as DeFi and other on-chain activities like non-fungible token (NFT) minting and trading rise; gas fees usually expand in trending markets.\n\nAccordingly, the recent expansion in gas fees could suggest that the markets could be preparing for a leg up, and tokens of critical protocols, including Uniswap or Aave, could benefit.\n\nDeFi TVL Rising, But Uniswap Is Stuck Below $5.6\n\nAs of writing, the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi protocols stands at over $46.6 billion as of November 21, according to DeFiLlama. This increase is nearly $5 billion more than in early November and up from $37 billion in mid-October.\n\nEthereum remains a choice platform for deploying DeFi apps despite the relatively gas fees pinned to mainnet scaling challenges. The pioneer smart contract blockchain manages $25.4 billion in TVL, whereas Uniswap is one of the largest protocols with $3.216 billion in TVL.\n\nUNI prices are up 30% from mid-October when writing on November 21. However, bulls have been unable to break above the November highs at around $5.6. From the daily chart, trading volume, and thus participation, has been tapering even though prices have been edging higher.\n\nThis formation suggests that the uptrend was behind low momentum and sustainability. Technically, there could be more gains if there is a solid close above November highs with expanding volumes. In that case, UNI could expand, retesting 2023 highs of around $7.2.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Average daily transaction fees on Bitcoin (BTC) have flipped with Ethereum following a frenzy of Ordinals-related activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOn Nov. 20, the average daily transaction fee for Bitcoin stood at $10.34, while Ethereum transaction fees came to an average of $8.43, according to BitInfoChart data.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average daily trading fee notched a new six-month high on Nov.16, reaching a peak of $18.67, while Ethereum fees reached $7.90.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average daily fees have surged above Ethereum in the last five days. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe sudden uptick in Bitcoin transaction fees stems from a renewed market appetite for assets inscribed with the Ordinals Protocol \u2014 a tool for creating nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing a significant lull in activity between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23, Ordinals-based assets saw a drastic uptick beginning in late October, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe number of Ordinals inscriptions grew by over six million since late October. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals team launches nonprofit to grow protocol development\n\nSince Oct. 24, over six million Ordinal assets have been created, resulting in more than 800 BTC in fees \u2014 worth roughly $30 million \u2014 being redistributed to the network.\n\nThe uptick in Ordinals inscription activity compounded as ORDI \u2014 the second largest BRC-20 token by market cap \u2014 was listed on Binance on Nov. 7. The listing spurred a wider wave of BRC-20 buying activity from traders with the price of the ORDI token jumping by just over 50% on the day.\n\nAdditionally, on Nov. 17, the Ordinals-based project Taproot Wizards announced a $7.5 million seed round.\n\nMagazine: I spent a week working in VR.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Price Regain $3000 by Year End? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto market witnessed high volatility and selling pressure this week primarily attributed to the recent departure of Changpeng Zhao, from the CEO position of Binance Exchange. The sell-off occurred amid allegations from the Department of Justice (DoJ) accusing Binance and Zhao of non-compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering regulations. The ripple effect pushed the Ethereum coin to $1900 but an immediate counterattack from buyers has managed to regain the $2000 psychological mark.\n\nThe second largest crypto, down 1.04% in the last 24 hours to $2,077 and 20% over the last four weeks, swept liquidity at $1,930 as investors reacted to the developments at Binance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe former Binance CEO resigned following a $4.3 billion settlement agreement with the Department of Justice (DoJ) and on the condition that CZ pleads guilty to violating anti-money laundering regulations and does not hold an executive position at the company.\n\nAlthough CZ will be allowed to retain his stake in Binance, his exit has touched many who feel that his impact contributed immensely to the growth the crypto market has achieved over the years.\n\nRecommended for you: Binance Coin Price Prediction As BNB Nurtures 25% Bullish Move\n\nCan Ethereum Price Ignore Fed Minutes And Rally To $3,000?\n\nMarket participants are likely to rally behind Ethereum price, especially with the token trading above the $2,000 support. This move from $1,930 assures traders that Ether has a strong bullish outlook\u2014one that could trigger a larger breakout toward the coveted $3,000 level.\n\nSeveral indicators back the bullish theory, starting with a couple of golden cross patterns formed when the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) crossed above the 100-day EMA (blue) and the 200-EMA (purple) roughly two weeks ago.\n\nThe breakout to $3,000 will greatly depend on two key levels; the validity of support at $2,000 and weakening resistance at $2,130. A break above this hurdle is critical to the uptrend\u2019s continuation as it shows that ETH price is backed by increasing momentum.\n\nThis could also help invalidate the sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACd) indicator. With a bounce from the immediate support level at 50, the MACD could rebound thus, prompting another bullish breakout.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price outlook is surprisingly strong despite the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes of the November 1 meeting which revealed a collective take by the committee members that although the economy grew at a stronger rate in Q3 and remains resilient, inflation \u201cremained well above the Committee\u2019s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.\u201d\n\nAll participants echoed the need to retain the restrictive economic policy if the Fed is to achieve its long-term goal of returning inflation to the desired 2%. The committee agreed to focus on the current data to inform the decisions on interest rates in upcoming meetings.\n\nThere was no mention of when the Fed could consider rate cuts. However, it is unlikely the committee will hike interest rates again this year. Overall, the US economy is still under the microscope, with inflation said to be \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nThis outlook could be sufficiently bearish for risk asset classes like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, at the moment, a buoyant Ether has the potential to close the gap to $3,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum recently cleared the $2,000 price level again in the past 24 hours, as filings of Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US start to pile up. New on-chain data has shown a clearer sentiment among ETH investors, and it looks like many are getting ready for the long haul.\n\nData shows that the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges has dropped since the middle of last week to the lowest levels since 2018. That means fewer people are selling their Ethereum, and more are holding onto it or staking it.\n\nEthereum Exchange Supply Plummeting\n\nAlthough Ethereum is still down by 2.57% in the past seven days, the cryptocurrency is now trading above $2,000 after breaking the barrier on Monday, November 21. The recent surge would be the third time Ethereum crossed over the price level this month, as it\u2019s still looking to maintain a sustained price increase.\n\nThe recent spikes can be attributed to applications of Ethereum Spot ETFs piling up in front of the US SEC. BlackRock, in particular, joined the spot Ethereum ETF race on November 15th, igniting a price spike that pushed ETH past the $2,000 mark for the second time this month.\n\nIt would appear that investors reacted to BlackRock\u2019s ETH filing with the same sentiment they had in response to the investment company\u2019s spot Bitcoin filing. CryptoQuant\u2019s Exchange Reserves metric indicates that investor sentiment started to change around this period, as investors started to pull their assets off of exchanges into cold storage immediately after the news.\n\nAccording to the metric, the number of ETH deposited across crypto exchanges amounted to 14.5 million as of November 15. However, this figure dropped by 152,583 ETH in the days after to reach 14.3 million on November 20th.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s exchange netflow reveals a similar sentiment. The netflow calculates the number of tokens entering exchanges minus tokens leaving exchanges. According to the metric, exchanges have had around 228,450 ETH more in outflows than inflows since November 15.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nWhat To Expect For ETH Price Action In The Coming Months\n\nDropping exchange reserves reduces the amount of ETH available for trading, thereby increasing scarcity. The data from both Cryptoquant and IntoTheBlock indicates Ethereum might be gearing up for a price spike fueled by increasing scarcity.\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,013 at the time of writing. We\u2019ve already seen the crypto increase by 67% from $1,200 at the beginning of the year, and many analysts expect this trend to continue if supply tightens. According to crypto analyst Tony The Bull, Ethereum could cross $10,000 very soon if a bullish scenario plays out.\n\nETH price holds $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Exame, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Even that narrative was a bit flawed in my opinion because yeah an ETH ETF may be coming but a BTC one is coming first.\n\nSo why would ETH outperform now?\n\nBeen calling for this move down for literally months, and we are over 50% lower since then with more downside coming.\n\nI will be the biggest ETH bull when the time is right but that time isn\u2019t now. Embrace the BTC run that is coming and when the time is right, we can embrace the ETH run that will follow.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that ETH/BTC will fall down to the green box which covers the range between 0.03 BTC and 0.036 BTC ($1,121 and $1,345).\n\nAt time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.054 BTC ($2,018).\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s latest Layer 2 network Blast, has swiftly directed over $20 million in ether and stablecoins via investors.\n\nThe Blast Layer 2 solution is designed to address the speed, cost, and scalability challenges faced by Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 blockchain. Bridges, acting as a blockchain-based channel, facilitates seamless token transfers between different networks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlast\u2019s Unique Design Yields Generation and Innovation\n\nDepositors on Blast can earn yields on transferred ether, coupled with BLAST points. This will add an inventive twist to the pre-existing Layer 2.\n\nStaking returns are distributed back to users and decentralized apps (DApps) on the Layer 2 network as a result of the platform\u2019s inherent participation in ETH staking. According to the firm, having 1 ETH in your Blast wallet will automatically expand to 1.04, 1.08, and 1.12 ETH over time.\n\nHowever, access to the Blast network is currently \u201cinvite-only\u201d, mandating a code from invited users. Withdrawals and on-chain activities will be accessible after the mainnet launch in February. Additionally, the accrued BLAST points can be redeemed starting in May.\n\nIn terms of money invested, more than $19 million in ether has been staked on Lido. This will provide investors with an annualized dividend of up to 4%. Another $3 million is on Maker, while a smaller chunk of $150,000 in DAI stablecoins is in the wallet awaiting action. Blast presents USDB, an auto-rebasing stablecoin, for users bridging stablecoins. The USDB yield is derived from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol.\n\nAlso Read: Bloomberg Analyst Slams SEC For Implicitly Accepting Ethereum As Commodity\n\nAdditional Funding Into Blast\n\nRoquerre, the man behind the pseudonymous figurehead PacmanBlur and co-founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur, reported a significant $40 million fundraising.\n\nThe funding will be used to build decentralized apps (DApps) on top of the platform. Most of the funds will be used to accelerate the progress of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs per investor Standard Crypto VC, TVL is an imperfect measuring tool, yet its broad acceptance warrants its examination. Perhaps, the most successful dApps have gathered billions of dollars in external user deposits across multiple categories, including crypto exchanges, lending platforms, perpetual contracts (perps), and social applications.\n\nAdditionally, Standard Crypto VC sees Blast and its connected dApps enforcing unique monetization models. Blast can monetize by collecting a percentage of the yield, removing the need for sequencing fees as a source of revenue, as per the firm. This mechanism, in particular, allows Blast to possibly refund gas fees to the dApps that generate them.\n\nIn response to this news, Blur\u2019s native token, BLUR\u2019s price rose by 12% to trade at $34.\n\nAlso Read: Chainlink Whale Accumulation on the Rise, LINK Price Rally to Continue"

        "content": "Ethereum whales have been bullish for a long time now, even through the stretched-out bear market of the last year, and their accumulation trends prove this. According to Santiment, the largest Ethereum wallets have been stacking up ETH at an alarming rate, suggesting that these large investors expect the price to keep going up.\n\nEthereum Whales Buy $124 Billion Worth Of Tokens\n\nSantiment reports that the top 200 Ethereum whales have been buying ETH since November 21, 2022. This was just a few weeks after the FTX crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, sending cryptocurrency prices across the space into a downward spiral. ETH prices would eventually fall as low as $900 and as fear grew, so did the opportunity for buying.\n\nHowever, even after prices began to recover once more, breaking above $1,000, these large investors did not reduce their buying. Santiment reveals that they continued to purchase tokens and by November 2022, these top 200 Ethereum wallets have bought up $124 billion worth of ETH.\n\nSource: Santiment on X\n\nIn total, these addresses increased their holdings by a whopping 30%, and they now hold a collective 62.76 million tokens. This figure means that the top 200 Ethereum wallets now command approximately 52% of the total ETH supply.\n\nThe whale buying spree has not been the only bullish development for Ethereum though as there has been a marked increase in the number of new ETH wallets that are being created. Santiment notes that on Tuesday, November 21, a total of 94,700 new wallets were created on the network, a new 4-month high. This could point to a return of interest in the ecosystem and adoption could trigger a price recovery.\n\nETH On The Cusp Of Recovery\n\nAlthough the price of Ethereum has been hit hard following the news of Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao hitting the space hard, it has maintained a reasonable price level just below $2,000. This ensures that forecasts are still valid and the chances of recovery remain high.\n\nCrypto analyst FieryTrading has forecasted that the Ethereum price could cross back into the $2,350 territory soon. The analyst notes that the [rice had been on a continuous consolidation trend following the rise from $1,500 to $2,100. Given this, FieryTrading expects the altcoin to break out of its current \u2018bull-flag\u2019 as the market rallies.\n\n\u201cBull-flags are bullish continuation patterns, to bullish price action is the most likely result from this pattern,\u201d FieryTrading explains. Once this breakout happens, then the analyst places the \u201cTarget at 2400$ for the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nETH is currently sitting at $1,996 at the time of this writing with small losses of 0.45% in the last 24 hours. It is performing better than Bitcoin which has fallen 2.24% in the same timeframe to trade at $36,480.\n\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It refers to a price level at which a downward trend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand.\n\nNow that Ethereum nears this key level of $1,925, investors and traders are closely monitoring its movement for potential buying opportunities or signs of a further price drop.\n\nThe top altcoin dropped in tandem with other major cryptocurrencies on Tuesday due to the bombshell Binance news.\n\nTraders are still greedy\n\nDespite this, Ethereum's current sentiment remains in 'greed' territory, with the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index indicating a score of 56 \u2014 suggesting that market sentiment is still optimistic.\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, ETH is up by 66% since the beginning of the year. This robust increase is a potential factor contributing to the prevailing optimistic sentiment among investors, even as the cryptocurrency approaches its horizontal support level.\n\nEthereum's performance over various periods has shown a mixed trend, with a 5-day decrease of 2.84% but an 11.34% rise over the past month and an 18.20% increase in the last three months."

This contract is apparently controlled by a five-key multi-signature wallet. However, of the five addresses, one contains no ether and has no transaction history, and the other four were recently funded by a single address.\n\nThat calls into question the independence of the signing cohort.\n\nAccording to Pacman, there\u2019s no need to worry.\n\n\u201cThe Blast Early Access bridge contract does use a multisig, and each signer is a unique contributor to Blast,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cThis is the same security model that other L2s like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum utilize \u2014 these L2s are all upgradeable via multisig as well.\u201d\n\nBlockworks also contacted Paradigm and Standard Crypto for comment.\n\nL2Beat designated the project \u201cupcoming\u201d rather than \u201cactive\u201d as a result of its current implementation.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe use of Lido has drawn the ire of Ethereum community members concerned with centralization risk in staking providers, including Dankrad Feist, who called it \u201ca very bad idea\u201d on X.\n\n\u201cETH and liquid staking derivatives are different assets with different risk profiles (and rewards), and users should have a choice about which one they want to use,\u201d he said.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, given that Paradigm is an investor in both Lido and Blur.\n\nCritics also question the use of a multi-level-marketing style referral campaign, which doles out points, of unknown value, to incentivize sending invitations to prospective new users.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe site explicitly promises an airdrop based on early access participation.

It aims to have versatile functionality compared to competitors.\n\nSome think Galaxy Fox could perform well relative to other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) in 2023.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest crypto after Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market capitalization. Its goal is to be a platform where decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts can run.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not have a fixed cap on the supply of ETH, which has raised some concerns among institutional investors.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum among major blockchains, dominating with 92.5% of total TVL\n\nEthereum aims to apply blockchain\u2019s principles of decentralization, security, and open-source code to a wide range of potential applications. However, the network has faced challenges with congestion, high fees, and limited ability to scale thus far.\n\nNewer blockchain platforms like Solana were explicitly designed to address scalability issues by incorporating improved infrastructure. As a result, Ethereum now faces increasing competition in dapp and smart contracts deployment. The project continues working to upgrade its architecture and performance.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform founded in 2017 as an alternative to proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin. It uses a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros to address sustainability concerns surrounding crypto\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nBy incorporating proof-of-stake, Cardano aims to create a greener platform than Bitcoin\u2019s electricity-intensive mining operations. This could make it more appealing to institutional investors who consider environmental factors.\n\nThe project was designed to rival Ethereum and allow decentralized apps and smart contracts. However, development has progressed slowly, and some of Cardano\u2019s promised capabilities are not yet active on the platform despite initial expectations of faster advancement. This has caused frustration among some investors.\n\nAs the platform aims to expand functionality, it must demonstrate real-world utility and adoption to compete with faster-moving blockchain projects. The environmental benefits of its consensus model remain a key differentiator if further development progresses.\n\nGalaxy Fox\n\nGalaxy Fox aims to reshape the meme and gaming industries. With its unique combination of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, staking, and non-fungible token (NFT) offerings, Galaxy Fox has attracted investors who believe it has the potential to carve market share in crypto.\n\nGalaxy Fox will release 3,000 NFTs representing characters from its ecosystem during its presale period. These will be minted, held, or traded on popular NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token, GFOX, will power the Galaxy Fox ecosystem, enabling transactions, investments, and trading.\n\nSupporters are pinning Galaxy Fox\u2019s early success in its presale to the platform\u2019s features and growing popularity.\n\nThe Galaxy Fox presale is in stage 1 and ongoing.\n\nLearn more about Galaxy Fox (GFOX) here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Galaxy Fox on Twitter\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "content": "Veteran crypto investor Arthur Cheong says that one altcoin project operating on the Ethereum (ETH) network is set for big moves to the upside.\n\nCheong, the founder of DeFiance Capital, tells his 153,300 followers on the social media platform X that the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Synthetix (SNX) could surge by more than 75% from its current value.\n\n\u201cSNX $6 soon? Yearly high reclaim.\n\nMake Synthetix great again, [SNX founder Kain Warwick].\u201d\n\nThe trader, whose firm\u2019s holdings include Synthetix, says that SNX has no high time frame resistance until it hits $4.\n\n\u201cI like how this chart is looking, no major resistance until $4 essentially.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the relatively small number of SNX in circulation means just a few big buys could send SNX soaring.\n\n\u201cBelieve SNX has the least amount of circulating coins on CEXs (centralized exchanges) for a top 100 coin. More than 70% of the total supply is staked.\n\nWe have more SNX than some of the CEXs here. Doesn\u2019t take much for it to go hard from here as long as some big buyers come in.\u201d\n\nSNX is trading for $3.42 at time of writing, down 0.8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe crypto investor recently said that he was bullish on the decentralized derivatives trading sector, which includes the Synthetix Network.\n\nSaid Cheong,\n\n\u201cWe are most bullish on decentralized derivatives. When you look at all the numbers, it points at the derivatives trading sector as the biggest market in crypto. I think the annual revenue generated by derivatives trading in the space is probably $10 to $15 billion in current market conditions. If we go back to the bull market, I think we\u2019re looking at $20 to $30 billion, just from derivatives trading alone.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Blast, a brand new Ethereum Layer 2 network, has drawn a startling amount of interest and security concerns due to a surge of investors using the network to bridge their assets.\n\nBlast Hits $123 Million In TVL\n\nBlast recently announced its mainnet access on X (formerly Twitter). The L2 network built by Pacman Blur has gained a staggering amount of attention from crypto investors following the declaration.\n\n\u201cIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. We\u2019ve raised $20m from Paradigm and StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more,\u201d Blast stated.\n\nBlast recorded over 23,368 users in just 24 hours of announcing the imminent launch of its mainnet. The influx of investors pushed Blast\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) to $81 million in a single day.\n\n\u201c23,368 users have joined the Blast Community in the past 24 hours. Thanks to them, Blast has reached $81 Million in TVL in one day! We\u2019re excited to share more with community members soon. There\u2019s much more to come,\u201d Blast said.\n\nPresently, Blast has recorded over $123 million in TVL from assets bridged by investors. This unexpected surge in bridging demands has raised concerns especially due to the unusual conditions attached to the bridging process.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAccording to Blast, users can only access the Ethereum L2 network after receiving an invitation code. The network has also stated that users will not be able to withdraw their bridged funds until February 2024.\n\nWhile the unconventional bridging conditions have raised some red flags, many investors continue to express their interest by actively bridging their assets\n\nDetails About New Ethereum L2 Network\n\nBlast has outlined several important details of its bridging and staking processes. The Ethereum L2 network highlighted the potential yield benefits of investors when they bridge their ETH tokens and stablecoins. The network has also stated that investors who stake their ETH can gain profits over time as their assets grow in their Blast wallets.\n\n\u201cOnce you have access, you can bridge to earn yield (4% for ETH + 5% for stablecoins) and Blast Points ahead of the Mainnet launch in February (2024). Early access members get more points based on how much they bridge and who they invite,\u201d Blast stated.\n\nThe L2 network added:\n\nSpecifically, Blast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2\u2019s users and dapps. We\u2019ve redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically.\n\nAdditionally, Blast has expanded its bridging capabilities to a diverse range of digital assets. According to the L2 network, investors can bridge beyond ETH and opt for stablecoins such as USDT, DAI, and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just ETH on Blast that earns yield. Stablecoins do too. When you bridge stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and DAI to Blast, it\u2019s deposited in on-chain T-Bill protocols like MakerDAO, and the yield is passed back to Blast users via USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin,\u201d Blast stated.\n\nETH price regains support above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Metaverse Post, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, it also raises a cautionary note since any break below this level could lead to further price declines."

        "content": "New York, New York --News Direct-- Movement Labs\n\nMovement Labs has announced its plans to launch M2, the first Move Virtual Machine L2 for Ethereum, scaled with Celestia as modular DA. Starting with M2, Movement is building an ecosystem of Modular Move-Based Blockchains, with M2 made possible by Celestia\u2019s Blobstream and the modular stack.\n\nWith modularity at its core, Movement is set to release public goods and tooling to facilitate the adoption of the Move programming language across broader blockchain ecosystems.\n\nWith Movement and Celestia, developers can launch secure, performant, and high-throughput Move VM rollups as easily as they do smart contracts. M2 enables builders to tap into Movement\u2019s formal verification system to audit and maintain secure smart contract execution, while living within theEthereum ecosystem and affordable gas fees through use of Celestia, a high-throughput DA layer.\n\n\u201cModularity has always been a core driving principle of Movement\u2019s thesis. We believe in a future where novel technologies like the MoveVM can be adopted while leveraging the security of Ethereum with EVM-like tooling\u201d said Rushi Manche, Co-Founder of Movement Labs.\n\nThe Architecture Of Movement\n\nThe M2 mainnet is poised to become the first Ethereum Layer Two rollup that integrates Celestia for Data Availability, Snowman for Shared Sequencing, and the Move Virtual Machine for execution which is capable of 145k+ transactions per second as well as localized fee markets to mitigate gas spikes. This integration will allow developers to create high-performance, consumer-focused applications with minimal resource expenditure.\n\nWithin the ecosystem a multitude of applications that will benefit from customizable app-chains are being built including games, consumer applications, and financial products that can prioritize security of consumer funds\n\nMovement\u2019s Fractal module enables scripting from Solidity to be turned into opcodes understood by next-generation virtual machines, such as Move. This means Solidity projects can leverage Move performance and security and launch on M2 without having to write a single line of Move code.\n\nStory continues\n\nMovement Labs is growing an ecosystem of applications and infrastructure joining the Movement from multiple original virtual machines and blockchain networks. With DeFi primitives from the top Aptos and Sui ecosystems as well as established EVM projects like BenQi, GoGoPool, Vector Finance, and Ultiverse integrating into Movement\u2019s devnet, we're expanding support for Ethereum, increasing liquidity, and enhancing accessibility for teams launching on the Movement Network.\n\nCelestia\u2019s Blobstream & Movement Create A New Design Space Of Novel Use Cases\n\nBlobstream acts as a vital bridge between Ethereum and Celestia, ensuring a seamless, cost-effective, and high-throughput environment. Movement Labs envisions a future where the Move language is a cornerstone of Web3, offering unmatched performance and security. Movement is committed to democratizing Move and integrating it with existing blockchain ecosystems and frameworks. For builders looking to leverage formal verification and next-generation virtual machines, the Movement testnet is available to interact with.\n\nAbout Movement Labs\n\nMovement Labs is creating tools and infrastructure to enhance the security and efficiency of distributed networks. With a focus on smart contract safety and the scalability of blockchain technology, Movement Labs is dedicated to advancing novel use cases in decentralized economies thanks to the security and performance of the Move Programming Language.

        "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 Blast has gone live in early access mode following a $20 million investment from Paradigm and Standard Crypto, among others.\n\nBlast announced the launch in a post on X late yesterday, aiming to become the first Ethereum Layer 2 to introduce a native yield model. Flashbots strategy lead Hasu, Delegate CEO Foobar and members of investment group eGirl Capital also participated in the round.\n\nBlast was built by Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of the NFT marketplace Blur BLUR +2.67% , also known as \u201cPacman.\u201d Roquerre previously doxxed himself in February, outlining plans for the platform to become the \"Binance of NFTs.\"\n\nRoquerre will oversee the development of both Blur and Blast, adding that he had raised another $40 million to contribute to the Blur ecosystem, including Layer 2 apps for NFTs.\n\nBlast plans to airdrop tokens to community members and developers, with half the tokens allocated for each of the two groups. The airdrop will be based on the number of points each member has earned. The developer airdrop is scheduled for January 2024 when the testnet launches while the airdrop for community members will be in May.\n\nWhere the money comes from\n\nThough users can already earn 3-4% by separately staking ether, Blast said the baseline interest rate on existing Layer 2s is 0%, with the value of assets depreciating against inflation over time. With Blast\u2019s native yield, users\u2019 balances compound automatically, offering 4% for ether and 5% for stablecoins, alongside rewards known as \u201cBlast Points,\u201d the team said.\n\nMore specifically, Blast said it natively participates in staking ether and passes the yield on to the Layer 2\u2019s users and dapps, with their balances automatically growing over time.\n\nAdditionally, Blast offers stablecoins yields on USDC, USDT and DAI, which are deposited in on-chain T-Bill protocols like MakerDAO with the yield passed back to users in the form of USDB \u2014 Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin.\n\nOver $30 million has bridged to the Layer 2 since launch, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. This includes over 13,000 ETH ($26 million), $3.4 million in DAI, $2.3 million in USDC and $900,000 in USDT.\n\nAccording to a separate post by Roquerre, there is $100 million of total value locked in Blur\u2019s bidding pool not earning yield, and a Layer 2 was the answer. \u201cA new L2 with native yield for dapps and users would allow the Blur ecosystem to avoid asset depreciation, reduce NFT transaction costs and launch NFT perps,\" he said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nModel criticism and no withdrawals until February\n\nDespite the apparent demand, the platform has received criticism over how its model is structured and marketed.\n\nInvite-only early access members are offered more points based on how much they bridge and who they invite to rank further up the leaderboard, according to a screenshot shared by Tytan.eth on X and verified by The Block. Members get rewards from those they invite, and then a smaller portion of rewards from people that their invitees then invite. Some have likened it to a Pyramid scheme.\n\nUsers also have to wait until the Blast mainnet launch in February before dapps go live and they can withdraw any funds, according to the team.\n\nCurrently the bridge to send funds to Blast is a multisig wallet owned and controlled by five people.\n\n\"Legally speaking, this is beyond crazy, particularly when only managed by a multisig. You are simply investing in a crypto hedge fund,\" said Delphi Labs General Counsel Gabriel Shapiro on X.\n\nRoquerre did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block.\n\nDisclaimer: Larry Cermak, CEO of The Block, is an angel investor in Blast."

        "title": "Sleeping Crypto Giant Building on Ethereum | DOP - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Blockchain networks get praise for their transparency. And we like that. But you don\u2019t want your national ID number out there on-chain for anyone to see or use to steal your identity right?\n\nBecause public transparency has its limits. And if you want to limit how much of your public information others can see and access on-chain, then today\u2019s project is for you. Meet this sleeping giant: DOP and its selective transparency protocol.\n\nWhat is Selective Transparency?\n\nBlockchains are public. At least the good ones are. So we\u2019ve been conditioned to think blockchain privacy is only an all-or-nothing game. It has to be not private at all like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Or completely 100% private like Secret Network or Aleph Zero.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. DOP, which stands for Data Ownership Protocol, gives you an idea of where they stand just by the name. They want YOU to own and control your data. You can see in the background DOP is talking about how shielding some of your data will help crypto go mainstream.\n\nBut they have this selective transparency thing. So what is that? DOP offers the chance for you to decide what, when, and how much of your data you expose to the public. So it\u2019s not all or nothing. Real privacy moves on a sliding scale. Sometimes it matters a lot.\n\nIf you are paying a bill online, or maybe something that costs more than $1000, then maybe you don\u2019t want others to see that info. But then smaller transactions of sending $50 to a friend or buying a small free minted NFT, you may not care as much who sees it. There are lots of advantages to this method.\n\nThe biggest advantage, by far, is that it\u2019s less of a hassle dealing with local regulations worldwide. Many jurisdictions becoming hostile to crypto now. And some of these same jurisdictions have the \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d stance even if they say they believe otherwise.\n\nWith that in mind, it means platforms like Secret have a target on their back from these regulators and jurisdictions. And while we are against these types of policies, it\u2019s also foolish to ignore them when you know they are out there. Since DOP lets YOU select what to reveal, the responsibility falls to you. And if a regulator asks the DOP dev team about you, that\u2019s what they will say.\n\n(1/6) At DOP, we're committed to preparing the ground for mass adoption by bringing data ownership to Ethereum. But we know we can't go mainstream without fighting illicit activity. \ud83e\uddf5below: \u2014 Data Ownership Protocol (@dop_org) November 20, 2023\n\nData Ownership vs Privacy\n\nWe already see that with DOP, the level of privacy you choose is on a sliding scale. You get to decide.\n\nBut there are some important distinctions too. Privacy coins are a relatively small part of the market at $6 billion. The previously mentioned regulations are just one of a few reasons why. The biggest coin is Monero at #27 by market value. But DOP is building on top of Ethereum. The EVM market is huge at over $365 billion. It\u2019s 60x larger!!\n\nSo maintaining data ownership down at the user level where you control it, but within the EVM ecosystem can be MUCH more impactful. You are revealing your information much less often on the most popular platforms in crypto. Other advantages include:\n\nZero-knowledge-based KYC if your app needs to KYC customers.\n\nCustomized data disclosures.\n\nShowing full data ownership on Ethereum for the first time.\n\nSo you can see that while privacy is a great goal. Full 100% privacy Secret-style might be more limiting than we\u2019d prefer. DOP\u2019s approach broadens the possibility of you only disclosing this info when you want to even when using the most popular ETH protocols.\n\nDo you use any privacy protocols now? If so, which one is your favorite? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nThank you @Binance for a wonderful event!\n\nWe had a great time at #BinanceBlockchainWeek sharing our vision, showcasing our technology and taking a step closer to true Data Ownership. A big shout out to our amazing community!\n\nIt was wonderful seeing you. Can't wait till next\u2026 pic.twitter.com/3E2Dr2k2DX \u2014 Data Ownership Protocol (@dop_org) November 10, 2023\n\nThe Future of ETH Apps & Protocols\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the term account abstraction around. It\u2019s confusing and it means a couple of different things.\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to make using Ethereum safer and better. The creation of a \u201csmart account\u201d lets you do the things you want to do like connect to a DeFi app but in an easier way than we do now by:\n\nConnecting.\n\nApprove interaction with the smart contract.\n\nApprove the transaction.\n\nAnd Signing multiple times.\n\nThis shift from Externally Owned Accounts (which is doing it the old way) to this new, faster, safer way is the future of all Ethereum apps and protocols. This new way of using account abstraction allows DOP to offer you flexibility in how private your account is.\n\nBasic human rights like control of your financial data are at risk in the crypto space, and DOP is here to protect it. Our new article explores how DOP allows for the confidentiality users deserve.\n\nRead more: https://t.co/Xembm5il1V pic.twitter.com/L6WHrVpiEH \u2014 Data Ownership Protocol (@dop_org) November 13, 2023\n\nAt the network level, meaning on Ethereum, your account details will now be invisible. So ETH can\u2019t tell who you are. They can only see the smart contract you interact with. So at the user level, which is us, those things are hidden. We now have more options for deciding who sees what instead of the full transparency of a working public blockchain.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt means wallets and apps are easier to work with AND our control over our data will increase. Without account abstraction, it\u2019s hard to make privacy work unless you make everything private like a Secret Network. And the idea of you being in control of your data disclosures would be non-existent.\n\nAccount abstraction is the future of ETH apps. And you can see how it will work in real life with one of the first apps to implement it. Stay tuned out there as the testnet is coming soon so you can try it out for yourself.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2023, Blast, a new second-layer solution on Ethereum (ETH), caused unprecedented hype on social media. By press time, over $87 million in liquidity is injected into this on-chain bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is Blast, novel Ethereum staking L2: Highlights\n\nBlast L2 protocol attempts to change the way Ether (ETH) is staked on-chain. It employs a number of eccentric mechanisms designed to offer more profitable and seamless staking for ETH holders.\n\nBlast is promoted as a second-layer protocol on top of Ethereum (ETH), the largest programmable blockchain.\n\nPer the statement of its team, Blast automatically stakes all injected crypto in Lido and redistributes staking rewards between investors if its L2.\n\nAlso, users who bridge stablecoins, automatically get USDB, Blast's auto-rebasing stablecoin, to enjoy additional yield from MakerDAO's on-chain T-bill protocol.\n\nBlast team will enable withdrawals on Feb. 24, 2024, while redemption of Blast Points is set to kick off in May.\n\nThe project siphoned over $87 million in Ether and stablecoins in less than 24 hours upon launch.\n\nImage by 21 Shares via Dune Analytics\n\nBy press time, its TVL metric demonstrates over 20,000% daily growth, which makes it arguably the fastest growing L2 in Ethereum (ETH) history.\n\nBlast, most overhyped Ethereum L2 in Q4, 2023\n\nBlast, a novel L2 on Ethereum, is attempting to make ETH staking more profitable via the concept of \"native yield.\"\n\nBlast L2: Basics\n\nBlast is the second-layer solution on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Per its official statement, Blast is developed by contributors of Blur, a dominant NFT marketplace. Also, it is said to be funded by heavyweight VCs Paradigm, Standard Crypto and Primitive Ventures with the participation of top angel investors Andrew Kang and Santiago Santos.\n\nSimply put, the protocol attempts to offer more inclusive and profitable staking for ETH and stablecoin holders than its competitors.\n\nWith Blast, ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2. Ether-denominated yield from an L1 staking protocol (initially Lido) is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nBlast attempts to integrate real-world assets into the ETH staking process. All of its customers who inject stablecoins get USDB, Blast's native asset. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO protocol pegged to U.S. 10-year T-bills.\n\nBlast L2: When will the token arrive?\n\nBlast released a three-step timeline for its operations:\n\nEarly access (already live from Nov. 21): Bridge goes live, Blast Points distribution starts. Mainnet launch (expected on Feb. 24, 2024): dApps go live, ETH withdrawals enabled by team. Redemption (expected in May 24, 2024): Blast Points redemption activated.\n\nUsers will only be able to withdraw what they inject into Blast three months after the start of its early access campaign.\n\nBlast Ethereum L2: Risks\n\nBesides the high volatility of cryptocurrency and other \"regular\" considerations necessary for crypto investors, there are some extra risks associated with the project so far:\n\nNobody can predict the price of Ether and associated assets on the day of the unlocking; the stakes-USD-denominated valuation can either spike or shrink.\n\nAirdrop of token is not guaranteed; its rules are also yet to be announced.\n\nInterest in building dApps on this L2 cannot be predicted.\n\nAs such, users should be extra cautious when working with every early-stage cryptocurrency protocol."

According to some analysts, one of the stumbling blocks to the approval was the dominance of Binance exchange in the industry.\n\nLots of chatter on this Blackrock #Bitcoin ETF. And rightfully so. Blackrock more or less IS is the US government. They\u2019ve also received approval on 575/576 of ETF applications.\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say- there is no chance, and I mean zero, that this ETF is approved with Binance in\u2026 \u2014 Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) June 16, 2023\n\nAlso Read: With Binance market dominance under threat, experts say path for spot Bitcoin ETF is now clear\n\nBitcoin price tests key support\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing weakness, recording a 3% fall on the day, with most of these losses recorded following news around Binance exchange. Testing the critical support at $36,788 and with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing weakening momentum, BTC could fall.\n\nIncreased selling pressure below the $36,788 mean threshold of the supply zone stretching from $36,276 to $37,301 could open the drains for an extended fall, with experts anticipating a crash to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlready, the Awesome Oscillator\u2019s (AO) histogram bars are soaked in red and inching closer to the midline by the day. This points to the bears steadily taking over.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, increased buying pressure from investors looking to capitalize on the retest of $36,788 could send Bitcoin price north, first clearing the local top at $37,972 before testing the range high at $37,980 and ultimately claiming the $40,000 psychological level, 10% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds above critical support at $36,788 as Binance CEO CZ begins BTC halving countdown\n\nEthereum price struggles to keep $1,935 support base\n\nEthereum (ETH) price risks losing the critical support at $1,935, marking the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker that extend between $1,864 and $2,004. If the $1,935 level fails to hold, it could spell doom for token holders, with ETH likely sliding to the $1,800 psychological level, or in the dire case, invalidating the bullish thesis below $1,753.\n\nBoth the RSI and the AO support this outlook, edging south as momentum continues to fade.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure, enough to vindicate Ethereum price from the grasp of the aforementioned supply barrier above $2,009 could spur optimism, setting ETH back above the ascending trendline. This could clear the skies for a stretch to $2,136, denoting a 10% ascent from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price dilemma or buy signal before 60% rally"

        "content": "Wed 22 Nov 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nA recent report from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) reveals that 19 large banks have heavily invested in crypto, amounting to 9.4 billion euros, with Ripple making a notable presence alongside giants Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe crypto XRP gains popularity among banks\n\nWhile the banking sector has long been reluctant toward cryptocurrencies, it seems that mindsets have radically changed. According to the recent report from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), 19 large banks have massively invested in crypto at the level of 9.4 billion euros.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin (31%) and Ethereum (22%) dominate the portfolios, but XRP has also emerged with 2% of the total investments, equivalent to 188 million euros.\n\nThe increasing presence of XRP in the investment strategies of these institutions is notable. Even though it remains behind BTC and ETH, the XRP token has climbed to the third place among the favoured cryptocurrencies. This interest can be explained by several factors.\n\nOn one hand, Ripple has won several legal battles against the SEC, thereby reassuring investors about the long-term viability of XRP. On the other hand, Ripple continues to expand its cross-border payment services to new banks around the world. Its RippleNet network, which uses XRP, is now accessible in several countries.\n\nOther altcoins emerging in banks\n\nIn addition to the dominant trio BTC-ETH-XRP, the BCBS report reveals the growing presence of other crypto-assets like DOT, ADA, or LTC in the banking portfolios.\n\nTogether, they still represent only 5% of the allocations, but this shows that financial institutions are beginning to diversify their digital assets beyond dominant coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe increasing integration of public blockchains within banking strategies reflects a paradigm shift: banks are increasingly adopting innovations from decentralized finance.\n\nWith nearly 10 billion euros already invested in crypto, there is no doubt that this is just the beginning. The appetite of institutional investors for these new digital assets will probably only grow in the coming years. The banking sector could soon become one of the main drivers of mass adoption of cryptocurrencies like XRP.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

However, the stars may be starting to align for the number 2 cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto recovers quickly\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s joint US DOJ and Treasury enforcement action against Binance and its leader Changpeng Zhao, the crypto market took a bit of a tumble. However, Wednesday has dawned brightly for the crypto market, and ethereum is starting to look strong.\n\n$ETH bull flag\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nIn the short term 4-hour time frame it can be seen that $ETH is in a flag and is approaching the top for a potential breakout to the upside. The measured move for this breakout could potentially be to $2,200.\n\nAscending triangle\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nLooking further out on the daily time frame $ETH looks to be ready to break the top of an ascending triangle once again. The price did venture out earlier this month but this turned out to be another fake out. Once $ETH does break out of this triangle, confirms, and gets the odd week as consolidation above, rocket propellant could be what pushes the price rapidly to the upside.\n\nMacro up-sloping channel\n\nSource: Trading View\n\nLooking out even further from a macro perspective, $ETH is also inside an upward sloping channel. Bitcoin has a similar one. Reaching the top of this channel could potentially carry $ETH to between $2,600 to $3,000.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced a crucial partnership with Atomic Wallet to expose its tokens to over five million users. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) saw a price surge after BlackRock took a significant step ahead in the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, a new coin is gaining traction as it aims for a $100 million market cap.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what this new emerging crypto coin is and why some crypto enthusiasts are looking into it and considering it a contender for the cryptos to watch out for!\n\nShiba Inu Announces Integration With Atomic Wallet, SHIB Soars\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Shiba Inu confirmed the integration of Atomic Wallet, a prominent non-custodial decentralized wallet, into its platform. This integration marks a strategic move for Shiba Inu, allowing the wallet's expansive user base of 5 million to access the Shibarium blockchain seamlessly.\n\nThe announcement highlights Atomic Wallet's newfound support for Shibarium-native cryptocurrencies, including SHIB, LEASH, and BONE. Since its launch in August, Shibarium has rapidly gained adoption, processing nearly 3.5 million transactions within its initial 90 days.\n\nFollowing the news of the integration, the market responded with a notable surge in the price of Shiba Inu. On November 15, the SHIB price stood at $0.000008343, and after the announcement, SHIB experienced a substantial increase of 9.7%, reaching $0.000009156 by November 16. But has since experienced a decrease in price to $0.000007947 as of November 22.\n\nPer SHIB price prediction, some enthusiasts anticipate a bullish trajectory for Shiba Inu. Projections indicate that SHIB could experience an impressive surgeby 2024.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run, coupled with the positive impact of recent partnerships and integrations.\n\nHowever, a more conservative forecast suggests that SHIB may maintain a more modest level in 2024, acknowledging the potential influence of bearish sentiments in the market.\n\nBlackRock Registers Ishares Ethereum Trust in Delaware\n\nIn a pivotal move on November 9, 2023, Blackrock took a significant step in the crypto space by formally recording its Ishares Ethereum Trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations.\n\nThe official document, dated November 9, identifies the trust as statutory and acknowledges Blackrock Advisors as the filing party. This development has sparked speculation among market watchers, hinting that Blackrock may be strategically positioning itself to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThis move follows the firm's earlier submission for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, for which regulatory approval from the SEC is still pending.\n\nThe market's immediate response to this news has been substantial, with the price of Ethereum experiencing a notable surge. On November 9, ETH was trading at $1,884.20. However, post-announcement, ETH soared by 10% to $2,018.66 as of November 22.\n\nPer ETH price prediction, Ethereum's future appears promising.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nRebel Satoshi: A New Meme Coin Aiming for the $100 Market Cap\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ) has emerged as more than just a meme coin; it's a passionate force aiming to disrupt the status quo and achieve a remarkable $100 million market capitalization. As crypto enthusiasts seek the next hidden gem, Rebel Satoshi positions itself as a unique blend of playfulness, purpose, and the potential for substantial returns.\n\nAt its core, Rebel Satoshi represents a movement, a call to rebellion against centralized systems and the entrenched elite. Inspired by historical figures like Satoshi Nakamoto and Guy Fawkes, Rebel Satoshi carries the torch of defiance and unity.\n\nThe $RBLZ token, an ERC-20 standard asset, becomes the symbolic embodiment of this mission, signifying unity against the established norms in the crypto space.\n\nKey features of $RBLZ include staking rewards, deflationary characteristics, meme coin status, a limited collection of 9,999 rare and exclusive NFTs, and governance within the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem.\n\nCurrently in the Early Bid Round of its public presale with a price of $0.010, the company says that $RBLZ is poised to list on exchanges at $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

Bitcoin has surged by over 126 percent since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been trading above the $2,000 threshold amidst discussions regarding Spot ETH ETF applications in the US. In other news, the altcoin Cardano has shown solid growth, recording an increase of over 8 percent in the last week.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin at $37,000 has defied many projections of a correction phase. As ETF prospects keep piling, the top two tokens by market cap, BTC and ETH, are leading the Crypto market. Altcoins such as Ripple and Solana also witnessed a surge as institutional investment trickled beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While major market oscillators indicate a \u2018Neutral\u2019 sentiment, Bitcoin\u2019s price predictions post halving might entice more investors to enter the market.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently trading at $37,489 showing a slight uptrend of 0.13 percent. It is in a consolidation phase, facing resistance at $37,574 and crucial support at $36,342. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 58.78 indicates a moderate presence of buyers, leaving room for more momentum. The $37,574 level is key for potential bullish momentum, while a break below $36,342 could prompt a reassessment of bullish sentiment. Traders watch these levels closely for signals of market direction. The overall situation suggests a cautious outlook, with attention focused on key support and resistance levels for potential market reversals.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"The crypto heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ether continue to lead the strong market rally riding on the ETF wave. BTC is inching towards the $40,000 mark which will be its highest point in 2023 while ETH is sitting comfortably on the $2,000 mark. Binance reaching the settlement stage with SEC may also bring some positive sentiment in the market and drive the prices north. The overall crypto market cap has touched the $1.42 trillion mark.\"\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk told ABP Live, \u201cWith OpenAI founder Sam Altman in the news over the weekend, AI-related tokens have also experienced volatility in the past few days, as Sam\u2019s crypto project World Coin, touched its four-month high at $2.71 before returning to $2.25 levels. Other AI-related tokens like RNDR also crossed its 21-month high and have almost doubled in just one month. Another development came in terms of the acquisition of Coindesk, as one of the world\u2019s leading crypto-focused media companies was acquired by a crypto exchange called Bullish. The exchange is led by an ex-NYSE president. Coindesk is one of the most influential companies in the crypto space as they were among the first to report the FTX fiasco, and also infamously the recent fake news of a spot BTC ETF approval.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team noted, \"Due to BTC's sideways movement in recent days, ALT coins exhibited mixed trading. In noteworthy news, BNB coin surged by over 7 percent following reports that the US Government is seeking over $4 billion from Binance to settle a criminal case, as reported by Bloomberg. This news notably impacted the price of BTC positively.\"\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Share:\n\nMaker (MKR), a smart contract token, is being accumulated by large wallet investors that scooped up MAKER in the past day. These addresses are sitting on unrealized profits, according to an on-chain data provider.\n\nOn-chain metrics of Maker are supporting a bearish thesis for the asset in the short term. Crypto on-chain intelligence provider SpotOnChain identified the Maker token as the sixth largest asset in terms of smart money inflow in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum has noted a considerable increase in accumulation by large wallet investors. Large ETH wallets scooped up ETH tokens consistently over the past year, and the altcoin recorded the highest spike in new wallets created on Tuesday.\n\nEthereum price gains are supported by bullish on-chain metrics for the altcoin. Based on data from crypto intelligence tracker, Santiment, the 200 largest wallet addresses holding Ether, added 62.76 million ETH tokens to their wallet. These Ether tokens are worth $124.1 billion and the wallets accumulated 30.3% more ETH since November 2022.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a memo outlining its discussion with Grayscale, concerning the conversion of its Bitcoin Trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF product. The US financial regulator recently delayed its decision on Hashdex, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton\u2019s spot BTC ETF applications.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart, reported that Grayscale had meetings with the US SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets on November 20.

Unlike traditional payment methods restrained by borders and fluctuating exchange rates, embracing cryptocurrency opens the doors to a vast, borderless marketplace.\n\nYour business gains immediate access to a global customer base, tapping into markets that were once considered unreachable.\n\nThis borderless nature of cryptocurrency facilitates seamless transactions, making it an attractive option for international trade.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a small startup or an established enterprise, the ability to transact with customers from different corners of the globe enhances your market reach significantly.\n\nAmong the myriad of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has emerged as a frontrunner, distinguished by its smart contract capabilities and wide-ranging applications beyond just a digital currency.\n\nIncorporating Ethereum into your payment options not only adds a layer of sophistication to your transactions but also aligns your business with one of the most influential players in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSmart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain automate and enforce agreements, streamlining complex processes and reducing the risk of fraud.\n\nThis level of transparency and efficiency is particularly appealing for businesses engaged in cross-border transactions, where trust and speed are paramount.\n\nCryptocurrency as the Future of Payments\n\nAs businesses worldwide recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies, the acceptance of digital assets, particularly Ethereum, is becoming a hallmark of forward-thinking enterprises.\n\nThe decentralized nature of these currencies ensures security, while the global reach provides unprecedented opportunities for growth.\n\nBy embracing cryptocurrency, your business positions itself at the forefront of a financial revolution, signaling to customers that you are not just adapting to change but actively shaping the future of commerce.\n\nThe inclusion of Ethereum in your payment options serves as a strategic move, aligning your business with a versatile and widely accepted digital currency.\n\nIt\u2019s factual to state that the era of cryptocurrency is upon us, and businesses that embrace this paradigm shift are reaping the rewards of a global customer base.\n\nEthereum, with its technological advancements and widespread acceptance, stands as a beacon in the world of digital currencies, offering your business not just a means of payment but a gateway to unparalleled global opportunities.\n\nIt\u2019s time to leverage the power of Ethereum and position your business at the forefront of the evolving landscape of finance."

        "content": "\n\nEs ist durchaus nicht neu, dass B\u00f6rsen ihre Netzwerke starten. Denn der aktuelle Trend, auf Ethereum aufzubauen, macht die Einf\u00fchrung eines Tokens \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig, was strategisch gesehen eine regulatorische \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung im aktuellen Umfeld vermeidet. Demzufolge gehen wir davon aus, dass konforme B\u00f6rsen dieses Modell nachahmen und die Gelegenheit ergreifen werden, im kommenden Zyklus aus einer diversifizierten Einkommensquelle Kapital zu schlagen.\n\nAbbildung 4: Einsatz von neuen Anwendungen \u00fcber ETH-Skalierungsl\u00f6sungen hinweg\n\nverabschiedet. DVT ist ein Mechanismus, der die Verantwortlichkeiten f\u00fcr die Schl\u00fcsselverwaltung und das Signieren von Krypto-Transaktionen auf mehrere Parteien verteilt, um einzelne Fehlerpunkte zu reduzieren und die Ausfallsicherheit der Validatoren zu erh\u00f6hen. So wird LIDO, das fast ein Drittel der eingesetzten ETH ausmacht, k\u00fcnftig durch die Integration von DVT-Modulen in die Protokolle Obol und SSV ein vielf\u00e4ltigeres Profil von Knotenbetreibern einf\u00fchren und damit der Debatte \u00fcber den unerw\u00fcnschten Einfluss auf den Validierungsprozess und die Blockproduktion auf Ethereum den Boden entziehen.\n\nNeben der Diversifizierung der Knotenbetreiber sorgt diese Implementierung daneben f\u00fcr mehr Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit bei Validierungsausf\u00e4llen oder Zensurversuchen. Auf der anderen Seite stellen SSV- und Obol-Netzwerke neue technische Funktionen dar, so dass es unerl\u00e4sslich ist, im Hinblick auf alle unvorhergesehenen Schwachstellen, die sie einf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnten, wachsam zu bleiben.Abbildung 5: Dominanz der Entit\u00e4ten, die auf das Ethereum-Netzwerk setzen\n\nMit Verweis auf eine \u201epolitische Polarisierung\u201c und bestehende Haushaltsdefizite stellte die Ratingagentur Moody\u2019s der US-Wirtschaft eine negative Prognose aus und senkte ihr Kreditrating von stabil auf negativ. Die Renditen f\u00fcr 10- und 30-j\u00e4hrigen Staatsanleihen stiegen am Montag an, was sich auf die Portfolios der Anleger auswirkte und das Ausleihen von Geld f\u00fcr die Regierung verteuerte. F\u00fcr den Fall, dass die US-Regierung ihre Bundesschulden von aktuell \u00fcber 33,7 Billionen Dollar nicht einh\u00e4lt, k\u00f6nnte der Weg in eine Rezession f\u00fchren. Die aktuelle Hausse von Bitcoin unter diesen Bedingungen st\u00fctzt das Narrativ von Absicherung gegen Inflation \u2013 wenngleich sicher auch Spekulationen um einen potenziellen Spot-ETF in den USA dabei beteiligt sind.\n\nAbbildung 6: Rendite von 30-j\u00e4hrigen US-Staatsanleihen im Vergleich zu Bitcoin (YTD)\n\n\n\nQuelle: Yahoo Financesn\n\nNEAR: Partnerschaften f\u00fcr engere Zusammenarbeit mit Ethereum\n\nBei NEAR handelt es sich um eine Blockchain-Plattform, die eine skalierbare und entwicklerfreundliche Umgebung f\u00fcr dezentrale Anwendungen (DApps) anbietet. Der Entwickler, die NEAR Foundation, k\u00fcndigte nun eine Kooperation mit Polygon Labs an, um einen sogenannten \u201ezkWASM Prover\u201c, also ein Tool, das Zero-Knowledge-Proofs speziell im Kontext des Programmierstandards WebAssembly (WASM) erm\u00f6glicht zu entwickeln. WASM-basierten Netzwerke sollen k\u00fcnftig ihre Abrechnungen auf Ethereum validieren und dessen bew\u00e4hrte Sicherheitsgarantien nutzen k\u00f6nnen. WebAssembly stellt eine Alternative zur Ethereum Virtual Machine von Ethereum dar. Diese Zusammenarbeit ist f\u00fcr Entwickler:innen, die das Polygon CDK verwenden, von entscheidender Bedeutung, da sie die M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Erstellung anpassbarer Netzwerke \u00fcber die EVM-Beschr\u00e4nkungen von Ethereum hinaus erweitert. Sie erm\u00f6glicht die Nutzung von Technologien wie Sharding, die derzeit auf Ethereum nicht m\u00f6glich sind und bietet \u00fcber Polygons Shared Layer Zugang zur Liquidit\u00e4t von Ethereum. Diese Integration bietet einen strategischen Vorteil f\u00fcr Nicht-EVM-Entit\u00e4ten, da sie die Interkonnektivit\u00e4t zwischen inkompatiblen Blockchain-Systemen f\u00f6rdert. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat sie das Potenzial, die ZK-EVM-Nutzerbasis von Polygon zu erh\u00f6hen und die L\u00fccke zu Ethereum und Near-Netzwerken zu schlie\u00dfen. Abbildung 7: T\u00e4glich aktive Nutzer:innen von Near (wei\u00df) im Vergleich zu Polygon ZK-EVM (lila) und Ethereum (grau)\n\n\n\nQuelle: Artemis\n\nDie NEAR Foundation stellte zudem auch ihre neue Datenverf\u00fcgbarkeitsl\u00f6sung NEAR DA vor. Diese soll Ethereum-Skalierungsl\u00f6sungen ein kosteneffizientes Mittel zum Einstellen von Daten bieten. Herk\u00f6mmliche Blockchains vereinen alle wichtigen Funktionen wie Abrechnung, Konsens, Ausf\u00fchrung und Datenverf\u00fcgbarkeit, was Netzwerke mit zunehmender Gr\u00f6\u00dfe ineffizient macht. Der modulare Ansatz konzentriert sich stattdessen auf die Trennung einiger weniger intensiver Prozesse, wie z. B. das Einstellen von Daten auf Ethereum zum Nachweis ihrer G\u00fcltigkeit, um L2-Blockchains bei der Rationalisierung ihres Betriebs zu helfen.\n\nIm Fall von Near es deren Blogpost zufolge nun voraussichtlich 8000-mal billiger, einen Satz an \u201ecalldata\u201c, also Eingabedaten, die f\u00fcr eine Smart Contract-Transaktion ben\u00f6tigt werden, zu verwenden, als auf Ethereum. Near ist nun das zweite Protokoll, das einen solchen modularen Ansatz anbietet, nachdem das Krypto-Projekt Celestia Ende Oktober die Einf\u00fchrung des Mainnets angek\u00fcndigt hat. Dies ist eine wichtige Entwicklung, um das Ethereum-\u00d6kosystem weiter zu skalieren und von den monolithischen Architekturen, die komplexer und weniger flexibel sind, unabh\u00e4ngiger zu werden.\n\nRechtliche Hinweise:\n\nDas in diesem Beitrag enthaltene Material dient ausschlie\u00dflich Informationszwecken. 21.co und die verbundenen Unternehmen empfehlen keine Ma\u00dfnahmen auf der Grundlage dieser Informationen.

        "title": "21Shares analysis reveals the resilience and importance of Ethereum's growth - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In the tumultuous crypto landscape, while global attention is often monopolized by Bitcoin, an in-depth analysis by 21Shares reveals that Ethereum is emerging as a resilient and growing player.\n\nDespite recent challenges, including a hacker attack, we will explore the remarkable recovery of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a close look at the outstanding performance and partnerships that outline a promising future.\n\n21Shares: the In-Depth Analysis of Ethereum Performance\n\nIn recent times, the cryptocurrency landscape has been dominated by the narrative focused on Bitcoin, with its performance and growing reputation as a haven in times of instability in traditional financial markets.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that significant events, such as Ethereum recent recovery, could have equally significant impacts.\n\nDespite an overall loss of 7.82% recorded in the last week, the price of ETH showed a remarkable 12.54% increase in a single night, significantly surpassing previous figures.\n\nWhile the drop can be primarily attributed to a hacking attack, the positive developments can be traced back to the growing calls for the approval of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) dedicated to this digital currency and the return to June\u2019s fee and \u201cburn rate\u201d levels.\n\nFactors favoring Ethereum positive momentum\n\nThe push for cryptocurrency has been fueled by the application for approval of an ETF by several companies, including Ark Invest and 21Shares itself, with significant buy-in from BlackRock, an $8.6 million asset manager.\n\nThese developments have triggered growing optimism among investors.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s solid recovery is anchored by robust fundamentals, emancipating itself from contingent dynamics.\n\nProminent among the signs of recovery are rising base fees and the rising \u201cburn rate,\u201d which have returned to levels observed last June.\n\nThis indicates a general revitalization of on-chain activities. Despite the recent hacker attack against Poloniex, which resulted in the theft of more than $100 million in ETH, Ethereum\u2019s rally has not been halted.\n\nArkham Intelligence forecasts indicate the possibility of losses of up to 10%, but it is crucial to note that this has not weakened the cryptocurrency\u2019s consolidation process.\n\nPartnerships and projects involving the Ethereum network reflect its attractiveness. A significant example is the collaboration between NEAR and Polygon, which has led to multiple agreements to align their respective networks.\n\nThis effort is evident in the partnership with Polygon Lab, which offers Polygon CDK developers a wide range of options for creating customizable networks not bound by EVM standards.\n\nThe integration of advanced technologies, such as sharding, provides a distinctive advantage to both networks.\n\nThe increase in base fees is a clear sign of growing activity on the Ethereum platform. This phenomenon, combined with a rising \u201cburn rate,\u201d indicates rapid consumption of circulating ETH, confirming a general upswing in on-chain activity.\n\nThese indicators not only testify to the robustness of the network, but also suggest an increase in user and developer interest.\n\nThe recent hacker attack and possible losses\n\nThe recent hacker attack against Poloniex, although it generated concern and caused the loss of a considerable sum, did not significantly destabilize Ethereum\u2019s positive performance.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that market reaction to such events can often be transient, especially when the underlying robustness of the blockchain is not compromised.\n\nArkham Intelligence forecasts indicate possible losses, but Ethereum\u2019s resilience could mitigate negative impacts in the medium term.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s strategic partnerships with projects such as NEAR and Polygon underscore its prominent position in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe partnership with Polygon Labs, in particular, offers advanced solutions to developers, enabling the creation of customizable networks.\n\nThis integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as sharding, represents a significant step toward evolving and optimizing network capabilities.\n\nIn closing, while Bitcoin remains a beacon in the cryptocurrency universe, detailed analysis of Ethereum reveals an equally interesting and potentially profitable narrative. The recent recovery, despite the challenges, is an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s fundamental soundness and the continued enthusiasm of investors and developers.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Ethereum is positioned as a key player, poised to shape the future of this revolutionary financial technology."

        "title": "Blast is an Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins - Get Invite for Blast Airdrop - Gizmo Times",
        "content": "So, a new chain has emerged, and this time, it comes with backing from the big names including Paradigm and Standard Crypto. It\u2019s called Blast, and they say, \u201cBlast is the first L2 that incorporates native yield. Your balance on Blast compounds automatically.\u201d\n\nBlast yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The yield from these decentralized protocols is passed back to Blast users automatically. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On Blast, it\u2019s 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins.\n\nHere\u2019s how Blast works.\n\nAuto Rebasing\n\nUsers transact in ETH. Dapps are built around ETH. Blast was designed from the ground up so that ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2.\n\nL1 Staking\n\nBlast only became possible this year following Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade. ETH yield from L1 staking, initially Lido, is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nT-Bill Yield\n\nUsers who bridge stablecoins receive USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol. USDB can be redeemed for USDC when bridging back to Ethereum.\n\nBlast contributors have raised $20m from Paradigm, Standard Crypto, eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, Jeff Lo, and other crypto-natives.\n\nA quick comparison done on the website of Blast shows that it is better than Optimism and Arbitrum in terms of giving native yields, and it shares all the gas revenues with the developers on the chain, and there are substantial incentives to devs compared to what the devs on the other two chains get.\n\nRight now, users can bridge their funds to Blast, get an early entry into the Airdrop leaderboard, and invite friends to make a team that deposits at least 5 ETH in total, so that they qualify for the squad reward where the entire squad is rewarded with points. The Blast Community Airdrop is split between Early Access Members (50%) and Developers (50%). The ETH that you deposit right now is available for withdrawal in February 2024 when Blast Mainnet gets launched, and the actual distribution of Blast airdrop is going to happen in May 2024.\n\nIf you need invite codes for Blast, you can tweet reply to me @thecaptaingates and I will try to share a few as and when I get them from the squad. Make sure you RT the post that mentions Blast."
