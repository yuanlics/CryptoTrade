        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification as a security will impact the cryptocurrency space, influence trading, issuance, and investment regulations.\n\nThe Howey Test defines asset security. Debate continues on Ethereum\u2019s classification.\n\nLegal clarity is vital to avoid regulatory uncertainty and to guide industry growth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey from ICO to decentralization has shaped its status.\n\nImportance Of Determining Ethereum\u2019s Legal Classification As A Security\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification as a security is considered to be an important regulatory decision that would impact the cryptocurrency space. The reason is because securities laws affect regulations with trading laws, issuance laws, and investment practices.\n\nThe Howey Test, referenced by the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), defines whether an asset is a security. The outcome of this decision will also influence investor protection, market stability, and innovation in the crypto space.\n\nBackground On Securities And How Securities Are Regulated Under US Law\n\nThe regulation of crypto-assets, particularly in relation to securities is a complex issue. In general, securities sold or traded in the U.S. must be registered, and the registration process involves providing essential facts about the company\u2019s or cryptos properties, business, and the security itself.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s role includes minimizing compliance while ensuring investor protection. These regulations are designed to provide investors with access to relevant information about investments before and after investing, and to prevent conflicts of interest in the securities industry.\n\nDefinition Of Securities\n\nSecurities are fungible and tradable financial instruments to raise capital in both the public and private markets. Securities can include notes, stocks, bonds, certificates of interest, collateral trust certificates, and more. These instruments then serve as a means for individuals and entities to invest, speculate, and manage risk within the financial markets.\n\nThe term \u201csecurity\u201d covers a broad range of investments, and its definition can vary based on jurisdiction and context. Securities play a pivotal role in capital markets, enabling companies and governments to access funding while offering investors opportunities for potential returns and income.\n\nWhat Is The Howey Test? Explanation Of The Howey Test\n\nThe SEC is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and safeguarding investors. The SEC\u2019s jurisdiction extends to various aspects of financial markets, including investment banks, trading, financial dealings, product offerings, advertising, and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nThe Howey Test is a legal framework used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and thus falls under securities regulations. The test originates from the landmark Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946.\n\nThe test consists of three main elements:\n\nAn investment of money,\n\nIn a common enterprise,\n\nWith an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.\n\nIf these three elements are met, the transaction is considered a security, subject to the regulations set forth by SEC. The Howey Test serves as a fundamental guideline for classifying various financial arrangements and offerings in terms of whether they require compliance with securities laws and regulations, ensuring investor protection and transparency in financial markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Characteristics And SEC\u2019s Perspective On Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its programmable smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on its network, offering features like transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and to incentivize network participants.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that whether a particular cryptocurrency, like Ether, constitutes a security depends on its specific characteristics and how it is marketed and sold. The SEC has noted that if a cryptocurrency operates as a security , it falls under its regulatory jurisdiction, subject to applicable securities laws. The classification of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is based on the Howey Test and other legal considerations to determine their status as securities or commodities, impacting their regulatory oversight and legal compliance.\n\nSEC\u2019s Statements and Actions Regarding Cryptocurrencies And Tokens\n\nThe U.S. SEC has actively engaged with the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and tokens through its statements and actions. The SEC\u2019s emphasis on investor protection and market integrity has led to a series of public statements clarifying its position on digital assets. It has consistently emphasized that whether a particular cryptocurrency or token qualifies as a security depends on the underlying facts and circumstances, with the Howey Test being a pivotal framework.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, the SEC released an investigative report addressing the treatment of digital assets, specifically tokens offered by \u201cvirtual\u201d organizations through distributed ledger or blockchain technology. The report emphasized that these assets, often marketed as \u201cInitial Coin Offerings\u201d (ICOs) or \u201cToken Sales,\u201d could fall under the scope of federal securities laws. The SEC\u2019s stance was whether an asset is a security depends on the factual and economic nature of the transaction rather than the terminology or technology employed.\n\nThe investigative report on the case of \u201cThe DAO,\u201d a virtual organization that offered and sold tokens. The SEC concluded that these tokens were securities, thereby subject to federal securities laws. The report underscored that entities issuing securities via distributed ledger or blockchain technology must adhere to registration requirements, unless a valid exemption applies.\n\nAdditionally, unregistered offerings and securities exchanges facilitating trading in these securities could face liabilities.While the SEC is open to innovative technologies, its measured approach underscores the need to balance innovation with the protection of investors and the integrity of the markets.\n\nExamination Of SEC\u2019s Stance On Ethereum\u2019s Status As A Security\n\nThe position on whether Ethereum\u2019s status is a security or not is not so well defined. While Ethereum initially launched through a token sale, the SEC\u2019s perspective has evolved over time. Former Chairman Jay Clayton highlighted that as Ethereum decentralized and its network matured, it might not fit the traditional definition of a security subject to securities regulations.\n\nThe determination hinges on whether the sale of Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, involved the investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others, the key elements of the Howey Test. The SEC\u2019s cautious and nuanced approach reflects its commitment to balance innovation and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nContrary to initial concerns, Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, reportedly indicated in 2018, that he also doesn\u2019t view Ethereum as a security based on his interpretation of its historical issuance and network distribution. He referenced his earlier remarks from a 2018 lecture at MIT, where he emphasized that Ethereum was likely offered and sold as a security during its initial coin offering (ICO) phase.\n\nGensler\u2019s statement aligns with the idea that the initial sale of a token could be considered a security offering, but over time, if the token\u2019s network becomes sufficiently decentralized, it may no longer meet the criteria of a security. This view holds significance for Ethereum\u2019s regulatory treatment and could impact how other cryptocurrencies are evaluated by the SEC.\n\nAnalysis Of Speeches, Regulations, And Enforcement Actions Relevant To Ethereum\n\nThe analysis of speeches, regulations, and enforcement actions relevant to Ethereum, offers insight into the SEC\u2019s evolving stance. Various officials\u2019 speeches have indicated the importance of evaluating the underlying characteristics of a cryptocurrency and its manner of distribution to determine its regulatory status. The issuance of guidance, the establishment of a framework, and subsequent statements by SEC officials have further clarified its position.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s legal status as security is key for cryptocurrency regulation and market prices. The SEC\u2019s approach using the Howey Test emphasizes investor protection, market stability, and innovation. While Bitcoin is often seen as a commodity, Ethereum\u2019s classification remains debated.\n\nClarity is crucial to alleviate regulatory ambiguity, fostering industry growth. Understanding securities and the SEC\u2019s role is essential; they govern investment instruments and ensure market fairness. Ethereum\u2019s evolving journey from ICO issuance to a decentralized network shapes its status. Former and current SEC chairs, Clayton and Gensler, offer nuanced perspectives on the definition of Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the significance of determining Ethereum\u2019s legal classification?\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification impacts its regulatory treatment, influencing trading, issuance, and investment practices in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHow does the Howey Test affect cryptocurrency regulation?\n\nThe Howey Test helps determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, potentially subjecting it to securities regulations for investor protection.\n\nWhat is the SEC\u2019s role in regulating securities?\n\nThe SEC safeguards investors and maintains market fairness by overseeing securities markets, ensuring transparency, and preventing insider advantages.\n\nWhy is legal clarity important for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum?\n\nClear classification mitigates regulatory uncertainty, fostering industry development while balancing innovation and investor safeguarding in the digital asset landscape."

        "content": "Choosing a promising cryptocurrency amid thousands can be daunting. Indeed, most investors look at top options such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD), with these cryptos usually providing enough diversification over the long term.\n\nKeep in mind that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are massive in size. While that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t grow immensely from here, those with a more growth-oriented market view may want to look for the so-called \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d or the \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nSo, where to start? Investors have plenty of smart contract-enabled blockchain projects from which to choose. Here are three of the best-known Etheruem alternatives I think could have a shot of taking market share away from the incumbent over time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nMacro shot of a physical coin from the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: Rcc_Btn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmidst crypto giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana (SOL-USD) emerges as a promising star, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance. Despite a tumultuous journey from $260 to around $25, Solana\u2019s potential remains significant.\n\nSolana is evolving as the \u201cVisa for digital assets\u201c with institutional adoption and scalability advantages. Positioned as an \u201cEthereum challenger,\u201d it excels in decentralized finance and NFTs, making it a crypto contender to watch.\n\nRanked in the top 10 by market cap, Solana holds less than 1% market share. Despite its performance in 2023, its technicals present an appealing case. Overcoming the $27 resistance could trigger substantial upside potential, targeting $32.40 and potentially $40-plus gains in 2023.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nAvalanche AVAX symbol.

        "title": "Choose AWS Graviton and cloud storage for your Ethereum nodes infrastructure on AWS | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "The first question that comes up for everyone who wants to manage their own Ethereum nodes on AWS is how to select the right compute and storage. To answer this question, we ran a series of tests and observed how popular Ethereum Execution Layer (EL) clients go-ethereum with LevelDB (Geth) and Erigon work on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances powered by AWS Graviton processors and with Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) type gp3 and io2 as well as Amazon FSx for OpenZFS. We used Lighthouse as accompanying Consensus Layer client in both cases, but focused our tests on JSON RPC API exposed by EL clients as the most important for the end user experience. First, we benchmarked the EL clients to compare the performance of different EC2 instance types and used EBS io2 volumes with 64,000 operations per second (IOPS) to avoid storage bottlenecks. Then we ran similar tests but now with different storage configurations and high CPU and memory EC2 instance size to isolate the performance comparison of different storage options. Based on the data we gathered, we identified the set of configurations most suitable for nodes that sync with the rest of the network and serve JSON RPC requests.\n\nTesting EC2 instances powered by AWS Graviton\n\nAWS Graviton is an ARM-based CPU designed by AWS to deliver the best price performance for workloads running in Amazon EC2. Multiple versions of the AWS Graviton processor family were released since 2018. AWS Graviton 3 processors are the latest in the AWS Graviton processor family.\n\nWe compared the performance of running two of the most popular EL client configurations, Geth in full node type and Erigon in the only possible for it archive node setup. We tried them on c6g.2xlarge (AWS Graviton 2) and c7g.2xlarge (AWS Graviton3) EC2 instance types and chose the 2xlarge size to follow the recommended minimum of 16 GB RAM for both Geth and Erigon.\n\nFor performance testing, we used the K6 load testing tool by Grafana Labs to generate the load from AWS Cloud9 instances. During the tests, we were initiating as many read transactions as possible for the specified time, typically 20\u201330 minutes. For both Geth and Erigon, we tested two scripted scenarios:\n\nScenario 1 \u2013 We called a single JSON RPC method, eth_estimateGas, which has high CPU utilization and is therefore ideal for testing the processor. To make sure we prevented the EL clients from caching responses, we created a pool of thousands of Ethereum addresses and picked them randomly during the test.\n\n\u2013 We called a single JSON RPC method, eth_estimateGas, which has high CPU utilization and is therefore ideal for testing the processor. To make sure we prevented the EL clients from caching responses, we created a pool of thousands of Ethereum addresses and picked them randomly during the test. Scenario 2 \u2013 We triggered the mix of commonly used JSON RPC methods invoked with the same weight: eth_gasPrice , eth_blockNumber, eth_getBalance , eth_getCode , eth_gasPrice , eth_estimateGas , eth_getBlockByNumber , eth_getTransactionByHash , eth_getTransactionReceipt , and eth_getLogs . We also randomized the data used in requests by choosing random block numbers and picking from a pool of thousands of transaction hashes and addresses for every transaction.\n\nTo make sure the tests were consistent between runs, we used the same operating system (Amazon Linux 2) and the same versions of Geth (v1.10.26) and Erigon (v2.34.0) clients across all instance types. We also used the same storage configuration powered by Amazon EBS type gp3 with 16,000 disk operations per second (IOPS), 1000 MB/s throughput, and capacity of 2 TB for Geth and 3 TB for Erigon. For the duration of the tests, we stopped blockchain synchronization on all clients to prevent unpredictable interference from the syncing process. Finally, we used m5.4xlarge instances for AWS Cloud9 generating JSON RPC requests with the K6 tool and placed it in the same subnet within the same Availability Zone with all target nodes to avoid possible bottlenecks in compute and network.\n\nThe following tables show the max iterations per second we got for both scenarios.\n\nThe first table summarizes the results for Scenario 1 (single JSON RPC method eth_estimateGas ).\n\nInstance Erigon Max Iterations/Sec Geth Max Iterations/Sec c6g.2xlarge 10466.6637 10051.32125 c7g.2xlarge 13931.81629 13875.40971\n\nThe second table summarizes the results for Scenario 2 (mix of commonly used JSON RPC methods).\n\nInstance Erigon Max Iterations/Sec Geth Max Iterations/Sec c6g.2xlarge 5190.03825 325.32374 c7g.2xlarge 6358.26578 488.86294\n\nIn both scenarios, c7g.2xlarge showed the highest maximum iterations per second across Geth and Erigon. Our observation of the efficiency of AWS Graviton-based instances is also similar to Polygon, the Ethereum based scaling platform, which also experienced better performance and lower cost with AWS Graviton for EVM-compatible nodes. You may also notice that Erigon showed higher than Geth with LevelDB performance in Scenario 2 with the mix of commonly used JSON RPC methods. We have fund that for disc-intensive methods, such as eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber , Erigon can show six to thirteen times more iterations per second than Geth with LevelDB, while for CPU-intensive methods like eth_estimateGas the performance is about the same.\n\nEven though C7g costs about 6% more than C6g powered by AWS Graviton 2, from the \u201cperformance for cost\u201d measure it still comes as a leader.\n\nChoosing the storage\n\nBlockchain nodes need storage that can be directly mounted to the file system and sustain a high number of IOPS with low latency. Based on these requirements, we tested Amazon EBS with volume types gp3 and io2 and FSx for OpenZFS. We decided to skip the tests of EC2 instances with an instance store for now because although the data on an instance store is preserved between instance reboots, it doesn\u2019t persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or deleted. That adds operational overhead for the nodes because they have to spend up to multiple hours copying the state data from elsewhere before they get operational. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a popular option among those who run nodes for high-throughput blockchain networks, so we will come back to this option when we start analyzing those.\n\nBoth Amazon EBS gp3 and io2 provide single-digit millisecond latency, but io2 has more consistent performance and therefore lower tail latencies than gp3. Tail latency is the duration of the small percentage of response times from a system that take the longest in comparison to the rest of the response times. However, in our observations for Geth and Erigon, there is no noticeable difference between the performance of io2 and more cost-efficient gp3 when configured with up to 16000 IOPS. That amount of IOPS is usually sufficient for nodes that need to follow the chain head and serve 10\u201315 JSON RPC requests per second. For more performant nodes that need to serve hundreds of JSON RPC requests per second, multiple EBS gp3 volumes can be combined together with RAID 0 to serve 32000 IOPS (two gp3 volumes) or 64000 IOPS (four gp3 volumes). This configuration will be more cost-effective than using a single EBS io2 volume, but with slightly lower performance and more operational overhead.\n\nFSx for OpenZFS can be mounted to the nodes\u2019 file system over a Network File System (NFS) protocol. It showed performance similar to both mentioned Amazon EBS options, but with slightly higher latency. Its advantage is fast provisioning of new volumes on the same file system. The built-in volumes cloning concept allows you to save time of copying state data during initialization and get new nodes up and running quickly. It also helps to save space because new volumes are created as children of older volumes and file reads will be served from parent blocks until the data on them is changed. Only when the data is changed it is copied to the new volume. Unfortunately, Erigon can\u2019t work with disk volumes through NFS protocol, so in our tests, FSx for OpenZFS only worked for Geth. Considering the costs of FSx for OpenZFS, if you don\u2019t need to provision new nodes as quickly as possible and accept about 30 minutes to 1 hour of initialization time, then Amazon EBS gp3 is still the more cost-effective option.\n\nChoosing the configurations\n\nThe goal of our analysis was to find the combinations of Graviton-powered EC2 instances and storage that will be cost-effective and performant. Most Ethereum clients combine functions of syncing with other nodes in the blockchain network and serving the JSON RPC API to decentralized applications (dApps). Processing JSON RPC requests takes more resources than just syncing the data, but at the same time not everyone needs the nodes for dApps. Some use nodes only as the reliable feed of blockchain network data for analytics systems or locally-stored snapshots. Therefore, we came up with multiple configurations based on the role the node plays.\n\nConfigurations for sync nodes\n\nThe purpose of the sync node is to catch up with the chain head. In addition to stress tests that we ran to identify better-suited compute and storage, we also left sync nodes running for a week and then let AWS Compute Optimizer advise us on the sizes for compute and storage. Finally, we ran those setups for a few more days. The following table summarizes the final configurations.\n\nEL + CL Combination Instance Type EBS Volume Geth + Lighthouse/Prysm r6g.2xlarge GP3 \u2013 3000 IOPS, 200 MBps throughput Erigon + Lighthouse r6g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 5900 IOPS, 125 MBps throughput Nethermind + Teku r6g.2xlarge GP3 \u2013 3000 IOPS, 125 MBps throughput Besu + Teku m6g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 3000 IOPS, 125 MBps throughput\n\nConfigurations for RPC nodes\n\nRPC nodes serve requests from dApps while also staying in sync with the rest of the Ethereum network. The configurations in the following table assume the nodes with Erigon will handle below 30 requests per second of storage-intensive trace_block RPC method, while still following the chain head.\n\nEL + CL Combination Instance Type EBS Volume Geth + Lighthouse/Prysm m7g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 16000 IOPS, 1000 MBps throughput Erigon + Lighthouse m7g.4xlarge GP3 \u2013 16000 IOPS, 1000 MBps throughput\n\nFurther tests also showed that the Erigon with Lighthouse combination can sustain about 300 RPC requests per second on m7g.16xlarge and 4 EBS gp3 volumes with 16000 IOPS and 1000 Mbps throughput configured as RAID 0 volume. We also found that from a performance perspective on a mixed JSON RPC test scenario, one Erigon-powered node can be used as a replacement of two Geth-powered nodes on a similar setup.\n\nConsiderations\n\nThe analysis and the recommendations in this post assume that you run Ethereum nodes for your own needs. Those who provide nodes as a service to others, like node operators, might consider building more sophisticated architectures and end up with different configurations. For example, you may consider using EC2 instances types with an instance store to get the storage performance at the levels of EBS io2 and benefit from compute savings plans to pay less for both compute and storage. If you\u2019d prefer to get new nodes up and running as fast as possible, you might still use FSx for OpenZFS to benefit from fast volume provisioning.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post we shared the configurations of compute and storage that we found suitable for running Ethereum nodes on AWS. Through our tests and observations, we found that AWS Graviton-based instances, particularly the C7g and M7g instance types demonstrated good performance and cost-effectiveness for popular EL clients like Geth and Erigon. The M7g has more memory than C7g and that helps to both serve JSON RPC requests and follow the chain head.\n\nAs for the storage, both Amazon EBS with gp3 and io2 volume types and FSx for OpenZFS provided suitable options. Although io2 volumes offer more consistent performance, gp3 volumes configured with sufficient IOPS proved to be a cost-effective choice. FSx for OpenZFS also showed good results, especially for speeding up horizontal scaling, although it\u2019s not compatible with the Erigon client.\n\nOur recommended configurations vary based on the node\u2019s role, whether it\u2019s a sync node or an RPC node serving dApps. The suggested instance types and EBS volumes provide a good balance between performance and cost-effectiveness, enabling nodes to synchronize with the network and handle RPC requests efficiently.\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, it\u2019s essential to stay informed about new developments and updates that may impact node configurations in the future. Regular monitoring and evaluation of performance and cost-efficiency are necessary to ensure optimal node operation and maintain a reliable service for the Ethereum network and dApps.

ETH whales seem to accumulate, and the $1,620 support could be the key.\n\nEthereum is struggling to rise above the $1,680 and $1,700 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,670 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a decent increase above the $1,670 and $1,700 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a short-term upside correction above the $1,650 level. ETH even climbed above the $1,670 level but the bears were active near the $1,700 zone, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price traded as high as $1,698 and is currently moving lower. There was a drop below the $1,670 level. The price even tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,580 swing low to the $1,698 high.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,670 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,665 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,670 level and the trend line zone. The next resistance is near the $1,700 zone. To start a decent recovery wave, the price must settle above the $1,700 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,780 level, above which the price could rise toward the $1,820 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,640 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,620 zone or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,580 swing low to the $1,698 high. The next key support is close to $1,600. If there is a downside break below $1,600, there could be more losses. The next major support is near the $1,520 support level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,440 level or even $1,320.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "PancakeSwap v3, a popular multi-chain DeFi exchange, announced its launch on the Ethereum layer 2 network Linea on Aug. 24.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s deployment on Linea introduces two new features. The first is improved capital efficiency, which will allow liquidity providers to focus their capital within specific price ranges where maximum trading occurs. This feature is intended to help participants increase their earnings. PancakeSwap claims that liquidity providers can achieve a capital multiplier up to 4000 times greater on v3 than v2.\n\nThe second feature that Linea will facilitate is enhanced trading features. PancakeSwap said the launch will provide multi-tier fee structures, allowing traders to access low trading fees. Fee tiers will range from 0.01% to 1%, and users will be able to choose a fee structure that is best for their trading activities and liquidity pool of choice.\n\nPancakeSwap also advertised a promotional activity called \u201cTraverse the Treasure Islands\u201d and said users can earn rewards by participating in activities. This campaign presents an opportunity to earn loyalty points and gain access to commemorative NFTs, further indicating the platform\u2019s engagement with its community.\n\nPancakeSwap added that if it receives Linea incentives, it will partially distribute those rewards to stakeholders who stake its CAKE token and other project contributors and community members. However, it said Linea has not announced any such rewards.\n\nThough today\u2019s announcement marks its mainnet launch, PancakeSwap noted that it previously deployed on Linea as a testnet ecosystem partner.\n\nProjects populate DeFi ecosystem\n\nLinea is a layer 2 network for Ethereum. Like most layer 2 networks, it intends to improve transaction efficiency by increasing transaction speeds and reducing fees. The platform is developed by ConsenSys and was formerly known as ConsenSys zkEVM.\n\nPancakeSwap itself is available on several different blockchain networks. The project originated on Binance Smart Chain (now known as BNB Chain). Other supported networks include Ethereum, Aptos, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era, and Arbitrum. PancakeSwap v3 went live on BNB Chain and Ethereum in April 2023.\n\nPancakeSwap is currently the 13th largest DeFi platform by total value locked (TVL), with $1.4 billion of crypto locked by users at present. Its native token (CAKE) is among the 130 largest cryptocurrencies and has a market cap of $273 million."

        "title": "Step-By-Step Guide: How To Bridge Ethereum On Different Blockchains - Milk Road",
        "content": "Introduction To Bridging\n\nAs of August 21, 2023, there are 204 blockchains listed on DefiLlama. Each chain is accompanied by unique protocols to explore, different levels of speed and security and a loyal community.\n\nThe problem? Blockchains are not able to communicate with one another.\n\nIf you hold assets on Ethereum, you are not able to use those assets in protocols that are deployed on other blockchains. And if you want to purchase a token on a blockchain like Optimism, you need to find a way to get your funds there.\n\nThat\u2019s where bridges come in. They allow users to send crypto from one blockchain to another, while ensuring that funds are transferred 1:1.\n\nNo blockchain is created equal. And with all of the recent hype around Layer 2s (L2s) and VC funding pouring into new chains, we decided to send the Milk Man into the multi-chain world.\n\nWhy Use A Bridge\n\nBridging to new networks can offer several benefits:\n\nFirst off, new blockchains are often filled with early opportunities. While Ethereum has been known to be the gold standard, it is more expensive to transact on and less scalable than other blockchains. This makes it difficult to deploy applications that require a high frequency of transactions, such as trading or gaming.\n\nEmerging blockchains are also a hotbed for new protocols to launch on. Being early to new trends and applications can pay serious dividends, but also brings greater risk. And when you account for the lower gas fees on other networks, it becomes much easier to transact and explore new things on-chain.\n\nLastly, interacting with a new blockchain could make you eligible for an airdrop. The biggest Layer 2 blockchains to date, Optimism and Arbitrum, both rewarded their early network users with a lucrative airdrop. And it is widely expected that others will follow in their footsteps.\n\nWhy We Bridged Ethereum\n\nIn Milk Road\u2019s case, we decided to bridge for two reasons:\n\n1/ To show Roaders what all the hype is about. We told you we would be getting our hands dirty, so it wouldn\u2019t be fair for us to only stick with Ethereum.\n\nWe want Roaders to see everything that the world of DeFi has to offer. And that includes getting out of our comfort zone to interact with new and innovative protocols.\n\n2/ To set us up to explore emerging protocols in the future. Bridging is the first step towards diving into other networks.\n\nThis will act as a precursor for some of the other things we will be doing with our public wallet. It also gives us the resources to be ready to take action on abrupt events, like the recent launch of Coinbase\u2019s blockchain.\n\nWhat We Did \u2013 Bridging Ethereum On Three Blockchains\n\nWe bridged 0.5 ETH to three different layer-2 blockchains:\n\nArbitrum\n\nWe bridged to Arbitrum because it has been the most widely adopted L2 by almost every metric. First off, L2Beat states that Arbitrum is currently holding ~56% of the total TVL locked in L2s.\n\nTVL refers to the amount of funds that are locked in smart contracts on the network. This includes funds that are being staked, providing liquidity to DeFi or being used in other activities such as lending. While not a perfect metric, TVL gives you a glimpse into the strength and adoption of a blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum is in a league of its own when it comes to deployed protocols and active users. Arbitrum\u2019s blockchain had ~150,000 daily active users on August 22nd. This was more than half of Ethereum\u2019s count on this day.\n\nLastly, Arbitrum is home to over 400 protocols, with many of these being native to the network. Arbitrum\u2019s ability to transact much cheaper than Ethereum has allowed new innovation to be launched. We will be exploring some of these in the future!\n\nOptimism\n\nOptimism is the clear second winner in terms of adoption. While it has significantly less TVL (27%) and protocols (179) than Arbitrum, it recently surpassed Arbitrum in daily transactions due to their ever-growing list of partnerships.\n\nOptimism recently launched the OP Stack, a way for others to utilize Optimism\u2019s resources to launch their own L2 networks. And its initial success has been very promising with two recent launches generating a lot of attention: Base chain and Worldcoin.\n\nSince Optimism has established itself as a major player in L2 wars, we want to have some funds here ready to act on future developments and opportunities.\n\nBase\n\nCoinbase recently launched their own L2, Base. And it has raised all kinds of excitement from the crypto community.\n\nIt started off with a tribute to Brian Armstrong called the $BALD coin. This coin was one of the fastest rising token launches ever, reaching $100M before there was even a way to withdraw funds from Base\u2019s chain. This token was later rug pulled with rumors the creator was SBF.\n\nMore recently, Friend.Tech launched on Base and took Twitter by storm. This application introduced a market to trade shares of creators and influencers. And it generated $1.5M in revenue on August 21st alone, only being beaten by Lido and Ethereum itself.\n\nThe ongoing craziness accompanied by the backing of Coinbase makes the Base chain a very interesting avenue to explore. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s best guess what happens next there.\n\nStep By Step: How To Bridge ETH\n\nStep 1: Choosing A Bridge\n\nThe first thing to be aware of is that there are many different bridges available to users. When choosing which is the best fit for your needs, there are two things to consider:\n\nCost: In addition to gas fees for using the network, bridges also contain a bridge fee charged by the protocol itself. These typically range anywhere from 0.05-0.30% of the transaction volume.\n\nTiming: Some bridges have a wait time until you can access your assets, often being 7 days. Other bridges may allow you to receive the funds in as quick as a few minutes, but these may bring higher costs or lower security.\n\nStep 2: How To Bridge\n\nNow that you are familiar with the concept, bridging assets is just as simple as making a swap. To show you, we are going to dive into a screenshot from Stargate\u2019s bridge:\n\nTo start, connect your wallet to the site and select \u201cTransfer\u201d from the top bar.\n\nThe top rectangle represents the origin, where you are bridging assets from. Simply select the token you want to transfer and the blockchain you want to transfer from.\n\nwhere you are bridging assets from. Simply select the token you want to transfer and the blockchain you want to transfer from. The bottom rectangle is your destination chain. Ensure you have the correct network selected and it will show you your expected output.\n\nEnsure you have the correct network selected and it will show you your expected output. Ensure that you have the gas fees to cover the transaction and confirm it in your wallet.\n\nDepending on network congesting and the involved networks, your assets should arrive in a few minutes.\n\nStep 3: Managing A Multi-Chain Portfolio\n\nNow that we have assets all over, we need a way to stay on top of our portfolio.\n\nHere\u2019s our two favorite ways to see our assets in one place:\n\n1/ MetaMask Portfolio dApp: This is the quickest method, as you can view your portfolio directly from your wallet. They also provide you with basic data and allow you to export everything to Excel yourself. Learn more about MetaMask Portfolio and how it works.\n\n2/ DeBank: DeBank is great for those who want to dive deeper. They offer a wider range of blockchains to track, and organize wallets by chain and activity. You can also use DeBank as a social media site. Give us a follow!\n\nBridging Directly In MetaMask Portfolio\n\nIn addition to buying crypto or swapping tokens, MetaMask also has a bridge built directly into their portfolio dApp.\n\nYou can access this feature by opening your wallet and navigating to the bridge tab on the home page:\n\nYou will then be brought to the portfolio dApp, where you simply need to choose the origin network, the destination and the token you want to transfer:\n\nIt is important to note that MetaMask offers a convenient way to bridge, but they have a higher fee than the average bridge.\n\nConcerns Around Bridging\n\nBridging has been revolutionary and opened up a whole new world for crypto users. However, bridges are not perfect and users should be aware of the risks associated with using them.\n\nFirst off, bridging costs users a fee just like any service. It is important to consider the bridge fee, amount bridged and current network fees to ensure you want to transact. You will also need to ensure that you have native tokens on the destination network to cover gas fees.\n\nAnother consideration is that in some cases, there may also be wait times to have your funds available. Sometimes this is done by the bridge itself in order to verify the funds and transactions. In other cases, congestion of the blockchain can cause delays.\n\nLastly and most importantly, bridges have been prone to hacks and exploits in the past. Since bridges need to lock large amounts of funds in smart contracts, they are attractive targets for bad actors on the blockchain.\n\nAnd this cannot be understated. In 2022, bridges were involved in \u2157 of the biggest hacks of the year. In total, 70% of all funds lost to exploits last year came from bridges.\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that we have assets on several blockchains, things are going to start to get interesting! We will be exploring some new and interesting protocols in the near future and continuing to provide Roaders with the full tour of the blockchain.\n\nFor now, you can track our wallet on their own through DeBank.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitstamp to terminate staking service in the US on September 25.\n\nStaking is viewed as an unregistered security within SEC crypto crackdown.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp will stop offering Ethereum (ETH) staking services to users in the United States in a month.\n\n\u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until September 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked. Rewards, along with the principal, will be credited to users\u2019 main Bitstamp account balances,\u201d explained Bobby Zagotta, U.S. CEO and global CFO at Bitstamp.\n\nZagotta also added it could take a few days for the modifications to appear on users\u2019 balances.\n\nIn addition, Bitstamp stated that customers\u2019 primary account balances would be rewarded with incentives such as the initial amount deposited. It also said that, depending on the state of the network, this process could take several days.\n\nChanges Linked to Regulatory Pressures\n\nBitstamp website states that a 15% commission is applied to all staking payouts \u2013 the monthly return for staking Ethereum is 4.50%; in contrast, the monthly payout for staking Algorand is 1.60%.\n\nWith thIS change, the us will now join Canada, Japan, Singapore, and the UK in not offering Bitstamp staking services.\n\nBitstamp choice was made in response to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moves to examine websites providing staking services.\n\nIn litigation SEC launched against cryptocurrency businesses in June, it asserted that staking services provided by Coinbase and Binance constitute securities.\n\nAs part of a $30 million settlement , US regulator also ordered Kraken to stop providing its staking service in the US in February. Any of those activities might have had an impact on Bitstamp\u2019s choice to disable Ethereum staking for users in the States.\n\nBitstamp To Delist 7 American Tokens\n\nIn response to changes in American regulation, Bitstamp earlier announced on August 8 that it will stop trading seven cryptocurrency coins in the United States.\n\nUpdate for our US users \ud83d\udce2 Starting August 29: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected. More info:\u2026 \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 8, 2023\n\nAccording to recent legal developments in the US, at least seven alternative currencies would no longer be available in the nation. Solana, Decentraland, Polygon, Near, Axie Infinity, Chiliz (CHZ), Chiliz (CHZ), and The Sandbox were interested by this move.\n\nSEC declared all seven tokens will be unregistered securities in June as part of its legal actions against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, despite a lack of explanation for the suspension of trade.\n\nThe decision appeared to be a response to the ongoing SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase stated above, even though Bitstamp did not specifically reference the developments in question.\n\nBy August 29, 2023, US customers will not be able to trade these coins.\n\nETH Staking In the Rise\n\nDespite last week crypto market collapse, on-chain data for the second-largest digital asset globally indicate a rising resilience.\n\nEven though there were worries that the Shanghai-Capella fork would have the opposite effect on price, it has merely boosted demand for ether (ETH). Instead, utility and demand have skyrocketed, as others correctly expected.\n\nTotal Value Staked for the asset has risen steadily, reflecting an underlying demand. According to data , the amount increased from 26.3 million ETH to 27.8 million, up by 5.7% on a monthly basis.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to pay less attention to short-term volatility as a result of the expansion of liquid staking tokens (LSTs).\n\nEther Mostly Referred to As a Commodity\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether, is second in terms of market capitalization to Bitcoin.\n\nWhether to classify ETH as a security or a commodity is a key concern in the current regulatory landscape in the U.S.\n\nWhile SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, stated at an April hearing that Bitcoin was a commodity but didn\u2019t say whether ETH could be classified as a security, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has consistently referred to Ether as a commodity."

        "content": "Over the last week, Ethereum (ETH) has seen its price take a slight hit following the general market crash due to reports of a massive Bitcoin sell-off.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is down by 5.01% in the last seven days, bringing its total price loss in the previous month to 10.80%.\n\nAlbeit, despite Ethereum\u2019s negative performance, the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, has noted some positive developments in terms of whale activity.\n\nEthereum Experiences Highest Whale Activity In 4 Months\n\nOn Thursday, August 24, Santiment posted a report on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Ethereum has recorded its largest level of whale transactions in the last 16 weeks.\n\nAccording to the blockchain intelligence firm, there has been a notable increase in transactions by addresses with large ETH holdings following the token\u2019s fall beneath the 1,650 price mark last week.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum\u2018s network has picked up in large address activity during this drop below $1,650 and its highly volatile price conditions. The amount of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 $ETH has risen back up to 355K, and $100K+ transactions have surged. https://t.co/X137U93ZYu pic.twitter.com/J9lyMoeBmf \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 24, 2023\n\nSentiment reported that Ethereum experienced 23,073 ETH whale transactions in the past week, marking the network\u2019s highest since May 4.\n\nIn addition, the report also stated that the number of wallets with 10-10,000 ETH had surged by 1,788 since the start of June, returning this metric to the previous high of 355,000.\n\nCould The ETH Market Experience A Boost Soon?\n\nBased on Santiment\u2019s report, it can be inferred that the decline in ETH\u2019s price has led to a buying spree by large investors anticipating a price surge, thus taking advantage of the current market dip.\n\nProviding more insight into this trend, Lookonchain, another market intelligence firm, has also reported on the ongoing accumulation of ETH.\n\nVia an X post on Thursday, Lookonchain stated that four whales have collectively purchased 56,100 ETH, valued at $94 million, in the last seven days.\n\nFollowing such heavy investments, it appears that ETH major investors are banking on the prominent altcoin to begin a market rebound soon.\n\nHowever, data from Coincodex states that general market sentiments around ETH remain bearish. At the same time, the Fear & Greed Index is set at 41, indicating that many other investors are still skeptical about the token\u2019s potential gains.\n\nETH is trading at $1,652.06 at the time of writing, with a 1.861% loss on the last day. In tandem, the token\u2019s trading volume is also down by 31.07%, valued at $5.67 billion.\n\nNotwithstanding, with a market cap value of $198.36 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nETH trading at $1,652.4 on the weekly chart | Source: ETHUSD chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from BBC Wildlife Magazine, chart from Tradingview.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Similarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Comprehensive Comparison\n\n\u200dCryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, and two of the most prominent players in this space are Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhile they have their unique characteristics, they also share several similarities.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the similarities between Bitcoin and Ethereum, shedding light on their decentralized nature, blockchain technology, digital currencies, limited supply, and cryptographic protocols.\n\nBy understanding these similarities, newcomers and enthusiasts alike can gain a deeper understanding of how these giants differ from one another.\n\nAlso read: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nSimilarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nDecentralization: The Backbone of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum operate on a peer-to-peer network without the need for a central authority or intermediary.\n\nThey are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any government, bank, or financial institution.\n\nThis decentralized nature is one of the core principles of cryptocurrencies, as it ensures that no single entity has control over the network.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on a network of nodes spread across the globe to validate and record transactions.\n\nBlockchain Technology: Similarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum utilize blockchain technology to maintain a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions.\n\nThe blockchain serves as a public record that verifies and stores every transaction made on the network.\n\nThis technology ensures the integrity and security of the network by eliminating the need for a central authority to validate transactions.\n\nInstead, a consensus mechanism involves a network of nodes validating transactions.\n\nSource: Inventiva\n\nCryptographic Protocols: Ensuring Security and Authenticity\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum employ cryptographic protocols to secure their networks and ensure the validity and authenticity of transactions.\n\nThese protocols use advanced mathematical algorithms to encrypt and verify transactions, making them secure and resistant to tampering.\n\nCryptographic protocols play a crucial role in maintaining the trust and security of both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.\n\nAlso read: Will Dogecoin realistically sponsor this Formula 1 team?\n\nDigital Currencies: The Future of Transactions\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies that exist solely in a digital form.\n\nThey can be used to buy goods and services, making them a viable alternative to traditional currencies. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to gain widespread recognition, and it paved the way for the emergence of other digital currencies, including Ethereum.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum offer fast and secure transactions, making them attractive options for individuals and businesses alike.\n\nLimited Supply: Scarcity and Value\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have a limited supply, which adds to their value and scarcity.\n\nBitcoin has a maximum supply hard cap of 21 million coins, while Ethereum does not have a hard limit but has a maximum limit of 18 million new Ethereum tokens per year.\n\nThis limited supply guarantees the preservation of these cryptocurrencies\u2019 value over time, much like the valuation of precious metals such as gold and silver.\n\nName Recognition and Reach\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhen it comes to name recognition and reach, no other cryptocurrencies come close to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, they receive vastly more exposure than others, and their respective communities are also growing rapidly.\n\nBitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, has become synonymous with the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nEthereum, created by Vitalik Buterin, has gained significant traction as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nCommunity Growth and Focus\n\nThe communities surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum have distinct focuses and goals.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is primarily focused on financial privacy, autonomy, and cutting out the middleman. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and limited supply align with the community\u2019s desire for independence from traditional financial systems.\n\nConversely, the Ethereum community concentrates on crafting a decentralized, open-source platform that developers can use to construct applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract functionality and programmability make it an attractive option for developers seeking to create innovative solutions.\n\nTransaction Speed: A Comparison\n\nTransaction speed is an important factor to consider when comparing cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is generally faster than Bitcoin in terms of transaction speed.\n\nThe Ethereum network can handle up to 15 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can only handle up to 5.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Ethereum\u2019s faster speed comes at the cost of higher fees, as the increased transaction throughput puts additional strain on the network.\n\nProgramming Language: Turing-Complete vs. Limited Scripting\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin differ in terms of their programming languages.\n\nEthereum uses a Turing-complete programming language, allowing developers to write any program on the Ethereum network. This flexibility enables the creation of complex decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin uses a limited scripting language primarily used for simple transactions. While Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is less versatile, it is sufficient for its intended use as a digital currency.\n\nCreator: Satoshi Nakamoto vs. Vitalik Buterin\n\nSource: Bitcoin.com\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have distinct creators with different levels of visibility.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, an individual or group using a pseudonym, brought Bitcoin into existence, and their actual identity remains undisclosed.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s invention of Bitcoin revolutionized the financial industry and laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, was created by Vitalik Buterin, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency community. Buterin\u2019s vision for Ethereum as a decentralized platform for applications has garnered significant attention and support.\n\nConclusion: Similarities Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin and Ethereum are both valuable cryptocurrencies with unique features and use cases. While they share similarities such as decentralization, blockchain technology, and limited supply, their differences in technology, use cases, and communities set them apart.\n\nPeople primarily use Bitcoin to store value and exchange goods, while Ethereum functions as a platform for creating decentralized applications and executing smart contracts.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to play essential roles in driving innovation and adoption.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in investing in Bitcoin or Ethereum, it\u2019s important to research and understand the risks involved.\n\nCryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can experience significant price fluctuations. It\u2019s advisable to consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions."

        "content": "Crypto exchange Bitstamp will end Ethereum (ETH) staking services for U.S. customers within a month, according to a statement on Aug. 23.\n\nThe company said:\n\n\u201cCustomers will continue earning staking rewards up until [Sept.] 25, 2023, and after that, all staked assets will be unstaked.\u201d\n\nBitstamp added that rewards and principal (i.e., the original amount deposited) would be credited to users\u2019 primary account balances. The company also suggested that this process could take multiple days and may be affected by network conditions.\n\nThe alteration in services seems to leave Bitstamp\u2019s U.S. users without any staking options. Though the platform also offers Algorand (ALGO) staking, that feature is already unavailable in the United States. Furthermore, Ethereum and Algorand staking are currently unavailable in Canada, Japan, Singapore, and the U.K.\n\nThe decision comes in the aftermath of actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has recently scrutinized platforms offering staking services.\n\nMost notably, the securities regulator claimed that staking services offered by Coinbase and Binance are securities in lawsuits that it filed against each crypto company in June. The SEC also compelled Kraken to stop offering its staking service in the U.S. as part of a $30 million settlement in February. Any of those actions may have influenced Bitstamp\u2019s decision to remove the option from U.S. users.\n\nBitstamp to delist seven U.S. tokens\n\nBitstamp previously said on Aug. 8 that it would halt trading for seven cryptocurrency tokens in the U.S. due to regulatory developments in the country.\n\nThough Bitstamp did not explicitly name the developments in question, the decision seemed to be a reaction to the ongoing SEC cases against Binance and Coinbase mentioned above. Those cases classified the implicated tokens as securities.\n\nThe affected tokens are set to be removed from U.S. users\u2019 trading options by Aug. 29, 2023.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "There\u2019s three ways to buy Ethereum with Paypal in 2023. If you\u2019re in the United States, you can buy ETH directly on the PayPal platform. Otherwise, you can use PayPal to buy Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange, or use eToro.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll show you the three methods of buying Ethereum with PayPal, and explain the pros and cons of each method. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nMethod 1: Buy Ethereum directly on PayPal\n\nThe most straightforward way to buy Ethereum with PayPal is to simply buy ETH on the PayPal app directly. However, please keep in mind that this feature is only available for customers in the United States and United States Territories (excluding Hawaii).\n\nPayPal made waves back in 2020 when it first offered its customers to buy crypto directly on the PayPal platform. PayPal\u2019s selection of cryptocurrencies is quite limited but it does include Ethereum, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe fees for buying Ethereum directly on PayPal depend on how much ETH you\u2019re buying. In addition to the fee, PayPal also charges a spread on each cryptocurrency purchase or sale. You\u2019ll be informed about all the additional costs that will apply before you buy or sell a cryptocurrency on PayPal. Here\u2019s a breakdown of PayPal\u2019s crypto fees as of August 2023:\n\nValue of purchased or sold crypto Fee $1 - $4.99 $0.49 $5 - $24.99 $0.99 $25 - $74.99 $1.99 $75 - $200 $2.49 $200.01 - $1,000 1.8% $1,000.01 and above 1.5%\n\nThese fees are quite high compared to most cryptocurrency exchanges. However, if you already have a PayPal account and don\u2019t want to create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, the convenience might be worth the higher fees.\n\nAfter you buy Ethereum on PayPal, you can hold it, sell it, use it to make purchases, send it to another user with a PayPal account, or send it to an external cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nMethod 2: Buy Ethereum with PayPal on a crypto exchange\n\nThe two cryptocurrency exchanges where you can buy Ethereum with PayPal are Coinbase and Bitstamp. Both are considered as very safe and reliable exchanges, but please keep in mind that they charge substantial fees on crypto purchases made via PayPal.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase is a solid cryptocurrency exchange to use if you are looking to buy crypto with PayPal, especially if you\u2019re based in the United States. If you\u2019re a United States user, you can deposit funds to your Coinbase account via PayPal. Otherwise, you can still buy cryptocurrency with PayPal on Coinbase, but you won\u2019t be able to make a deposit.\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Coinbase also gives users the option to cash out to their PayPal account.\n\nIn order to use PayPal with Coinbase, go to your account\u2019s \u201cSettings\u201d section and then select \u201cPayment Methods\u201d. The next step is to select \u201cLink a New Account\u201d and choose PayPal from the list of payment options. You will then be guided through the process of linking your Coinbase account with your PayPal account.\n\nHowever, using PayPal to buy Ethereum on Coinbase comes with considerable fees. If you\u2019re directly purchasing crypto on Coinbase with PayPal, the transaction is subject to a 3.99% fee. Meanwhile, USD deposits via PayPal to Coinbase come with a 2.5% fee.\n\nFor more information about using PayPal with Coinbase, please refer to the exchange\u2019s PayPal FAQ.\n\nBuy Ethereum on Coinbase\n\nBitstamp\n\nBitstamp is one of the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges in the market, as it has been operating successfully since 2011. In 2022, Bitstamp added support for PayPal as a payment method, which makes it possible for their customers to buy Ethereum with PayPal.\n\nAfter creating an account on Bitstamp, you\u2019ll need to link your PayPal account to Bitstamp. When making a cryptocurrency purchase, choose PayPal as your payment method. Then, you will be redirected to the PayPal website where you will be able to authorize linking your PayPal account and Bitstamp.\n\nThen, you will be able to buy any cryptocurrency listed on Bitstamp using your PayPal account. However, you must keep in mind that you will be charged a considerable 4% fee on your purchase when buying crypto on Bitstamp with PayPal. You can buy up to $2,500 worth of crypto with PayPal on Bitstamp per day, or $20,000 per month.\n\nBuy Ethereum on Bitstamp\n\nMethod 3: Buy Ethereum with PayPal on eToro\n\neToro is a very popular trading platform where users can trade stocks, commodities, forex markets, and also cryptocurrencies. eToro supports PayPal deposits, so you can fund your account with PayPal and then use the balance to purchase Ethereum.\n\nWhen it comes to buying cryptocurrency on eToro, it\u2019s important to mention one caveat. You cannot directly withdraw cryptocurrency to an external wallet of your choice, as you have to first withdraw the coins to the eToro Money crypto wallet.\n\neToro charges a fee when transferring crypto from the main eToro platform to the eToro Money wallet. The fee is 2% of the value of the transferred cryptocurrency. The minimum fee you\u2019ll be paying is $1, but it won\u2019t exceed $100 regardless of how much crypto you\u2019re transferring. Of course, you\u2019ll also have to pay the fee that\u2019s required by the blockchain network you\u2019ll be transferring your crypto on.\n\nBuy Ethereum on eToro\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIt\u2019s hard to recommend PayPal as a good method for buying Ethereum because you will likely be paying a significant amount in fees. Probably the best option to buy Ethereum with PayPal is to buy it on the PayPal platform directly, provided that you live in a country where this feature is supported.\n\nTheoretically, you could also buy Ethereum with PayPal using a P2P crypto marketplace that lists Ethereum and allows sellers to use PayPal as a payment method. However, we haven\u2019t been able to find any such examples at the moment except for Bybit\u2019s P2P marketplace, where there wasn\u2019t a single ETH seller that accepted PayPal at the time of writing this article.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more efficient ways of investing in ETH, make sure to check out our full guide on how to buy Ethereum.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow to buy Ethereum with PayPal?\n\nIf you live in the United States, you can buy Ethereum directly on the PayPal platform. Otherwise, you can use a cryptocurrency exchange that accepts PayPal as a payment method \u2014 examples include Coinbase and Bitstamp. The third option is to use PayPal to make a deposit on eToro and buy ETH there."

        "content": "The total staked ETH was almost 28 million.\n\nStaked ETH currently makes up 21.8% of the total ETH supply.\n\nEthereum [ETH] staking has developed a distinct trajectory, separate from the price trends. As more of the circulating supply gets locked up in staking, one particular metric is experiencing a decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum staking on the rise\n\nRecent data from CryptoQuant indicated a steady upward trajectory in Ethereum\u2019s total staked value. As of this writing, nearly 28 million ETH were staked, in sharp contrast to the approximately 16 million ETH staked in January. This signified a substantial increase in staking volume.\n\nAccording to CryptoMarketCap, the total circulating supply of ETH had surpassed 120 million as of this writing. Additionally, data from Dune Analytics revealed that the staked portion constituted more than 21.8% of the total supply, implying that nearly 22% of the entire ETH supply was staked at press time.\n\nConsidering the daily staking rate, this proportion is anticipated to rise further. However, it\u2019s worth noting that while staking potential was on the rise, there was an opposing trend in the supply of ETH on exchanges.\n\nExchanges see less and less Ethereum\n\nIn January, the proportion of the entire Ethereum supply held on exchanges exceeded 11%. Nonetheless, this metric has undergone a substantial reduction in recent months.\n\nAs of this writing, the percentage of the circulating supply residing on exchanges hovered around 8.5%. Also, this shift signified a decrease from the January figure of over 13 million to approximately 10.7 million on exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, this reflected a scenario where an increasing number of holders were inclined to stake their ETH. Furthermore, it demonstrated that a smaller proportion opted to retain their holdings on exchanges.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH volume sees a slight decline\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges has had repercussions on its trading volume, as highlighted by Santiment. The volume chart revealed that while ETH was still experiencing a respectable trading volume, it paled compared to the volume recorded at the start of the year.\n\nAs of this writing, the trading volume was approximately 5 billion. Furthermore, this figure falls several billion short of the average volume exceeding 7 billion observed around January."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA slew of failures of centralized crypto exchanges and services over the past year has done little to stem consistent outflows from decentralized finance (DeFi) during that time, data shows.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, less than $38 billion in value remains locked within DeFi protocols across chains, down from $178 billion at the industry\u2019s height in November 2021. Almost $21.8 billion of that is currently held in Ethereum protocols.\n\nThe overall figure even falls short of the ~$40 billion in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi shortly after centralized exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, which cratered the amount of many assets locked within such protocols to a two-year low at the time. Centralized crypto lenders including BlockFi, Genesis, and Gemini Earn also collapsed amid the surrounding contagion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough TVL rose back to roughly $50 billion in April as the market recovered, the metric quickly retraced below $38 billion despite its underlying crypto values sliding relatively little over this period.\n\nThe $37.6 billion figure does not include funds locked in popular liquid staking protocols like Lido, which has more than doubled its TVL from $6 billion to $13.95 billion since FTX fell apart. As DeFiLlama notes, such protocols \"deposit into another protocol,\" so it's not counted in that tally.\n\nSimilarly, after launching in September 2022, Coinbase\u2019s staking service has accumulated an additional $2.1 billion worth of ETH. In total, such services contain another $20.2 billion in assets alone.\n\nLiquid staking allows investors to stake their assets and earn yield, while still having access to trading liquidity through pegged assets issued by the staking provider (such as cbETH and stETH).\n\nThis can be a more attractive alternative for investors than using a lending protocol like Aave, which forces users to lock their tokens and possibly be subject to unwanted protocol risk. At present, Aave\u2019s ETH and USDC yield rates are 1.63% and 2.43% respectively, versus Coinbase\u2019s 3.65% ETH staking rate, and 4.5% USDC rate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAave\u2019s total value locked has fallen 21% over the past month to just $4.5 billion, while Curve Finance has slid 26% to $2.3 billion.\n\nOutside of DeFi, the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish monetary policy has driven up yields on short-term government debt, potentially looking more attractive to investors than what stablecoin yields can offer."

        "content": "Where to Store Ethereum Safely: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n\u200dCryptocurrencies have gained immense popularity in recent years, with Ethereum being one of the leading players in the market.\n\nAs an Ethereum investor, it is crucial to understand the importance of securely storing your ETH assets.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the various options available for storing Ethereum safely, ensuring that your investments are protected.\n\nSo, let\u2019s dive in and discover the best practices for storing your valuable Ethereum assets.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin Moves 600 ETH to Coinbase, What\u2019s the Motive?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nWhat is an Ethereum wallet?\n\nBefore we explore the safest ways to store Ethereum, it is essential to understand what an Ethereum wallet is.\n\nAn Ethereum wallet is a software application or hardware device that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and manage your Ethereum-based assets.\n\nThink of it as a digital wallet that enables you to store, send, and receive ETH.\n\nAn Ethereum wallet consists of two main components: a public address and a private key.\n\nThe public address serves as your unique identifier on the Ethereum network and is used to receive funds.\n\nOn the other hand, the private key is a secret code that grants you access to your Ethereum holdings and allows you to initiate transactions.\n\nAlso read: BRICS Expansion Projected To Reduce 90% Of USD Oil Sale Settlements\n\nHot and Cold Wallets: Understanding the Difference\n\nSource \u2013 Analytics Insight\n\nWhen it comes to storing Ethereum securely, there are two primary types of wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between these two options is crucial to determining the safest way to store your ETH.\n\nHot Wallets\n\nHot wallets are software-based wallets that are connected to the internet.\n\nThey are accessible through various devices, such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and web browsers. With hot wallets, you can easily access your Ethereum account and perform transactions on the go.\n\nOne of the most popular types of hot wallets is software wallets. These wallets are installed as applications on your devices and provide a user-friendly interface for managing your Ethereum assets.\n\nSoftware wallets are available for different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.\n\nAnother type of hot wallet is browser extensions.\n\nThese extensions integrate with your web browser and allow you to interact with the Ethereum network directly. They provide a convenient way to access your Ethereum account while browsing the internet.\n\nHot wallets offer convenience and accessibility, but they are more susceptible to security risks compared to cold wallets. Since they are connected to the internet, hot wallets are potentially vulnerable to hacking attempts and malware attacks.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to take additional security measures, such as enabling two-factor authentication and regularly updating your software, to protect your Ethereum holdings.\n\nCold Wallets\n\nCold wallets, on the other hand, are hardware devices that store your Ethereum private keys offline.\n\nThese wallets provide an extra layer of security by keeping your keys away from internet-connected devices, making them less susceptible to hacking attempts.\n\nHardware wallets are the most common type of cold wallet. They come in the form of small devices, similar to USB drives, and are designed specifically for securely storing cryptocurrencies.\n\nHardware wallets are equipped with encryption features and require physical confirmation of transactions, ensuring that your Ethereum assets remain safe even if your computer or mobile phone is compromised.\n\nWhile cold wallets offer superior security, they may be less convenient for frequent transactions compared to hot wallets.\n\nHowever, if you are a long-term investor or hold a significant amount of Ethereum, using a cold wallet is highly recommended to protect your assets from potential threats.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Wallets: Exploring Your Options\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of hot and cold wallets, let\u2019s explore the different types of Ethereum wallets available on the market.\n\nEach type offers unique features and benefits, allowing you to choose the most suitable option based on your needs and preferences.\n\nSoftware Wallets\n\nAs mentioned before, software wallets are hot wallets that you can install as applications on your devices.\n\nThey provide a user-friendly interface for managing your Ethereum assets and interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHere are some popular software wallets to consider:\n\nMyEtherWallet (MEW): MyEtherWallet is an open-source Ethereum wallet that allows you to securely store and manage your Ether. It features a transparent and auditable codebase, providing users with peace of mind regarding the wallet\u2019s security. Atomic Wallet: Atomic Wallet is a multi-currency wallet that supports Ethereum and over 300 other cryptocurrencies. It offers a user-friendly interface and allows you to store, exchange, and buy ETH with ease. Exodus: Exodus is a desktop wallet that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. It provides a simple and intuitive interface, making it suitable for beginners. Exodus also offers built-in exchange features, allowing you to trade your Ethereum for other digital assets.\n\nHardware Wallets\n\nHardware wallets are cold wallets that provide the highest level of security for storing Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, these wallets store your private keys offline, making them immune to online threats.\n\nHere are some popular hardware wallets for securely storing your ETH:\n\nLedger Nano X: The Ledger Nano X is a state-of-the-art hardware wallet that supports Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. It offers advanced security features and allows you to manage your Ethereum assets with ease. Trezor Model T: The Trezor Model T is another popular hardware wallet known for its robust security measures. It features a touch-screen interface and supports Ethereum and various other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWeb Wallets\n\nWeb wallets, also known as online wallets, are hot wallets that allow you to access your Ethereum account through a web browser.\n\nWhile these wallets provide convenience and accessibility, it\u2019s important to note that they might offer lower security when compared to hardware wallets.\n\nHere are some web wallets worth considering:\n\nMetamask: Metamask is a popular Ethereum web wallet that allows you to manage your Ethereum account and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) directly from your browser. Developers and Ethereum enthusiasts widely use it for its user-friendly interface. Coinbase Wallet: Coinbase Wallet is an online wallet provided by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. It offers seamless integration with the Coinbase exchange platform and allows you to securely store and manage your Ethereum assets.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nPaper wallets are a form of cold storage that involves printing your Ethereum private keys on a physical piece of paper.\n\nStoring your private keys offline through this approach ensures enhanced security.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to keep your paper wallet in a safe and secure location to prevent loss or theft.\n\nMobile Wallets\n\nMobile wallets are hot wallets that allow you to manage your Ethereum assets through mobile applications.\n\nThese wallets offer convenience and portability, allowing you to access your Ethereum account on the go.\n\nHere are some popular mobile wallets for Ethereum:\n\nTrust Wallet: Trust Wallet is a mobile wallet that supports Ethereum and various other cryptocurrencies. It offers a user-friendly interface and allows you to securely store, send, and receive ETH on your mobile device. Coinomi: Coinomi is a multi-currency mobile wallet that supports Ethereum and numerous other cryptocurrencies. It provides a secure and intuitive platform for managing your Ethereum assets.\n\nWhat is the safest way to store Ethereum?\n\nWhen it comes to storing Ethereum safely, the ideal approach is to utilize a combination of both hot and cold wallets.\n\nBy using a hardware wallet for long-term storage and a software wallet or mobile wallet for frequent transactions, you can strike a balance between security and convenience.\n\nHere are some best practices to ensure the safe storage of your Ethereum assets:\n\nUse a hardware wallet for long-term storage.\n\nInvest in a reputable hardware wallet, such as the Ledger Nano X or Trezor Model T, to store the majority of your Ethereum holdings. Keep your hardware wallet in a secure location, and ensure that you have a backup of your private keys.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your Ethereum wallets to add an extra layer of security.\n\nFurthermore, 2FA requires you to provide a second form of authentication, such as a verification code sent to your mobile device, in addition to your password.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest software updates and security patches for your Ethereum wallets. Software updates often include bug fixes and security enhancements, ensuring that your wallet remains secure against potential vulnerabilities.\n\nBe wary of phishing attacks.\n\nBe cautious of phishing attempts and avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing your private keys or personal information to untrusted sources. Always double-check the URL of the wallet website to ensure that you are visiting an official and legitimate site.\n\nKeep your private keys offline.\n\nNever store your private keys online or share them with anyone. Keep your private keys offline in a secure location, such as a hardware wallet or a printed paper wallet.\n\nUse strong passwords.\n\nChoose strong and unique passwords for your Ethereum wallets. Avoid using common passwords or easily guessable phrases. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\nRegularly back up your wallet.\n\nRegularly backup your wallet and store the backup in a safe and secure location. This ensures that you can recover your Ethereum holdings in the event of a lost, stolen, or damaged wallet.\n\nConclusion: Where to Store Ethereum Safely?\n\nIn conclusion, storing Ethereum safely is of utmost importance to protect your valuable assets.\n\nAdditionally, by utilizing a combination of hot and cold wallets, following best practices, and staying vigilant against potential threats, you can ensure the security of your Ethereum holdings.\n\nRemember to choose reputable wallets, enable additional security measures such as two-factor authentication, and regularly update your wallet software.\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can confidently buy, store, and manage your Ethereum assets with peace of mind."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Confirms Post-Merge Ethereum Centralization Concerns, Urges Not to \u2018Overly Catastrophize\u2019 It\n\nVitalik Buterin. Source: a video screenshot, Lex Fridman / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is \u201cdefinitely\u201d worried about centralization risks following The Merge, the event when the current Ethereum Mainnet merges with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind noted that Lido Finance, the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum, where around a third of staked ETH (stETH) has been deposited, could theoretically disturb the Ethereum network post-Merge.\n\n\u201cBut I also think it\u2019s important to not overly catastrophize the issue,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you have a third [of staked Ether deposits on the Beacon chain], you can\u2019t revert the chain or whatever,\u201d Buterin said in an interview with Fortune, adding:\n\n\u201cBut realistically, the worst that you could do is make finality stop happening for about a day or so, which is inconvenient, but it\u2019s not that terrible.\u201d\n\nButerin also mentioned that Lido does not act as a single entity but that \u201cthey have something like 21 delegates and nodes that are running these validators that are inside of Lido,\u201d he said, claiming that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of good decentralization between them.\u201d\n\nLido is the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum. Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.\n\nHowever, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don\u2019t have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.\n\nThe Merge is Ethereum\u2019s long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year\u2019s estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.\n\n\u201cAlso, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,\u201d Buterin told Fortune. \u201cIt makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don\u2019t think about.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, \u201cminers are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days. The coin is also down by more than 76% compared to its all-time high of USD 4,878 recorded in November last year.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Dominant Staking Pool Lido Causing \u2018Long Lasting\u2019 Damage to Ethereum, But Aims to Improve\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Ropsten Test is \u2018Almost\u2019 Bug-Free, Two More Testnets to Go Before the Merge\n\n\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme\u2019 Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\n\u2013 The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\n\n\u2013 Contradictory Vitalik Buterin Says He Wants a More Bitcoin-like Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Beacon Chain Experienced a 7-block Reorg, More Work Needed Ahead of The Merge\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist"

        "title": "This is The Next Target for ETH If the Drop Continues (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After a prolonged period of tranquil price activity near the critical level of $1.8K, there has been a significant and rapid downturn at ETH following a notable rejection. This sudden cascade has caused the price to drop below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs), indicating a bearish signal for the ETH market.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nLooking at the daily chart, a prolonged phase of quiet price action near the $1.8K resistance level led to a sharp downward movement, breaching below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages positioned around $1,835 and $1,800, respectively. The market is typically considered to be in a bearish phase when the price resides beneath the 200-day moving average line, which is widely recognized as a pivotal trend indicator.\n\nThe short-term support at $1,650 is currently managing to hold the price, potentially setting the stage for a bullish rebound and forming a pullback. However, the recent decline has changed the market structure to mostly bearish, increasing the likelihood of a retest of the $1,400 level in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that the price has breached the static support at $1.8K, leading to a rapid and forceful downward move. This breakdown has deepened the decline, with a prominent wick piercing through the $1,650 level.\n\nNevertheless, the mentioned support level has thus far effectively held the price, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has rebounded from the oversold zone, indicating the potential for a short-term consolidation phase.\n\nConsidering the recent price action, it appears likely that a consolidation period will develop between the support at $1,650 and the resistance around $1.8K in the mid-term. This scenario is anticipated before sellers potentially make another concerted push to drive the price to lower levels.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAnalyzing the fund holding metric, the chart indicates a significant trend shift for Ethereum since June 2022. While Bitcoin has experienced intermittent periods of price upticks accompanied by various fund distribution zones, Ethereum has witnessed a consistent downtrend in fund holdings and distributions during this period.\n\nInterpreting this chart, it becomes clear that there is a notable decline in the interest of asset management funds (such as ETFs and trusts) to indirectly invest in Ethereum. This contrasts with Bitcoin, where, despite fluctuations, specific periods of increased demand and fund distribution can be identified.\n\nThe consequence of this trend is a gradual reduction in the funds\u2019 market participation, leading to diminished trading liquidity and overall interest in Ethereum. For the market to experience a sustainable price upswing, a steady rise in investment interest from these funds is crucial.\n\nAs of now, this decline in fund engagement necessitates a cautious approach, particularly when viewed in conjunction with other data points. Consistently tracking the trends of this indicator can potentially provide valuable insights into determining the future trajectory of the Ethereum market."

        "content": "Key Takeaways The ethOS phone supports EVM chains and layer 2s.\n\nSolana's Saga phone saw a 40% price cut this month.\n\nShare this article URL Copied\n\nThe ethOS phone, the first mobile device to support EVM-based chains and layer 2s, has made waves in the Ethereum community after selling out its pre-sale in less than 24 hours. This news comes weeks after another web3 mobile phone, Solana\u2019s Saga, had its price slashed by 40%.\n\nThe ethOS phone is a revamped version of the Android-based Google Pixel 7a running on the Ethereum-native mobile operating system, ethOS. This phone runs a light Ethereum client, allowing it to verify blocks on its own and interact with Ethereum without relying on centralized infrastructure like Infura or Alchemy.\n\nThe ethOS phone comes with a built-in wallet and offers smooth compatibility with other wallets. And while the Pixel 7a is not a hardware wallet itself, it has a special security chip, known as a secure enclave, designed to safely store and encrypt private keys.\n\nOnly 50 phones were available during the pre-sale phase. Interested buyers had to mint an ethOS NFT and burn it to claim their phone. Now, these NFTs are now popping up on the NFT marketplace OpenSea, with some selling for 3 ETH, or roughly $5,000. For perspective, a regular Google Pixel 7A retails for $499 in the U.S.\n\nWhile the ethOS phone seems to be riding a wave of early success, the Solana Saga phone\u2019s sales haven\u2019t lived up to expectations. Since its April 2023 launch, only 2,120 units have been sold, according to data from FlipsideCrypto.\n\nIn a bid to boost sales, Solana Mobile slashed the price of the Saga phone from $1,000 to $599 this month.\n\nWith the ethOS phone\u2019s regular orders set to start this fall and Solana Saga looking to revamp its sales strategy, the competition in the mobile web3 space is bound to intensify."

Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDue to these factors, whales started to sell large portions of their ETH.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a sizeable whale liquidated a 10,600 ETH valued at $17.2 million, at a price point of $1,622. This transaction incurred a loss of $2.9 million for the whale.\n\nA whale dumped 10,600 $ETH($17.2M) at a price of $1,622 7 hrs ago, with a loss of $2.9M.

The said whale ventured into 18 different token trades, with only four of them turning out to be profitable. This translated to a relatively modest success rate of 22%.\n\nAlthough the whale managed to accumulate a profit of $10.8 million from its Ethereum holdings, the situation is not entirely favorable. It also incurred a $3.6 million loss on PDT trades and an additional 1.3 million loss on $MPL trades.\n\nAs whale interest in Ethereum seems to wane, retail engagement tells a different tale. Illustrated by data from Glassnode, the number of non-zero addresses skyrocketed to an all-time high of 104,794,621.\n\nThis suggested sustained interest among individual users despite the ongoing market volatility.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market activity took center stage as the Exchange Inflow Volume surged to a 1-month peak of 9,630.147 ETH. This surge in inflows into exchanges could potentially reflect evolving market sentiment and highlight potential selling pressures.\n\nNevertheless, despite the increase in exchange inflows, Ethereum\u2019s network activity exhibited a divergent trajectory. Low gas usage indicated a reduction in general network activity, particularly in terms of smart contract interactions.\n\nIn contrast, the NFT sector seemed to maintain relatively stable activity levels.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current landscape\n\nDue to the behavior of whales and other factors, Ethereum\u2019s price shifted from $1820 to $1627 over the last week, indicating a noticeable decline.

The negative MVRV ratio implied that a significant portion of Ethereum holders were not realizing profits at press time."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Fading momentum could lead to another dump - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nAfter a rather lull week, Bitcoin (BTC) price leads the cryptocurrency market into the weekend, where the volume of transactions is expected to be at the lowest. Like the largest altcoin by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices have also not shown much activity this week, and this consolidation may prove detrimental, as markets tend not to wait for that long.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC history forecasts another crash in Q3 ahead of Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nBitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. What are altcoins? Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. What is Bitcoin Dominance? Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\nBitcoin price could slip after weeklong consolidation\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has not shown any directional bias this week and is zoning into the weekend at the same level as last week, $25,940. Considering prices do not hold out for very long during times when the market is bearish (like now) or bullish, it is possible that BTC could slide lower.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin price is sitting on a solid support level, a demand zone marked in orange. Typically, this is an area characterized by aggressive buying. However, bulls are not acting, which could prove destructive for BTC holders.\n\nIf the demand zone fails to hold as a support level, Bitcoin price could slip through, converting it into a bearish breaker before revisiting the mid-March lows around $24,079.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still headed south despite being under the dreadful 30 level. This shows that momentum is still falling. The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are also in the negative, adding credence to the bearish outlook.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNevertheless, weekends have been known to be dominated by large wallets looking to take advantage of retailers stepping back for the weekend. If this plays out, Bitcoin price could show momentum within the weekend.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin price could rise, breaking past the immediate barricade at $27,300 before extending north. A move up to the supply zone (blue) is likely in such a turnout to the order block dominated by sellers. Overcoming this region could set the tone for BTC to reclaim the territory above the psychological $30,000, possibly tagging the $31,804 resistance level. Such a move would denote a 20% climb.\n\nThe presence of bulls in the BTC market is already evident, indicated by the large volumes of green bars of the AO.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds at $26,100 range ahead of Jerome Powell\u2019s Speech at Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nEthereum price stuck in a range\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains stuck within the $1,699 and $1,630 range after the August 17 dump. Speculation of an ETH futures ETF approval gave the market some momentum but not enough to break out from the zone. Currently, momentum indicators, the RSI and AO, point to a weakening market, and the PoS token could slump.\n\nAs volume continues to reduce, Ethereum price could lose the $1,630 support level before extending south toward the $1,507 support level. This would constitute a 10% drop from current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the ETH ETF narrative continues to drive the market, expect Ethereum price to fight out the current gloom and head north. While a break above the immediate barrier at $1,699 would be ideal, invalidation of the current bearish outlook would only occur after ETH converts the supply zone (green) into a bullish breaker, forging above it to reclaim highs above the $2,000 psychological level. This would indicate a 20% ascent.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner.\n\nRipple price calculated next move\n\nRipple (XRP) is working out the next step after a rejection from the $0.5752 resistance level. Buying pressure from the demand zone (orange between $0.5040 and $0.4600) is present, though seemingly insufficient to facilitate a swift uptrend.\n\nUnless bulls resurface strongly, Ripple price may slip through the immediate support offered by the demand zone to tag the range zone at $0.4191 potentially, levels last seen during the August 17 crash, provoked by the BTC dip and worsened by Judge Analisa Torres allowing the US SEC to file an interlocutory appeal.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying activity could change the fate of Ripple price, sending it above the $0.5752 roadblock, thereby reclaiming the ground lost during the recent dip. A sustained uptrend could see XRP overcome multiple hurdles, but confirmation of an uptrend would only happen once the remittance token records a decisive daily candlestick close above the July 19 highs at $0.8193.\n\nAlso Read: XRP whale moves 29 million tokens to Bitstamp amid price slide"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nLarge investors used Ethereum\u2019s price crash last week to increase their stash, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. Ether\u2019s price fell as low as sub-$1,600 during this time.\n\nEther Whales In Accumulation Mode\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that wealthy investors with large holdings used price turbulence last week to buy Ethereum (ETH) and are betting on future gains.\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, four whales accumulated a total of $94 million in ether over the past seven days.\n\nThe big buys by these whales came as ETH plummeted to its lowest level since June, dropping from over $1,700 on Thursday to about $1,540 just hours later. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which composes about 46.4% of the entire crypto market, slumped below $26,000 in the same time frame before rebounding to above $26K in a few hours.\n\nHuge Bitcoin investors also used the recent crypto market rout to acquire more coins. An anonymous entity scooped up a whopping 118,300 BTC (now valued at over $3 billion), becoming the third-largest holder of Bitcoin in the world in just three months. While the whale\u2019s true identity remains unknown, speculations range from major traditional financial institutions like BlackRock to crypto exchanges like Gemini.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevival Of Whale Fossils\n\nMultiple ancient Ethereum whales have come out of a decade-long hibernation this year.\n\nOn July 19, a wallet holding pre-mined Ether that had remained inactive for eight years transferred assets worth over $116 million to a Kraken exchange wallet, sparking much curiosity. Another pre-mine address, dormant for 8.1 years, sprung to life recently, moving 191 Ethereum tokens with a valuation of approximately $317,724.\n\nThat said, whales buying up ETH even as prices dunk suggests another leg up might be on the cards soon."

        "content": "Key Takeaways 18 Ethereum ETFs submitted this month.\n\nARK & 21Shares seek two new Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nShare this article URL Copied\n\nYesterday, ARK Invest and 21Shares, submitted two new Ethereum futures ETFs to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe first, named Active Ethereum Futures ETF (ARKZ), focuses solely on Ethereum derivatives. The second, Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY), will cover both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Both of these products will invest in Ether futures that settle in cash via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe filing states that the Active Ethereum Futures ETF plans to allocate over a quarter of its assets to Ether futures. The remaining assets will be diversified into liquid, short-term investment avenues like U.S. Treasuries, money market instruments, and repurchase agreements. Following a similar asset distribution pattern, the Active Ethereum Futures ETF also proposes to allocate more than 25% of its resources to Ether futures and balance the remainder with liquid, short-term assets.\n\nThis news closely trails Bloomberg\u2019s report from last week, indicating that the SEC might be on the brink of green-lighting an Ethereum ETF that invests in futures.\n\nAugust saw significant activity in this sector with the submission of 18 different Ethereum ETFs to the SEC. These applications hail from a diverse range of funds, including Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill, VanEck, Proshares, Grayscale, Direxion, Kelly ETFs, and Valkyrie. Breaking down the details, 10 out of these 18 ETFs are purely Ethereum-based, whereas the other eight propose a combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum investment strategies.\n\nStanding out among the submissions is the Ether Strategy ETF by Volatility Shares, positioned as the first exclusive ETH ETF in the lineup, with an expected approval date of October 11. Additionally, in the BTC and ETH mix, the Direxion Bitcoin Ether Strategy ETF is set for potential approval on October 16.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,649 at the time of writing, a near-flat performance in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "A recent Twitter update from Santiment blockchain analytical platform has revealed a surge on the Ethereum (ETH) network amidst recent price volatility conditions that caused the cryptocurrency to drop to the $1,650 dollar mark.\n\nThe Ethereum Whale Growth\n\nSpecifically, Santiment noted that the number of whales holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has experienced a resurgence, climbing back up to a count of 355,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis increase in the number of whales suggests that there has been a renewed interest among larger holders of Ethereum, potentially indicating their confidence in the asset even in the face of price fluctuations.\n\nAdditionally, the update points out that transactions involving sums of $100,000 and above have also witnessed a surge. This uptick in high-value transactions indicates that despite the volatile price conditions, there are entities willing to transact substantial amounts of Ethereum, a trend that is vital in sustaining the positive network outlook.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum whales, entities holding significant amounts of the cryptocurrency, have always played a crucial role in shaping the market dynamics. These large holders can exert influence over prices through their trading decisions, impacting both short-term volatility and long-term trends.\n\nThis pattern suggests that despite the price turbulence, these well-capitalized players are finding opportunities in Ethereum\u2019s market. Such activity could be interpreted as a sign of institutional interest or strategic maneuvering by experienced market participants who see potential value in the asset at its current price level.\n\nImplications for the Future\n\nThe surge in Ethereum whale counts raises intriguing questions about the cryptocurrency\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nWhile the immediate implication is a potential increase in market stability due to the presence of strong-handed investors, it also underscores the evolving dynamics within the crypto space.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to develop its ecosystem with upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) innovations, the role of these whales could have far-reaching implications on price discovery, network governance, and adoption.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at a price of $1,649, down by 2.19% in the past 24 hours."

        "content": "The Cosmos and Ethereum-focused scaling startup Dymension has achieved another key milestone on its roadmap with the launch of its incentivized testnet. With the launch, Cosmos and Ethereum developers can now start experimenting freely with one of the most promising Web3 scaling solutions to emerge thus far.\n\nDymension bills itself as a modular blockchain network and is aiming to build on the success of the Cosmos ecosystem by giving developers easy access to a unique rollup-based scaling solution it calls RollApps.\n\nRollApps are different from traditional monolithic blockchains such as Ethereum, which handle consensus, data availability, transaction execution and settlement on a single network. The monolithic design, although simple, has led to serious scaling problems, resulting in slow transaction processing and higher network fees for decentralized applications in DeFi, GameFi and other industries.\n\nDymension does things differently. With its modular RollApps, it effectively outsources some of the main functions of a blockchain. The Dymension Hub is solely responsible for handling consensus and settlement, while RollApps execute the transactions and data availability is outsourced to the Celestia and Avail networks.\n\nBy separating these components into three distinct chains, Dymension enables dApps to scale with optimal performance, strong settlement layer security, and greater access to liquidity thanks to its compatibility with the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems. Security is inherited from Dymension\u2019s settlement layer, which implements a fraud-proof mechanism to minimize trust in the RollApp sequencer. Meanwhile, Dymension communicates with IBC-enabled chains using the Inter-RollApp Communication Protocol, which is a customized version of the IBC protocol. This enables it to access liquidity via an embedded, native AMM.\n\nNow Dymension is making its RollApps more accessible with the launch of its incentivized testnet. Cosmos and Ethereum developers will be able to deploy RollApps using Roller, a command-line interface tool, using their virtual machine of their choice, such as EVM or CosmWasm. This represents another key benefit, because developers were previously limited to choosing the favored VM of the ecosystem they are building in.\n\nEarlier this year, Dymension launched its initial devnet for early participants. That limited launch saw more than 500 RollApps deployed, with full interoperability enabled by the IBC. With its testnet, Dymension is hopeful that it will see hundreds more RollApps deployed by developers from the wider Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.\n\nDymension said users will be able to interact with RollApps via its new portal, which provides an overview of its ecosystem\u2019s usage data and provides a way to bridge over IBC using MetaMask.\n\nAlthough Dymension is competing against dozens of other scalability layers, such as Polygon, Boba Network, Caldera, zkSync, OpStack and others, it believes its native IBC connectivity will help it to stand apart from those competitors, providing unlimited scale for dApps as well as widespread interoperability.\n\nThese were some of the advantages cited by Dymension\u2019s backers earlier this year, when it closed on a $6.7 million funding round led by Big Brain Holdings, Stratos and others. They believe Dymension\u2019s vision of a network of modular blockchains can potentially accelerate Web3\u2019s transition away from Ethereum, helping dApps to achieve the scale needed to support widespread adoption."

All the seven cryptocurrencies that Bitstamp delisted are deemed as \u201cunregistered securities\u201d by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has come under intense scrutiny, as it grapples with providing a definitive stance on the status of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe lack of clarity has stirred concerns among users and service providers alike. Notably, the SEC has initiated legal actions against major crypto exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities and violating securities laws.\n\nEarlier, the US SEC imposed a $30 million penalty on Kraken for offering staking services in February.\n\nThe exchange later had to halt its crypto-staking services for US customers.\n\nThis decision by Bitstamp adds another layer of complexity, particularly as staking has gained traction within the booming Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nUS Regulators Struggle to Provide Clear Crypto Regulations\n\nCentral to the regulatory conundrum is Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether. The question of whether Ether should be classified as a commodity or a security remains a pivotal concern.\n\nWhile the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has consistently labeled Ether as a commodity, the characterization of Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency has yet to be conclusively defined.\n\nThe discontinuation of Ethereum staking for US users underscores the pressing need for clearer regulatory guidelines, ensuring a balanced approach that fosters innovation while safeguarding investor interests."

        "content": "The collaboration showcases an effort to diversify investment options for potential investors in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s previous rejections have underscored the stringent regulatory environment surrounding crypto-based financial products.\n\nARK Invest and 21Shares, prominent investment firms, have submitted joint applications for two Ethereum [ETH] futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move coincided with recent reports indicating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be on the verge of approving Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe proposed ETFs were detailed in a filing made to the SEC on 24 August. ARKZ is planned to allocate a minimum of 25% of its total assets to cash-settled Ethereum futures contracts. These include those available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nConversely, ARKY will feature both Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum futures contracts in its composition. Empowered Funds will serve as the investment advisor for these Ethereum products.\n\nNotably, ARK Invest and 21Shares had previously collaborated to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the year 2021.\n\nThe SEC had previously rejected ARK Invest\u2019s initial two attempts for a Bitcoin spot ETF. The first request was in March 2022, and the other in January. Subsequently, they filed their latest Bitcoin spot ETF application in April, a couple of months ahead of the $10 trillion firm BlackRock\u2019s own application.\n\nEthereum ETF application filed amid\u2026\n\nThe SEC\u2019s scrutiny led to a significant development wherein several Bitcoin spot ETF applications were deemed inadequate. In response, ARK 21Shares and other applicants incorporated surveillance sharing agreements into their applications as a strategic measure.\n\nIn addition to their recent Ethereum ETF filings, these investment firms are also eagerly awaiting the outcomes of their applications for the \u201cArk 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures ETF\u201d (ARKA) and the \u201cArk 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d (ARKC).\n\nThis move is indicative of growing interest within the investment community to tap into the evolving cryptocurrency market. Ethereum has garnered significant attention due to its smart contract capabilities and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThe partnership comes at a time when financial institutions are increasingly exploring opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s previous rejections underscore the stringent regulatory environment, the recent developments signal a potential shift in attitude. The anticipation of Ethereum ETF approvals indicates that regulators are acknowledging the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and its integration into traditional financial frameworks."

        "content": "Cardano And Ethereum Take Development Steps As Everlodge Makes Market Bullish\n\n\n\nIn the world of crypto, two names, Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH), are making big changes. There's also a new player called Everlodge, bringing good vibes to the market. Let's check out these changes, and understand what they're about.\n\nJoin the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nCardano (ADA) Moves Forward\n\nCardano (ADA) has introduced a new and better Hydra scaling solution. Additionally, this improvement could make Cardano (ADA) more valuable. Furthermore, the upgrade's goal is to help Cardano's (ADA) system work faster, and handle more transactions without any issues. The newest version is called Cardano (ADA) Hydra v0.12.0, and is available now.\n\nThe upgrade works well with the Cardano (ADA) Node v8.1.2 software, and the Mithril protocol. It also helps APIs, which are tools that make it easier for Web 3.0 developers and researchers to use better scaling solutions. These changes show that Cardano (ADA) is committed to the future of apps that can work without relying on a central authority.\n\nCardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.27, as a result, it is 91.26% below its all-time high of $3.10.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Sees a Boost\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price has surged by 11%, reaching a new high of $1,700. This is due to the potential approval of Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe approval of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) ETFs would be a significant development in the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Firstly, it would signal the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. Secondly, it could lead to increased investment in the sector. Finally, it would be a major step toward the mainstream adoption of digital assets.\n\nBesides the ETF news, more people have been trading Ethereum (ETH) recently. This has made Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) trading volume surge by 185%. The current Ethereum (ETH) price is $1,659.73. Ethereum (ETH) has decreased by 0.64% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Makes Property Investment Easier and Smarter\n\nEverlodge is a new way of using technology to change how we invest in property. To begin with, it helps people share ownership of vacation homes using special digital tokens. Thus, more people can afford to co-own great holiday houses, as the real estate market is expected to grow to $5,209.84 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 7.0%.\n\nAdditionally, Everlodge uses blockchain to make things safe, and clear for co-owners. It records who owns what, how money moves, and takes care of the property in a safe way that can't be changed. Therefore, this new way helps with common property investment problems. It offers sharing ownership, easy buying and selling, access for everyone, and smart contracts.\n\nFinally, Everlodge allows you to invest a bit of money, even just $100, in property pieces using special digital tokens called Real Estate NFTs. The ecosystem has a few main parts: a place to trade, a start point for new projects, lending options, and rewards. All of this works with a special token called ELDG, which helps people earn rewards, and makes the system steady.\n\nAlso, the presale has kicked off with each token priced at only $0.01. In the beginning, there will be 40 million tokens up for grabs. During this presale stage, experts are foreseeing a notable 280% increase in price.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG) Presale\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge"

        "title": "Comparing Binance, Ethereum, and Bitgert: Features, Performance, and Investor Opportunities | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "Binance, Ethereum, and Bitgert are three of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market today. They have different features, performance, and prospects that can benefit investors looking for opportunities in the crypto space. Here is a brief overview of each coin and what they offer.\n\nBinance:\n\nBinance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and one of the most influential players in the industry. Binance Smart Chain is a fast and low-cost blockchain network that hosts many decentralized applications (DApps) and tokens. Binance has its own native token, Binance Coin (BNB), which is used to pay for fees, access various services, and participate in token sales on the Binance platform. Binance Coin has performed well in 2023 despite Binance\u2019s regulatory tiffs throughout the year. Binance\u2019s BNB is also the base currency for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BNB is used to pay for trading fees on Binance, as well as to access various services and products on the Binance ecosystem, such as Binance Smart Chain, Binance Launchpad, and Binance NFT. BNB also benefits from the buy-back and burn program, which reduces its supply over time. Binance (BNB) holders can benefit from the growth of the Binance ecosystem and its innovations.\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for smart contracts and DApps. Ethereum enables developers to create various applications that run on a decentralized network, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and more. Ethereum transitioned to Ethereum 2.0 in earlier months of 2023 to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Ethereum 2.0 moved the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one, which will allow Ethereum (ETH) holders to stake their coins and earn rewards for securing the network. Ethereum has seen a cautious retreat in 2023, dropping from its peak to around $1,700 in August. However, some analysts believe that Ethereum is undervalued and has strong fundamentals that will support its long-term growth.\n\nBitgert:\n\nAlongside Binance and Ethereum, we have a newcomer that can be investors' favorite, Bitgert. Bitgert (BRISE) is a crypto engineering project launched in 2021. Bitgert's ecosystem includes a zero-fee blockchain network that can process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade any token without intermediaries, a metaverse platform that enables users to create and explore virtual worlds, and an NFT marketplace that connects artists and collectors. Bitgert also plans to launch its own peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange soon, which will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without any third-party involvement. Bitgert claims that its P2P exchange will pump the price of BRISE hard, as it will increase the demand and utility of the token.\n\nHow to buy Bitgert (BRISE):\n\nOne of the easiest ways to buy Bitgert (BRISE) is through Binance or Coindesk. You can use your credit card or bank transfer to buy Ethereum (ETH) on Binance and then swap it for Bitgert (BRISE) on the Bitgert DEX or any other DEX that supports BRISE. Alternatively, you can use Trust Wallet, a popular mobile wallet app that supports Bitgert (BRISE) and other cryptocurrencies. You can buy Ethereum on Trust Wallet using your credit card or bank transfer and then swap it for Bitgert (BRISE) on the Bitgert DEX or any other DEX that supports Bitgert (BRISE).\n\nAs you can see, Binance, Ethereum, and Bitgert are three cryptocurrencies that have different features, performance, and prospects that can benefit investors who are looking for opportunities in the crypto space. While Binance and Ethereum may not show exponential growth, a project like Bitgert, being in its early stage, has the potential for massive growth, especially after the announcement of its P2P exchange. So hold on to your Bitgert (BRISE) until then.

        "title": "Exploring zkEVM: Bridging ZKP Technology & Ethereum's Virtual Machine - CryptoTvplus",
        "content": "When the Ethereum network was first proposed in 2014, the original developers did not take ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) technology into account. However, in recent years, ZKP has gained significant attention and is expected to play a more prominent role in the blockchain space. Consequently, there has been an intensified effort to combine ZKP technology with Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine.\n\nTo understand what a zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) is, let\u2019s briefly review its two underlying concepts: zk-rollups and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).\n\nWhat are zk-rollups?\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that aggregates multiple transaction executions outside the main chain and sends the data back to the main network as a single transaction. This process increases throughput while reducing the cost of executing these transactions.\n\nOn Ethereum, transactions within a rollup are compressed and submitted to the Ethereum mainnet, with the cost of verifying a single transaction. The Ethereum mainnet provides settlement and verifies the transaction data contained in the rollup.\n\nA zk-rollup is a type of rollup that utilizes ZKP technology. ZKP is a cryptographic technique that allows the verification of information\u2019s validity without revealing the information itself. Unlike other rollup solutions, zk-rollups only need to publish state differences (such as changes in user account status) and validity proofs, significantly lowering gas fees.\n\nThe security of zk-rollups relies on ZKP cryptography, where cryptographic methods are employed to verify proofs and achieve trustlessness. This differs from other rollup solutions like optimistic rollups, which rely on economic game theory for security, where bad actors are discouraged by potential losses and challengers are motivated by incentives.\n\nWhat is EVM?\n\nThe EVM is a state machine where Ethereum\u2019s account system and smart contracts run. Every execution of a smart contract triggers the EVM to transition from an old state to a new state. The EVM defines rules for calculating new and valid states from one block to another.\n\nState is a critical concept in Ethereum. It refers to a Merkle Patricia Trie data structure that represents Ethereum\u2019s current state and enables anyone to trace transaction information from the current block back to the genesis block.\n\nAll nodes participating in maintaining Ethereum ensure continuity and consensus, enabling each node to observe the exact current state. The EVM plays a critical role in maintaining this consistency.\n\nHow does zkEVM work?\n\nBy default, the EVM does not support ZKPs. However, zkEVM aims to ensure Ethereum\u2019s state continuity while providing proof of the correctness of all information. This ensures that the various factors involved in the computation of these processes are verified while maintaining security and privacy.\n\nzkEVM accomplishes this by replicating the Ethereum environment as zk-rollups. It takes the initial state, performs all the transactions, and outputs a newly updated state along with an accompanying ZKP. This proof is submitted to a verifier smart contract that verifies the correctness of both the initial and new states\u2019 output without having to individually verify all the transactions.\n\nDue to zkEVM\u2019s basis on the EVM, developers can easily port Ethereum DApps and smart contracts to zkEVMs without the need for ZKP development work. In other words, zkEVMs allow zk-rollups to execute smart contracts, expanding beyond token swaps and payments supported without zkEVMs.\n\nThe compatibility feature of the EVM enables developers to build new products using existing EVM tools and programming languages such as Solidity, while benefiting from the enhanced security provided by zkEVM. Users can also continue using the same DApps and familiar tools while enjoying added security and privacy.\n\nEVM Compatibility versus EVM Equivalence\n\nWhen we refer to a blockchain as EVM-compatible, it means that it provides an environment where DApps written in the Solidity programming language can be deployed. Solidity is specifically designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum developers can easily copy and paste the code of existing DApps from Ethereum and deploy them on other EVM-compatible chains with minimal modifications. For users, any EVM-compatible chain address functions the same as their Ethereum address.\n\nThis compatibility ensures that addresses can be used with mainstream wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Currently, major EVM-compatible chains include BNB Chain, Avalanche C-Chain, and Polygon.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important not to confuse EVM compatibility with EVM equivalence. EVM equivalence means that, from the perspective of DApp developers, Layer 2 rollups are nearly identical to Layer 1 Ethereum.\n\nTo use an analogy with operating systems, EVM equivalence is like restoring files and settings through Apple Cloud if a user\u2019s previous computer and new computer both run on Apple\u2019s operating system.\n\nIn contrast, EVM compatibility means that if a new computer switches to a Windows system, the original files need to be downloaded through cloud storage and converted to recover preferred settings and old files.\n\nDifferent Types of ZkEVMs\n\nGenerating and verifying ZKPs directly using the EVM is extremely slow because Ethereum was not originally designed to support ZKP technology. In some cases, it could take several hours. However, striking a balance between EVM compatibility and ZKP efficiency is important.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin categorized zkEVMs into four types, each with different trade-offs between ZKP performance efficiency and EVM compatibility.\n\nType 1: Consensus-level equivalence \u2014 zkEVM that is completely equivalent to Ethereum\n\nAt the consensus level, a Type 1 zkEVM, also known as an enshrined rollup, is equivalent to Ethereum. The zkEVM chain state and transactions are identical to those of Ethereum. They can mutually verify blocks and be directly used with Ethereum execution clients.\n\nType 1 zkEVMs make Ethereum itself more scalable and can be introduced directly onto the Ethereum mainnet. The drawback is that ZKP efficiency is extremely poor and requires a significant amount of computation for verification. Future solutions could involve using large-scale parallel validators or specialized integrated circuits for zk-SNARKs.\n\nType 2: Bytecode-level equivalence \u2014 completely equivalent to EVM\n\nType 2 zkEVMs are fully equivalent to the EVM but not Ethereum. They differ from Ethereum in terms of data structures (such as block structure and state tree) and eliminate some stack operations that are not ZK-friendly.\n\nType 2 zkEVMs are fully compatible with Ethereum\u2019s existing DApps, debugging tools, and developer infrastructure. While they can improve prover times to some extent, they are expensive and have low and expensive efficiency in terms of ZKP.\n\nType 2.5: Similar to Type 2 but with modifications to gas fees\n\nType 2.5 zkEVMs share the advantages and disadvantages of Type 2 but have slightly lower gas fees.\n\nType 3: Bytecode-level equivalence \u2014 nearly equivalent to EVM\n\nBuilding upon Type 2, Type 3 zkEVMs sacrifice compatibility for improved ZK efficiency. They eliminate functions that are difficult to implement on zkEVM, such as precompiles, which may require rewriting some code used in DApps that rely on these functions.\n\nType 4: Development language-level equivalence \u2014 high-level language equivalent to EVM\n\nType 4 zkEVMs offer the highest ZK performance but relatively subpar compatibility compared to other types. They provide an equivalent high-level language to the EVM.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary goal of implementing zkEVM is to enable the integration of ZKP computation into smart contract execution, thereby extending the reach of DApps to all EVM-compatible protocols. However, the applications of ZKP technology extend beyond this point.\n\nZKP technology has the potential to be compatible with Web2 use cases as well. By combining ZKP with various Web2 applications, Web3 applications can become more seamless and user-friendly. This integration would allow users who are already familiar with traditional Internet browsers to access Web3 and, as a result, accelerate the adoption of Web3 technology."

Chart: TradingView\n\nWhile Hoskinson\u2019s optimism for Cardano\u2019s future shines brightly, his keynote address did not shy away from critical evaluations of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He noted that Bitcoin\u2019s unaltered design, maintained for over 13 years since its inception, might become a vulnerability in the long run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s leadership, in contrast, dismissed the feasibility of on-chain governance. Hoskinson countered this stance by arguing that as crypto platforms evolve and encompass millions of users, adopting some form of on-chain governance could be a strategic advantage rather than a liability.\n\nDissenting Voices And Ongoing Debate\n\nWhile Hoskinson\u2019s proclamation has garnered admiration and anticipation, dissenting voices within the cryptocurrency community remain.\n\nEvan Van Ness, a prominent member of ConsenSys and an Ethereum advocate, criticized Cardano, labeling it a \u201czombie chain\u201d due to its position below Base\u2019s TVL (Total Value Locked).\n\nIt\u2019s been live for just a couple weeks, but @BuildOnBase has already flipped Cardano in TVL (even new and immature) L2\ud83d\ude80\n\nzombiechains \ud83d\udcc9 pic.twitter.com/LOe0oGxRek \u2014 Evan Van Ness \ud83e\uddc9\ud83d\udcb8 (@evan_van_ness) August 24, 2023\n\nThis critique isn\u2019t the first of its kind from Van Ness, who previously pointed out Cardano\u2019s perceived lack of transaction activity almost a year ago.\n\nWhether ADA can indeed ascend the ranks to surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the world of blockchain and digital assets is as dynamic and unpredictable as the markets they represent.\n\nFeatured image from Publish0X"

        "content": "Important crypto news for Ripple (XRP), which recently overtook Ethereum in terms of preference in South Korea, becoming the favorite altcoin of investors, according to a tweet from Whale:\n\nXRP Surpasses Ethereum as South Korea\u2019s Most Popular Altcoin \u2014 Whale | Dinobet.io (@WhaleChart) August 23, 2023\n\nSee below for all the details.\n\nThe Ripple (XRP) crypto triumphs over Ethereum in South Korea\n\nAs anticipated above, the fifth crypto in the global rankings, Ripple (XRP), now reigns as the favorite in South Korea in the altecoin sphere, overtaking even Ethereum.\n\nSpecifically, it is attested that Ripple (XRP) has gained the top spot among the most popular altcoins in South Korea. This report shows that South Korean cryptocurrency traders have embraced XRP as their top choice in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that Ripple has shown a growth of about 2% over the past few hours. South Korea-based cryptocurrency trading platform Bitsum shared a study highlighting investment trends among different age groups.\n\nEmerging from this are traders in their 20s as the most active in the country. Moreover, the same study confirms XRP as the most sought-after cryptocurrency in this age group, with more than 20% of young people preferring this token.\n\nThere is no denying the obvious growth and development that the cryptocurrency market has experienced in recent years. And the central role played by the younger generation in the stimulating evolution of this sector is indisputable.\n\nThis generational shift in preferences eloquently demonstrates the unique features that XRP can offer.\n\nSome data regarding the Ripple (XRP) crypto\n\nWe also see that, based on the report provided, it appears that 82.5% of investors in the 20-year age group have allocated their investments to altcoins.\n\nAmong these, Ripple stands out as the most popular altcoin, boasting a 20.7% share.\n\nThis marks a relevant triumph of Ripple on the cryptocurrency scene, even surpassing the mainstays of the industry, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the latter are key figures in the cryptocurrency landscape, XRP\u2019s expansion in South Korea bolsters investor confidence. We also note that several elements have fueled the meteoric growth of the Ripple ecosystem.\n\nThese include XRP\u2019s practical uses, technological advancements, and strategic alliances. In addition, Ripple\u2019s remarkable triumph in a legal battle against the US SEC has further solidified XRP\u2019s position.\n\nIn making further strides, XRP experienced a considerable jump of about 60% in value immediately after the verdict in Ripple\u2019s favor in the legal case.\n\nCurrently, Ripple\u2019s price stands at around $0.5286, accompanied by an increase of more than 1.72% in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, according to CoinMarketCap, there is evidence of a decline in the magnitude of daily trading volumes for XRP, registering a release of 18.29%.\n\nSEC and XRP Conflict: Ripple\u2019s Garlinghouse Initiative\n\nThe dispute between the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, the crypto company, continues to move forward and Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, is further solidifying his defense.\n\nDuring the day on Tuesday, two renowned attorneys from the respected law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP announced their decision to participate in the litigation currently pending in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nAttorney Michael A. Schulman formally filed a motion for Pro Hac Vice, a legal procedure that allows a lawyer to practice in a jurisdiction where they are not licensed.\n\nIn addition, attorney Caleb J. Robertson has formally taken the position of representing Garlinghouse in the same court proceeding. The input of lawyers of such caliber from a renowned law firm underscores the significance and complexity of the case.\n\nAs is well known, the charges brought by the SEC against Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen involve the sale and issuance of the digital asset XRP.\n\nAs previously reported by U.Today, the judge overseeing the SEC\u2019s civil case against Ripple Labs planned to begin a jury trial in the second quarter of 2024, specifically between April and June.\n\nAlthough Judge Analisa Torres has previously ruled that the XRP coin does not constitute a security with regard to transactions on digital marketplaces, Ripple and its executives may still face other violations.\n\nIn fact, the SEC recently took legal action to challenge this decision, but the outcome of that attempt remains to be seen."

Around the same time, Buterin also divested several unsolicited alternative cryptos (referred to as \u201cshitcoins\u201d) in exchange for 439.25 ETH.\n\nButerin has made a series of transactions amid the recent market downturn that has been flagged by several crypto observers. On Sunday, he repaid 251,000 Rai Reflex tokens on Maker and subsequently liquidated 1,000 worth around $1.6 million according to data from lookonchain.\n\nEthereum Price Declined 13% After Vitalik Sold In April\n\nLarge transactions from recognized high-net-worth holders and influential figures like Vitalik Buterin often influence the markets significantly. Historical data culled from Arkham Intelligence shows how Ethereum\u2019s price sank by 13% barely a week after Vitalik made a significant outflow in April.\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Vitalik had moved out $283 million worth of ETH on April 19. Interestingly, ETH price began to wobble within just 48 hours and later declined 13% from $2,102 to $1,840 by the close of April 25.\n\nAlso, back in 2021, Vitalik\u2019s alternate 0Xabf address, which currently holds 248,027 ETH (~$415 million), exhibited a similar premonitory pattern.\n\nOn November 5, 2021, Vitalik moved out a total of 19.5 billion worth of ETH over an eventful period of two weeks. That period coincided with Ethereum losing its all-time high of $4,890, which it hasn\u2019t reclaimed ever since.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price, Market Cap, and Trading Volume\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Chart: According to Coingecko\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) as of the time of writing, is $1,663.22 today with a 24-hour trading volume of $5,742682,763.82. This represents a -0.53%price decline in the last 24 hours and a -9.66% price decline in the past 7 days. With a circulating supply of 120 Million ETH, Ethereum is valued at a market cap of $200,045,386,947."

        "content": "Bitcoin Spark is gaining traction in the crypto world as it promises to revolutionize the future of decentralized finance by combining the strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price observed through a four-hour timeframe reveals a bearish sentiment with a pattern of \u201cThree Black Crows\u201d candlesticks. The prevailing bearish dominance is emphasized by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators moving into the oversold region. The immediate resistance is at $26,200. But, the presence of a bearish engulfing candlestick and a two-day candle pattern below this level suggests ongoing downward pressure. A continuation of this trend could propel Bitcoin\u2019s descent to $25,600. Conversely, surpassing the $26,200 level might pave the way for targeting resistance at $26,800, subsequently opening doors for further gains toward $27,300. Nonetheless, a breach below $25,200 could signify the potential for deeper losses.\n\nHow to mine Ethereum\n\nMining Ethereum no longer became possible since The Merge. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners, to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of Ethereum they hold and are willing to stake as collateral. While this transition did curb the issue of energy and speed, there are still concerns about centralization with PoS.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark is built on Ethereum. The project improves on the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, introducing changes that usher in a new generation of cryptocurrency use cases. However, it does retain the favorable characteristics of Bitcoin, such as a limited supply of 21 million.\n\nBitcoin Spark will have increased block transaction capacity, reduced block time, and a significantly higher number of nodes than the Bitcoin blockchain. This ensures it has a higher transaction throughput while maintaining fast speeds and low costs.\n\nTaking from its predecessor, Ethereum, Bitcoin Spark will support smart contracts. However, it takes it a step further by having a multi-layered architecture with different contract execution systems but singular network finality. This layered model ensures scalability while promoting diversity by allowing the use of multiple programming languages, both high-level and low-level. Bitcoin Spark therefore boosts its utility, establishing itself as a blockchain with diverse applications extending a simple P2P payment system.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark network introduces a cross between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) known as Proof-of-Process PoP (PoP). The PoP requires miners/validators to stake and contribute processing power to the network in order to validate blocks and earn rewards. Bitcoin Spark, however, combines the PoP with a unique algorithm that reduces rewards per larger stake size and per additional power exponentially to ensure fairer distribution between larger and smaller miners. The Bitcoin Spark development team has ensured that the work and power required for mining BTCS is relatively low through the network\u2019s native application.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark application allows users to mine by permitting access to their mining device\u2019s processing unit. The application can be installed on Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and Mac OS devices and will work in an isolated virtual environment that doesn\u2019t interfere with operating system functions to ensure security. It will also adjust the processing power used to account for overheating, battery, and simultaneous usage requirements. However, miners will have the option of manually selecting the device resources permitted for mining use. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s innovative approach to network validation ensures true decentralization by enabling anyone to participate.\n\nNewly minted coins are the only way to incentivize validators to participate in many blockchains. However, Bitcoin Spark changes this notion. The processing power provided by miners is \u2018rented out\u2019 to organizations or individuals as remote computing power through the Bitcoin Spark network. The clients will pay with BTCS, which will be allocated to the mining pool to supplement BTCS minting rewards. Additionally, the Bitcoin Spark application and website will have small slots for community-policied advertisements, where 50% of the revenue generated will be transferred to miners and network participants. With such diverse revenue sets, Bitcoin Spark can not only survive but thrive in a Web3 world of singular use cases and closed revenue systems.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark Initial Coin Offering (ICO) has gained significant investments so far and is currently in Phase 3, selling BTCS at $2.00, accompanied by a 12% bonus.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin Spark:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"
