        "content": "The reason for differentiating reward withdrawals from full exits comes from how Ethereum\u2019s staking system works. Individual stakers or staking services have to lock up exactly 32 ETH to open a node and earn rewards for securing the network. Keeping the accrued rewards in the validator node does not improve the node\u2019s return. Acheson explained that it\u2019s logical for stakers to withdraw rewards, bundle the tokens and establish new nodes to increase potential returns."

        "content": "Prices of bitcoin and ether\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014are usually closely correlated, but that's changing after Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade, and it could affect investments and risk management for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nKey Takeaways Ether and Bitcoin have moved together in the past, with the exception of the time period around The Merge.\n\nThe lack of correlation increased after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork.\n\nAt the same time, bitcoin has continued its correlation with the Nasdaq.\n\nEther and Bitcoin's Correlation\n\nAccording to a recent report by Coinbase, the correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) has been declining since the beginning of 2023 and the rift widened after Ethereum's Shanghai (Shapella) hard fork. The upgrade, completed on April 12, allowed users to withdraw staked ether for the first time.\n\nThe BTC-ETH correlation based on a 40-day rolling window has fallen from 0.95 to 0.82 during that time. In the past, these two crypto assets have mostly moved lockstep.\n\n\n\nThe report attributes this trend to several factors, such as the increasing adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps), the growing popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the transition of the network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nHow Declining Correlation Impacts Investments\n\nLower BTC-ETH correlation could have implications for portfolio diversification and risk management. For institutional investors, it could mean a change in their hedging strategies.\n\n\"The relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins),\" said Coinbase analysts.\n\nFor investors who want to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market, holding both BTC and ETH could provide more benefits than holding either one alone, as they could reduce the overall volatility and increase the potential returns of their portfolio.\n\nHowever, the report cautions that correlation is not a static measure and could change over time depending on market conditions and developments in both networks.\n\nBitcoin Still Correlated with Nasdaq\n\nBitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven asset in times of economic turmoil. However, a recent analysis by CoinDesk shows that the cryptocurrency's correlation with the ratio of Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 index has increased significantly since late 2020, suggesting that bitcoin may be more sensitive to shifts in market sentiment and risk appetite than previously thought.\n\n\n\nThe ratio of Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 reflects the relative performance of growth stocks versus value stocks. Growth stocks are typically associated with higher earnings growth potential and higher valuations, while value stocks are seen as undervalued and often pay dividends.\n\n\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, bitcoin's 90-day correlation coefficient with the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio rose to a record high of 0.79 in March 2021, up from -0.06 in September 2020.\n\n"

        "title": "What Are Smart Accounts on Ethereum? - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "Let\u2019s get to know more about one of the developments iterated to enhance the usability of the Ethereum network and foster its wider adoption \u2013 Smart Accounts on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain network that has undergone significant changes over time, such as the switch from proof of work to proof of stake consensus mechanism. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is a major milestone in this transition, but it is still a work in progress. Despite this, other important improvements have been made, with the potential to enhance the usability of the network and drive user adoption.\n\nOne such improvement is the deployment of smart accounts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart accounts are a type of accounts that can be controlled by programmable smart contracts rather than private keys, allowing for more advanced functionality and automated management of assets and transactions. This can include multi-signature authorization, time-based unlocking, and threshold-based transaction limits, as well as the implementation of complex business logic and security measures.\n\nSmart Accounts Defined\n\nAs said above, smart accounts are a type of account on the Ethereum blockchain that can be controlled by programmable smart contracts rather than private keys. This means that the functionality of the account can be customized and automated using code, rather than relying solely on manual intervention from the account holder.\n\nSmart accounts offer a range of advanced features, such as multi-signature authorization, time-based unlocking, and threshold-based transaction limits. They also enable the implementation of more complex business logic and security measures, such as payment plans and revenue-sharing arrangements that can be enforced automatically without the need for third-party intermediaries.\n\nAccount Abstraction Explained\n\nAccount abstraction is an emerging standard in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem that allows the transformation of a regular wallet into a smart contract account. It was previously known as ERC-4337, but the standard was not officially adopted. The feature has already been deployed on a smart contract, and it is expected to be supported by several Ethereum infrastructure providers in the future.\n\nAccount abstraction is a significant development that could greatly enhance the usability of wallets and improve the security of user accounts. By transforming a wallet into a smart contract account, the feature provides more advanced functionality, including multi-signature authorization and time-based unlocking, which can help prevent the loss of private keys and secure user accounts.\n\nAnother important aspect of account abstraction is its compatibility with other EVM-compatible blockchains, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX). This means that the feature can be used across multiple blockchain networks, enabling greater interoperability and flexibility for users.\n\nWhile it was initially expected to take until 2024 for account abstraction to be deployed, the feature has already undergone a full security audit and is now available for use. It may take some more time for the feature to become widely adopted, but its potential impact on improving the security and usability of wallets makes it an exciting development for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLaunch of Smart Accounts\n\nSmart accounts were not launched as a single event, but rather as a gradual evolution of the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain. As the Ethereum ecosystem has grown and matured, developers and businesses have increasingly turned to smart contracts to create more sophisticated and secure financial applications on the blockchain.\n\nWhile smart accounts are not a distinct product or service that can be launched, several developments have contributed to their emergence as a powerful tool for creating more advanced financial applications on the Ethereum blockchain. These include the introduction of the ERC-20 standard for creating fungible tokens, the development of more advanced programming languages such as Solidity and Vyper for writing smart contracts, and the emergence of infrastructure providers and tooling to support the development of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nMoreover, the emergence of account abstraction that allows wallets to be transformed into smart contract accounts, has further expanded the capabilities of smart accounts and enhanced their usability and security. This development enables the implementation of more advanced functionality, such as multi-signature authorization and time-based unlocking, and allows for more complex business logic and security measures to be enforced automatically without the need for third-party intermediaries.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs)\n\nThe majority of accounts created on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM networks are known as externally owned accounts or EOAs. EOAs use traditional key pairs, meaning they consist of a single private key that is used to sign messages and make transactions. However, this also means that if someone gains access to your private key, they have full control over your account and funds.\n\nPopular wallets like Metamask and imToken, as well as hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano and Trezor, are all examples of EOAs. Despite their popularity, EOAs are susceptible to security risks since the private key is a single point of failure. If your private key is lost or stolen, you could lose access to your funds.\n\nTo address this issue, account abstraction was developed as a new standard for Ethereum, with the goal of allowing wallets to become smart contract accounts. Smart accounts leverage the added security and functionality of smart contracts to enable features like multi-signature authorization and time-based unlocking. By doing so, smart accounts aim to provide users with a more secure and flexible option for managing their funds on the Ethereum network.\n\nContract Accounts (CA)\n\nA contract account (CA) is a unique type of account on the Ethereum blockchain that is owned and managed by a smart contract, rather than an individual or entity. This means that the smart contract code determines how the Ether within the account is managed and utilized.\n\nNotably, contract accounts provide a powerful tool for developers and businesses to create more sophisticated and automated financial applications on the Ethereum blockchain. By allowing for more complex functionality and automation, contract accounts can enhance the efficiency and security of financial transactions and other applications built on the Ethereum platform.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that contract accounts still require an externally owned account (EOA) to deploy and execute their functions. The EOA is responsible for initiating transactions and interacting with the smart contract code, which then determines how the Ether within the CA is utilized.\n\nEOAs vs Smart Accounts\n\nExternally owned accounts and smart accounts are both types of accounts in the Ethereum blockchain, but they have different characteristics and purposes.\n\nEOAs are the most basic type of Ethereum account. They are controlled by private keys, and transactions can be initiated only by the account owner. EOAs are used mainly for holding ether and sending transactions to other accounts, including smart contracts.\n\nSmart accounts, on the other hand, are more complex and have more functionality than EOAs. Smart accounts are smart contracts that have been deployed to the blockchain and have their own Ethereum address.\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs that can be programmed to perform specific actions when certain conditions are met. Smart accounts can interact with other smart contracts and can also execute code automatically based on predefined rules and conditions.\n\nThe key difference between EOAs and smart accounts is that smart accounts are programmable and can execute code, while EOAs are simply accounts that hold ether and can send transactions. Smart accounts can be used for a variety of purposes, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, voting systems, and supply chain management, among others.\n\nIn some cases, smart contracts may be owned by EOAs. For example, an individual may deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum network and own it through their EOA. In this case, the EOA would control the smart contract and be able to perform actions such as updating its code or interacting with other smart contracts.\n\nBenefits of Using Smart Accounts\n\nThe use of smart accounts on the Ethereum network provides users with the following benefits.\n\nSecurity. Smart accounts are built on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses cryptographic techniques to secure the network. This makes smart accounts highly secure and resistant to hacking and fraud.\n\nTransparency. Smart contracts are transparent, meaning that the code is open and visible to everyone on the network. This makes it easy to audit the code and verify that it is working as intended.\n\nAutomation. Smart accounts are self-executing programs that can automate a wide range of tasks, making them highly efficient and reducing the need for manual intervention.\n\nCost-effectiveness. Smart accounts can automate tasks and reduce the need for intermediaries, making them highly cost-effective. This is especially true for tasks that involve multiple parties, such as supply chain management and decentralized finance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSmart accounts on Ethereum have revolutionized the way agreements and transactions are conducted, enabling automated and trustless execution of contracts without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts can be used for a wide range of applications, including financial instruments, insurance policies, supply chain management, and more.\n\nWhile smart accounts on Ethereum offer a wide range of benefits, they are still a relatively new technology and may present some challenges, including the need for careful and secure programming to prevent vulnerabilities and the possibility of unforeseen consequences due to complex interactions between multiple smart contracts."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant turbulence lately, with Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, dropping below the $30,000 price mark. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has also been affected, with its price dropping below the $2,000 mark and reaching the support price of $1,850. This has led to many investors wondering what will happen next. Will Ethereum crash to $1,000? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum prediction article.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Blockchain?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. It was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and has since grown to become one of the most popular blockchain platforms in the world.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Important?\n\nOne of the main reasons why Ethereum is important is that it enables developers to create decentralized applications that can run without the need for a centralized authority. This means that these applications can be more secure and less prone to censorship or manipulation. Ethereum also allows for the creation of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that can automate certain processes and eliminate the need for intermediaries.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Why is Ethereum Down?\n\nNow let\u2019s take a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s recent price action. Ethereum increased in prices from $1,400 and reached a high of $2,115. However, it retraced lower and reached the support price of $1,850. This is an important milestone for ETH, and future prices will be determined based on the next few days\u2019 price action.\n\nEthereum prediction: Will Ethereum Crash to $1,000?\n\nSo what can we expect from Ethereum\u2019s price in the near future? Based on current market trends, Ethereum should rebound from its current prices and reach $2,000 again. However, if the resistance price of $1,850 is breached lower, Ethereum is expected to crash lower and reach the next support at around $1,600. It\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum crashing to $1,000 is not in sight for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn ancient Ethereum (ETH) wallet address that participated in the 2015 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the protocol has suddenly come back to life after close to eight years of dormancy. Data from Etherscan as shared by Lookonchain shows that this wallet address reawakened with a massive amount of Ether tokens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 7.7 years of dormancy and transferred 1 $ETH to a new address.\n\n\n\nHe received 2,365 $ETH($4.42M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/hOfBSyml19 pic.twitter.com/yoMoB6vE9n \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 24, 2023\n\nTo revive the wallet, the ICO participant sent just one Ethereum token to a new address in what appears to be a functionality test. The ICO era wallet received a total of 2,365 during the public sale, which was priced at approximately $0.31 at the time.\n\nThis address has HODLed the tokens through the storm and, at present, the tokens are worth roughly $4.42 million. While it remains unclear what the reasons for the reawakening are, it can be inferred that the address is likely interested in staking the tokens now that Ethereum as a network now allows for such investment, as most institutional investors are currently doing.\n\nThe reasons could also be to liquidate the asset, but from antecedents, this owner has witnessed Ether hit its all-time high price above $4,000 and may not be so quick to offload the coin at this time.\n\nEthereum price growth as motivation\n\nReawakening the wallet may have different causes, but the trust in the potential of Ethereum to hit new milestones now that the Shapella upgrade is live remains good motivation.\n\nEthereum is currently changing hands at $1,846.50 as it is entering the week with a largely bearish stride. While the more than 11% slump over the trailing seven-day period can be tagged as a bad omen for the digital currency, it can spell an overselling move that can further attract more investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe digital currency ecosystem is still very volatile, and Ethereum has what it takes to benefit from this industry feature."

I know they broke their 10-month high last week, leaving many investors (including myself) frustrated with gas prices sometimes higher than the value of the transaction itself.\n\nThis is a direct result of demand for decentralized applications (dApps), NFT trading, cryptocurrency, and Web3 services reaching an all-time high, which is a net positive for investors.\n\nUnfortunately, Ethereum can't handle all this new demand. And because gas prices depend on network traffic, supply of validators, and the amount of transactions needing validation-the more people that use Ethereum, the higher that gas prices climb.\n\nThat's because what you're actually paying for is the amount of computational power required to validate new transactions on the blockchain, the value of which increases with demand.\n\nEthereum gas is measured in \"gwei,\" the equivalent of 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nThe chart below illustrates how gas fees have steadily increased over the past six months.\n\nBut here's the kicker: higher demand also means a higher price for ETH, which has climbed by 50% in the same time frame.\n\nThe more people that use Ethereum...\n\n...the more transactions that need validating...\n\n...and the more money we're all going to pay to make it happen.\n\nWe're stuck with this problem until Ethereum can increase its transaction capacity, or another blockchain replaces it as the leading Web3 platform.\n\nSo, while we can't avoid these fees entirely... I can show you three ways to pay less.\n\nHere are three tips for avoiding high gas fees:\n\n#1 - Avoid Rush Hour\n\nCryptocurrency has peak traffic times, too. Gas fees are typically lower during off-peak hours when the network is less congested. You can time your transactions for these periods to save money on gas fees.\n\nGas prices are currently at their lowest between midnight and 4 a.m. (EST) on weekdays, and between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. (EST) on weekends.\n\nUse this chart to find out when gas fees will be their lowest and try to time your transactions for off-peak times.\n\n#2 - Use Exchanges that Bundle Transactions\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap can help save you money on Ethereum gas fees by bundling multiple transactions into one.\n\nUniswap does this using a market maker (AMM) model instead of a traditional order book that relies on liquidity pools to facilitate transactions, reducing the need for complex gas fee calculations and lowering the overall cost.\n\nYou can use Uniswap to convert Ethereum into other ETH-based cryptocurrencies for typically lower gas fees than what you'd find on MetaMask\n\nNot familiar with Uniswap? Start here.\n\n#3 - Utilize Layer-2 Solutions\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid high gas fees on Ethereum is by utilizing Layer-2 protocols like Polygon (MATIC).\n\nLayer-2 protocols have become vital scaling solutions for Ethereum by offloading transactions and validating them on a \"sidechain\" adjacent to the mainnet. We can access these sidechains and use them to conduct transactions for lower fees and faster processing times.\n\nThe most popular Layer-2 network for ETH is currently Polygon. To use Polygon instead of Ethereum, you'll need to own MATIC and connect to the network via MetaMask.\n\nLearn how to use Polygon here.\n\nBut there's another Layer-2 network I haven't mentioned here that I think is going to outperform Polygon long-term. I'm building my position in it right now, and I'm predicting a 10X return over the next three to five years.\n\nI'm keeping this asset hidden for now...unless you're subscribed to Digital Fortunes Network, in which case you can check out your April pick here.\n\nStay liquid,\n\nNick Black\n\nChief Crypto Strategist, American Institute for Crypto Investors\n\nThe post Three Tips for Avoiding Ethereum's High Gas Fees appeared first on American Institute for Crypto Investors."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin outflows hit $53.1 million last week\u2014meaning that, for the first time in six weeks, more funds flowed out of digital asset investment products than in.\n\nProfit-taking is largely to blame, especially considering there were few macroeconomic triggers that could influence BTC's price, says a new report from digital asset investment firm CoinShares.\n\nAnd that would suggest that meaningfully staying above the psychologically significant threshold of $30,000 could be a tough nut to crack for bulls. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin was sliding towards $27,000 and down 9% from the last week, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, digital asset investment products saw total outflows of $30 million in the seven days through April 21\u2014with CoinShares XBT, ProShares, and 3iQ the hardest-hit providers. The providers all manage exchange-traded products pegged to cryptocurrencies, an indirect way for institutional investors to get exposure to crypto markets without actually holding it.\n\nBut the devil's in the details. According to CoinShares head of research James Butterfill, there's one cryptocurrency that's bucking the trend in a big way.\n\nBasking in the glow of the successful \"Shapella\" upgrade, Ethereum actually enjoyed inflows of $17 million last week\u2014putting it far ahead of major altcoins, like Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Litecoin, which were mostly flat.\n\nThis indicates investors are feeling confident now that validators on Ethereum's proof-of-stake network can withdraw staked ETH if they so wish.\n\nButterfill also revealed that inflows into ETH-based funds came solely from Europe, which is fresh from approving much-welcomed, landmark legislation on cryptocurrencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll of this comes as regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. casts a long shadow over American crypto firms\u2014with the SEC's crackdown potentially prompting investors to sit on the sidelines.\n\nThere was also a clear continental divide when it came to Bitcoin.\n\n\"Regionally, the profit-taking was almost solely from North America, which saw outflows totaling $54 million,\" Butterfill wrote. \"This was offset by the continued optimistic sentiment in Germany which saw inflows totalling $29 million.\"\n\nThat optimism in Germany has undoubtedly been driven by the country's friendly tax regime, which states that cryptocurrency offloaded after 12 months isn't subject to capital gains."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that large entities are using bullish Ethereum (ETH) traders as liquidity to exit the markets.\n\nIn a new DataDash update, crypto analyst Nicholas Merten tells his 512,000 YouTube subscribers that many ETH traders are now trapped after Ethereum got rejected from resistance.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about how Ethereum was going to deviate above this range and that this again was the perfect range to start looking at getting bearish, essentially starting to create a plan for potential short positions, especially if we see that weakness. And take a look here at what we got, an 11 or 12% move down in a single week, completely reverting those gains and [it\u2019s] looking like we\u2019re ready to continue moving lower in the near term. Now why is this the case here?\u2026\n\nThis was the highest range we\u2019ve been in since back towards around May of 2022. This is what gets a lot of traders trapped because a lot of people think that when you break that potential resistance or that resistance that\u2019s been holding the price down for nearly a year, that\u2019s the time when everyone feels the urge to go long.\u201d\n\nMerten says that whales and institutions are likely taking advantage of ETH\u2019s current price structure and the exorbitant bullishness in the markets. He says he\u2019s anticipating prices heading significantly lower as the bigger traders take profits on the recent rally.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines, you got cash, you\u2019re feeling the FOMO (fear of missing out), and that\u2019s the time when everyone thinks they need to strike. Everyone who didn\u2019t catch the broader probably beginning at that point, and there\u2019s the optimal time for large-scale investors who have been riding this wave for a long period of time.\n\nThat is the period of time when they offload. They use those buyers as exit liquidity to sell positions they bought at a much greater discount at a much higher valuation. That\u2019s the name of the game guys, and if you\u2019re trading with that emotion, you will be utilized by these larger investors, these smarter people who essentially will take advantage of those emotions.\u201d\n\nMerten also looks at the big-picture macro conditions and warns that the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to continue tightening interest rates to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cContrarians in this environment cannot ignore the reality that in the macro environment right now, there is still a lot of inflation in the economy, and that the Federal Reserve is going to have to continue tightening much higher than people expect. We have been on that narrative for the past year, year and a half, whereas a lot of other people have been just constantly bullish, and it has proven right time and time again that inflation is sticky, it takes time to correct.\u201d\n\nETH is worth $1,837 at time of writing, down 13% in the last week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Binance is rebranding its Ethereum staking product and introducing a liquid staking token less than two weeks after Ethereum's Shapella upgrade enabled staking withdrawals.\n\nThe token, called Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH), will allow Binance users to participate in decentralized finance protocols off the exchange. Users will continue to acquire Ethereum staking rewards while doing so. From Thursday, users can wrap Beacon ETH (BETH) tokens to WBETH and unwrap WBETH to BETH tokens on the exchange's Ethereum staking page. There will be zero fees for the wrapping and unwrapping of these tokens.\n\nThe initial conversion is one-to-one, but this is subject to change since the value of WBETH will increase over time by the daily APR on Ethereum Staking, the announcement noted.\n\nLiquid staking tokens allow holders to stake ether and receive a derivative token that represents the locked cryptocurrency. This derivative can then be used across various crypto markets, effectively making the locked coins liquid.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLido dominates staking\n\nThe staking market is heavily dominated by Lido, which holds around 31% of the market share, according to data aggregated by Hildebert Moulie, a data scientist at Dragonfly Capital. Lido Finance's total value locked (TVL) surpassed 6 million ether (ETH), equivalent to over $12 billion, days after the Shapella upgrade on Ethereum.\n\nBybit's Head of Crypto Insights, Charmyn Ho, told The Block last week that liquid staking is \"poised to benefit the most from the Ethereum Shapella upgrade.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s gas price reached a 10-month high.\n\nThe ETH price was affected by the gains collected by meme traders.\n\nThe reappearance of seemingly profitable memes has helped Ethereum [ETH] record a whooping 73% hike in gas fees. Throughout the week that ended on 22 April, several meme cryptocurrencies caught the attention of the crypto community.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nIndebted to the resurgence\n\nCoincidentally, these highly volatile assets, which were mostly traded on the Arbitrium [ARB] network, engaged in an exchange of ETH. According to IntoTheBlock data, the rise in gas usage made Ethereum $66.7 million within the timeframe.\n\nEthereum fees rose a whopping 73% this week, with meme coin speculation driving gas costs.#ETH #PEPE pic.twitter.com/5U6xBMVFur \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 22, 2023\n\nIt is worth noting that increased activity on the Ethereum network can cause congestion and drive up fees.\n\nAlthough memes are considered high-risk assets and subject to sudden spikes and drops, there were a bunch of them which exhibited incredible performances in the past week.\n\nSome of these recently emerged memes include PEPE, whose market cap hit 100x within a few days. ArbDogeAI\u2019s [AIDOGE] value increased by over 7,000% last week. And most lately, the focus has been on REKT.\n\nThough most of these assets were currently experiencing a correction, they were instrumental to the rise of ETH circulation. At the time of writing, Santiment revealed that ETH\u2019s circulating supply rose significantly from 12 April.\n\nWhile the momentum cooled off, the hike meant that a lot of ETH was used in transactions in the last seven days. However, there has also been a decline in the average gas used.\n\nGridlock and reversals\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the average gas used has dropped to 43.99 Gwei. This reflected how traders have restrained from exchanging more ETH for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInterestingly, Glassnode reported on 23 April that Ethereum\u2019s average gas price reached a 10-month high. In a number of cases, ETH gas fees increase when there is a high demand for cryptocurrency. So, the price increased for the average user in order to avoid clogging.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s exchange inflow subsided at press time. The metric, which determines how much of the altcoin is flowing into exchanges, was at 18,200.\n\nBut over the week, there were several spikes that consented to increased activity since the memes were traded on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nIt was a similar situation with the exchange outflow. As of this writing, the metric was at 5,563. But with a large difference between the outflow and inflow, this condition suggested more of an ETH selling pressure.\n\nAs expected from cryptocurrencies under the meme bracket, the hype around the aforementioned tokens has dropped. And due to their hit-and-miss nature, investors may be looking to reconsider their risk appetite."

        "title": "Layer 0 Blockchain Protocols Explained | Definition & Examples - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "This guide focuses on the Layer 0 Blockchain networks, explaining what they are, the problems they solve, and how they work, as well as offering a breakdown of their architectures. Additionally, the guide also features a few examples of noteworthy Layer 0 blockchains currently in the market and their use cases.\n\nWhat is a Layer 0 Blockchain?\n\nDefinition A Layer 0 Blockchain is a protocol infrastructure on top of which other blockchains (particularly Layer 1s) are built. Think of it as a blockchain for blockchains. It is a foundational layer that comprises hardware, miners, connections, and a support framework for other decentralized protocols enabling easy cross-chain interoperability, scalability, and shared security. It is the underlying physical layer of the blockchain network.\n\nSo far, there are four layers of blockchains. They are:\n\nLayer 0 ;\n\n; Layer 1 ;\n\n; Layer 2 ;\n\n; Layer 3.\n\nLayer 3 Blockchain is the application layer that builds on top of the blockchain protocols and provides decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other value-added services to the network.\n\nLayer 2 blockchain refers to a scaling solution that operates on top of the main blockchain protocol and aims to increase its throughput, reduce transaction fees, and enhance user experience. They are an alternative to Layer 0 but with far fewer benefits compared to their counterparts.\n\nMost leading blockchains currently in the market are considered Layer 1 or base layer protocols. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC). However, due to their growing popularity over the last decade, it has become evident that they are prone to some key drawbacks.\n\nThe challenges include what is known as the \u2018blockchain trilemma,\u2019 a phrase coined by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. According to Buterin, blockchain developers have to choose amongst three priority design aspects that will help define the focus of their protocols. These are scalability (speed), security, and decentralization.\n\nButerin posited that only two of these three aspects could be met for every decentralized protocol, but not all three. For example, Bitcoin, the flagship blockchain, is the most secure of its peers and (arguably) among the most decentralized, but it is slow, managing to process about five transactions per second (TPS) and a block production time of ten minutes.\n\nNewer blockchains have opted for scalability and decentralization while deprioritizing security, and this is where Layer 0 comes in. As you\u2019ll learn, these core layer protocols are designed to solve the biggest challenges facing Layer 1s, as described above.\n\nBlockchain Challenges Layer 0 Protocols Seek to Solve\n\nWith the growing popularity of blockchain technology, experts have managed to identify three main challenges that most decentralized network protocols face. These are:\n\nScalability ;\n\n; Cross-chain interoperability ;\n\n; Usability.\n\nThese three challenges represent the bulk of the issues faced by blockchains and their developers. Now, let\u2019s dig deeper into what they are.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is a measure of how flexible a protocol is when handling an ever-increasing load of transactions. Most blockchains can easily handle low traffic typically experienced during their initial start.\n\nHowever, as they grow to accommodate a larger market share, they attract more traffic and users. This scenario leads to scaling challenges. As discussed before, blockchain designers have to decide which among three design aspects to focus on: scaling, security, or decentralization.\n\nMost of the newer protocols have placed a premium on scalability and decentralization through consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake (PoS). This way, they ensure that they can handle more transactions and achieve high flexibility when it comes to handling more users.\n\nTo achieve their target scalability objectives, most have sacrificed security, exposing them to attacks that have led to the loss of funds and critical information. This is what is the scalability trilemma every protocol designer has to go through when creating a new blockchain.\n\nInteroperability\n\nBlockchain interoperability is the ability for two or more blockchains to communicate and share resources. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum could be considered interoperable if applications created on either are able to communicate with each other.\n\nIt is, however, not the case in this situation and in most other cases since a majority of the current blockchains are created through unique designs adhering to custom protocols. The result is segregated and isolated services with varying user experiences.\n\nDevelopers have to learn varying skills and programming languages to adapt their applications or when creating new applications to run on various blockchain infrastructures.\n\nAs the blockchain scene matures, there is a growing need for the various decentralized applications (dApps) to communicate regardless of their host protocols. Different layered protocols, for instance, Layer 0s and Layer 1s, need to communicate to ensure the effective execution of tasks. The same is true of some Layer 1s and Layer 2 scalability solutions.\n\nThe most common solution for blockchain interoperability at the moment is using bridges, which are applications used to convert native tokens to be used on different protocols. However, there is a need for smoother interoperability as opposed to using bridges.\n\nFlexibility and usability\n\nFlexibility is the ease with which one can change from using one blockchain to the next. This is especially important for dApp developers looking to launch their applications on various networks.\n\nAt the moment, it is difficult designing one dApp to operate on multiple blockchains. For instance, a dApp created for Ethereum will not run on a competing chain, say Cardano or Solana. This means that a developer looking to launch a dApp on any or all of these platforms will have to create three versions of the same application.\n\nMore often than not, dApp developers will choose a single platform and create one version, thereby limiting their applications in terms of reach and features. There is a choice to make between launching an app on a scalable platform such as Solana or a more secure and decentralized one such as Ethereum.\n\nThere are merits and drawbacks to launching on any platform, but choosing one means losing out on the benefits of the other. This situation illustrates how inflexible the current blockchain development space is and why there is a need for a solution.\n\nHow Layer 0 Protocols Work to Solve These Challenges\n\nThere are three main elements that Layer 0 blockchain protocols have, and they are:\n\nMain chain; Side chain; Inter-blockchain transfer protocol.\n\nThese three elements complement each other to achieve the desired goals, which, for most L0 protocols, is providing interoperability and scalability for host networks. Here\u2019s a closer look into each element.\n\n1. Main chain\n\nAs the name alludes, the main chain is the central blockchain onto which transactions are recorded and kept immutably. It is the underlying infrastructure that runs the L0\u2019s governance and consensus mechanisms.\n\nThis means that information recorded from other derivative protocols or Layer 1s is kept on the main chain.\n\n2. Sidechain\n\nSidechains or base layer chains are protocols that are designed to host decentralized apps and scalability solutions. If you are a developer looking to launch your next dApp, you can do so on the side chain of an L0 blockchain.\n\nThe main advantage of using L0 side chains is that most Layer 0 protocols encourage the deployment of specialized side chains or Layer 1s, which means that end-user experiences are more controlled and optimized as opposed to using a single-layer blockchain.\n\nSide chain developers also have the option of designing their blockchains to use custom consensus mechanisms or opt to leverage the security of the underlying infrastructure or L0\u2019s consensus mechanism. This way, they can outsource the security of their network and focus on scalability and decentralization and thereby circumventing the scalability trilemma.\n\n3. Inter-blockchain transfer protocol\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle for Layer 0 blockchains is the cross-chain compatibility mechanism that enables various side chains to communicate with one another. A dApp on one blockchain platform can easily share data and information with another on a different side chain and with the L0.\n\nThere are several advantages to maintaining interoperability between various platforms, including enhancing specialization. Side chain developers no longer have to compromise on their creations. They now have the option of creating a highly-focused network that supports specialized dApps, which can share in/output data with other apps on different side chains to achieve their goals.\n\nPopular Layer 0 Blockchain Protocols\n\nLayer zero blockchain protocols are growing in number as more developers acknowledge the need and benefits of having more of these networks in place. So far, the more notable options in the marketplace include:\n\nVenom (VENOM) ;\n\n; Polkadot (DOT );\n\n); Cosmos (ATOM) ;\n\n; Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nAll Layer 0 protocols, like L1s, operate more or less in a similar manner, except for some nuanced features that help to differentiate them. Let\u2019s consider how these four L0 networks highlighted above operate and why they are worth an L1 developer\u2019s consideration for their next project.\n\n1. Venom Blockchain\n\nVenom Foundation\u2019s homepage\n\nVenom blockchain is a highly scalable, transparent, and secure Layer 0 network capable of processing as many as 100K \u2013 1M transactions every second. The protocol is Turing-complete, meaning that it can host self-executing scripts (smart contracts) like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nA standout feature of Venom is that it employs a hybrid consensus mechanism using both Proof of Stake (PoS staking) and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). Additionally, it is worth noting that the Venom Foundation, the entity behind the Venom L0 blockchain, is a fully regulated and registered institution by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).\n\nThe Venom blockchain maintains three distinct layers typical of layer zero networks, and they include:\n\nMasterchains \u2013 this is the main chain and the backbone of the Venom protocol that utilizes PoS and BFT consensus algorithms;\n\nWorkchains \u2013 these are specialized Layer-1 blockchains that can be used to achieve or serve various purposes.\n\nShardchains \u2013 these are blockchain partitions that are used to store and process a subset of the accounts running on the main chain. Sharding is what makes Venom highly scalable because the protocol can increase and reduce the number of shards dynamically according to demand.\n\n2. Polkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot homepage\n\nPolkadot is a creation of Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood which launched on mainnet in 2020. The network, considered a \u201cblockchain of blockchains,\u201d enables developers to launch fully-fledged decentralized networks, also called parallel chains or parachains.\n\nThe parachains are interconnected, ensuring easy communication and resource sharing through the main chain, also called the Relay Chain, which functions are the bridge between the various L1 blockchains.\n\nSimilar to Venom, Polkadot also uses sharding as a scalability solution in conjunction with nominated PoS staking, which is a slight variation on the PoS consensus mechanism. All in all, these features allow Polkadot to process between 1K and 100K transactions per second.\n\n3. Cosmos (ATOM)\n\nCosmos homepage\n\nCosmos is another popular Layer 0 blockchain with a history dating back to 2014. The network includes a mainchain called the Hub and multiple side chains called Zones.\n\nZones are, essentially, blockchains that can host decentralized apps and are able to communicate with other dApps through the network\u2019s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, thus enabling a seamless flow of data and information across the network.\n\nCosmos offers a suite of blockchain development tools called the Cosmos SDK (software development kit), which enables developers to whip up custom networks fast and cost-effectively.\n\nSo far, the Cosmos SDK has been used by developers to create several notable projects, including Binance\u2019s Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Cronos Blockchain, dYdX, Osmosis, Oasis Labs, Kava, and Evmos.\n\n4. Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche homepage\n\nAvalanche was launched in 2020 by Ava Labs, a blockchain development studio led by former Cornell University associate professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer. The project focuses on providing scaling solutions through its three constituent blockchain layers, i.e.: X-chain, C-chain, and P-chain.\n\nThe P-chain is the platform layer that handles governance by facilitating validator coordination, while X-chain handles asset swaps or exchanges. The last layer, the C-chain or contract-chain, is the layer that supports automated scripts (smart contracts) akin to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nTogether, the X, C, and P Chains ensure that Avalanche is able to provide a base for launching and deploying dApps that are fast and scalable. The network is able to scale to infinity, with a sub-2 second transaction finality.\n\nFor consensus, Avalanche uses the common Proof of Stake, providing an avenue for blockchain investors to earn by staking their tokens and partaking in the network governance.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nBlockchain scalability is proving to be a major challenge hindering widespread adoption, hence the growing popularity of scaling solutions such as the Layer 2 and Layer 0 networks. The latter offers several advantages, including providing scaling platforms, and blockchain interoperability, among others.\n\nHowever, these L0 solutions are still in their early stages, and whether they manage to achieve their goals remains to be seen. The blockchain space is highly dynamic, with an ever-increasing number of new projects launching by the day. The only way to truly gauge the success of Layer 0 blockchains will be to gauge who uses them and the impact level of projects created on them.\n\nDisclaimer The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative. When investing in crypto, your capital is at risk.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Layer 0 Blockchain Protocols\n\nWhat Is a Layer 0 Blockchain? Layer 0 blockchains are protocol infrastructure platforms on top of which other blockchains can be deployed. Essentially, they are blockchains for other blockchains.\n\nWhy are Layer 0s necessary? Layer 0 blockchains are essential because they enable seamless cross-chain interoperability and help fix blockchain scaling challenges.\n\nIs Ethereum a Layer 0? No, Ethereum is not a Layer 0 but rather a Layer 1 or base layer blockchain because it supports the deployment of decentralized apps. This is not a feature that is supported on the Layer 0 chains."

        "content": "Cointelegraph Markets Pro stunned traders on April 8 with a massive 379% gain from a single alert. The AI-powered crypto trading platform detects market-moving events as they happen. One of the indicators pointing to these events is the VORTECS\u2122 Score.\n\nOn April 7, OG Fan Token (OG) was getting ready for a remarkable rally. OG Fan Token is a cryptocurrency created for esports clubs to interact easier with their fans. In partnership with the blockchain mobile application Socios.com, the OG esports club powered by the Chiliz (CHZ) token aims to enhance the sporting experience. OG\u2019s rally this week was followed by an interest spike in fan tokens like Manchester City Fan Token (CITY) and FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR).\n\nThe token was trading at $2.90 when its VORTECS\u2122 Score \u2014 a historical \u201csnapshot\u201d comparison between current and past market conditions for individual coins \u2014 rose above 75. Over the next 24 hours, OG\u2019s price skyrocketed to $13.90. That\u2019s a remarkable jump of 379%!\n\nSource: Cointelegraph Markets Pro\n\nFive days later, traders could have captured additional gains as OG took off again. On April 13, a VORTECS\u2122 Score of 80 lit up. Over the next 24 hours, the token saw a rapid rise of 40%.\n\nAnyone with access to Markets Pro had a chance to capture these gains, which stand in stark contrast to Ether\u2019s (ETH) performance so far in April. Ethereum had the historic \u201cShanghai Capella\u201d upgrade, allowing token withdrawals to be made from the deposit contract.\n\nThe upgrade effectively unlocked $36.4 billion in staked ETH and drove the coin\u2019s price from $1,775 at the start of April to as high as $2,132 \u2014 a lackluster gain of just over 20%.\n\nCointelegraph Markets Pro, on the other hand, delivered multiple alerts that led to significant gains in the underlying tokens associated with those alerts. A summary of these results is provided in the weekly VORTECS\u2122 Report. Since March 26, a number of winning trade opportunities have stood out.\n\nVORTECS\u2122 Alerts\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) \u2014 45% gain\n\nRPL was one of many high VORTECS\u2122 assets this week! On April 13, a strong score of 80 was flashing when the asset was trading at $42.18. The price soon began a sharp ascent, peaking at $60.97 on April 17! That\u2019s an increase of 45%!\n\nA green score of 75 also briefly flashed on April 15 when RPL was trading at $52.53. Traders who bought this price point could\u2019ve seen a 16% gain in just two days!\n\nRPL is the utility and governance token of Rocket Pool, a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum. The project is the first Ethereum staking pool that is fully decentralized.\n\nSource: Cointelegraph Markets Pro\n\nTweet & Trade Volume Gainers\n\nSwipe (SXP) \u2014 163% gain\n\nSXP appeared on the Tweet, Trade, and Most Active On-Chain 24hr charts from March 28\u201331. At the time of its appearance on March 28, it was trading at $0.29, and on April 3, it peaked at $0.764. That\u2019s a whopping increase of 163%!\n\nSXP is the native token of Swipe, a cryptocurrency wallet ecosystem that allows easy exchanges of fiat money on different transactions and trading platforms.\n\nSource: Cointelegraph Markets Pro\n\nTrade Volume Gainers\n\nIcon (ICX) \u2014 76% gain\n\nICX topped the Trading Volume chart on April 2 when it was trading at $0.282. Just three days later, its price rose to $0.464, an impressive increase of 76%!\n\nICX is the native token of Icon, a blockchain network that aims to create a digital economy in which the Icon Network hosts other blockchain-based networks.\n\nSource: Cointelegraph Markets Pro\n\nA history of positive weekly gains\n\nCointelegraph Markets Pro delivered more than 204 alerts that led to double-digit gains in 2022. That is an average of four winning alerts per week and 17 winning alerts per month. This year, the crypto trading platform continues to alert members to these kinds of potential winning trades regardless of market conditions.\n\nWith new upgrades to the platform, Markets Pro 2.0 now includes not only the legacy AI indicators, such as the VORTECS\u2122 Score and NewsQuakes\u2122 alerts, but also a diversified range of new indicators including Top Exchange Inflows, Top Exchange Outflows, and Most Active On-Chain.\n\nThe additional indicators offer members of the Markets Pro community an opportunity to find more trading opportunities than ever before.\n\nSee how Cointelegraph Markets Pro delivers market-moving data before this information becomes public knowledge.\n\nCointelegraph is a publisher of financial information, not an investment adviser.

        "content": "Real Vision founder and macro guru Raoul Pal is expressing bullish sentiment on the stock market and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn the latest installment of the Global Macro Investor newsletter, Pal says the bullish thesis on the stock market partly stems from the recent weakness of the US dollar index (DXY), which suggests that investors are leaving the safety of the dollar in favor of risk assets like equities and crypto.\n\nAccording to the macro guru, the DXY is flashing a bearish pattern that if confirmed, could give stocks and crypto a boost.\n\n\u201cThe DXY looks to be forming a big head-and-shoulders top. A break of 101 will lead to significant downside (but all within a secular dollar bull market). This should give risk assets a tailwind\u2026\u201d\n\nLooking at global equities, Pal says that the stock market looks poised to break out from a bullish head-and-shoulders pattern.\n\n\u201cGlobal equities just look like the mirror image of the DXY and appear to be forming a large head-and-shoulders bottom. Again, all eyes on a potential DXY breakdown of 101. That\u2019s the signal to watch for and will probably suggest equities head much higher from here\u2026\u201d\n\nAs for Ethereum, the macro guru says that the second-largest crypto asset by market cap appears to be following in the footsteps of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2015 price action when it rallied from below $2,000 to above $3,000 in less than a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also throw in this chart on ETH that, as we\u2019ve been flagging for quite some time, continues to trade a lot like Bitcoin during the 2014-2016 period\u2026\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,842.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum staking withdrawals have entered their third \u201cround,\u201d but Ether (ETH) staking deposits have almost equaled them, according to the data from the analytics platform Nansen.\n\nEthereum staking withdrawals started ramping up for the third time on April 24 and into April 25. According to Nansen, the crypto exchange Kraken was responsible for a large portion of these withdrawals.\n\nA \u201cround\u201d refers to the number of days taken to process partial withdrawals and rewards. Nansen says it currently takes just under four and a half days.\n\nThe last large batch of withdrawals on April 24 was a total of 61,608 ETH in principal and reward withdrawals. However, at the same time, there were 63,009 ETH deposits, reported Nansen.\n\nThis has resulted in zero change in the balance of staked ETH over the past 24 hours.\n\nEther deposits (shown in blue) since April 18. Source: Nansen\n\nIn February, Kraken was forced to halt its Ethereum staking services following enforcement action and a fine by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused it of selling unregistered securities.\n\nAs a result, much of the ETH withdrawn early on has been from Kraken wallets as assets get returned to stakers. According to Nansen, 2.3% of the total withdrawable ETH remains from Kraken.\n\nNansen currently reports there is a total of 632,651 ETH waiting in the pending withdrawal queue. At current prices, this is valued at around $1.16 billion.\n\nThird round of principal withdrawals underway\n\n\n\nAgain largely Kraken, bringing their total principal withdrawn to almost 400k\n\n\n\nSource: @nansen_ai pic.twitter.com/jVnnxnl5Jf \u2014 Martin Lee | Nansen (@themlpx) April 24, 2023\n\nBefore the last wave of withdrawals commenced, Nansen reported an all-time high in the total amount of staked ETH. The figure hit 18,796,663 ETH valued at around $34.5 billion on April 24.\n\nRelated: ETH staking passes withdrawals for the first time since Shapella upgrade\n\nThe current figure, which is slightly lower than this peak, represents 14.5% of the total Ether supply. Due to the EIP-1559 burning mechanism, the total supply has declined by 114,077 ETH (around $209 million) since the Merge in September.\n\nConcerns over a massive exodus of staked Ethereum following the Shapella upgrade have been quashed. Token Unlocks is reporting that a total of 1.66 million ETH has been withdrawn since April 12, but 1.07 million ETH has been deposited, signaling there is still quite an appetite for staking Ether.\n\nMagazine: District 9 director\u2019s shooter, Decentraland red-light district battle: Web3 Gamer"

Although fewer active ETH is in circulation, the number of addresses holding at least 1 ETH continues to rise.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSmall Ethereum holders increase\n\nDespite experiencing a recent decline in price, Ethereum has continued to attract interest, as current data from Glassnode revealed.\n\nSince the Shanghai update, which made staked ETH available earlier this month, some addresses have shown positive activity.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data revealed that the number of addresses holding 0.01 or more coins had been steadily increasing, and as of this writing, the figure stood at over 23.7 million.\n\nThe current figure marked an all-time high.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s latest data, Ethereum (ETH) remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at over $222 billion. As of this writing, the total supply of Ethereum in circulation stood at over 120 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s active supply declines\n\nDespite the increasing number of addresses holding ETH, the supply of Ethereum that was active has been decreasing. Glassnode\u2019s \u201cAmount of Supply Last Active\u201d metric, which measures the percentage of active ETH between one week and one month, showed a decline.\n\nAs of this writing, the Supply Last Active was over 7.3 million ETH, and a visible decline could be seen on the chart.\n\nThe \u201ctotal supply last active\u201d metric indicates the total number of units of a cryptocurrency currently available. Also, it represents the most recent period in which any of those units were transacted or moved.\n\nThe decline in active ETH might be attributed to the volume of supply that was currently staked.\n\nNew Stake decreases as total stake increases\n\nUpon examining the staking statistics, it was evident that the number of staked ETH has been increasing. Currently, the total amount of staked ETH is almost 9 million.\n\nHowever, despite this rise, the volume of new stakes has experienced a significant drop recently. The observed chart shows that the number has decreased from around 93,000 daily to approximately 80,000.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFollowing its ascent above the $2,000 price range, the value of ETH has experienced a decline in recent days. As of this writing, it was trading at around $1,839, representing a loss of over 1%.\n\nThe decline marked the second consecutive day its value had been in the red zone on a daily timeframe chart."

        "content": "Since the CryptoKitties debacle in 2017, we\u2019ve been hearing promises that Ethereum would scale soon and that Vitalik Buterin and friends would pull a rabbit out of a hat to bring gas fees down for good.\n\nYet, over five years later, Ethereum is no further along. As an inherently flawed state machine, it can still only process 20 transactions per second (max) on the base layer, and fees fluctuate wildly depending on use.\n\nWe saw yet more evidence of this recently when a handful of meme coins created major congestion on Ethereum and almost tripled the average gas fee. While some Ethereum advocates celebrated the growth in revenue for stakers, others lamented the gas fee increase as $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO entered the top 10 gas burners on the network.\n\n\u26fd\ufe0f A highly unusual shift in top 10 gas burning #altcoins has emerged today. Instead of $ETH, $WETH, and $USDT being at the top of the fee distribution list, we're seeing new assets like $TROLL, $APED, and $BOBO among them. Read our latest deep dive. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/7SlmJ59k2m pic.twitter.com/Y2kaLKZTrL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 19, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s yet another demonstration that the Ethereum blockchain is wholly unsuitable as anything other than a novelty network for pet projects that don\u2019t require serious scaling.\n\nUtility is taking center stage, and Ethereum will not fare well\n\nIn July 2025, it will be Ethereum\u2019s 10th anniversary, and with the way the digital currency and blockchain markets are changing, it\u2019s not looking good for Vitalik Buterins\u2019 brainchild. Already, many Ethereum developers have jumped ship, realizing the promises coming out of the Ethereum camp were nothing more than hollow words; time and again, update after update, those who staked their futures on Ethereum have been left disappointed.\n\nWith the speculative mania of recent years dying down and regulations coming down hard on exchanges, promising to drive out unregulated stablecoins and limit leverage, we\u2019re seeing a shift of focus to utility, the real-world use cases of blockchain technology, and the problems it solves. In such an environment, hype machines like Ethereum will begin to fall behind as utility blockchains that can deliver the goods take center stage.\n\nFor example, take Bitcoin SV (BSV), the original protocol designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. It\u2019s currently processing millions of transactions daily with fees of just $0.000007 (04.20.23), and real companies like STUK.co and Haste Arcade are harnessing the power of the BSV blockchain to manage data and deliver services that would otherwise be impossible. See Haste\u2019s Instant Leaderboard Payout technology, which is used in its arcade, for one example.\n\nDeliver or die \u2013 there\u2019s no other way forward\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase and spell it out: the era of easy money, VCs throwing bags of cash at everything with the word blockchain in it, and rogue stablecoins like Tether pumping speculative tokens like BTC and ETH to insane heights is over. The big crash has already occurred, and just as with the Dot Com crash back in 2001, only the companies that use the blockchain to deliver real services in a way that\u2019s better than what\u2019s already out there will survive.\n\nSo, you tell me, how are companies going to deliver anything of value on a blockchain that is incapable of scaling on-chain, which has fees that almost triple when put under a little pressure by some silly memes coins? What serious business will be able to deliver blockchain services at an affordable cost when it can\u2019t even predict what its costs will be weekly or month to month?\n\nIn the new era, where blockchain startups have to do something useful to earn their money, they\u2019ll need utility blockchains that scale with fees that either remain low to build on. In this era, nobody will care whether you can run a node at home or whether Lord Vitalik says it\u2019s cool or not. Businesses don\u2019t deal in ideology; they deal in dollars and cents, and the most affordable solutions that work today will win.\n\nSeriously, get your study cap on and hit the books. Try to find a blockchain that can lay a glove on Satoshi\u2019s original Bitcoin; you won\u2019t be able to. Then, let logic take its natural course and ask yourself; how will companies building on blockchains like Ethereum compete with those building on BSV? They won\u2019t be able to, and that\u2019s all anybody really needs to figure out.\n\n\u201cBut Ethereum is going to scale!\u201d I can hear some shrill voices yelling internally as they read this. Yeah, right. If it could have, it would have, and if a feasible layer-two solution emerges in a couple of years, it\u2019s going to be too late. Businesses are signing deals now, and utility blockchains will have it all tied up before Vitalik Inc. delivers anything feasible.\n\nWe\u2019re well into the blockchain marathon now, and in the era of utility, those who have been focused on scaling and building superior technology are going to rapidly catch up with and overtake those who have been focused on pie-in-the-sky layer-two networks and coin prices. In BSV\u2019s case, it has already surpassed Ethereum many times over, and the gap is only going to widen.\n\nWhile Ethereum has been in the limelight during the early days of the industry, unless it delivers solutions that can best its competitors in the next year or two, it\u2019s not going to be relevant for much longer. After all, if a couple of meme coins can break the network, how is it ever going to underpin the global economy, as Ethereum maximalists claim?\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,\n\nEthereum, FTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "#CryptoExplained: A Brief History of Ethereum - Rolling Stone India",
        "content": "The crypto space moves fast, and Ethereum has singlehandedly changed the crypto landscape over the last 10 years with significant innovations that have come to define the space.\n\n2013\n\nEthereum was conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin who has become one of the key figures in the crypto ecosystem. He published his concept in the form of a white paper, similar to the way Bitcoin was introduced to the world. This white paper included his ideas for a world computer called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and smart contracts.\n\n2014\n\nThe Ethereum Initial Coin offering launched in 2014 and successfully raised $18 Million USD. The sale had 2 parts: a pre-sale which allocated Ethereum to early contributors and supporters and a public sale with an initial exchange rate of 2000 Eth for 1 BTC. The funds raised were used for the development of the platform, and a portion of the Eth was set aside for use by the Ethereum foundation to grow the ecosystem. In addition to Vitalik, the founders of the Ethereum Network included Gavin Wood who went on to found Polkadot, and Joseph Lubin who founded Consensys. The Ethereum ICO became the template for ICO\u2019s in the ICO boom of 2017.\n\n2015\n\nThe first Live release of Ethereum launched and was called \u201cFrontier\u201d. It launched on July 30th. The creation of the Genesis block marked the exact start of the network.\n\nFrom the official blog at the time of the launch:\n\n\u201cThe Dev team joins me in thanking each and every one of you for your support during the past year and half. It\u2019s incredible to see the progress that has taken place since that humble first commit on Christmas Eve 2013. The vision of a censorship-proof \u2018world computer\u2019 that anyone can program, paying exclusively for what they use and nothing more, is now a reality.\u201d\n\n2016\n\nThe DAO hack took place. The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization that was designed to be a new way to allocate funds to projects. Due to a vulnerability in the code 3.6 million eth worth a total of over 70 Million USD was stolen. This led to a controversial move by the Ethereum community who decided to fork the code to version before the hack occurred and recovered the funds. This was controversial because it questioned the immutability of the Eth ledger. Eth purists continued the version with the hack, and this gave birth to the Ethereum Classic, a network that\u2019s been running with the original Ethereum code since 2016.\n\n2017\n\nThe ICO boom was one of the most exciting periods in Ethereum History. ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, and ICOs paved the way for entirely new ways to fund new businesses. The boom also saw the advent of scam ICOs which relied on nefarious tactics like Pump and Dump to steal investor funds. Over $1B in funding was raised during the ICO boom.\n\nThis year also saw the launching of Crypto Punks, which paved the way for the NFT craze. Crypto punks are rare collectible NFTs and their value has increased significantly over the years. Many crypto punks are owned anonymously.\n\n2018\n\nUniswap launched as one of the first decentralized exchanges. It was a significant innovation in the crypto economy as it allowed anyone to exchange tokens built on the Ethereum ERC 20 standard and it popularized the use of Automated Market Makers or AMMs. Since its launch, Uniswap and other decentralized exchanges have grown to the point where they are likely to overtake centralized exchanges in volume. The FTX crisis in 2022 has made DEXs even more valuable as they are unlikely to be manipulated in the same way.\n\n2020\n\nThe most significant event in 2020 was the decision by the Ethereum community to move to Proof of Stake which would reduce the energy consumption of the network by 99%. In December 2020 Ethereum launched the genesis chain to begin the process. As part of the process, \u2018Validators\u2019 locked in 32 ETH (approx. 20000 USD at the time) for an unspecified amount of time to help secure the network and help it make the transition. Many skeptics believed at the time that this would mean the end of Ethereum, as a transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake had never been attempted.\n\nThis year also saw the DeFi boom. DeFi stands for decentralized finance and most people agree that this has changed the way finance works around the world and will continue to usher in financial innovations that are accessible to more and more people. DeFi is expected to do to the financial industry what the internet did to the Print and Media industries. It will enable anyone to provide financial services just like the internet enabled anyone to become a content creator and publish to large audiences.\n\n2021\n\nThis year had many major events in crypto all of which culminated in all-time highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transaction volumes were some of the highest ever seen and led to extremely high fees for applications running on Ethereum. All the while the Ethereum developers worked diligently to prepare for the merge which still did not have a date and would mark the complete transition to Proof of Stake.\n\nEthereum also implemented the London hard fork which turned Ethereum into a deflationary asset. By burning Ethereum with every transaction the amount of Ethereum being burned began to exceed the amount being minted, resulting in a reduction of supply. This means that over time the value of Ethereum is likely to increase as more apps utilize it and increase demand, while supply decreases.\n\n2022\n\nThe year of crashes and the merge! Terra Luna and FTX tanked the crypto market, but Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem kept working as designed and withstood an incredible stress test created by malicious centralized actors. In doing so Ethereum helped prove that DeFi was here to stay and was a far superior alternative to the centralized systems we are used to.\n\nAnd then on September 15th, 2022, it happened. The Ethereum network performed an unprecedented feat and successfully transitioned to Proof of Stake. The network experienced no downtime, no errors, and no malicious activity. It defied the skeptics and ushered in a new era of innovation.\n\n2023\n\nAnd that brings us to the Shanghai upgrade completed just a week ago. The primary purpose of this upgrade was to allow stakers to withdraw the Ethereum they locked into the network in 2019 to help secure the transition. Skeptics expected significant withdrawals that would briefly reduce the price of Ethereum. But this has not happened yet, and instead the price of Ethereum has risen. Most people expect this price increase to continue as more institutions begin to add Ethereum to their balance sheets since now it can be withdrawn within a reasonable amount of time."

CloudBet \u2013 Best Ethereum Gambling Site for Sports Betting\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing variety of sports betting markets\n\nGenerous welcome package for new players\n\nLive dealer games available\n\nAmazing mobile compatibility\n\nCons:\n\nDesign could use an update\n\nIf you are looking forward to betting on the upcoming sports events or wager on different events, you should take a look at what CloudBet has in store.\n\nEthereum Compatibility: 4/5\n\nCloudBet supports 12 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The minimum deposit necessary to be eligible for the welcome bonus is 0.01 ETH.\n\nThis online casino is designed exclusively for crypto players, especially for those who use Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nGame Variety: 4.5/5\n\nAs an established sportsbook, it can be expected that Cloudbet should have a great selection of sports betting markets for players to enjoy. There are over 30 sports to bet on, including major leagues like MMA, FIFA, and less mainstream ones like table tennis, snooker, and more.\n\nUnlike BitStarz, CloudBet doesn\u2019t have as many casino games offered to its players, but its 1,500 game selection and variety is already enough to keep its players satisfied.\n\nAt CloudBet, you can play a lot of slots, live casino games, and more. It is also worth noting that this brand is responsible for some of the excellent jackpot slots and an online casino behind the creation of high RTP games like Marching Legions, Royal Rumble XtraGatcha, and more.\n\nBonuses: 4.3/5\n\nWhen it comes to bonuses and promotions, CloudBet offers various bonuses and promotions for its players.\n\nThe first deposit starts with a 100% deposit match as a welcome offer, which will slowly go up to 5 for BTC, ETH, and BCH deposits.\n\nAs mentioned, you cannot get the bonuses all at once; instead, the game operator will add 0.01 BTC for every 800 loyalty points. After that, you can get the opportunity to win free spins on Volatile Vikings. Furthermore, the bookmaker gives zero-margin betting options for chosen leagues, events, and sports, ensuring the best prices.\n\nUser Interface: 4/5\n\nCloudbet was created last 2013, but its user interference was just recently updated to make it even more user-friendly.\n\nThis type of online casino is different from the typical ones, especially when it comes to its design. Its layout looks more like a sportsbook compared to other brands. However, it\u2019s not bad as it still looks professional and clean.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing to complain about, it would be the location of its banking area. For most people, the place where it is located looks unsuitable to see at first sight.\n\nCustomer Support: 4/5\n\nCloudbet casino has several available channels for customer support. The casino staff is also very friendly and reliable in answering all customer queries.\n\nIt has a live chat available 24/7 on its website for all customer concerns that require immediate feedback.\n\nAside from that, its email is also available on its website for concerns that do not need instant correspondence. The casino staff usually answers after an hour. They also offer an FAQ section for quick customer concerns. Despite the availability of these channels, Cloudbet casino lacks customer support via call.\n\nBet on your favorite sports and spend CloudBet\u2019s generous welcome bonus.\n\n5. mBit Casino \u2013 Most Exciting Tournaments of All Ethereum Casinos Online\n\nPros:\n\nMinimalistic casino lobby\n\nAmazing variety of casino games from leading providers\n\nHosts regular tourneys for slots and table games\n\nPayouts are processed almost instantly\n\nCons:\n\nSlow email response\n\nmBit Casino has improved its quality features throughout the years. Today, this online casino is constantly performing well with its fastest and most user-friendly website.\n\nWith over 2000 games, mBit casino allows players plenty of freedom to choose the game they love to spend their time with. But the casino is mostly known for its crypto slots and table wars \u2013 the exciting tournaments that players keep coming back for.\n\nEthereum Compatibility: 4.6/5\n\nAt mBit casino, you have the option to deposit among seven available cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nOther accepted currencies include Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. However, there are certain limits on how much you can deposit and withdraw with these listed methods.\n\nBut what makes this preferable for others is that almost all casino games available can be played using ETH.\n\nGame Variety: 4.6/5\n\nmBit casino has a large selection of over 2,700 fun and exciting casino games to offer its players, such as Blackjack, Roulette, Baccarat, and many more. Over 1,161 of them are slot games, making sure slot enthusiasts won\u2019t ever get bored.\n\nDespite having thousands of casino games available, mBit casino only has limited crypto games, which is quite odd for a crypto online site.\n\nOverall, this casino still has many games to offer in the market, making it one of the top-rated online casinos so far.\n\nBonuses: 4.3/5\n\nmBit casino offers generous welcome bonuses and rewards to keep their new and existing players happy. New players who sign up on mBit casino, will receive a welcome deposit bonus of 110% up to 1 BTC and 300 free spins on their first deposit. The wagering requirement is 35x.\n\nMoreover, they can also receive additional perks for the second deposit of 100% up to 2.5 BTC and a 75% bonus up to 1.5 BTC for their third deposit.\n\nThis is such a great deal compared to other casinos who mostly just offer welcome bonuses on their first deposit.

They have a live chat available that is accessible 24/7 for those who want instant responses.\n\nTheir email address is also readily available on their website. But as much as they\u2019re great options for customer support, they lack two other important factors for accessible customer support \u2014 a phone hotline and a user-friendly FAQ section.\n\n\n\nSign up for a new account at mBit and score your welcome package!\n\n\n\nRunners-up:\n\nRanking Methodology for the Best Ethereum Gambling Sites\n\nEthereum Casino Compatibility\n\nFirst of all, we made sure that all of the gambling sites listed above accept Ethereum.

This would help them decide which Ethereum casino offers the best bonus offers and promotions today.\n\nUser Interface\n\nA casino website\u2019s user interface is one of the most important factors to be considered, given that all Ethereum gambling sites are different. We looked at website themes, accessibility, design, etc. Smooth navigation and fast loading speeds are two of the most important factors we considered.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nLastly, we looked into each Ethereum casino\u2019s customer support team. They need to have multiple communication channels available on their website for easier use and convenience. We checked whether they had an existing email address, phone hotline, and a 24/7 live chat feature.

        "content": "Ethereum is not yet the base layer of trust on the internet. To get there it has to go through several more upgrades. As it does so, the way it operates will continue to change and evolve. But because Ethereum is the primary ecosystem for most crypto, each stage of evolution will create new opportunities for technologies, innovations, and businesses.\n\nThe biggest change coming to Ethereum in the near future is the move to something called Proto-Danksharding. This is a way for Ethereum to scale the number of transactions it can process. Currently, Ethereum is a single blockchain which can process around 15 transactions per second. After this upgrade, it should be able to process over 100,000 transactions per second. For reference, Visa can process 1,700 transactions per second.\n\nTransaction fees currently are also very high, and often become prohibitively expensive when a lot of people are using the Ethereum network at the same time. But this will also change with future upgrades and expectations are that fees will drop to less than $0.001. With high transaction volumes and low fees, Ethereum will improve the economics of the businesses that run on it.\n\nUpgrades that Increase transaction volumes and lower fees will likely take place within the next two years and are much needed. However, the Ethereum roadmap is also looking at what Ethereum will look like beyond the next two years.\n\nIn several talks, Vitalik has discussed various possibilities for the future of Ethereum. Most of these include the \u201coutsourcing\u201d of certain tasks away from the network itself. For example, the Ethereum blockchain currently contains all the transactions since the first one. This means that maintaining the network requires a lot of memory from participants. One of the proposals for the future state of Ethereum is to incentivize service providers to store historic data and only maintain two to three years worth of information at a time. This could create new business models around archiving old data.\n\nFuture upgrades will primarily focus on making Ethereum even more efficient and getting it to a state where it will no longer require significant changes for 10 to 20 years. This is because every time Ethereum is upgraded, trillions of dollars are affected and businesses built on Ethereum have to expend several hours of technical expertise on ensuring their tech is ready for the change. For Ethereum to truly become the base layer of trust, it will need to stay constant in a rapidly changing world.\n\nAs the base layer of trust strengthens collaboration around the globe, humanity could solve some pressing challenges like climate change, poverty, and becoming a multi-planetary species."

        "content": "Ethereum price has sent a bullish signal on the four-hour chart in the form of a bullish divergence from the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This setup points to an ETH recovery bringing a move to areas above the $2,000 psychological into the picture.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Bullish From A Technical Outlook\n\nAfter being turned away from the $2,142 local high, Ethereum embarked on a downtrend that was halted around the $1,800 support zone. Ether has then been displaying range bound movement producing a series of lower highs and lower lows, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) produced lower highs. This resulted in a non-conformity scenario referred to as a \u201cbullish divergence\u201d.\n\nA bullish divergence is a technical setup that suggests that the bulls have not given up on pushing the price higher. This formation from the RSI forecasts an upward recovery in the Ethereum price. The levels that buyers likely have their eyes on is the $1,973, which is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downturn as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $2,069\n\nShattering this resistance will allow Ether\u2019s price to tag the $2,100 hurdle and later the $2,142 swing high. Such a move would bring the total gains to 18% for the ETH traders.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nApart from the bullish divergence from the RSI, the price sat on a four-hour demand zone, as shown on the chart above. This was the area stretching from $1,640 to $1,760 that could provide the oomph required by the buyers to scale ETH higher.\n\nNote that the last time the price consolidated within this region between March 12 and March 28, it went on to surge 22% to 10-month highs close to $2,150. Therefore, even if Ethereum drops back into this level, demand pressure from this zone could lift the price back up, avoiding the price from tanking below the said level.\n\nOn the downside, if bulls fail to lift Ethereum up and sellers tighten their grip instead, it could spell doom for the largest altcoin by market value. If this happens, ETH could slide below the 23.6$ Fibonacci retracement level at $1,805 and back into the bullish breaker, described above.\n\nIn highly bearish cases, a four-hour candlestick close below $1,640 would invalidate the bullish thesis for Ethereum price and potentially trigger a correction to $1,531 and $1,470 defense levels.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As the crypto market experiences a bullish momentum, investors keep a close eye on developments in China, where the cryptocurrency narrative is undergoing significant shifts.\n\nOne of the most notable events is the \"Shanghai\" upgrade of Ethereum (ETH), spearheaded by its founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nThis article examines the similarities and differences between Ethereum and VeChain (VET), a China-based cryptocurrency, and analyses how these developments affect the larger Chinese crypto narrative. Additionally, we explore the concept of liquid staking wars and how it impacts these currencies.\n\nFinally, we examine whyBig Eyes Coin (BIG), a cryptocurrency that operates similarly to Ethereum and VeChain, is a solid investment opportunity going into the bull market.\n\nInnovation in Ethereum with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nInnovation in Ethereum with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies globally, with a market capitalization of $241 billion. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, is known for his constant efforts to upgrade the currency's capabilities.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is one of the latest developments. It aims to improve the currency's scalability by introducing a new liquid staking mechanism. This mechanism allows users to stake their ETH tokens while keeping them liquid, making it easier to use them for other purposes.\n\nThis upgrade is essential for Ethereum's growth and allows the currency to handle more transactions while still being efficient.\n\nVeChain and the Chinese Crypto Narrative\n\nVeChain (VET) is another popular cryptocurrency in China, with a market capitalization of $7 billion. Unlike ETH, which focuses on general-purpose blockchain solutions, VET is explicitly designed for supply chain management.\n\nIt can track products' origins, quality, and shipping information. Given China's extensive manufacturing sector, VET's use case is highly relevant. Moreover, VET has also partnered with the Chinese government, providing legitimacy that other cryptocurrencies may not have.\n\nThese factors have made VET a favourite among Chinese investors, particularly those seeking investment in blockchain-based solutions.\n\nLiquid Staking Wars and Beyond\n\nLiquid staking has emerged as a significant concept in the crypto world, particularly in China. As Ethereum (ETH) introduces this mechanism, other currencies like Polkadot and Solana are developing similar solutions.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) offers a compelling opportunity to invest in a currency that operates similarly to ETH and VET.\n\nThis has led to \"liquid staking wars,\" where different currencies compete to provide the best solutions. While this competition is healthy for the industry, it also challenges investors.\n\nChoosing which currency to invest in requires careful consideration of each currency's specific strengths and weaknesses. In this regard, ETH's long-standing reputation and Vitalik Buterin's track record make it a solid choice for investors looking for stability.\n\nVET's targeted use case and government partnerships make it an attractive option for investing in China.\n\nAs Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is still in the presale stage, innovations by other currencies like ETH will inspire the trajectory taken by this alternative coin, which has been taking into consideration the rise in the prevalence of liquid staking.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum and the rise of VeChain in China exemplify the changing narrative around cryptocurrencies in the country.\n\nAs China seeks to embrace blockchain technology while maintaining control over its financial sector, currencies offering specific use cases and legitimacy are gaining favour among investors.\n\nMoreover, liquid staking is emerging as a crucial factor in currency selection. As different currencies compete to offer the best solutions, investors must carefully consider each currency's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nETH and VET are solid choices in this regard, particularly as the market experiences a bullish momentum. For investors looking to take advantage of this trend, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) offers a compelling opportunity to invest in a currency that operates similarly to ETH and VET. By staking BIG, investors can also earn rewards while maintaining liquidity, making it an attractive choice for those looking to enter the market.\n\nMore About Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nWebsite:https://bigeyes.space\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nDisclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/ editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

Read till the end to know more!\n\nChinese Crypto Banks Turn To Hong Kong\n\nChinese banks have shown interest in building partnerships and onboarding regulated crypto companies in Hong Kong. Since crypto trading has been banned in the mainland since 2021, state-affiliated banks in China have shown interest in building partnerships and onboarding regulated crypto companies in Hong Kong. These banks are looking to leverage the province\u2019s development to tap into the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter the restriction of a security crackdown and COVID regulations, Hong Kong is emerging as a financial hub for cryptocurrency in China.

This exchange itself was visited by 13,000 people on its first day at the recent Hong Kong Web3 Festival.\n\nBitcoin Reels, Ethereum Flourishes As Shanghai \u201cUpgrades\u201d\n\nMuch to the dismay of optimistic watchers, Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a dip below the $30k level: decrease of 1.12% on the $29,996 mark. The coin surged through the week by 5%, peaking at $31,005 on Friday, before fluctuating over the weekend. Meanwhile, after a continued 12% week-long surge post the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) is at the $2101 mark, a 134% increase since the lowest value in June last year.\n\nSignUpToken.com: Ready To Take Over The Market!\n\nSignUpToken.com is a new altcoin that is similar to other cryptocurrencies but has some unique features.

        "title": "Ethereum and how it has affected London's business sector in recent years - London Post",
        "content": "Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain-based platform that enables developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts. The platform was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer, and has quickly become one of the most popular blockchain platforms in the world.\n\nEthereum\u2019s history dates back to 2013 when Vitalik Buterin proposed the idea of a blockchain-based platform that could run decentralized applications. The platform was launched in 2015, and since then, it has grown rapidly, attracting a large community of developers and businesses.\n\nLondon has always been a hub for business and finance, and with the rise of Ethereum, the city\u2019s business landscape has undergone a significant transformation. In recent years, Ethereum has been increasingly adopted by businesses in various industries, including gambling. The use of Ethereum in the gambling industry has brought about significant advantages and changes, making it a topic of interest for businesses and investors alike. This paper aims to explore the impact of Ethereum on London\u2019s business sector, with a particular focus on its impact on the gambling industry.\n\nEthereum\u2019s impact on London\u2019s business sector\n\nEthereum has had a significant impact on London\u2019s business sector in recent years. The decentralized nature of the Ethereum platform and its ability to execute smart contracts has made it an attractive option for businesses in various industries. The use of Ethereum has enabled businesses to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of Ethereum is that it has made transactions more efficient. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology enables businesses to execute transactions instantly without the need for intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions. This has made transactions faster, more secure, and more cost-effective. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality allows for the automation of transactions, reducing the need for manual intervention and streamlining business operations.\n\nEthereum\u2019s decentralized nature and open-source platform have facilitated the growth of new businesses in London. The platform has made it easier for startups to access funding through initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other crowdfunding methods. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has also enabled startups to create decentralized applications, providing new business opportunities in various industries. The ability to create decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform has provided businesses with new revenue streams, while also promoting innovation and creativity in the business sector.\n\nEthereum\u2019s impact on the gambling industry\n\nLondon is home to a thriving gambling industry, with various casinos and betting shops located throughout the city. The industry has been experiencing significant growth in recent years, driven in part by the adoption of new technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum has had a significant impact on the gambling industry in London. The use of Ethereum in gambling has brought about several changes, including the adoption of cryptocurrency payments, the introduction of smart contracts, and the creation of decentralized gambling platforms. These changes have made the gambling industry more transparent, secure, and fair.\n\nThe use of Ethereum in gambling has several advantages. First, it provides users with greater anonymity and privacy when making transactions, making it a popular option among online gamblers. Second, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality enables the creation of decentralized gambling platforms that are transparent and fair. Third, Ethereum\u2019s fast transaction processing times and low transaction fees make it an attractive option for both gamblers and casino operators.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of using Ethereum in gambling is the availability of Ethereum casinos. These are online casinos that accept Ethereum as a payment method, providing users with a fast and secure way to deposit and withdraw funds. Ethereum casinos offer various benefits, such as high levels of security and transparency, instant payments, and access to a wide range of games. If you\u2019re interested in exploring the world of Ethereum casinos, you can check out a list of Ethereum casinos for a comprehensive review of the top options available.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum has had a significant impact on the gambling industry in London, bringing about several changes and advantages. The use of Ethereum in gambling has enabled greater transparency, security, and fairness, making it an attractive option for both gamblers and casino operators. The availability of Ethereum casinos has further contributed to the growth of the industry, providing users with a fast and secure way to access their favorite games.\n\nChallenges and future developments\n\nWhile Ethereum has had a significant impact on London\u2019s business sector, it has also faced several challenges. One of the primary challenges is scalability. Ethereum\u2019s current transaction processing speed is limited, making it difficult for businesses to scale their operations. Additionally, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices can make it difficult for businesses to manage their finances effectively.\n\nAnother challenge facing Ethereum in London\u2019s business sector is regulatory compliance. The use of cryptocurrency in business transactions is still a relatively new concept, and regulatory bodies are still developing guidelines and regulations for its use. This can create uncertainty and legal implications for businesses that use Ethereum in their operations.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are several potential future developments in Ethereum technology that could address these issues. One of the most significant developments is Ethereum 2.0, which is set to launch in phases over the coming years. Ethereum 2.0 is expected to significantly improve the platform\u2019s scalability, making it faster and more efficient. It will also introduce new features such as sharding, which will allow the network to handle more transactions at once.\n\nAnother potential development is the integration of Ethereum with other blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network. This could enable faster and more cost-effective transactions across different blockchain networks, further improving the efficiency of Ethereum in London\u2019s business sector.\n\nThese developments have the potential to significantly impact London\u2019s business sector. The improved scalability and efficiency of Ethereum could enable businesses to scale their operations and handle larger transaction volumes, opening up new opportunities for growth and expansion. The integration of Ethereum with other blockchain networks could also facilitate greater interoperability between different businesses, making it easier to conduct cross-border transactions and collaborate on projects.\n\nHowever, these developments also bring with them potential risks and challenges. As Ethereum becomes more efficient and scalable, it may become more attractive to malicious actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities in the system. Additionally, the increasing complexity of Ethereum technology may make it more difficult for businesses to understand and navigate, creating barriers to entry for new adopters.\n\nOverall\n\nIn recent years, Ethereum has had a significant impact on London\u2019s business sector. Its decentralized and transparent nature has made it an attractive alternative to traditional payment methods, and its smart contract functionality has enabled the creation of new business models and opportunities. The adoption of Ethereum by businesses in London has facilitated more efficient transactions and has helped to support the growth of new businesses.\n\nOne of the areas in which Ethereum has had a particularly significant impact is the gambling industry. By enabling faster and more secure transactions, Ethereum has made it possible for online casinos to operate more effectively, and has helped to make the industry more accessible to a wider audience. The use of smart contracts has also made it possible to create new and innovative gambling products and services.\n\nWhile Ethereum has brought many benefits to London\u2019s business sector, it has also faced several challenges. Scalability and regulatory compliance are two of the primary challenges that must be addressed to ensure the continued growth and adoption of Ethereum in the city\u2019s business community. However, with the launch of Ethereum 2.0 and other potential developments in the technology, these challenges are being actively addressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nLinkedIn\n\n"

        "title": "Crypto's Top Contenders: A Look At The Three Most Promising Cryptocurrencies Of 2023 - Bitcoin, Ethereum & Dogetti - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade, with Bitcoin (BTC) being the pioneer in the world of decentralized digital currencies. In recent years, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) and Dogetti (DETI) have emerged, offering unique features and potential to investors and enthusiasts. Despite this, some people are still skeptical about the benefits of crypto and question its relevance. In this article, we will explore why we should embrace cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti, and the potential they offer for trading and investment.\n\nReimagining Investment with Bitcoin: A Solid Crypto Asset\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been around since 2009 and operates on a decentralised blockchain network, offering a secure and transparent way to transfer value without the need for intermediaries such as banks. With a maximum supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature has earned it comparisons to gold. Holding onto Bitcoin for the long term has the potential to yield substantial returns, making it a worthwhile investment to consider.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Smart Contracts: Revolutionising Decentralised Applications\n\nFounded in 2015, Ethereum (ETH) expands upon blockchain technology to enable the creation of decentralised applications and smart contracts. In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s scope extends beyond basic transactions. The introduction of smart contracts is a game-changer, particularly in real estate transactions where the buying and selling process can be automated. Imagine being able to purchase a home without leaving your house! Smart contracts make this possibility a reality.\n\nDogetti: A Meme Coin Offering Passive Income for Investors\n\nDogetti is a new presale meme coin that aims to establish a robust community that rewards holders regularly. It operates on the Ethereum network and employs a unique 2% reflection protocol that distributes 2% of every transaction to all wallets, providing a passive income opportunity for its holders. As a result, Dogetti is gaining traction in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nDogetti token is primarily used for DogettiSwap, and the platform\u2019s tokenomics demonstrate its commitment to the community. The platform imposes a 6% tax on each transaction, out of which 2% is distributed to all token holders, 2% to charity, and the remaining 2% is used for token liquidity. In addition to financial gain, Dogetti strives to contribute to charitable causes and enhance the community\u2019s financial status as the platform expands.\n\nFurthermore, Dogetti offers a vibrant community with a range of promising opportunities. Investors can buy, sell, and trade DogettiNFTs and participate in decision-making through DogettiDAO. The cryptocurrency\u2019s robust and tight-knit community is dedicated to growing together, and Dogetti provides exciting prospects for future community involvement.\n\nCurrently, Dogetti is running a limited-time promo code \u201cDON50,\u201d which offers investors a 50% bonus for free.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti are distinct cryptocurrencies that offer potential for investment and trading. These currencies provide a decentralised and transparent medium to transfer value, grant access to global financial markets, and have the capacity to revolutionise various industries. Embracing their potential and backing the growth of new cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can unleash their full potential and pave the way for a decentralised future.\n\nFor More Information On Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been a bumpy ride for investors, leaving many wondering about its future. While some experts predict a potential crash, others maintain a positive outlook. With regulatory twists and fresh crypto developments, the market\u2019s future is both hazy and exhilarating. Therefore, for intermediate or advanced-level investors seeking adventure, this will help them navigate the current crypto climate.\n\nA prolonged period of bearish market conditions in the cryptocurrency world is known as a \u201cCrypto winter.\u201d It is characterized by significant price drops and reduced market capitalization. Predicting the crypto market\u2019s trajectory is a challenging task due to the significant fluctuations and recoveries that have marked its history. However, in 2023, the market has shown signs of recovery, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) rallying, despite negative headlines. The new meme coin Dogetti (DETI) is proving itself as a promising investment for quick returns.\n\nBitcoin For The Long Run\n\nIn April 2023, Bitcoin enjoyed a moment in the sun when it approached 30K, eventually settling at $28,070, representing a 19.2% monthly gain. On Thursday, Bitcoin traded at approximately $28,600, dropping as low as $28,289 earlier in the day. This marks the fifth time the digital currency has fallen in the past six days. Bitcoin had a remarkable surge in the past few months, reaching above $30,000 for the first time in ten months last Tuesday, and hitting $31,019 late last Thursday, making it the highest level since June 7 last year. Bitcoin saw a 20% increase in March, which is its best performance since January, when it rose by 38.7%.\n\nOverall, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has rallied by about 73% since the beginning of the year. Although Bitcoin has experienced its ups and downs, with a current market cap of, it remains the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency and still has room to grow. While Bitcoin has had a stronger correlation with the stock market in recent years, it is unclear if rising interest rates will impact this trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Predictions\n\nEthereum (ETH) also climbed 9.7% in March 2023, ending the month at a respectable $1,829. Wolf, a Twitter user and renowned analyst, has attributed the bullish prediction for Ethereum\u2019s growth to the increasing demand for decentralised applications (dApps) and the platform\u2019s dominance in the DeFi and NFT markets. Meanwhile, Brian Schuster, the founder of Ark Capital LLC, is even more optimistic, suggesting that Ethereum could potentially replace many traditional financial services. Schuster believes that Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native token, could compete as global money and capture a share of the $123 trillion in global Money and quasi-money (M2).\n\nEthereum 2.0, also referred to as Eth2, is a series of upgrades designed to enhance the efficiency and security of the Ethereum network. TThese upgrades\u2019 primary focus is moving away from the current Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, which was successfully completed last year. This transition is expected to result in lower energy consumption and faster transaction processing times, making the network more eco-friendly and cost-efficient.\n\nDogetti For Quick Profits\n\nThe upcoming presale token, Dogetti (DETI) has captured the attention of the crypto world, and is set to be one of the most highly anticipated coins of the year. Originally scheduled to launch in the fifth stage of the presale, the Dogetti team has pushed the release date to June 20th.\n\nThe project has successfully raised $941,223 and has already sold 8.74 billion tokens, accounting for almost one-fifth of the total supply of 50 billion tokens. Dogetti\u2019s affordability has made it a popular choice for budget-conscious investors seeking low-cost investment opportunities. Additionally, the large token supply may help balance supply and demand, ultimately promoting price stability.\n\nInvestors are drawn to Dogetti\u2019s many offerings, including its NFT marketplace, a reflective protocol that redistributes 2% of the 6% transaction tax back to the community, and a deflationary tokenomics model that ensures the coin\u2019s longevity.\n\nThe Dogetti team is now preparing to launch a series of NFTs that will grant community members access to unique digital companions. These NFTs are expected to have significant value and will be available for trade, sale, and purchase on the NFT marketplace, as well as provide exclusive access to Dogetti events and content.\n\nDogetti DAO is another notable feature that allows the community to participate in voting and proposing ideas, thereby giving users a unique sense of ownership over the coin that is rarely seen in other crypto ventures.\n\nWhat distinguishes Dogetti from other cryptocurrencies is its community-driven approach. Holding DETI tokens provides users access to a closely-knit community, and the team plans to leverage this dynamic community to promote the coin\u2019s success.\n\nTo mitigate risks, it is advisable to diversify your investment portfolio. Rather than investing all your money in established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, consider investing in other new altcoins/meme coins like Dogetti to spread out potential gains or losses.\n\nFor more information about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Snowmantastic has announced its movement from Ethereum to Cardano.\n\nThe reason has been linked to the high gas fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nSnowmantastic NFT project has become the latest to announce its transition from the Ethereum network to the Cardano network. According to the team, there was serious deliberation and planning before bringing it to the public domain.\n\nAs stated in their announcement, the transition of the Snowmantastic NFT project was largely influenced by the high fee cost present on the Ethereum network. Also, several other factors not disclosed were stated to be part of this move. On the Ethereum network, Snowmantastic has collaborated with over 200 projects.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/snowmantastic/status/1650591769505964033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nThis is just one of the many projects moving from Ethereum to Cardano. In March, a popular NFT collector identified on Twitter as @Alex_ADA_ announced his decision to move to Cardano from the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to him, the current limitations of Ethereum have led to slow transactions and high gas fees. Cardano addresses this problem as its Ouroboros Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm makes the network more scalable and efficient. Another reason for his transition is sustainability. According to him, the Proof of Stake model of Cardano is energy efficient and environmentally friendly compared to Ethereum. Another reason is financial inclusion.\n\nCardano\u2019s mission to bank the unbanked resonates with me. Their focus on empowering developing countries and providing access to the global economy can have a life-changing impact on millions of people.\n\nAlonzo upgrade of Cardano provides a better outcome\n\nCardano also has a better smart contract capability with the recent launch of the Alonzo upgrade. It has become a viable option for developers seeking to build decentralized applications. This, in addition to its interoperability, influenced his decision and possibly all NFT projects moving to Cardano.\n\nInteroperability: Cardano is built with interoperability in mind, aiming to connect with other blockchains and legacy systems. This is crucial for the future of cryptocurrencies and seamless integration with the broader financial ecosystem. In conclusion, while I appreciate the innovations #Ethereum has brought to the table, I believe #Cardano is better positioned for the future of decentralized finance and applications.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the most popular platform for minting NFTs, layer 1 blockchains and layer 2 networks are recording increasing sales recently. Cardano (ADA), Polygon, and Solana are the hottest in the market with Cardano recording 86 percent sales in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe surge has been linked to two main projects, Goofy Gophers and Spacebudz that have over $70,000 in trading volume in the last 24 hours. Solana also recorded a jump in unique buyers and sellers on April 22. Mad Lads had so much demand that it had to delay its mint. This contributed to the $8 million of the $9.9 million in sales on April 22. Solana\u2019s sales volume has increased by 129 percent in the last seven days.\n\nAlso, NFT collection Y00ts, which recently migrated from Solana to Polygon has led to increased sales in the past days on the network.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Co-founder and Sadhguru discuss the intersection of technology and human consciousness - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "On April 25th, the reState Foundation hosted a virtual talk between Vitalik Buterin, co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, and Sadhguru, the founder of the Isha Foundation. The topic of discussion was the intersection of technology and human consciousness. Blockchain technology is transforming the way humans interact with the digital world. This has prompted conversations among thought leaders from within and outside the industry about the implications of emerging technologies on the human experience.\n\nButerin started the conversation by highlighting that the core of blockchain technology is centered around human coordination and interaction. He explained that blockchain technology can help different groups of people collaborate across large distances on various kinds of projects. Technology makes it easier for people to recognize complicated identities and connect with one another on common ground.\n\nSadhguru pointed out that there is a growing gap between the rate of technological evolution and the progression of human ethical and consciousness development, with the latter lagging behind. He attributed this to the need for humans to identify with a group. According to the Indian mystic, this need for self-identification surrenders intelligence to \u201cprotecting and defending the identity\u201d of that group.\n\nSadhguru and Ethereum Co-founder take\n\nThe Ethereum Co-founder agreed with Sadhguru\u2019s assessment and added that emerging technologies would not solve all problems of users. But agreements and disagreements in the space have the potential to result in \u201crealized cooperation\u201d and learning opportunities. He believes that these are the kinds of ideas that people in Ethereum and related communities really care about.\n\nBoth speakers emphasized the importance of proper usage of technologies like blockchain. They pointed to the fact that humans are the \u201chighest level of technology\u201d and that by being mindful of this, we can improve the way we interact with technology. They believe that blockchain technology when implemented as a tool for greater understanding and raising human consciousness, can have a positive impact on the world.\n\nAs these new technologies continue to take precedence in the lives of users and in systems around the world, it is important to remember that humans are at the forefront of their development and implementation. The proper usage of blockchain technology will require a conscious effort to ensure that it is being used for the betterment of society. The Ethereum inventor encouraged listeners to be mindful of the role they play in this process and to use emerging technologies as a tool to improve the way humans interact with one another."

        "content": "If you\u2019re someone who follows crypto trends, then chances are you might have heard about the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade of the Ethereum network quite often recently. The proposed upgrade will make the network complete proof-of-stake (PoS), and this update has quite a few implications for the crypto world. Ethereum\u2019s change to PoS will give it a leg up in its fight against Bitcoin. Prices of Ethereum are projected to rise following the transition. The crypto market is poised to enter into a long-term bull run, making it the best time to get into the crypto world, be it through established tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum or newer ones like SignUptoken.com ."
