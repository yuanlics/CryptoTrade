        "content": "The European Investment Bank (EIB) is once again leveraging Ethereum in its quest to tokenize capital markets, this time while issuing the first-ever digital pound sterling (GBP) bond on a seperate private blockchain.\n\nEIB, the primary lender of the European Union, deployed the \u00a350 million ($86.6 million) bond to a permissioned network underpinned by HSBC\u2019s tokenization platform, Orion. The EIB is a public institution owned by the EU\u2019s 27 member states.\n\nThe bank opted for a private network for privacy and efficiency, according to a statement. In an effort to increase transparency, the bond was also recorded on Ethereum, a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\nThis was done to provide evidence the issuance took place while still maintaining the anonymity of bondholders (Blockworks reached out for some transaction IDs but they weren\u2019t readily available. We\u2019ll update this piece should EIB provide them).\n\nHSBC debuted Orion last November, when it first flagged intent to launch the tokenized GBP bond. BNP Paribas, HSBC, and RBC Capital Markets were named as joint lead managers of the bond, with those firms serving as custodians. Client assets will be stored in digital securities accounts kept on Orion, the bank said.\n\nThe EIB\u2019s new vehicle is expected to bring a range of benefits to market participants, including reduced costs, improved efficiency and real-time data synchronization in an otherwise cumbersome process.\n\nDigital bonds have garnered interest from financial institutions in various countries, including Australia, Germany, France and Sweden since at least 2017.\n\nA Luxembourg legal framework that enables firms to issue dematerialized securities using distributed ledger technology was enacted into law in January 2021, paving the way for further exploration.\n\nDematerialized securities refer to digital representations of financial assets that exist only in electronic form, rather than as physical certificates or paper documents.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for further innovation in the financial sector,\u201d said EIB Vice-President Ricardo Mourinho Felix. \u201cThis new financial tool will provide additional capital flow that the EIB will invest in projects with global impact.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first digital bond issued by the EIB. That happened back in Apr. 2021, when the European Union\u2019s investment bank deployed a two-year, 100 million euro ($110 million) bond entirely on Ethereum.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "1 Reason Ethereum Could Lead the Next Bull Market - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For many years, Bitcoin has been touted as a premier store of value and has even drawn comparisons to gold due to its inherent scarcity and low inflation rate. But another cryptocurrency might be poised to beat Bitcoin at its own game: Ethereum (ETH 0.39%).\n\nIn August 2021, Ethereum developers implemented the London hard fork, an upgrade to the blockchain that added a few new perks to the way the Ethereum network functions. The most meaningful change to come out of this was a new feature that would make Ethereum deflationary.\n\nA crucial upgrade for price increases\n\nUntil the London hard fork, there was no limit to the amount of Ethereum that would enter circulation. And while that still technically is the case, the newly introduced deflationary mechanism will ensure that the rate at which new Ethereum enters circulation is reduced. And rather than only slowing the rate of newly minted coins, developers took it a step further and made it so that the total supply of Ether can actually be reduced.\n\nIt's a complicated process, but essentially, what has happened is that after the switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the fee that previously would have gone to miners is now burned. The size of the fee varies depending on network demand, referred to as gas. Theoretically, the dynamics of the London hard fork make it so that as demand picks up, more Ether is burned.\n\nAs demand increases and more Ether is burned, Ethereum's price will probably climb. At this stage, Ethereum users are more likely to hold and not spend, while investors will look to reap the rewards of price increases. This will lead to fewer transactions and, therefore, less Ether getting burned, thereby increasing supply and perhaps lowering its price.\n\nAs the price comes down, users will have less of an incentive to hold and more pressure to spend. But as more spending occurs, more Ether will be burned, and the cycle between supply and demand and inflation and deflation will unfold once again.\n\nEthereum in the post-Merge world\n\nWe have yet to experience a full iteration of this cycle, but we are in the beginning stages of one. Since the Merge, the number of Ether tokens in circulation has remained nearly stagnant, hovering around 120 million. Before the switch to proof of stake and introducing burning, Ethereum's inflation rate was at about 4.5%, but since the Merge, it has moved to -0.009%. For comparison, Bitcoin's current inflation rate is about 1.7%.\n\nIf Ethereum still utilized proof of work and hadn't introduced the burn mechanism, there would have been an additional 1.5 million tokens in circulation just since the Merge in September 2022. But since implementation, the total supply of Ether has actually dropped by about 4,000.\n\nAn opportunity awaits\n\nDue to the recency of the Merge, we probably still haven't seen the true effects of this phenomenon, but when that day comes, it could bring some serious returns for investors. Despite its price being down more than 60% from its all-time high, Ethereum still is one of the most widely used blockchains in the world. As activity on the network picks up -- which it seems to be doing as of late -- demand should follow and add further deflationary pressure.\n\nOver the coming years and even decades, Ethereum might become subject to the whims of limited supply and increased demand, a phenomenon similar to the one that made Bitcoin the most valuable cryptocurrency today and spurred people to view it as a supreme store of value.\n\nCould Ethereum take over Bitcoin's role? Perhaps. But whether it does isn't too important right now. Instead, investors should use this time as an opportunity to grab some Ethereum while its price is still struggling and enjoy the benefit of its new deflationary feature for the long haul."

        "content": "Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank, is moving forward with the plan to launch its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, preparing to trial the product in a few months.\n\nSberbank expects to launch open trials of its DeFi platform by May 2023, Sber\u2019s Blockchain Lab product director Konstantin Klimenko announced, the local news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 3.\n\nCurrently being tested in private beta, Sberbank\u2019s upcoming DeFi platform will be fully open by the end of April, enabling users to conduct the first commercial transactions, Klimenko said.\n\nThe executive noted that the blockchain platform will be compatible with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing customers to use major wallets, such as MetaMask, to move their assets. Klimenko also noted that users will be able to transfer their assets from other platforms.\n\nThe blockchain executive stated that Sberbank\u2019s DeFi platform aims to become a prime DeFi ecosystem in Russia. He also expressed confidence that DeFi systems are able to displace the traditional market of banking services.\n\nThe announcement comes in line with Sberbank\u2019s previously disclosed plans to enable DeFi applications on the bank\u2019s infrastructure. In November 2022, Sberbank announced a set of new features for its proprietary blockchain platform, including compatibility with smart contracts and applications on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt appears to be unclear how the upcoming platform is going to be regulated because Russia is yet to come up with digital currency regulation. According to Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the Duma\u2019s Committee on Financial Market, Russia will \u201cdefinitely\u201d adopt crypto regulations in 2023.\n\nRelated: Iran and Russia want to issue new stablecoin backed by gold\n\nAs previously reported, Sberbank was struggling to launch some blockchain tools over the past few years due to multiple delays of registration by the Russian central bank. Originally expecting to launch its digital asset issuance platform in 2021, Sberbank eventually received the Bank of Russia\u2019s approval in spring 2022. The Russian government is the majority shareholder in Sberbank, holding 50% + 1 share.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Alfa Bank, one of the largest private banks in Russia, became the fourth financial institution in the country allowed to issue digital assets alongside Sberbank, the state-backed tokenization platform Atomyze and fintech company Lighthouse."

        "content": "In January, ETH\u2019s supply decreased by 10,145.72 units.\n\nFebruary might be marked by a price decline.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound Money, in January, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] supply decreased by 10,145.72 units, resulting in a net deflationary value of approximately $16 million. As of this writing, the current total supply of ETH stood at 120,515,752, with an annual growth rate of -0.012%.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum: Deflation is the preferred option\n\nThe decrease in the supply of ETH has several implications for the cryptocurrency market. A decrease in supply leads to an increase in demand, as less of the asset is available for purchase. This can drive up the price of ETH, making it more valuable. Thus, the increase in demand could also attract more investors to the market, which could further boost the price of ETH.\n\nAlso, the net deflationary value of ETH could positively impact the currency\u2019s stability. Notably, deflationary currencies maintain their value over time, as the decrease in supply creates a scarcity of the asset. This reduces the risk of inflation and can make the currency more attractive to investors, as it is less likely to depreciate.\n\nOutlook is gloomy in the interim\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s net deflationary value might ensure price stability in the long term, an assessment of price movements on a daily chart revealed that an imminent price reversal was on the horizon.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $1,569.93. In January, the altcoin\u2019s value rose by 32%. However, as many investors rallied to take profits, buying pressure appears to have declined significantly.\n\nA look at ETH\u2019s moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) confirmed the commencement of a new bear cycle on 27 January. Since then, the indicator has returned only red histogram bars, and ETH\u2019s price has fallen by 2%.\n\nAt press time, key momentum indicators aimed for their respective neutral zones. ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have declined persistently in the last week and remained in downtrends at 56.33 and 59.40, respectively, at the time of writing. A drop in ETH accumulation marked the past week, and many took to selling their holdings.\n\nLikewise, the dynamic line (green) of the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) aimed to cross into the negative zone. Many investors shied away from buying more ETH.\n\nHow many ETHs can you buy for $1?\n\nThe lack of new demand for ETH was depicted by a consistent decline in its Open Interest in the past ten days, data from Coinglass revealed. Within that period, ETH\u2019s Open Interest fell by 16%.\n\nTypically, a decline in an asset\u2019s Open Interest means that traders are closing out their positions and there is a decline in new contracts being created. This suggests that they are becoming less confident in the future price movements of the asset and are reducing their exposure."

        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate analysts shows that Asia, the U.S., and the EU have been bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) since late January.\n\nAs the regional price metrics indicate, investors from all three regions feel more bullish on BTC than they do on ETH. In the meantime, year-over-year BTC supply for Asia means BTC will continue to increase in the short term.\n\nRegional prices\n\nThe regional price metric used in this research shows the 30-day change in the regional prices of Asia, the EU, and the U.S. The price movements during the working hours of a region must be recorded before calculating the regional price metric. Then, the price for a region can be determined by calculating the cumulative sum of the price changes recorded within the working hours of that region.\n\nThe chart below reflects the regional BTC prices for all three regions since the beginning of 2022. The red bars represent the regional price for the U.S., while the blue and green ones represent the EU and Asia, respectively.\n\nIf the metric falls below the zero line, this indicates that the region is bearish on BTC. If it places above the line, it represents the region\u2019s bullish sentiment.\n\nAccording to the chart, that all three regions turned on the bullish side in late January 2023 and have been bullish since then, with the U.S. being the most bullish. The last time all three regions were bullish was during a short time in August 2022, right after the Luna collapse.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe regional ETH prices for Asia, the U.S., and the EU also represent a similar bullish sentiment. The chart below illustrates the regional ETH prices for each region since the beginning of the year 2022. The U.S., the EU, and Asia are represented with red, blue, and green, respectively.\n\nSimilar to the regional BTC prices, all three regions currently appear bullish on ETH, with the U.S. being the most bullish one. However, none of the regions show the same level of enthusiasm as they do with BTC.\n\nYear-over-Year supply of Asia\n\nThis metric provides an estimate for the year-over-year (YoY) change in the market share between the BTC supply held and being traded. The chart below shows the YoY supply for the Asia region since the beginning of 2010.\n\nThe data shows that the region\u2019s YoY supply is currently over 8.5%. This percentage indicates that Asia is at the highest bullish point it has ever been.\n\nPrevious CryptoSlate research revealed that Asian investors built and maintained a smart money reputation by consistently buying at the bottom and selling at the top. Assuming Asiacontinuesg to act \u201csmart,\u201d their bullish sentiment indicates that BTC will continue to increase, at least in the short term.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The project quickly sold out regardless.\n\nAnndy Lian, author of the new book \u201cNFT: From Zero to Hero,\u201d told Forkast in an emailed statement that Polygon\u2019s growth isn\u2019t really about Trump.

        "content": "While the global cryptocurrency market continues with its ubiquitous movement, Ethereum seems to be sneaking out to break a new record. The latest achievement Ethereum obtained is setting a new high in its burning-per-day mechanism.\n\nPer a recent report from WuBlockchain citing data from oklink, Ethereum\u2019s burning amount exceeded 3,000 ETH at a figure of 3,040 ETH on February 2. This new record sets the crypto asset burning rate highest point ever seen since November 10, 2022. According to the reporter, the primary source where the burning was aggressive was two popular decentralized exchanges, Uniswap and OpenSea.\n\nOver the past months, both platforms have recorded significant usage and trading volumes which correlate with the increased burning of ETH tokens. Data from CoinGecko shows Uniswap trading volume has moved from $558 million seen at the beginning of this year to $1.1 billion as of February 3, up by more than 50% over the last 25 days.\n\nIs ETH Warming Up For Another Rally\n\nWith an upcoming catalyst like the Shanghai upgrade coming soon to the Ethereum network, ETH could be in a warm-up stage before another rally. Following the demand for ETH surging, the crypto asset greed index has also made some significant movements in the past weeks ranging above 60 in recent days.\n\nThe increase in the greed index signifies a massive level of FOMO and anticipation amongst ETH investors waiting for the right moment to buy and result in another rally. Data aside, so far, the Ethereum price chart has only indicated two possible scenarios, which are to either retrace a little bit more or proceed with another bullish trend.\n\nLooking at the 1-day time frame of the ETH/USDT price chart, we can see ETH recently tapped into external liquidity \u2014 a move that signifies a possible retracement to take out the liquidity of the buyers below. A retracement confirmation could mean ETH returns to the $1,300-$1,350 region.\n\nMeanwhile, should ETH invalidate the possible retracement and tap into the $1,684 zone declining a retrace, we could see another upward rally as the crypto asset appears to be consolidating at the moment, waiting for a significant movement (expansion) either to the upside or downside.\n\nEthereum Continues Recording New Highs\n\nNotably, the burning rate hasn\u2019t been the only new high Ethereum recurred in the past weeks. Last month, NewsBTC reported the total staked ETH on the Beacon chain reached an all-time high of over 16.16 million ETH. The figure cumulates to more than 13.28% of the total Ether supply and represents $26.13 billion at current prices\n\nOut of the 16 million ETH staked, about 11.408 million ETH have been staked via staking services providers such as Lido, Coinbase, and Kraken, among others \u2013 representing 70.86% of the total staked on the Beacon chain. Lido dominates ETH staking with 29.3%, Coinbase controls 12.8%, while Kraken holds 7.6%, and Binance controls 6.3% of the total stake, according to Glassnode on-chain data.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum total validators recently surpassed the 500,000 benchmarks and currently sit at 512,432 as of February 3, according to data from BeaconScan.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The price of the digital currency is pegged at $1,671.53, up by 5.69% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing. With the growth, Ethereum is now rebuilding its week-to-date (WTD) metrics, having accrued just about 4.13% within that time frame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the most important factor fueling the growth in the price of Ethereum remains broader crypto market sentiment, two other distinct factors can be pointed out.\n\nFirst is the intense activities of both retail and whale buyers, according to popular crypto market analytics platforms. While Glassnode showed that the total number of nonzero addresses topped 93,275,549, an indication of intense buying, WhaleStats confirmed the use of the Ethereum protocol by whales, as measured through the accumulation of altcoins like Gala (GALA) and Chainlink (LINK).\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides this, the network activities have lent positivity among all Ethereum investors. Besides the circulating supply of the digital currency dropping to its lowest point, the public testnet that will help simulate the staking Ether withdrawal process has also been launched, per an earlier U.Today report.\n\nEthereum's journey to $2,000\n\nFollowing the completion of the transition of Ethereum from the proof-of-work (PoW) model to the proof of stake (PoS) through The Merge, many expected a corresponding upshoot in the coin's price.\n\nWith the positive rally Ethereum has gained thus far this year, the projection that it will retest a new high of $2,000 has resurfaced. While this price growth, if it happens, will not come as a surprise seeing as Ethereum's all-time high (ATH) remains pegged at $4,891.70, the projected short-term $2,000 growth might be unrealistic.\n\nThis is because, with the advent of the Shanghai upgrade, a number of staked Ethereum may be withdrawn and liquidated, a trend that may tank the price of the coin."

        "title": "Nouns Comic Books Turn Ethereum NFTs Into \u2018Unconstrained Anarchy\u2019 - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNouns, the Ethereum NFT-based project building open-source IP, has already put its vibrant characters into a Super Bowl commercial, the annual Rose Parade, and elsewhere around the physical and digital worlds. Now they\u2019re headed to bookstores and comic shops.\n\nTitan Comics, which specializes in licensed comic books tied to IP like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d is bringing Nouns to physical comic books starting in April with a six-issue run of \u201cNouns: Nountown.\u201d It\u2019s written by Titan Senior Editor David Leach and illustrated by Danny Schlitz, with an eventual graphic novel to be published by Penguin Random House.\n\nAs with many other Nouns-related projects, the comics project was backed by the DAO\u2014or decentralized autonomous organization, a type of tokenized online group\u2014made up of Nouns NFT holders, who control a sizable treasury to fund IP development and other projects. Currently, Nouns DAO oversees about $46 million worth of ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSample artwork from the first issue of \"Nouns: Nountown.\" Image: Titan Comics\n\nIn this case, the comic project was proposed by industry veteran Adam Fortier through his Comics DAO organization, in collaboration with Nouns-centric collective SharkDAO, and received $210,000 worth of ETH through a unanimous vote in August. It\u2019s one of the latest efforts to propagate the Nouns IP through a mass-market channel.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people who read it might not even know that there were NFTs backing it, but at the end of the day, it was the NFTs that created the on-chain incentives to get this thing produced,\u201d pseudonymous Nouns co-founder 4156 told Decrypt. \u201cBut the end user doesn't ever have to know that.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a simple licensing play for Nouns DAO. First, Nouns itself falls under a Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license, meaning all of its assets are freely available for anyone to use and commercialize. Theoretically, anyone could make a Nouns comic book, but Titan Comics has established distribution channels with retailers.\n\nFurthermore, \u201cNouns: Nountown\u201d will be released in tandem with Ethereum NFTs that provide access to digital issues while also representing ownership in copies of the printed comics, including a chance to receive a couple of different types of limited-edition versions.\n\nThe project has two different NFT rarity levels: the mosaic NFT at 0.069 ETH (about $115) and generative NFT at 0.3 ETH (nearly $500), with the latter comic covers featuring a randomized mix of Nouns from the collection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn each case, Titan Comics will pull the first 420 comics from the press (and film the process for proof) and then hold them in a secure vault by 4K, a startup that specializes in NFTs backed by physical items. There will also be a limited supply of issues for each NFT presale in which each issue owner can ask the artist to draw whatever Nouns characters they request.\n\nA CC0 experiment\n\nNouns has a distinctive vibe in the NFT space, with the platform auctioning off one colorful pixel character each day. Each has a version of the brand\u2019s familiar Nouns glasses (or \u201cNoggles\u201d), but otherwise uses a mix of amusing traits\u2014including heads based on a wide array of inspirations, including a pineapple, skateboard, igloo, flamingo, and plenty more.\n\nGiven that mishmash of avatars, what is the Nouns comic book about, anyway?\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a deeply moving coming-of-age drama about a small-town thimble salesman caught up in a politically-charged espionage caper involving a stolen atom bomb, a signed picture of the Pope, and a man with a fox head,\u201d the official synopsis reads.\n\nCover artwork for the first issue of \"Nouns: Nountown.\" Image: Titan Comics\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s absurd and chaotic. Fortier told Decrypt that there are some adult elements in the mix, such as an evil character that\u2019s grinding up Nouns characters to create an alternative to Beyond Meat. He described it as \u201cunconstrained anarchy with good intent,\u201d and that the tone is \u201cso over-the-top\u201d and \u201cso \u2018Looney Tunes\u2019\u201d in nature.\n\n\u201cSomebody who read the first issue described it as \u2018exhausting,\u2019\u201d he joked, likening the challenge of spotlighting so many Nouns characters to the process of herding cats.\n\nDeveloping a comic book around already-minted NFTs in an open-source property also means that the creative team is building around characters that other people own the original NFT of, and may feel an attachment to. Their interpretation of such characters has already led to some \u201cangry emails\u201d from Nouns owners, Fortier admitted.\n\n\u201cWe kind of put the writer and artist in a room and said, \u2018Don't go on Twitter. Don't engage [with] people,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cOnce people start advocating for their character to appear in a certain way, or act in a certain way, it can harm the creative process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting experiment and test case for the CC0 model. And not only are the comics based on open-source characters, but the team will also release the art files to the community so that creators can develop whatever derivative works they please.\n\nIt\u2019s open-source all the way around, in other words, but also packaged in a way that can reach a broad audience. In Fortier\u2019s view, that provides an opportunity to entice people with a tale\u2014and then potentially clue them into the crypto elements that helped bring the adventure to life.\n\n\u201cWhen you say the term \u2018Web3\u2019 or \u2018crypto\u2019 to people, often their eyes glaze over. And you have a sense of fear or a sense of confusion,\u201d he said of the challenges of onboarding the masses. \u201cJust telling a fun story is like sneaking them in the back door.\u201d"

        "content": "A popular crypto strategist says Bitcoin (BTC) and two Ethereum (ETH) rivals, Solana (SOL) and Fantom (FTM), have more room to run.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 190,500 Twitter followers that Bitcoin is likely to surge at least 25% from its $24,007 value at time of writing.\n\n\u201cBTC: The longer that this hangs around this area, the more bullish I am. I think that it\u2019s quite likely that we see a gap fill up to $30,000 eventually.\u201d\n\nNext, Sherpa says Solana appears headed to the $30 range.\n\n\u201cSolana has done well and it should go to the mid-$30s if BTC holds up. I\u2019m not sure what the long-term future for this coin is, FTX/Alameda had a big bag of it iirc (if I recall correctly) and who knows how that\u2019ll get liquidated. The culture of this chain is still good though.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $24.89 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Fantom, he sets a price target of more than $0.60. Fantom is worth $0.58 at time of writing.\n\n\u201cFTM: Looks extremely\u2026 strong, I like this one. It will eventually hit $0.60ish IMO [in my opinion].\u201d\n\nSherpa also looks at four other altcoins.\n\nHe says Avalanche (AVAX) is likely going to retrace to $17, a more than 20% decline from its $21.48 value at time of writing.\n\n\u201cAVAX: Strong move but you probably still get some bids lower at like $17. High volume node around there and some S/R levels. Price currently pulling back due to S/R + 200-day EMA, which acts as resistance in these situations.\u201d\n\nNext, he says Cardano (ADA) is holding up against Bitcoin but he doesn\u2019t expect a strong rally in price, especially when compared to the upside potential of other altcoins. Cardano is trading at $0.40 at time of writing.\n\n\u201cADA: I don\u2019t really see any reason to buy this coin. The ADA/BTC pair looks pretty good to be honest and at support but I don\u2019t think this outperforms other altcoins relatively. Still, it has an insane community.\u201d\n\nHe says Polkadot (DOT) is underperforming relative to other altcoins and does not see a strong case for the token to move to the upside.\n\n\u201cDOT: I don\u2019t see any reason to buy this coin. It\u2019s unpumped relative to the rest of the market but it has performed horribly overall. Not a fan of the chart.\u201d\n\nLastly, he says STEPN (GMT) is likely forming a bottom and will rally to $0.79, a more than 38% increase from its $0.57 value at time of writing.\n\n\u201cGMT: Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this forms a low around here and continues higher to the $.79 area if BTC is stable. 200-d EMA acted as resistance but it\u2019s still ok for now IMO. I still use this app every week and invested in this one.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "If You Invested $1,000 in Ethereum in 2018, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The 2018 peak of Ethereum was followed by the initial coin offering (ICO) crackdown that caused a collapse across crypto. Ethereum itself avoided regulatory ramifications, but billions of dollars were lost in the meantime.\n\nOn the first day of 2018, Ethereum (ETH 0.39%) traded for $772.35 per token. Since then, its value fell below $100, skyrocketed to over $4,500, and then fallen below $1,000 before climbing to its recent levels above $1,500n. This shows how digital assets have been able to post solid long-term gains, but where will Ethereum go from here?\n\nWhy Ethereum is moving higher\n\nMomentum can't be undersold in the crypto market. A big reason Ethereum and other tokens have gained value in the last few years has been momentum trading during the pandemic, which correlated with higher values for growth stocks as well. It's no coincidence that these assets rose and fell together over the last few years.\n\nWhat's more sustainable long-term is Ethereum's smart contract capability, which has attracted a critical mass of developers and venture capital funding. Coinbase (COIN 0.78%), MetaMask, and OpenSea were just a few of the companies working to make Ethereum more usable. A16Z estimates that by 2022 there were 4,000 developers building on Ethereum, at least four times more than Bitcoin (BTC 0.71%) or Solana (SOL -0.96%).\n\nNot only are developers building on Ethereum, but the blockchain itself has also gone through some major changes.\n\nPoW to PoS and other upgrades\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum completed an upgrade that changed the consensus mechanism for the blockchain from proof-of-work (PoS) to proof-of-stake (PoS), which reduced energy consumption by about 99%. But there are more upgrades in store.\n\n\"The Surge\" is expected to improve the scalability of the blockchain and Layer-2 crypto projects built on top of Ethereum, \"The Verge\" introduces Verkle trees, \"The Purge\" will eliminate historical data and technical debt on the blockchain, and \"The Splurge\" will add miscellaneous upgrades.\n\nWhen completed (which could take many years), the blockchain should be even faster, cheaper, and more user and developer friendly. This could be the start of the next bull run for Ethereum.\n\nCompetition is coming\n\nThe bad news for Ethereum is that it's not the only game in town anymore. Solana has a similar number of users and is a much faster and cheaper blockchain. That's attracted many developers and non-fungible token (NFT) projects, in addition to decentralized finance platforms.\n\nThere are many other blockchains that have seen Ethereum's strengths and weaknesses and tried to improve on them. The cost challenge will continue to be Ethereum's pain point for the foreseeable future. It costs multiple dollars to make normal transactions on Ethereum, which makes the blockchain unusable for small financial transactions or even buying low-cost NFTs.\n\nThis will be the biggest challenge in Ethereum's future. Developers need to make the blockchain faster and cheaper, and we've seen it takes a long time to make upgrades on Ethereum.\n\nA profitable investment\n\nAs I'm writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,552.26, which means a $1,000 investment in the cryptocurrency at the start of 2018 would be worth $2,009.76 today. The ride has been wild, but this has been a profitable investment over the last five years. If upgrades happen quickly and blockchain adoption grows, the next five years could be profitable as well."

        "content": "Ether (ETH) has been struggling with the $1,680 resistance since Jan. 20. Still, the ascending triangle pattern and improvements in investor sentiment in ETH derivatives provides hope that Ether price could reach $1,800 or higher by the end of February. This, of course, depends on how the Ether price behaves as it reaches the pattern deadline by mid-February.\n\nEther/USD price index, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nFrom one side, traders are relieved that Ether is trading up 33% year-to-date, but the repeated failures to break the $1,680 resistance coupled with negative newsflow might give bears the power to cancel the bullish triangle pattern.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 30 report from Axios, New York State's Department of Financial Services is reportedly investigating cryptocurrency exchange Gemini over claims that the firm made regarding assets in its Earn lending program. The suspicions followed reports that multiple Gemini Earn users believed their assets had been protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nOn Jan. 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the Gemini exchange with offering unregistered securities through Earn. In addition, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has claimed that Genesis and DCG owe $900 million to Gemini's clients.\n\nSeveral United States senators have reportedly penned a letter requesting answers from Silvergate Bank, according to a Jan. 31 Bloomberg report. The policymakers were not fully satisfied with the bank\u2019s previous answers about its alleged role in handling FTX user funds. Silvergate reportedly cited restrictions on disclosing \"confidential supervisory information.\"\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi announced that the \"Zhejiang\" public testnet will be launched on Feb. 1. The implementation will allow staked Ether withdrawal on a test environment so that validators can anticipate the proposed changes for the Shanghai hard fork.\n\nLet's look at Ether derivatives data to understand if pro traders are frustrated by the recent price rejection at the $1,680 level.\n\nETH\u2019s futures premium has failed to enter the FOMO area\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe annualized two-month futures premium should trade between 4% and 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. When the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that traders using future contracts have failed to enter the neutral-to-bullish 4% threshold. Still, the current 3.5% premium denotes a moderate sentiment improvement compared to two weeks prior, but that does not mean traders expect an immediate positive price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions traders are comfortable with downside risk\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew has stabilized near 0% in the last two weeks, signaling that Ether options traders held a neutral sentiment. That is particularly intriguing since ETH gained 10% on Jan. 20 \u2014 indicating pro traders are pricing similar upside and downside risks.\n\nRelated: UK Treasury publishes crypto framework paper, Here\u2019s what\u2019s inside\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to whales and market makers not comfortable with adding leverage longs, but at the same time, not worried if the $1,570 ascending channel support breaks.\n\nTraders will watch to see if Ether bulls are able to keep the price within the bullish triangle formation for the next two weeks, but if the macroeconomic environment allows, ETH derivatives point to a potential rally toward $1,800.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Although short-term investors can consider this a success, would it be advantageous to hold the asset for the foreseeable future?\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH sees a three-day straight increase\n\nA glance at Ethereum on a daily timeline revealed that its surge began at the beginning of 2023. It was up about 1.7% as of this writing, and was trading at about $1,670. The asset would record a third straight gain in three trading periods thanks to the price increase.\n\nAdditionally, a review of the daily timeframe of the Relative Strength Indicator revealed that ETH was in a bull trend. The RSI line was at 65 and displayed a reasonably strong bull trend. However, how favorable is this trend for traders looking to go long?\n\nDeducing ETH\u2019s strength through Aroon\n\nThe daily chart of Ethereum\u2019s Aroon Indicator showed that bullish sentiment had deteriorated dramatically over the previous few weeks. However, as of the time of writing, the Aroon Up line had pumped to 100%, and the Aroon Down line was visible at 42.8%.\n\nThe rise of the Aroon Up line coincided with the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement.\n\nThe Aroon indicator can be used to determine whether an asset is trending or trading sideways. Additionally, it detects when a trend has begun and ended. The indicator\u2019s rise on the ETH chart suggests that the current uptrend is robust, which could be excellent news for long-term buyers.\n\nNetwork growth declines\n\nWhile the indicator mentioned above provided some good news for investors, this other metric suggested that they should proceed cautiously.\n\nAn examination of the network expansion statistic revealed a severe decline. Network growth dropped to roughly 25.9 from its previous steady state of 65. As a gauge of a cryptocurrency\u2019s health and growth prospects, this metric assesses how widely it is being utilized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAn increasing network growth indicator may suggest that a cryptocurrency is growing in popularity and adoption, while a decreasing indicator may indicate the opposite.\n\nGiven the convergence of these two important signals, this level may be a favorable chance for investors seeking to go long on Ethereum. They should exercise caution, though, because a dip in price is probable. However, a rally is imminent in the longer term."

Moreover, the token has surged by 3.88% in a week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nChainlink\n\nNext on the list of the best ERC20 tokens to buy today is Chainlink. This cryptocurrency is used to incentivize Chainlink node operators to securely transfer data to and from blockchains. LINK has stood up with a gain of 6.55% costing each token somewhat more than $7.30. Its current stand in the market is $3,705,475,596.\n\nShiba Inu\n\nThe list of the top ERC20 tokens is incomplete without Shiba Inu. From the shibarium launch to making a blast with SHIB-themed burgers, this meme coin has started 2023 with a blast. Shiba is currently trading around $0.00001205 with a one-day trading volume of $343,987,105. Recently, SHIB has seen significant growth, with a price increase of 4.21% over the past 7 days.\n\nThe SandBox\n\nAn Ethereum-based metaverse and gaming ecosystem, The Sandbox allows users to create, build, buy, and sell digital assets in the form of a game. Just like other ERC20 tokens mentioned in this article, SAND has surged by nearly 7.97% during the day. Currently trading at $0.7716 it has increased by 4.38% in the past seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 Sandbox Crypto Metaverse Projects To Watch For 2023\n\nNote: The information in this article is solely the author\u2019s opinion and not investment advice."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The article has been updated to reflect that EUROe is not the only or the first EU-regulated stablecoin offering in the region.\n\nFinnish company Membrane Finance has released a fully-reserved stablecoin backed by the euro, according to a Feb. 2 blog post from the company. The company is licensed by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fin-FSA), which targets to reduce the complexity of converting and paying in volatile cryptocurrencies.\n\nMembrane Finance is excited to announce the launch of EUROe on Ethereum!\n\n\n\nRead more at https://t.co/nV8dYKkBmK, and read the thread below to see how you can get started with $EUROe from today! \u2014 EUROe (@EUROemoney) February 2, 2023\n\nBy fusing EUROe with the Ethereum blockchain, Membrane Finance aims to enable near-instant payments globally for a fraction of the cost required in a traditional fiat setting.\n\nEach EUROe token is backed by \u201cat least one fiat euro [...] In a European financial institution or bank, ring-fenced from Membrane Finance,\u201d according to the company\u2019s post. The company believes it will allow for \u201cnear-instant payments\u201d at close to zero cost, in contrast to the high cost and slow speeds of traditional finance.\n\nMembrane Finance CEO Juha Viitala expressed hope that the regulated EUROe coin would encourage more Europeans to grow their wealth through the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, stating:\n\n\u201cStablecoins are an essential part of the transition towards blockchain-based money infrastructure, and Europeans deserve to have a full-reserve euro stablecoin from the EU and regulated by an EU-based financial authority. EUROe hopefully brings more regular people to DeFi, who were previously unable to or worried about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nSince 2021, the European market has witnessed numerous Euro-pegged stablecoin offerings being launched to over the complexities present in the fiat economy, including Circle's EUROC and Cardano's Stasis Euro (EURS).\n\nRelated: UK-native stablecoin integrates into 18,000 ATMs nationwide\n\nMembrane Finance plans to extend EUROe's support from Ethereum to other popular blockchains to improve its cross-compatibility.\n\n\u201cStablecoins,\u201d or crypto tokens backed by fiat currency, have had a long and illustrious history in the crypto world. The first U.S. dollar stablecoin, Tether (USDT), was initially released for the Bitcoin Omni Layer, with an Ethereum version arriving in 2018. It is now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn Jan. 19, Circle and the team behind the Uniswap decentralized exchange released a report claiming that blockchain-based foreign exchange can reduce remittance costs by as much as 80%."

        "content": "Top US crypto exchange Coinbase has added the altcoin Liquid Staked ETH (LsETH) to its listing roadmap.\n\nLiquid Staked ETH is a new \u201creceipt token\u201d investors receive when they stake their Ethereum (ETH) with the Liquid Collective, a liquid staking protocol.\n\nThe Liquid Collective notes its staking method differs from traditional staking, where users lock up their tokens.\n\n\u201cWhereas traditional methods of staking are subject to bonding and unbonding periods (ranging from days to weeks), liquid staking provides stakers with increased liquidity and capital efficiency. Token holders stake their token and receive a receipt token as evidence of their ownership of their staked token. The receipt token can be transferred, stored, traded, and utilized in DeFi [decentralized finance] or supported DApps [decentralized applications].\u201d\n\nLSETH is trading for $1,668 at time of writing. That\u2019s slightly above ETH, which is trading at $1,647.\n\nCoinbase created the listing roadmap last year to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of front-running their listing announcements.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it\u2019s probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it.

        "content": "Many cryptocurrencies are still recovering from a brutal crash, brought on by the bankruptcy of FTX. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is witnessing a price rally. Ethereum price has successfully managed to reach back up above $1,600 after struggling a lot.\n\nDespite its high transaction fees and slow transaction speed, Ethereum has remained one of the world\u2019s most dependable cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, ETH price was hovering around $1,644.38 with a 4.05% gain in the past seven days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price is Aiming for $1,800\n\nLeading up to January-February 2023, ETH has experienced a significant price surge. It could be the result of major announcements from big firms like The European Investment Bank and Visa.\n\nThe European Investment Bank: EIB to once again leverage Ethereum in its quest to tokenize capital markets. The Bank will issue the first-ever digital pound sterling (GBP) bond on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVisa: A trusted leader in digital payments also announced plans to transact in USD Coin over Ethereum.\n\nThe ascending triangle pattern of Ethereum provides hope that the ETH price could reach $1,800 by the end of February 2023.\n\nIs Ethereum A Good Investment for 2023?\n\nSimilar to any other cryptocurrency, one cannot guarantee how Ethereum will perform throughout 2023. Ethereum price could continue to soar throughout the year or dump below the lowest of the low. However, despite the massive drop in its price after the FTX bankruptcy announcement, ETH is obviously not planning on leaving its high position.\n\nEthereum can be a good investment option for those looking to diversify their portfolios or make long-term investments to reap maximum benefits in the future.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Based Tokens Showing Bullish Signs In February 2023\n\nDisclaimer: The information in this article is solely the author\u2019s opinion and not investment advice.

In particular, Layer-2 projects take multiple transactions off-chain, bundle them into one, and send them for verification to the Ethereum mainnet, thus reducing gas costs.\n\nOne such Layer-2 is an optimistic rollup Optimism (OP). The project\u2019s native token, OP, has been one of the best-performing tokens in the crypto markets since the start of the year.\n\nThe token is up around 230% in the last month and just reached its all-time high of $3.20, according to data from CoinGecko."

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe average number of 56 industry experts expect ETH to hit finish 2023 above $2,000 and hit $6,000 by 2025.\n\nFinder\u2019s panelists also opined that Ethereum could flippen Bitcoin as the largest crypto by market cap by 2024.\n\n56% of Finder\u2019s experts said now is the time to buy Ether and 60% believe ETH is underpriced at its current levels.\n\nA report from Finder on crypto\u2019s largest altcoin Ether (ETH) said that the token could skyrocket to $6,000 by 2025 as the markets recover following a murky year in 2022. Finder\u2019s analysis in January engaged 56 industry experts on what they believe the future holds for Ethereum and its native asset ETH.\n\nEther (ETH) Price Predictions\n\nThe panel average predicted key price levels for the largest altcoin by 2023, 2025, and 2030. Amid uncertainty within the broader financial industry, tightening monetary policies from the fed, and global inflation levels, most panelists expect ETH to close 2023 at around or just above $2,000. Currently, the token trades at around $1600 after crypto prices rallied in January.\n\nFinder\u2019s panelists turn more bullish down the line, predicting that ETH is set to reach $6,000 by 2025 and $14,000 by 2030. Founder of Seasonal Tokens Ruadhan O noted that transaction costs on Ethereum will rise as global economies recover, and this will incentivize users to buy more tokens. The increased buying pressure will propel ETH to higher prices as more validators and users flock to the network, Ruadhan said.\n\nBen Ritchie, Managing Director of Digital Capital Management AU, opined that Ethereum will power through harsh market conditions and \u201cdominate the market as the leading smart contract platform\u201d. Ritchie added that this should boost ETH\u2019s price as more businesses develop decentralized applications (dapps) on Ethereum and network activity increases.\n\nOrigin Protocol co-founder Josh Fraser hailed Ethereum as the base layer of innovation for most of DeFi and NFTs. DefiLlama data showed that Ethereum boasts over $29 billion in total value locked (TVL), the highest of any DeFi chain. Some of the most prominent NFT projects like Bored Apes, Azuki, and CryptoPunks also run atop Ethereum\u2019s chain. Fraser believes these factors will put ETH on track for $14,000 by 2025.\n\nCEO of Standard DAO Aaron Rafferty expressed bullish sentiment on ETH with a long-term point of view. Rafferty noted that ETH supply will drop, causing asset scarcity and hiked token prices.\n\nThe last 2 years have been extremely positive fundamentally for Ethereum from EIP 1559 to the Merge, [which] when combined, caused a deflationary effect to the protocol. As more companies like Mastercard and Visa use the protocol and more scaling solutions are integrated over the next few years, we should see on-chain supply reduce exponentially in the long term to the point that it will be nearly impossible to buy [ETH] from an open exchange in 2030.\n\nIndeed, not all the panelists reached a consensus on ETH\u2019s future prices and some experts predicted more pain in the market before users experience upward momentum. AskTraders\u2019 senior analyst for crypto and forex, Nick Ranga, foresees \u201cmore downside in the short term\u201d. Ranga argued that geopolitical tensions coupled with higher energy prices could stifle markets until 2024.\n\nJeremy Cheah echoed a similar bearish view on ETH due to a lack of regulated protection for crypto retail investors. Cheah who is an associate professor of DeFi at Nottingham Trent University predicted that ETH will end 2023 at $1000. Cheah added that the token might only reach $2000 by 2025.\n\nETH Underpriced? When flippening?\n\n60% of the experts agreed that ETH is currently underpriced at $1600. 56& of the panelists also chimed that now is the time to stockpile ETH. About 12% of the 56% specialists opined that ETH is overpriced and 16% recommend offloading Ether tokens now, expecting another downturn in crypto asset prices in the short term.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent bone of contention throughout Finder\u2019s report revolved around whether Ethereum can flippen Bitcoin to become the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum\u2019s market cap currently sits around $194 billion, while Bitcoin boasts a massive $445 billion despite heavy slumps in crypto prices since market highs in November 2021.\n\nETH Market Cap BTC Market Cap\n\n18% of industry experts predicted that the flippening could arrive by 2030. 30% of Finder\u2019s specialists think the flippening will never happen.\n\nDespite contrary opinions regarding Ethereum flippening Bitcoin, some experts believe ETH\u2019s chain holds more promise compared to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum looks to be more interesting than Bitcoin. The long-term charts highlight the ability to set ever-higher lows from June 2022. Also, Ether has returned above the 200-week average, something Bitcoin cannot yet boast of. \u2013 Alexander Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst for FxPro.\n\nWhile not all 56 panelists agreed on price ETH price levels in the short term and long term, the general sentiment among industry experts suggests bullish movement for Ethereum and its native asset as the dust settles and the broader crypto markets recover."

        "content": "Suppose you plan to invest in the crypto space this year. Then these three cryptocurrencies might catch your attention: PancakeSwap (CAKE), Ethereum (ETH), and Snowfall Protocol (SNW). There is a lot of potential in these projects. Snowfall Protocol just ended its presale, and it\u2019s already showing great prospects. Let\u2019s look at the potential and growth of these currencies and the direction they are heading in.\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) is rising again.\n\nThe current value of PancakeSwap (CAKE) is $4.25. It has mostly stayed the same in the past few weeks, except for a slight drop. When PancakeSwap (CAKE) first started, each coin was only worth $0.30, but it went up to a high of around $42.08. Even though the amount has gone down since then, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has had spikes and drops, which will likely happen again.\n\nMany analysts and experts have given different predictions for Pancakeswap (CAKE). Still, most agree that the price will increase significantly shortly and even more in the long term. Most predictions are that by the beginning of December 2023, the coin will be worth between $11 and $12. If this is accurate, many people agree it will keep going up, making it a good investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is increasing in value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized platform that executes smart contracts. These are applications that precisely run as programmed, without the chance of fraud or third-party interference. These apps run on a blockchain that was built just for them. This opens the door for developers to participate in a wide variety of activities, including creating marketplaces, storing records of contracts or debts, transferring funds, and many others.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a well-known cryptocurrency whose price is also about to increase significantly. Right now, Ethereum (ETH) has hit a 12-week ATH, with its price being $1585, give or take, but it could be worth a lot more before the year runs out.\n\nIf you want to invest in a cryptocurrency this year, Ethereum (ETH) is a good choice because it will give you a good return in the short to medium term.\n\nSnowfall Protocol is expected to yield 5000x at launch.\n\nThe Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is an ecosystem for cross-chain transfers developed for fungible and non-fungible tokens. Their decentralized application allows customers to trade assets across chains that are compatible with EVM and those that are incompatible with EVM. They are making a platform that will enable millions of users to interact with every blockchain.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) was trading at $0.015 per coin when phase 1 of the presale started. However, as of right now, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is priced at $0.20. As a result of its one-of-a-kind compatibility approach, demand for Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has surged by more than 30% since the presale stage. Some industry experts believe that Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has the potential to increase its size by a factor of 5000 by the time it is launched.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPancakeSwap (CAKE) and Ethereum (ETH) are great projects to invest in this year. However, if you want a high ROI, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has a huge prospect as market experts predict 5000x returns. Now is the best time to key in.\n\nFind out more about the Snowfall protocol:\n\nPresale: https://presale.snowfallprotocol.io\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/snowfallcoin\n\nWebsite:https://snowfallprotocol.io\n\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/snowfallcoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The rise of Web3 functionality has been a boon for decentralized domain name services over the past two years, with millions of blockchain-based domains registered to date. Challenging market conditions may have hampered exponential growth, but industry leaders believe that utility-driven adoption will continue in the future.\n\nWeb3 is fundamentally changing how businesses, brands and retailers serve customers, who are taking full control of their data, wallets and online identity courtesy of blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized domain names are valuable tools for users and businesses to integrate with Web3 functionality. From providing human-readable names that replace numerical wallet addresses to serving as a decentralized profile across the Web3 ecosystem, decentralized domains offer an alternative to conventional domain services.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) and Unstoppable Domains are the two most prominent platforms serving the space, having a combined six million-plus domain registrations since their respective inceptions. Both services saw significant increases in newly minted domains through 2021 and 2022.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to a handful of decentralized domain name platforms to gauge the current state of the industry, who is leading registrations and what the future holds.\n\n2022 in review\n\n2022 proved to be a massive year for both ENS and Unstoppable Domains, with both firms highlighting some key metrics from the year in correspondence with Cointelegraph.\n\nENS is a distributed, open, extensible naming system that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It maps human-readable names like \u201calice.eth\u201d to machine-readable data like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs.\n\nENS emulates the conventional Domain Name Service (DNS) by using dot-separated hierarchical names, commonly known as domains, with the owner of a domain controlling both it and any subdomains. An ENS domain is effectively a nonfungible token (NFT) that serves as an Ethereum wallet address, cryptographic hash or website URL.\n\nENS developer Makoto Inoue said that the platform\u2019s official registered domain total was 2.8 million as of January 2023, excluding any reregistered names after expiry. When including subdomains and DNS names, that number rises to 3.9 million \u2014 excluding off-chain names like Coinbase\u2019s in-house cb.id domain solution for wallets and decentralized identities.\n\nNora Chan, vice president of communications at Unstoppable Domains, unpacked the premise of the blockchain-based domain name service. Unstoppable Domains offers Web3 domains on Polygon with no gas fees, providing an affordable way for users to establish a secure and portable identity for Web3.\n\nThe domains can be bridged to Ethereum and used for various purposes, such as sending and receiving cryptocurrency, logging in to hundreds of apps and metaverses, building decentralized websites and constructing a Web3 identity.\n\nThe platform has registered and minted 3.1 million domains to date, with 1.2 million registered in 2022 alone.\n\nMeasuring growth in a bear market\n\nBoth Inoue and Chan reflected on the bearish market conditions of 2022 and offered varying views of its effect on decentralized domain registrations. Depressed market conditions were actually a boon to ENS registrations, as Inoue explained:\n\n\u201cDuring the bull market, high gas fees actually hindered the growth of ENS because a .eth registration was costing somewhere between $50\u2013$100 when a one-year annual registration is only $5/year.\u201c\n\nBut as gas fees have slowly reduced, it is becoming more affordable to register ENS names. Inoue also noted that the discovery of \u201ccategories influenced the growth of 2022 ENS registrations.\u201d\n\nThis included the minting of ENS domains based on a list of names with common traits like the \u201c10K Club,\u201d which are four-digit domain names from 0000.eth to 9999.eth; and genesis-era ENS domains, which are a select group of ENS names minted before June 2017 \u2014 preceding the advent of the popular CryptoPunks NFT collection.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan conceded that the rate of registrations with Unstoppable Domains slowed in 2022. Nevertheless, the 1.2 million domains registered in 2022 still account for more than a third of its total domain list.\n\nThird-party integration\n\nCompanies, brands and users are becoming increasingly familiar with Web3 functionality. Using a decentralized domain, users can carry their complete digital ID with them, pay for items on an e-commerce site, and collect NFT versions or extras linked to specific real-world products.\n\nAs more of these services plug into Web3, ENS and Unstoppable Domains provide the infrastructure for businesses and users to enter this new paradigm.\n\nFor ENS, the rise of Coinbase\u2019s high-profile cb.id subdomain integration was the biggest third-party service integration story, according to Inoue.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a universal standard for developers to create services and applications that can transact and send information actions across multiple networks. The ENS developer said CCIP Read provides a way to store ENS names outside the Ethereum layer 1, lowering overall gas costs.\n\nChan highlighted that despite the recent cryptocurrency bear market, Unstoppable Domains\u2019 extensive footprint of integrations includes partners like Brave, Opera, Trust Wallet and Etherscan. The firm has also launched various Web3 top-level domains \u2014 including .x, .nft, .wallet and .crypto \u2014 with mainstream brands and companies.\n\nUnstoppable Domains\u2019 work with Blockchain.com saw the creation of its .blockchain top-level Web3 domain, unlocking a potential 83 million users of Blockchain.com who might be looking for a customizable .blockchain domain or human-readable wallet address.\n\nWhat does 2023 have in store?\n\nSubdomain registrations could surge in 2023 if Inoue\u2019s prediction is correct. The ENS developer told Cointelegraph that ongoing development could give users more control of subdomains:\n\n\u201c2023 will see a surge of subdomain registrations. This will be driven by the release of \u2018Name Wrapper,\u2019 a feature to turn subdomains into NFTs (currently only .eth is NFTs), allowing the community to sell and transfer subdomains much more easily.\u201d\n\nInoue also highlighted subdomain integrations with the likes of Coinbase as an adoption driver, making ENS names more accessible to users. It also lowers gas costs to interact with the Ethereum protocol, \u201cmaking it resistant to the bull market gas surge.\u201d\n\nWhile the registration of these subdomains doesn\u2019t bring direct revenue to the ENS organization itself, Inoue said they drive the overall adoption and usefulness of the protocol within the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nChan said focusing on creating more utility, building partnerships and improving the user experience of the service would be key to continued adoption this year.\n\nAn alternative view\n\nCointelegraph also spoke to PeerName founder and CEO Vasil Toshkov, whose platform was founded in 2014, selling .bit domains based on Namecoin. The platform now sells a handful of Emercoin blockchain domains \u2014 including .coin, .bazar, .lib and .emc \u2014 and currently manages around 8,000 domains.\n\nToshkov said that PeerName sells \u201ctruly decentralized domains\u201d for working websites and does not offer NFT domains nor centrally managed services. It previously sold a more comprehensive array of domains from different platforms but now focuses on decentralized practical applications.\n\nPeerName sold around 700 domains in 2022, with Toshkov highlighting increased competition and high fees at the end of the bull market as key challenges:\n\n\u201cOur business performs much better during a bear market. Then, the competition with fake domains disappears. Fees are low, and users can pay seamlessly. We also only have users who buy domains to use, not as speculation.\u201d\n\nThe most sold domains on PeerName include .bit, .coin and .onion. The latter domain is not blockchain-based but is used within the Tor browser and client system. Toshkov believes that the possibility of .bit domains also being integrated into the Tor project and browser could drive adoption.\n\n\u201cIf this happens, the interest in them will be huge. These are the first and most decentralized blockchain-based domains. Kind of like Bitcoin, but for domains,\u201d he said.\n\nCointelegraph has previously explored the prevalence of domain \u201chijacking\u201d and \u201csquatting,\u201d which is driven by speculative users that register domains bearing well-known brands or names."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMetaMask has added new privacy features to its browser extension Thursday, allowing users to enable phishing detection and enable advanced settings like choosing their own remote procedure call (RPC) network and adding a custom IPFS gateway.\n\nMetaMask is a popular Ethereum crypto wallet with over 21 million monthly active users. Back in November, the wallet came under fire after parent company ConsenSys notified MetaMask users that it would begin collecting users\u2019 IP addresses and ETH wallet addresses via its infrastructure provider Infura (the default RPC network) whenever users make a transaction.\n\nNow, users will be able to choose a different RPC provider instead of Infura, a feature that ConsenSys said it was developing back in December.\n\nThe new features can be found under the MetaMask browser extension\u2019s Security and Privacy Settings and can be tweaked during initial crypto wallet setup or modified after the fact for existing wallets.\n\n\u201cWe have updated the MetaMask extension to maximize the control you have over your data,\u201d MetaMask said on Twitter Thursday.\n\nStarting today, extension users will see an updated experience when creating a new wallet, as well as an update in their privacy and security settings. We have updated the \ud83e\udd8a extension to maximize the control you have over your data. \u2014 MetaMask \ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc99 (@MetaMask) February 2, 2023\n\nIn its new settings interface, MetaMask warns that \u201cany RPC will receive your IP address and Ethereum wallet to make transactions.\u201d This means that true privacy is virtually impossible via MetaMask, as users will have to choose which RPC will handle their data, even if it\u2019s not Infura.\n\nWhile users might have more options now, it could be argued that MetaMask is providing users with an illusion of choice. Less tech-savvy users may not know how to optimize their privacy settings, let alone know what an RPC network is or how to choose an alternative.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMina Protocol Cofounder Evan Shapiro is a Web3 privacy advocate who believes in the privacy benefits of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK proof) technology. When asked for his thoughts on MetaMask\u2019s update, Shapiro told Decrypt via email that he isn\u2019t sure it amounts to much increased privacy at all.\n\n\u201cAs far as I understand, they\u2019re still collecting IP addresses. And, they have the ability to change these features at any time as they see fit,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cYou\u2019re still dependent on a centralized RPC. These issues won\u2019t go away until there are easy to run full nodes available to run on browsers and phones.\u201d\n\nDavid Schwed, COO of blockchain security firm Halborn, called MetaMask\u2019s new settings \u201cpositive.\u201d That said, he still sees MetaMask\u2019s ongoing data collection as risky for users.\n\n\u201cThe capturing of IP addresses and their associated transactions are both security threats as well as privacy concerns,\u201d Schwed told Decrypt via email. \u201cA threat actor with access to this information would be able to potentially launch a spear phishing campaign against targeted users based on IP address and wallet balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe change does not allow you to opt out of them collecting IP addresses, they are simply allowing/advising you to utilize another RPC provider to broadcast transactions,\u201d he added.\n\nUsers concerned about their privacy should note that the Ethereum network itself has never been fully anonymized. Etherscan offers detailed information on wallet transactions, and since the U.S. government sanctioned the Ethereum privacy mixing tool Tornado Cash, there aren\u2019t many options to increase user privacy or conceal transaction data.\n\nIn December, ConsenSys published a lengthy explanation of its privacy policies and how and when it collects user data. It claimed that it never sells user data and shared plans to automatically delete user data within seven days\u2014though it\u2019s unclear when exactly that practice will be adopted.\n\nRepresentatives for ConsenSys, Infura, and MetaMask were unable to provide comments to Decrypt before publication. ConsenSys is one of 22 strategic investors in Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor nearly a decade, creators have enlisted sidechain or layer-2 solutions to link digital art to the Bitcoin blockchain. But how this is accomplished\u2014or whether it should even be done\u2014has Crypto Twitter up in arms after new project Ordinals developed a way to add digital items to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNFT are blockchain tokens that can serve as a proof of ownership for assets, including digital goods like artwork, videos, music files, and memberships. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs and digital collectibles, many Bitcoin developers have sought ways to bring them to the quintessential blockchain.\n\nOne issue hampering the development of NFTs on Bitcoin is the need for smart contracts. In the minting process, NFTs use smart contracts to assign ownership of the digital asset in the NFT. The smart contract updates the ownership when the NFT is bought or sold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin has only limited smart contract support.\n\nTo address this, earlier projects like Counterparty and Stacks developed alternative solutions that use a native token for the contract piece but ultimately settle their transactions back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEarlier examples\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty launched the first layer-2 solution for digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty, which provides the infrastructure for users to create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, saw its XCP token hit an all-time high above $91 in 2018, but it has fallen about 97% since.\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters\u2014and its assets can be bridged to Ethereum. More importantly, Counterparty is best known as the home for historical assets like Rare Pepes, which still command significant sums on secondary markets. In April 2022, an NFT containing the opening theme to Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was minted using Counterparty.\n\nLaunched in 2017 as Blockstacks, Stacks (as it\u2019s now known) is a blockchain network that can run smart contracts and rolls up all of its transactions before settling them on Bitcoin. Stacks says it doesn\u2019t use a sidechain or layer-2 model, but founder Muneeb Ali told Decrypt in 2021 that he refers to it as \u201ca layer 1.5\u201d built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe STX token hit a peak above $3 in December 2021, according to CoinGecko, as its NFTs started to attract the Bitcoin faithful, and in February 2022, an NFT collection called Satoshibles launched a cross-bridge to send NFTs to the Ethereum network. Broadly, however, Stacks has not developed an especially active or valuable NFT market.\n\nWhat's Ordinals?\n\nThe most recent example of Bitcoin NFTs is Ordinals, and it takes a different approach. Launched in January, Ordinals aims to add NFT-like assets directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDesigned by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core contributor, Ordinals enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC), which may include data such as videos and images. Adding assets to individual satoshis is called inscription, which is stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature.\n\nThe idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos\u2014or even playable video games\u2014isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols. Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2014 Bitcoin is Saving (@BitcoinIsSaving) January 29, 2023\n\nDespite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution (or similar) or an additional cryptocurrency to work.\n\nBitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, but as Ordinals and past examples show, some developers are still trying to use its decentralized network to power new use cases."

        "content": "It appears the NFT market is slowly getting back on its feet. Trading volumes rose for two months straight, with January scoring the highest volumes since June last year, according to the Dapp Industry Report: January 2023.\n\nThe growth in January marked a stark difference from the trend of the past few months \u2014 October saw trading volumes dip to a low of $662 million \u2014 but in November, the market halted the downward trend to stay at $662 million, per the report.\n\nVolumes then recovered in December, rising slightly to $683 million, and increasing 38.5% from that number to $946 million in January.\n\nA number of blockchains allow traders to buy and sell NFTs, but Ethereum has held the leading position with over $36 billion in all-time sales, data from NFT aggregator CryptoSlam showed. In comparison, Ronin and Solana \u2014 the second and third largest blockchains by NFT sales volume in total \u2014 had about $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.\n\nJanuary was strong for both Ethereum and Solana, which saw trading volumes of $659 million and $85 million, respectively.\n\nFebruary is showing signs of continued strength as well \u2014 at least so far. As of February 3, the Ethereum blockchain had $26.5 million sales across more than 25,500 unique buyers, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nWhile Ethereum accounts for the lion\u2019s share of trading volumes, with more than 78% of all trades on the blockchain, Polygon had the biggest influx of traders in January, the report showed.\n\nPolygon\u2019s trading volume grew 124% to $46 million in January from $20 million in December. In the past week, NFT sales volume on the blockchain grew 43.5% to reach $2.8 million, indicating continued interest in the blockchain.\n\nIn late December, two large Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, said they would leave the blockchain in 2023, which stirred up conflicting sentiments across the community. DeGods said it would migrate to Ethereum, and y00ts plans to move to Polygon.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the year, we noticed that much of the creator economy\u2019s attention was focused on ETH and Solana,\u201d Ryan Wyatt, CEO of Polygon Studios, previously told TechCrunch. \u201cTherefore, we decided to go against the trend and focus on the untapped potential of web3 by onboarding large enterprise brands, DeFi platforms and gaming companies. We did this successfully through ecosystem fund investments and white-glove partnership support.\u201d\n\nAs big NFT collections like DeGods and y00ts diversify their alliances to blockchains, it could also draw in other holders who are seeking new opportunities or see value elsewhere.\n\nThe consecutive growth of the past couple months could also point to a broader upward trend across the crypto market. It could also potentially help drive creators and projects to form new use cases in the NFT world as they look to capitalize on the bullish marketplace."

        "content": "Ethereum is blazing a new trail in the world of cryptocurrencies, reaching a high of 3040 on February 2nd. It marks the highest point since November 10th, 2022, and solidifies its place as one of the top players in the game.\n\nThe primary sources fueling this fiery surge are two popular decentralized exchanges, Uniswap and OpenSea. Both platforms have seen a significant increase in usage and transactions, leading to a corresponding rise in the value of Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, as the demand for Ethereum continues to grow, so too does the cryptocurrency greed index, which has hovered around 60 for several days. It indicates a high level of excitement and anticipation in the market as investors scramble to get a piece of the action.\n\nHowever, the burning of ETH is a key metric in the world of cryptocurrency and is being closely watched by those in the know. This latest record high burn is just another example of how Ethereum is making waves in the market and solidifying its place as a leading cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Developers Set Sights On Upgraded Mainnet Launch In Mid-March\n\nThe Ethereum community was excited as developers gathered for a conference call on February 2nd to discuss the latest developments in the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to Christine Kim\u2019s blog, the conference call pointed out that assuming all public testnets of the Shanghai upgrade go smoothly, developers are expected to activate the upgraded mainnet in mid-March.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a highly anticipated event in the Ethereum community. It will bring several important changes to the network, including increased efficiency, reduced gas fees, and a new consensus algorithm.\n\nThe upgrade is expected to make Ethereum more secure, scalable, and user-friendly, which will be a big boost for developers and users alike.\n\nThe conference call also discussed the progress of the Shanghai upgrade on various testnets. The Zhejiang testnet will activate the Shanghai upgrade on February 7th, followed by releases on the Sepolia testnet (mid-February) and Goerli testnet (late February and early March).\n\nHowever, the smooth activation of the upgrade on these testnets will be crucial to ensuring a successful mainnet launch.\n\nRelated Reading | India\u2019s Retail Behemoth Set To Add CBDC Support"

        "title": "Shanghai fork Coming at Ethereum: Do Stakers need to dump ETH? - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The second-best blockchain, Ethereum, is coming up with the next best thing; EIP-4895, Shanghai, supposedly in March 2023. The activity would be known as the Shanghai hard fork, implementing future advancement proposals for the Ethereum network and allowing Ether, currently trading at $1,668.46, stakers and validators to withdraw their assets from Beacon Chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, the staked ETH amounts to nearly 14% of the total supply of 16 million coins. Meaning nearly $25 billion; with the current TH price, it is expected to be liquidated following the fork.\n\nShould Stakers be concerned?\n\nMost ETH stakers have been waiting for the last three years for rewards withdrawals. This announcement may cause the stakers to line up for the withdrawals selling their ETH as early as possible, but this might not happen as there are numerous reasons for eliminating any concerns, moreover pulling them to increase their investments into staking after Shanghai.\n\nEthereum to be the leading PoS network\n\nThough the market cap had pushed ETH to second place, it proudly holds the leading position as a Proof-od-Stake (PoS) network. At the time of writing, it stood for 65% of TVL in DeFi protocol, approximately around $48.7 billion.\n\nSource: DefiLlama\n\nEven with the current market conditions, the amount of ETH deposited has increased considerably, reaching nearly 500,000 validators in January 2023.\n\nA Stronger Staking yield\n\nCurrently, the yield is stable at a 5.45% annual percentage rate (APR). Hence newbies are expected to habituate themselves to the overall yield compensation structure, which comprises staking rewards, tips and maximal extractable value (MEV). With MEV-boost, stakers can increase the rewards by 2x to 3.5x over vanilla blocks.\n\nAttractive Liquidity\n\nWith the uncertainty of withdrawal eliminated, the initial staking percentage of 14% is expected to multiply. Most of these staked coins were of the bull run, and chances of shorting in the bear market are highly unlikely.\n\nEIP-4895: The Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEIP-4895 will focus on allowing withdrawals on the execution layer, Shanghai, and the consensus layer, also known as the Capella upgrade. The roadmap shows many milestones after Shanghai, commonly referred to as \u201cSurge\u201d, \u201cVerge,\u201d \u201cPurge\u201d, and \u201cSplurge\u201d. The immediate future shows that EIP-4844 (proto-dank sharding) could scale Ethereum by reducing gas fees, and EIP-3540 aims to reduce Ethereum Virtual MAchine\u2019s resource requirement.\n\n2022 saw a 178% increase in developer activities in Ethereum, causing 1.5 million downloads. Even with a slower market, smart contracts deployment hit 4.6 million deployments in Q4 2022.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nSwitching consensus mechanisms may have boosted the growth to some extent, but further developments are required to steal the top position."

        "content": "Staking in cryptocurrency is gaining popularity over its ability to offer investors benefits such as passive income. Therefore, several crypto projects are dominating this area based on the value staked in their respective networks.\n\nAs of February 2, 2023, Ethereum (ETH) ranked top among leading smart contract crypto projects by staking market cap with a valuation of $29.1 billion, followed by Cardano (ADA) at $10.4 billion, while Binance Coin (BNB) occupies the third spot at $7.5 billion, according to Cardano Daily data.\n\nElsewhere, Avalanche\u2019s (AVAX) market cap ranks fourth at $5.6 billion, while Polygon (MATIC), with a valuation of $4.3 billion, occupies the fifth spot. Interestingly, Polkadot (DOT) accounts for the highest reward rate at 14.47%, with a market cap of $3.8 billion to rank sixth overall.\n\nOther smart contract crypto projects making the top ten list based on market capitalization include Tron (TRX), NEAR protocol (NEAR), Algorand (ALGO), and Fantom (FTM).\n\nTop ten smart contract platforms by staking market cap. Source: Cradano Daily\n\nEthereum and Cardano\u2019s staking dominance\n\nIt is worth noting that both Cardano and Ethereum have undergone extensive network development activity that has contributed to their high ranking. For instance, after the Merge upgrade, Ethereum investors got an opportunity to start staking their ETH.\n\nIn this line, the Ethereum community is looking forward to withdrawing their staked ETH once the Shanghai hard fork goes live. In the meantime, ETH stakers are currently simulating the withdrawal process after the Zhejiang testnet was rolled out.\n\nIndeed, the staking feature is considered monumental for the Ethereum ecosystem that has been touted to help the second-ranked crypto by market capitalization.\n\nCradano\u2019s ecosystem growth\n\nElsewhere, Cardano\u2019s staked amount currently contributes to over 70% of ADA\u2019s supply. Notably, the staking feature on Cardano has recorded significant growth in recent months. For instance, a Finbold report in October 2022 noted that the platform added about 20,000 new staking addresses on average for more than a year.\n\nOverall, the network has been a hub of development activity that continues to be received well by the crypto community. In this line, features such as smart contracts have surpassed the milestone of over 5,000 as the blockchain moves to realize its potential to become an \u2018Ethereum killer.\u2019\n\nLastly, the platform also ranks second among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by GitHub development activity as of February 2023."
