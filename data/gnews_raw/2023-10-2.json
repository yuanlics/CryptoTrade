        "content": "Key Takeaways The first of many ether futures ETFs started trading Monday, and more such products are expected to launch soon.\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nSome ether futures ETFs may also contain exposure to bitcoin futures.\n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. began trading in Oct. 2021, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nEther futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a decline in value and limited volume activity on debut Monday. The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) was down 6.6% at 3:30 p.m. Eastern, while Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) were trading 4% and 3.7% lower respectively.\n\n\n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S.\u2014ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\u2014began trading in October 2021.\n\n\n\nHow Ethereum Futures ETFs Work And Why Should You Care?\n\nEther, the native crypto asset of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind bitcoin. Ether futures ETFs, invest in futures contracts with ether being the underlying security, rather than investing directly into ether itself.\n\nFor investors, these products offer a way to gain cryptocurrency exposure without directly having to buy ether. However, cryptocurrencies are volatile, making investing in future ETFs risky.\n\nBut the ETF providers are trying to sweeten the deal. For example, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) is structured as a C-Corp in an effort to offer \"a more efficient tax experience for long-term investors,\" the company said.\n\nNot Just Pure Play In Ether\n\nSome providers are not limiting their offerings to just ether futures. Bitwise & ProShares have announced ETFs that would include both bitcoin and ether exposure.\n\nThe Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF will only contain ether futures contracts, while the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) will contain a 50-50 split of ether and bitcoin futures contracts. The custodian for both of these funds is Bank of New York Mellon. This brings Bitwise's total number of crypto-related ETFs to five.\n\nThe ProShares Ether Strategy ETF will strictly contain exposure to ether futures contracts. However, the firm is also offering two products that combine exposure to the prices of bitcoin and ether.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE) is intended to contain equal exposure to both bitcoin and ether, while the ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF splits price exposure between the two assets based on their current market capitalizations. All three of these ETFs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nValkyrie was expected to change the strategy of their bitcoin futures ETF to also contain ether last week; however, this update has been delayed due to a regulatory issue with the SEC. This product will be known as the Valkyrie Bitcoin & Ether Strategy ETF once it has launched. Ether futures ETFs from Kelly ETFs and Volatility Shares are also expected to launch soon.\n\nVanEck and others have filed to launch spot ether ETFs as well, but these applications are still awaiting Securities and Exchange Commission approval. Additionally, the SEC is considering the approval of a plethora of bitcoin spot ETF applications, most notably from BlackRock.\n\n"

        "content": "The deluge of new cryptocurrency ETFs continues. Bitwise Asset Management announced today the launch of two Ethereum-themed ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange. With the launch, investors can gain exposure to futures in this category through the ETF wrapper for the first time.\n\nThe Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: AETH) invests in regulated CME ether futures focused on front-month contracts. The Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: BTOP) provides equal exposure to regulated CME bitcoin futures and CME ether futures. Both funds have an expense ratio of 0.85%.\n\nSee more: \u201c ProShares Launches 3 Cryptocurrency ETFs, Including 1st to Target Ether \u201d\n\n\u201cEthereum now has billions in revenue, millions of users, and thousands of distinct apps and developers,\u201d said Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley. \u201cAs the leading operating system for crypto, Ethereum has spread like wildfire. With blue-chip brands like Nike, Starbucks, Adidas, Pepsi, PayPal, JPMorgan, and others building and using applications on Ethereum, the momentum is only building. AETH and BTOP give investors the opportunity to participate in that growth with confidence through regulated ETFs.\u201d\n\nEthereum: A Broader Opportunity Than Bitcoin\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hougan argued in the news release that the \u201cportfolio opportunity with Ethereum is broader than bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHougan continued: \u201cSome investors consider Ethereum an alternative, while others see it as a traditional growth investment. It has elements of both. Like alternatives, Ethereum\u2019s correlation to traditional equities over the last two years has been low, and trending lower. At the same time, its increased usage and cash flows suggest it has the characteristics of a growth asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find that, to some investors, Ethereum makes more intuitive sense than bitcoin,\u201d he added. \u201cEvery time people use an Ethereum-based app, they pay a fee in Ethereum, which ultimately accrues value to investors in a manner similar to stock buybacks. With cash flows and real-world applications, Ethereum is often easier to grasp and value for experienced investors.\u201d\n\nThe launch of AETH and BTOP adds to Bitwise\u2019s broad suite of professionally managed vehicles. As of their launch, Bitwise\u2019s lineup of more than 20 products includes five crypto ETFs.\n\nMoving Day for Crypto ETFs\n\nThese Bitwise funds are part of several crypto-linked ETFs that begin trading today. The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) begins trading on the Cboe Exchange. ProShares also today launched three crypto ETFs on the NYSE, including the first ETF to target the performance of ether.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been clearing their desks ahead of the possible government shutdown,\u201d said VettaFi\u2019s associate director of research Roxanna Islam. \u201cThis means issuing delays for spot bitcoin ETF filings while likely allowing ether future ETFs to potentially begin trading early next week.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nETH price increased by 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhales accumulated and staked as on-chain data suggests.\n\nA breakout was made but it encountered new resistance.\n\nLookonchain, a prominent on-chain analytics platform, has detected substantial crypto whales amassing and staking significant quantities of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nTwo significant withdrawals, totaling $7.2 million and $16 million in ETH, were executed from Binance, and the entire amount was subsequently transferred to staking accounts.\n\nThis whale activity coincides with a noticeable 4.7% surge in ETH\u2019s price over the past day, breaching key resistance levels. Furthermore, Ethereum\u2019s promising momentum is contributing to a broader cryptocurrency market resurgence, including Bitcoin.\n\nETH On-chan Data\n\nAccording to recent data from Lookonchain, there has been notable activity among crypto whales, specifically in their accumulation and staking of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nNotably, two substantial withdrawals from the Binance exchange have attracted attention. One whale withdrew ETH worth $7.2 million, while another made an even more impressive withdrawal of $16 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s intriguing is that both whales subsequently moved these substantial sums entirely into staking accounts.\n\nThat this isn\u2019t an isolated case and that more investors are staking ETH is shown on the on-chain Total Value Staked chart from Cryptoquant.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the Total Value Staked (TVS) has increased from 29,527,744 to 29,551,488 ETH, equivalent to $40,839,680 at the current price of $1,720 per ETH. This upward movement is part of an ongoing and consistent uptrend that gained momentum starting in mid-April.\n\nWhen we examine the staking rate, calculated by dividing the balance of the ETH 2.0 deposit contract by the total ETH supply, it becomes evident that mid-April marked the significant turning point when staking activity surged.\n\nThe ETH All Exchange Reserve chart further reinforces the notion of increased accumulation among investors. As ETH is withdrawn from exchanges and moved into private wallets, it indicates investors\u2019 willingness to hold ETH for the long term.\n\nIn a manner similar to staking, we are witnessing a consistent downtrend in this metric. The most pronounced period of accumulation occurred between November 6 and December 20 of the previous year when the total ETH held on exchanges dropped from 23,340,585 to 18,448,188, indicating a withdrawal of 4,852,397 ETH.\n\nCurrently, this figure is even lower, standing at 14,538,278 ETH.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOn September 11, ETH experienced a notable drop to $1,540. This marked a nearly 25% decline from its high on July 14, when it was trading at $2,030. During this period, the price chart exhibited the formation of a descending trendline that acted as resistance. Additionally, when combined with the lower descending trendline dating back to April 26, it created a descending triangle pattern.\n\nAs the price began its upward movement, it initially breached the resistance of the descending triangle, progressing to the next horizontal resistance level at $1,760, where it encountered a temporary halt.\n\nThis ascent, measured from its low on September 11, marked a 15% increase, suggesting the potential for further upward movement. However, a minor pullback might precede this, aiming to test the broken triangle\u2019s resistance as a newfound support. Consequently, we may expect a slight descent to around $1,650.\n\nIf this support level holds, it could pave the way for a continuation of the upward trend, possibly surpassing $1,800. It\u2019s worth noting that the descending triangle may have served as a corrective structure, potentially leading to ETH achieving a new yearly high, especially since it didn\u2019t achieve one on July 14, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nConversely, a robust rejection at the current levels, roughly around $1,760, could trigger another downward move, taking the price below its September 11 low of $1,540. In such a scenario, the next potential support zone lies at $1,360.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Nine Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) became available for trading on Oct. 2.\n\nThe nine funds in that category are offered by six different asset managers: Valkyrie, VanEck, ProShares, Bitwise, Kelly, and VolShares. Each fund is currently trading on the Cboe exchange. Four of the ETFs invest in a combination of Bitcoin futures and Ethereum futures, while five others invest solely in Ethereum futures.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted a roundup of trading volumes as follows on X:\n\nTicker Issuer Strategy Value traded as 11:15am [USD]\n\nBTF US Valkyrie Ether + Bitcoin 787,376 EFUT US VanEck Ether 305,410 EETH US ProShares Ether 284,112 BETE US ProShares Ether + Bitcoin 245,825 BTOP US Bitwise Ether + Bitcoin 46,332 AETH US Bitwise Ether 27,494 BETH US ProShares Ether + Bitcoin 4,737 EXUS Kelly Ether 0 ETHU US VolShares Ether 0 TOTAL 1,701,286\n\nValkyrie\u2019s ETF reported the highest volume. The fund saw $787,376 in volume and accounted for 46% of the combined volume of all nine ETFs. Valkyrie announced that it added Ethereum futures to its fund in a press release; it called the newly-converted fund the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind dual cryptocurrency futures\u201d as it also includes Bitcoin futures.\n\nVanEck, meanwhile, offers an ETF that solely invests in Ethereum futures. It reported the second-highest volume of $305,410, accounting for 18% of the combined total. VanEck acknowledged the launch of its fund publicly and said that it offers the \u201conly ETF providing focused exposure to ETH futures that is structured as a C-Corp.\u201d\n\nProShares also has a notable presence with three separate ETFs that account for 31% of the overall volume. Bitwise accounted for 4% of all volume with just two funds. The two remaining funds, from Kelly and VolShares, had no measured volume.\n\nCrypto ETFs are milestones despite low volume\n\nBalchunas observed that the collective volume across all ETFs amounted to less than $2 million during the first few hours of trading. He called this \u201cabout normal for a new ETF\u201d but observed that the volume is considerably lower than that of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which launched in late 2021. Balchunas said that this fund saw $200 million in volume during the first 15 minutes of trading.\n\nDespite the seemingly modest appeal of the above ETFs, their approval is notable. Though certain asset managers took an interest in Ethereum futures ETFs this summer, VanEck and ProShares have sought permission for their respective Ethereum futures ETFs from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since at least September 2021. This means that the latest approvals are two years in the making.\n\nAs such, these new funds may pave the way for the approval of spot Ethereum and spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 the latter of which are expected to have the greatest appeal."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe hotly anticipated rollout of exchange traded funds linked to ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, in the US has turned into a damp squib, with modest investor interest.\n\nNine ETFs holding futures contracts based on ether \u2014 the token of the Ethereum blockchain on which most \u201csmart contracts\u201d are written \u2014 debuted on the same day after regulators expedited the approval process to sidestep a potential US government shutdown, now averted.\n\nHowever the funds saw combined trading volume of just $6.6mn on Monday, according to data from AB Bernstein. This was a pale shadow of the $1bn of assets that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) garnered on its first two days of trading in October 2021 when it became the first US ETF trading in futures contracts linked to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe ether futures ETFs opened to a rather tame start on Monday. Total trading volume was $6.6mn which was a disappointing start,\u201d said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at Bernstein, who believed media attention was focused on the impending trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in New York.\n\nChhugani believed the lacklustre launch was \u201cnot surprising, given the continued weak retail sentiment\u201d towards cryptocurrencies, whereas BITO launched at the peak of a digital bull market.\n\n\u201cLike any listed security, success or failure cannot be measured on the first days of trading with market sentiment and the macro environment all having a bearing on performance,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products.\n\nDespite rallying 10 per cent last week in anticipation of the wave of launches, the price of ether is still down 64 per cent from its peak in November 2021.\n\nIt fell 4 per cent to $1,663 on Monday as the launches underwhelmed \u2014 although as the ETFs are futures products, rather than investing in the \u201cphysical\u201d spot cryptocurrency, purchases do not have any direct impact on the price.\n\nBitcoin is also down by 57 per cent from the highs it briefly touched in November 2021 as cryptocurrencies have proved to be procyclical \u201chigh beta\u201d assets.\n\nThe bulk of the trading that did take place was in the pre-existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which changed its name to add \u201cand Ether\u201d on Tuesday, when it broadened out to incorporate both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTF traded $4.6mn, according to Bernstein. The liveliest of the newly launched ETFs was the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which saw turnover of $879,000, ahead of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), at $516,000.\n\nNevertheless, Chhugani argued that, if and when more retail investors do return to crypto there will be \u201cwide availability of fair, secure and regulated products that help them attain crypto exposure without worrying about losing their savings from fraudulent exchanges\u201d.\n\nDave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry, believed the funds would be popular with financial advisers, who cannot invest client money in crypto itself, but can do so via ETFs.\n\nEther is reasonably popular in Europe, where ETPs investing in both crypto futures and the physical spot currencies are permitted in many jurisdictions. The 13 pure ether ETPs available on the continent have combined assets of \u20ac1.1bn, according to data from TrackInsight, compared to \u20ac2.6bn in 20 bitcoin ETPs.\n\nOverall, ether has a market capitalisation of $200bn, compared to $535bn for bitcoin and $83bn for tether, the third-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe launches come as the US ETF industry remains barred from what is sees as the crown jewel of the crypto firmament \u2014 spot bitcoin funds.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to allow the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, citing fears of fraud and manipulation on the unregulated exchanges on which the digital tokens trade, concerns that it does not have about futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated venue.\n\nThe SEC has thus far maintained this stance despite losing a court case to crypto manager Grayscale, which sued over the regulator\u2019s refusal to let it convert its $17.4bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private fund, into an ETF, in August.\n\nAfter that defeat, one school of thought was that the SEC might satisfy the court\u2019s ruling \u2014 and equalise its treatment of spot and futures bitcoin ETFs \u2014 by retroactively axing BITO and its sister bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s willingness to allow ether futures ETFs would appear to have put that idea to bed.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nChhugani believed a \u201cdistinct shift\u201d was now evident in the SEC\u2019s stance towards crypto ETFs, with applicants \u201cseeing a more engaged SEC being responsive, unlike the past\u201d.\n\nHe believed the first such bitcoin ETFs would be approved sometime around early January.\n\nSpot ether ETFs may follow not long after, with Ark and VanEck among the groups to have filed to launch products. Grayscale has also filed to convert its existing $5bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that, like bitcoin, the listing of these ethereum futures ETFs is ultimately paving the way for a spot ethereum ETF in the US,\u201d said Duke."

        "title": "Ethereum Layer 2s Surpass Prominent Layer 1s in Total Value Locked - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "The surge of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and BASE, overtaking Layer 1 blockchains Solana and Avalanche in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) as of September 25, 2023, highlights the pivotal role of Layer 2s in augmenting the scalability and transactional efficiency of the Ethereum network. The data underscores a growing preference for Layer 2 solutions, demonstrating their potential in enhancing the blockchain technology landscape.\n\nTop-performing Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum , Optimism, and BASE have outpaced prominent Ethereum competitor Layer 1 blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of September 25, 2023, according to Grayscale. This shift is pivotal as it demonstrates the growing significance of Layer 2 solutions in enhancing the scalability and transactional capacity of the Ethereum network.\n\nLayer 1 refers to the base protocol layer of a blockchain network. It encompasses the fundamental rules governing the network, including consensus algorithms, transaction validation processes, and the creation of new blocks. Layer 1 solutions are integral to the operation of a blockchain and include established networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana , and Avalanche. However, as blockchain networks grow in popularity, scalability issues arise, often leading to slower transaction speeds and higher fees.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are secondary protocols built atop Layer 1 blockchains, aiming to alleviate scalability issues by offloading transaction processing from the main chain. These solutions retain the security guarantees of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain while providing faster transactions and lower fees. Examples of Layer 2 solutions include Arbitrum, Optimism, and BASE, which operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains operate by processing transactions from decentralized applications (dApps) and subsequently \"batching\" them together. This batch of transactions is then sent back to the main network in a compressed form for final settlement. This mechanism serves as an auxiliary route or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway, thus optimizing the transaction process.\n\nBy functioning as outlined, Layer 2s enhance the overall usability and transaction potential of the Ethereum ecosystem while still leveraging the network\u2019s fundamental security. As the Ethereum network scales further, a significant amount of activity can transition to the more cost-effective Layer 2 solutions. This transition, in turn, directs value back to Ethereum, further bolstering its position in the blockchain sphere.\n\nAmong the 31 active Ethereum Layer 2 projects listed by L2Beat, five projects namely Optimism, Arbitrum, BASE, Starknet, and zkSync are recognized for their standout performance in fundamental metrics. A chart released by Grayscale on September 27, 2023, sheds light on these top Layer 2s by TVL. It's noteworthy that while Arbitrum and Optimism have launched a token, BASE, Starknet, and zkSync have yet to do so. The market caps column within the chart signifies the market cap for each respective token.\n\nA recent report by Will Hamilogden delves deeper into the landscape of Layer 2s within the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a more extensive understanding of this burgeoning sector. The report is available on Grayscale\u2019s website for individuals seeking a more comprehensive exploration of Layer 2s and their role in scaling Ethereum.\n\nSource: L2BEAT\n\nThe data from L2BEAT reveals that as of October 2, 2023, the sum of all funds locked on Ethereum converted to USD stands at $10.78 billion, marking a 4.64% growth over the past seven days. The TVL across various projects underscores the growing traction of Layer 2 solutions. For instance, Arbitrum One leads with a TVL of $6.03 billion, followed by OP Mainnet with $2.70 billion, and zkSync Era with $459 million.\n\nThe ascent of Layer 2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and BASE in terms of TVL is a testament to their value proposition in augmenting the Ethereum ecosystem. By surpassing notable Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche, these Layer 2s have showcased their potential in fostering a more scalable and cost-effective environment for dApps, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement of the blockchain technology landscape.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH-USD) futures ETFs have begun trading in the U.S. for the first time. Yahoo Finance Live co-hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman monitor the price action in the crypto space, including bitcoin (BTC-USD), after the issuance of several ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: The ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise all launching their products. This coming as Grayscale files for approval to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund. So this is interesting, Julie.\n\nSo we've had, of course, Bitcoin futures ETFs for a while now. Of course, those made their debut during a very different time in the world of crypto. Bitcoin was a lot higher. Now we have these Ethereum-themed ETFs.\n\nI'll be very interested what demand is like. And to the extent there is demand, where does it come from? Does it come from retail investors, Julie, Josh, friends, and family, or is this, to the extent again that we see it, is it more of a financial advisor product? This is something they want to buy their customers.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: I'm not clear on the answers to any of these questions, right, because on the one hand, you have the SBF trial that is set to begin, that defenders of crypto would say, well, you get fraud in any asset class. This is not unique to crypto. Critics of crypto would say that there are qualities of cryptocurrencies that make it especially susceptible to fraud. In part, one of them being that it is not as regulated as other types of asset classes. So that debate rages on in the background, even as we get approval and beginning of trading of these new products.\n\nSo it's an interesting time, if you will. At the same time, we see Bitcoin up today, right? We see some buying again, even as the SBF trial is set to begin.\n\nEthereum, though, is trading lower. So all of these products are also under pressure in today's session. So it's unclear exactly what the situation will bring. I should also mention real quickly, Grayscale Investments is also now applied to have its Ethereum trust converted into an ETF. And of course, it's been on that similar quest with its Bitcoin ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Bitcoin, we just showed there. So near 28,000. It has rebounded strongly. But of course, way off that record of $69,000.\n\nI thought it was very interesting too, Julie, just what venture investors are doing right now. So these are obviously the men and women that are writing all those checks to those private companies. And this courtesy of Bloomberg, VC deals targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have shrunk to about $7 billion in total this year. That is about, Julie, a quarter of the full year tally in each of 2021 and 2022. So bottom line, VCs tightening their purse strings a bit here.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Again, you have that at the same time that the likes of Coinbase are in DC still really taking their case to regulators.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So much enthusiasm for those spot Bitcoin ETFs, right? That is really-- from at least the crypto fans."

        "content": "Cryptos struggle as relentless Treasury selloff continues; 10-year yield rises 5.2bps to 4.731%\n\nProshares Ethereum ETF (EETH) traded only 21,000 shares\n\nVanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) traded only 29,000 shares\n\nOver the past several months the focus in the cryptoverse has been on whether the SEC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. Hampered by SEC delays, sentiment for cryptos have struggled immensely, especially given the chaos sparked by the bond market.\n\nSentiment could be improving given the SEC has just approved a handful of Ether futures ETFs. Bitcoin future ETFs already exist, but the SEC decision to give approval to Ethereum is somewhat news considering it has always been thought as a bigger risk to getting the security tag.\n\nEthereum posted a nice rally to start the week following the ETF launches done by Valkyrie, VanEck, Proshares, and Bitwise. The massive Ethereum ETF launch was to make sure everyone had a fair chance, which is what not happened a couple years ago for Bitcoin when BITO launched alone and dominated the ETF market share.\n\nEthereum Daily Chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s Monday pump was faded on both disappointing ETF trading volumes and as prices quickly respected a confluence of resistance from the 50- and 200-day SMA. The death cross that formed at the end of August saw bearishness tentatively exhausted after making a low at $1531 on September 11th.\n\nEthereum could start attracting more interest once price closes above the $1810 level. Ethereum\u2019s more diversified blockchain ecosystem has yet to trigger a gamechanger for the use-case argument for cryptos, but optimism remains that some of its products and offerings are driving the majority of the interest. If bearishness resumes, downside targets include $1510, which is the 50% retracement of the 2022 low to 2023 high move.\n\nContent is for general information purposes only.

        "content": "Grayscale Ethereum (OTC:ETHE) has made a name for itself as a cryptocurrency stock focusing on Ethereum (ETH-USD), much as the name suggests. But it gained ground in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading as it made an important pivot that should help it catch more interest and manage more cryptocurrency assets. Grayscale moved to convert its operations from a trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on Ethereum spot trades.\n\nTo accomplish this, Grayscale has filed for approval with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S. and also got together with NYSE Arca to establish the fund. Currently, Grayscale is the largest Ethereum investment vehicle around, as it manages nearly $5 billion in assets. That\u2019s roughly 2.5% of all Ethereum currently in circulation.\n\nCurrently, Grayscale invests in Ethereum-based futures contracts. But with the move, it will be able to invest directly in Ethereum itself. Grayscale\u2019s CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, offered comment on the move, noting that this was an \u201c\u2026important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S regulatory perimeter.\u201d It\u2019s been said before that only institutional investment will truly allow cryptocurrency to take off, and making an Ethereum ETF should work nicely to pull some institutional dollars.\n\nWhat is the Future of Grayscale Ethereum Stock?\n\nThe future of Grayscale Ethereum is uncertain at the moment as it mainly relies on the price movements of the underlying asset. Nevertheless, a look at the last five days in trading for Grayscale Ethereum stock shows that it\u2019s making headway upward. While early in the period, it saw a clear decline, it recovered those losses within a few hours of trading and started a ramp-up. It\u2019s been continuing that ramp-up for most of the last five days, following a moment of near-vertical rise today and a loss of much of that gain over Monday\u2019s trading session.\n\nDisclosure"

        "title": "Ethereum Uptober on Hold Despite ETH Futures Launch: Is $2000 Possible? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nETH ETF launch was unsuccessful as low trading volume\n\nPrice makes a downturn, decreasing by 6.7%.\n\nChart analysis shows bearish signs.\n\nOn Monday, September 2, three U.S. investment firms, ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise Asset Management, introduced futures-based ETFs linked to Ether, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency. These six newly launched funds offered investors their first opportunity to invest in Ether-based exchange-traded products.\n\nHowever, the launch of these ETFs didn\u2019t seem to generate significant investor interest, and the ETH spot price has declined by 6.77% since then. While these ETH futures ETFs were expected to fuel a substantial price increase, they instead had a negative impact on the price.\n\nNevertheless, ETH has been in an uptrend since September 11. So, was this decline just a minor setback with $2,000 in its sights, or is it an early indicator that it lacks the strength to sustain its upward trajectory?\n\nETH Futures ETF\u2019s botch\n\nOn the debut day, the combined trading volumes of these ETFs reached $1.92 million. Notably, the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF had the highest trading volume at $878,560, according to data from LSEG .\n\nIn an informative X thread , Vetle Lunde, a Senior Analyst at K33Research, shared some statistics about the underwhelming launch day for futures-based ETH ETFs.\n\nHe focused on trading volumes and made comparisons with similar product launches, particularly BITI and BITO, which are ProShares Bitcoin ETF products.\n\nIn his initial chart, he highlighted that ProShares dominated the trading volume, accounting for the majority of the first-day trading volume, which totaled $1.96 million across EETH (Ether Strategy ETF) and BETE (Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF). VanEck\u2019s EFUT, which launched slightly ahead of its competitors, followed suit.\n\nIn his following chart, Vetle Lunde compared the day-one volumes of ETH ETFs with ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Future ETF products. The initial volumes for the ETH ETFs were considerably lower than those of BITO ($1.01B) and BITI ($7.21M) at their respective launches. The ETH ETFs\u2019 day-one volumes represented only 0.19% of BITO\u2019s launch volume and 27% of BITI\u2019s launch volume.\n\nIn summary, he acknowledged the differences in market conditions during the BITO and BITI launches but still characterized the launch of ETH ETFs as uneventful.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous analysis of ETH, we discussed the macro view, highlighting two potential scenarios. One possibility was that the price had initiated a new uptrend by breaking out from the descending resistance level.\n\nThe alternative scenario considered the increase from September 11 as a corrective move, suggesting that a new downturn might commence as the price faced rejection at the $1,760 resistance level.\n\nToday, we witnessed a 6.7% decline, measuring from yesterday\u2019s high to today\u2019s lowest point of $1,641. To support a potential move towards $2,000, the price needs to form a complete five-wave pattern starting from September 11.\n\nDespite briefly achieving a higher high yesterday, it faced a sharp rejection and is currently testing the September 18 high, which is considered to be the first wave of this pattern.\n\nCurrent Pattern May Be Invalid\n\nAccording to the Elliott Wave theory, it appears that the current pattern may be invalid. First, the assumed wave 3 fell slightly short of its optimum length, but it is still somewhat longer than wave 1, which adheres to Elliott Wave rules.\n\nWave 4 is typically a consolidative correction, often observed as a sideways movement and should not overlap with wave 2 territory. While it did produce a minor wick on the 4-hour chart, the candle close remained above wave 2. However, given that all three rules are currently stretched, it increasingly resembles a corrective move from September 11.\n\nThis could suggest that another downward trend has begun, with the price of ETH potentially heading below its September 11 low and below $1,500. The key determinant of the future outlook is how the price behaves around the $1,660 level. If it manages to stay above and starts moving upward, it could signal the start of an impulse wave.\n\nOn the other hand, if the descending move continues, it would indicate that sellers have regained control, potentially leading to a lower low.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nSeveral Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have started trading in the United States for the first time.\n\nInvestment firms ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares collectively debuted a total of nine ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Monday morning.\n\nProshares launched three funds: the Ether Strategy Fund (EETH), the Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BETH), and the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Strategy ETF (BETE).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Bitwise debuted its Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP).\n\nVanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) kicked off trading Monday, along with Valkyrie's Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF), and Volshares debuted its Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU). Brazilian fund manager Hashdex also rolled out its Ether Strategy ETF (EX).\n\nBut the nine funds got off to a slow start. As of 11:25am ET, they had traded little under $2 million in total, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Bulchunas, who described the volume as \"meh\" on Twitter.\n\nValkyrie's BTF was leading the race with around $787,000 worth of shares trading hands by that time.\n\nPretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low. Tight race bt VanEck and ProShares in the single eth lane. pic.twitter.com/F9AHtrVcVf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe funds have a long way to go since the first Bitcoin futures ETF started trading on the New York Stock Exchange back in 2021: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF traded nearly $1 billion in shares in one day on its debut, almost breaking records in the process.\n\nBack then, at the height of the bull market, Bitcoin was trading for over $66,000 per coin\u2014nearly 60% higher than it is now.\n\nToday's crypto funds, which track the future price of Ethereum rather than the asset itself, come as investors await a spot crypto ETF. A spot ETF lets investors gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in question\u2014without holding the actual asset\u2014at the current price of the coin, while investing in a futures ETF is effectively a bet on a later price of the asset.\n\nAmerica's top regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has a long list of applications from high-profile Wall Street players\u2014including BlackRock\u2014to make a decision on.\n\nUntil then, investors wanting exposure to cryptocurrencies will have to trade futures contracts\u2014or buy the digital asset directly.\n\nCoinGecko showed that the price of Ethereum at the time of writing stood at $1,690, a 24-hour rise of just 0.5%. The asset is also up almost 7% in the past seven days."

        "content": "One layer of defense may not be enough to combat the centralization risks present in some ETH staking pool operators, said the Ethereum cofounder.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns over the underlying mechanisms running on major ETH staking pool providers Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nLido and Rocket Pool are the two largest liquid ETH staking pools by market share, allowing users to participate in staking ETH, earning rewards, without having to lock their funds in the staking smart contract.\n\nIn a Sept. 30 blog post, Buterin said that both Lido\u2019s model of having its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) whitelist node operators and Rocket Pool\u2019s model of having users put down 8 ETH to run a node had different issues.\n\nLido offers users a derivative token called \u201cstaked ETH\u201d or stETH to represent the value of the amount staked, while Rocket Pool allows users to stake ETH by running a permissionless node.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s approach would allow malicious actors to 51% attack the network, forcing users to pay most of the costs, said Buterin. Meanwhile, Lido\u2019s DAO approach would create a scenario of potentially attactable governance gadget controlling a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s validtors if a single staking token dominates.\n\n\u201cTo the credit of protocols like Lido, they have implemented safeguards against this, but one layer of defense may not be enough,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nHe proposed encouraging ecosystem participants to diversify to different staking pool operators as a short-term solution to the prospect of one provider becoming too large, and thereby, a system risk to the blockchain.\n\nAnother solution would be enshrining features at a protocol level to curtail the effects of centralization in other areas. In his view, \u201cminimal viable enshrinement\u201d could be the middle ground that addresses these challenges without being too narrowly focused.\n\n\u201cRather than enshrining a full liquid staking system, changing staking penalty rules to make trustless liquid staking more viable,\u201d said Buterin, as one example of how this could be carried out."

        "content": "The SEC\u2019s recent approval of Ethereum ETFs confirms its status as a non-security, says former CFTC Chairman Brian Quintenz, who is currently a head of policy of a16z crypto.\n\nOn Oct. 2, the financial market welcomed a total of nine ETF products aimed at tracking futures contracts linked to Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOut of these nine, five ETFs are solely focused on Ether futures, whereas the remaining four offer exposure to both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures contracts.\n\nGrayscale Investments is also exploring the possibility of converting its existing Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nEthereum ETF approvals suggest changing regulatory winds at SEC\n\nBrian Quintenz, who serves as the Head of Policy at a16z Crypto and is a former CFTC Commissioner, suggested that the SEC\u2019s approval of an Ethereum ETF may signal a change in the agency\u2019s stance, possibly moving away from treating ETH as a security.\n\nBy approving ETH ETFs based on ETH commodity futures contracts, the SEC has officially provided clarity on ETH\u2019s status as a non-security.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Rally, Liquidating $70M in Shorts - Blockonomi",
        "content": "The crypto market sees green as investors pay close attention to the launch of the Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) kick off October with impressive price surges. The largest cryptocurrency broke through $28,000 as October begins. Bitcoin is now trading around $27,990, up to 3.3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe price of Ethereum surged from $1,595 to $1,750 before hovering around $1,723 at the time of writing. It remains unclear if the market has made a turn, or if this is just a flash in the pan.\n\nBull Run or Bull Trap?\n\nThe sudden rally came amid the market\u2019s anticipation of the first Ethereum futures ETF product within this month. Last Friday, the community was abuzz with news that Valkyrie would be the first to offer the futures ETF.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC reportedly approved other Ethereum futures ETFs from VanEck, Bitwise, ProShares, Kelly ETFs, and Vol Shares. These 9 products will come on October 2.\n\nApart from Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin spot ETFs are also in the spotlight, even though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could continue to extend the deadline for a decision on whether to approve them.\n\nThe SEC has delayed a decision on Bitcoin spot ETFs several times, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, there is growing pressure on the SEC to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF. Crypto members are optimistic about a potential approval in early 2024.\n\nOn a day when the two largest coins celebrated the new month, other altcoins also heated up. Over the past 24 hours, Solana (SOL) surged by 12.05%, THORChain (RUNE) was up to 12.35%, and Polygon (MATIC) increased by 5.64%. Other top altcoins, such as Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX), also recorded gains of 1% to 3%.\n\nWith the sudden return of bullish momentum, \u201cUptober\u201d is now the trending keyword across the crypto members. Historically, the price of cryptocurrencies has mostly rallied in October.\n\nThe unexpected price move has benefited spot and long positions, but it has been painful for short sellers. According to Coinglass, $70 million in short positions were liquidated within two hours, with nearly $36 million worth of BTC shorts and $23 million worth of ETH shorts liquidated.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment expected the Bitcoin bull run could continue in October. According to Santiment\u2019s report, Bitcoin whales that own between 10 to 10,000 BTC have accumulated their highest holdings in 2023, currently at 13.03 million BTC.\n\nThese whales have also been quietly buying Tether (USDT) over the past six weeks. The accumulation of Bitcoin and USDT by whales and sharks suggests that they are confident in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat to Expect this October?\n\nTwo significant macro events this month are U.S. unemployment rate on October 6 and CPI reports on October 1. The data provide insights into the health of the economy and the level of inflation, which are both key factors that the Federal Reserve (Fed) considers when making decisions about interest rates.\n\nWhile the Fed took a pause in its interest rate hikes in September, many financial experts and analysts are of the opinion that this pause is temporary. They believe that the Federal Reserve is inclined to resume raising interest rates, possibly as early as its upcoming meetings in November or December.\n\nThe rationale behind this expectation is the Fed\u2019s ongoing efforts to control and reduce inflation, which has been running above its desired 2% target. Of course, the Fed is limited, and more rate hikes will put more strain on the global financial system.\n\nGiven this scenario, the crypto market could experience some effects from the federal agency\u2019s decision. However, its significance may be minor. Analysts and observers believe that the broader economic outlook is pivotal in shaping the crypto market\u2019s direction."

        "title": "Ethereum Futures ETFs Storm the US Market, But Initial Enthusiasm Appears Muted - Securities.io",
        "content": "As Bitcoin surged past $28,000 on Monday to trade above its 200-day moving average, Ether also rallied to $1,740. However, since then, the prices have fallen as traders took profit, and the US 10-year yield spurged to its highest level in over 16 years.\n\nAt the time of writing, the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $198.4 billion has been trading at $1,649 while managing $12.45 bln in volume, which is up 9% from a day ago. Despite this, ETH's price has faced challenges recently.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ETH's price has dropped by 4.7%. Not only against USD, but ETH's price is also down against BTC, currently sitting at 0.0601, down from its Nov. 2021 high of 0.081246. ETHBTC has actually been on a downtrend for the past year, when it was at 0.077 in late Oct. 2022.\n\nHowever, ETH's price in USD is still up about 38% in 2023 so far, with the crypto asset gaining 27.6% over the past year. That said, it has lost over 66% of its value since hitting an all-time high (ATH) at $4,880 in Nov. 2021.\n\nAs the bullish sentiment spreads across the broader market and the crypto fear and greed index turns neutral with a reading of 50/100, risk-tolerant investors are exiting their ETH positions. They are moving their coins into exchange-hosted wallets, potentially to sell. As per Cryptoquant data, the total ETH deposited in exchange wallets has risen to 14.70 million ETH, an increase from 14.57 million coins on Sept. 24.\n\nIf we take a look at Global In/Out of Money Around Price (GIOM) data, 3.3 million addresses bought 3.37 million Ethereum coins at an average price of $1,802, presenting a significant sell-wall at this level. Technically, ETH has an important resistance present at the $1,725 (Fib 0.382) level.\n\nOn the other hand, 7.26 million addresses had bought 14.92 million ETH coins at the minimum price of $1,535. So, if ETH moves downwards and loses its support level at $1,650, it can drop below the first $1,550 and then $1,500.\n\nMoreover, last week, around 2,500 ETH worth just over $4 million, tied to last year's exploit of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started moving for the first time in nearly a year. Of these, 700 ETH were transferred using the Thorchain Router, and about 1,200 were moved through the privacy wallet Railgun, while another 550 were sitting in an intermediate wallet. Also, there is still 12,500 ETH in the original wallet.\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Ethereum.\n\nA Slew of Ether Futures ETF Enters the Market\n\nThe latest price action came after Ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) made their way into the US market for the very first time. In a recent note, QCP Capital said, \u201ca futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot price \u2013 as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into a synthetic market.\u201d\n\nHowever, the much-hyped Ether Futures ETFs failed to capture the interest of investors.\n\nOn Monday, investment firms VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, ProShares, and Kelly collectively debuted a total of nine ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). Of these funds, only five hold exclusively Ether futures, while the others track a mixture of Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts.\n\nVanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) kicked off trading yesterday, while Valkyrie debuted its Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF). Bitwise, too, was in the fray as it rolled out its Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). Meanwhile, Proshares launched three funds: the Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BETH), the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Strategy ETF (BETE), and the Ether Strategy Fund (EETH). Brazilian fund manager Hashdex also launched its Ether Strategy ETF (EX).\n\nHowever, despite the excitement surrounding these launches, the nine funds got off to a slow start, with low volumes reported on their first day of trading. As of 11:25 am ET, they had traded less than $2 million in total, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Bulchunas, who described the volume as \u201cmeh\u201d on Twitter.\n\nAmong all the Ether futures ETFs, Valkyrie's BTF was leading the race with around $787,000 worth of shares trading hands by that time.\n\nWhile Ether futures ETF only started trading now, the first Bitcoin futures ETF started trading on the New York Stock Exchange back in 2021. Compared to Ether's performance, at the time, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) traded nearly $1 billion in shares on its debut day and almost broke records. However, it's worth noting that BITO's launch was during the height of the bull run when Bitcoin was trading around $65,000, a lot higher than it is currently trading at.\n\nEven then, Balchunas noted that compared to a regular traditional finance (TradFi) ETF launch, the volume witnessed was actually \u201cquite a lot.\u201d He further explained that the SEC scheduled the launch of all the products on the same day to prevent any one fund from gaining market domination.\n\nAmidst this, Volatility Shares, a financial firm offering a range of ETF products, canceled its plans to list Eth futures ETFs, saying that it \u201cdidn't see an opportunity\u201d at this time with further plans to be decided.\n\nAll of these crypto funds track the future price of the digital rather than the asset itself. Investors are currently awaiting a Spot crypto ETF, which will allow them to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency itself without needing to hold the actual asset.\n\nIn the past few months, several high-profile TradFi players, including BlackRock, have filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF on which the SEC has yet to make a decision. Market participants are hopeful that we can get approval next year, but that remains to be seen.\n\nRecently, four US lawmakers called on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to immediately approve spot Bitcoin ETF after a federal judge last month undermined the agency's decision to reject converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.\n\nClick here to learn all about buying Ethereum (ETH).\n\nGrayscale Applied for a Spot Ether ETF\n\nAs a series of Ether futures ETFs made their way into the US market, asset manager Grayscale now intends to convert its Ethereum Trust into an ETF.\n\nNYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 with the SEC to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product's evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the US regulatory perimeter,\u201d said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein in a statement.\n\nAs per the press release, ETHE's conversion into a spot ETF has always been the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of the Trust's intended lifecycle ever since its launch in 2019. Much like Grayscale's Bitcoin fund, the company's Ethereum trust is the largest Ethereum investment vehicle worldwide. After all, ETHE currently comprises 2.5% of all circulating ETH.\n\nAs of writing, ETHE shares are trading at a 30% discount to the underlying ether held by the fund. Following the announcement, shares for ETHE spiked over 6%. With ETH currently trading at $1,665, the total value of the fund's ETH holdings amounts to about $5 billion, while its shares total to just $3.6 billion.\n\nThis is because, currently, ETHE shares are not redeemable for the underlying ETH, which would be changed under the ETF structure.\n\nLast month, Grayscale also filed for a futures Ethereum ETF, which is backed by cash-settled futures contracts rather than actual ETH. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset, here ETH, at a later date at a predetermined price.\n\nGrayscale's latest application to convert ETHE into an ETF comes while the company battles to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Back in August, the company did secure a major court victory over the SEC as the court found that the securities regulator was being \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d toward Grayscale in denying its spot Bitcoin ETF application while permitting alternative futures Bitcoin ETFs. Since then, GBTC's share discount has narrowed from 25% to 20%.\n\nTokenization & Staking on Ethereum Gains Traction\n\nAmidst all the heightened activity around Ethereum ETF, the tokenization trend on Ethereum continues to gather steam. This week, UBS Asset Management launched its inaugural live pilot of a tokenized Variable Capital Company (VCC) fund, representing a legal entity for investment funds in Singapore introduced in January 2020 to enhance the city-state's position as a hub for fund management activities.\n\nThe asset management division of Switzerland's largest financial holding will leverage its in-house tokenization service called UBS Tokenize to initiate a controlled pilot of a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and let the firm facilitate fund subscriptions and redemptions.\n\nThe pilot is part of the broader Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)-led VCC umbrella initiative called Project Guardian, which aims to tokenize various real-world assets.\n\n\u201cThis is a key milestone in understanding the tokenization of funds, building on UBS's expertise in tokenizing bonds and structured products,\u201d said Thomas Kaegi, Head of UBS Asset Management, Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn this initiative, UBS will collaborate with TradFi institutions and fintech providers to gain insights into enhancing market liquidity and providing better market access for their clients.\n\nThe UBS Tokenize platform was recently also used to issue digital structured notes by Bank of China Investment (BOCI), amounting to CNH 200 million ($27.3 million), on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBesides tokenization, staking is also gaining traction on Ethereum, with about 30.5 million coins staked on the network. Back in April, the Shapella upgrade went live, which finally allowed the withdrawals of ETH, making investors more confident with locking up their coins in Ethereum's deposit contract.\n\nStaking has made Ethereum one of the hottest money-making opportunities. While the market is going through a crypto winter, staking has created the ability for participants to earn rewards on their holdings and weather the storm until asset prices start rallying.\n\nHowever, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed worries regarding DAOs like Lido exerting a monopoly over the selection of node operators in liquidity staking pools. \u201cWith the DAO approach, if a single such staking token dominates, that leads to a single, potentially attackable governance gadget controlling a very large portion of all Ethereum validators,\u201d Buterin said in a Sept. 30 blog post.\n\nTo address this issue, Buterin encouraged ecosystem participants to utilize a variety of liquid staking providers.\n\nEthereum Protocol Improvements\n\nWhile all this development is taking place, developers continue to work on making Ethereum more efficient. Last week, Ethereum developers were successful in their second attempt to launch the new Holesky test network, which is to help developers test some ambitious scaling plans for the main blockchain. The new testnet will also allow twice as many validators to join the network compared to the mainnet.\n\nHolesky is of significance because it will be important for Ethereum's upcoming hard fork, Dencun, where proto-danksharding is supposed to go live. As part of EIP-4844, Proto-danksharding is aimed at reducing the cost of rollups, which batch transactions and data off-chain and submit computational proof to the main Ethereum blockchain. The expected launch date for proto-danksharding is yet to be decided, though development and testing are ongoing.\n\nButerin recently also commented on Ethereum's philosophy, which started off as minimalistic but has since changed. Discussing the possibility of integrating more advanced features directly into the Ethereum protocol, Buterin said it is not limited to Layer 2 structures but also includes other functionalities such as privacy, usernames, advanced cryptography, account safety, censorship resistance, frontrunning protection, and digital asset exchange, among others.\n\nHe did caution that too much enshrining, which is integrating advanced features and functionalities directly into the Ethereum protocol, can also bring problems in the long run in terms of overcomplications and including features only popular in the short term.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nETH is currently in the red, but if the bulls persist, we could see it continue first toward $1,800 and then $2,000. Not to mention, this price action is happening as we enter October, historically one of its strongest months. However, the macro environment remains the major driving force, and with investors worried that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates high for longer, which are at their highest level since 2001, to tame inflation, risk-averseness will continue to rule the markets."

According to insights shared by Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, the cumulative trading volume for the ETFs on the first trading day was just below $2 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low. Tight race bt VanEck and ProShares in the single eth lane. pic.twitter.com/F9AHtrVcVf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2023\n\nAfter the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted many of the ETF proposals from the likes of VanEck, ProShares, Valkyrie and Bitwise, among others, U.S. stock exchanges welcomed multiple launches earlier this week.\n\nPer the data shared, the combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures ETFs from Valkyrie had the highest trading volume, which was pegged at about $787,376 as of 11:15 a.m. on Monday. The same low trading volume characterized the offerings from ProShares, whose Ethereum Futures ETF saw just a meager $284,112 traded overall.\n\nWhile the fact that such a product is available for mainstream investors to gain exposure to the crypto space, Balchunas pointed out the poor volume when compared to the more than $200 million the first-ever Bitcoin Futures ETF recorded within the first 15 minutes after it went live.\n\nPotential reason for scarred volume\n\nThe industry has been quite emphatic about the SEC approving a crypto ETF product. While the market regulator has always been keen on the futures variant, what the industry wants the most is the spot ETF versions of both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWith multiple ETF applications filed with the SEC at this time, the regulator is facing pressures from the industry, compounded by the legal victory handed to Grayscale with respect to the product as well as pressure from lawmakers, who believe the time to approve a Bitcoin ETF is now.\n\nWith the Ethereum Futures ETF now live, expectation abounds for the SEC to approve more Bitcoin spot ETFs in the near term."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter ongoing efforts to convert its Bitcoin (BTC) Trust into an exchange-traded fund, Grayscale now intends to do the same with its Ethereum (ETH) product.\n\nNYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF shortly after the first series of futures Ethereum ETFs reached the U.S. market.\n\nWhen listing a new crypto ETF, regulatory permission is always sought from the exchange listing the new fund\u2019s shares, rather than the sponsor itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter,\u201d said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein in a Monday statement.\n\nGrayscale did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAs with its Bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is the largest Ethereum investment vehicle worldwide, comprising 2.5% of all circulating ETH.\n\nSince launching in 2019, conversion into a spot ETF has always been the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of its intended lifecycle, per the press release.\n\nRight now, ETHE shares trade at a whopping 30% discount to the underlying ETH held by the fund. Whereas the total value of the fund\u2019s ETH holdings amount to $5.14 billion at writing time, its shares total to just $3.6 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder an ETF structure, ETHE shares would be directly redeemable for the underlying ETH. This would likely bring the firm\u2019s net asset value and share value to parity.\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares for ETHE spiked 6.15% on the day.\n\nGrayscale turns from Bitcoin to Ethereum\n\nThus far, the company\u2019s long battle to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF is yet to bear fruit.\n\nHowever, a major court victory over the SEC in August boosted confidence among both Grayscale and its rivals that the agency may have no choice but to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF to list on U.S. markets. The court found that the SEC was being \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d toward Grayscale in denying its spot Bitcoin ETF application while permitting alternative futures Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSince then, GBTC\u2019s share discount has narrowed from 25% to 20%.\n\nGrayscale was one of many firms to file for a futures Ethereum ETF last month, which is backed by cash-settled futures contracts rather than actual ETH.\n\nA futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a given financial asset at a later date at a pre-determined price, effectively making them speculations on an asset\u2019s price trajectory."

        "title": "6 Reasons Why Ethereum Is The Best Blockchain For Gaming - Smartereum",
        "content": "Ethereum is the most popular blockchain used by developers creating decentralized apps (dApps). According to DappRadar, there are nearly 700 different games currently running on Ethereum, suggesting that creators prefer the Ethereum blockchain to other options.\n\nCryptoKitties, Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and The Sandbox are some of the world\u2019s most popular blockchain games running on the Ethereum network. These games achieved impressive figures at their respective peaks, becoming so popular that they congested the Ethereum network. For instance, the most expensive CryptoKitty, Dragon, sold for 600 ETH, about $170,000 at the time. CryptoKitties also accounted for over 12% of all Ethereum transactions in December 2017. For Axie Infinity, the game\u2019s publisher had to increase the transaction fee to 5.25% from 4.25%, in response to heavy demand from players.\n\nEven though there are hundreds of games on the Ethereum blockchain, many more developers are still deploying projects on the blockchain. The following are the most common reasons developers prefer Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum network supports smart contracts, which are essential tools for blockchain games. These contracts self-execute depending on specific conditions and according to predetermined rules. The self-execution takes a lot of worry off developers, allowing them to design complex games and run them smoothly for their audiences. For instance, developers can use smart contracts to ensure that a game\u2019s reward system incentivizes players as soon as they qualify. Using smart contracts also helps to verify ownership of in-game assets for easy acquisition or exchange.\n\nFlexibility\n\nEthereum\u2019s flexibility enables developers to create games tailored to specific audiences. It also allows game companies to add exciting features to their titles and update them for better gameplay, or to address feedback from the gaming community.\n\nFurthermore, flexibility helps developers modify their games to support Ether tokens, as well as any other assets compatible with Ethereum. In addition to blockchain games, online casinos enjoy this flexibility as they allow their customers to make gambling deposits using Ether tokens. Ethereum casinos are user-friendly, offer attractive bonuses, and ensure anonymity on public platforms.\n\nUsers often only need an email address to open an account. Players can create accounts and immediately begin making deposits and withdrawals, skipping most of the cumbersome steps typically required by other platforms (source: https://cryptonews.com/news/best-ethereum-casinos.htm).\n\nCommunity Support\n\nDevelopers creating titles on the Ethereum blockchain have access to an active community of creators from regions all over the world. This community helps new developers to easily connect with others and find solutions to major problems. The support also creates an opportunity for experienced developers to bounce ideas off each other or mentor newbies. Through community support, developers can get all the coding and testing assistance needed to develop the most engaging and profitable titles.\n\nScalability\n\nMany blockchain platforms have scalability issues that make it challenging to handle many gamers running simultaneous transactions. This can be detrimental for games that achieve global success and attract many players. Fortunately, Ethereum can handle thousands of transactions through several solutions on the network, including sharding. This solution basically splits the network into smaller parts for easy management and transaction processing. In addition to sharding, there are several layer-2 networks and sidechains that solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability problems, making the blockchain one of the most suitable networks for gaming.\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nMany Ethereum games are affordable because of the network\u2019s low transaction fees. Players who want to enjoy their favorite titles can buy in-game assets or trade NFTs without worrying about losing money on transactions. This is an advantage directly tied to scalability because solutions that allow the network to quickly handle a large number of transactions also keep fees low since transaction processing is easier. Another advantage of low transaction fees is the cost-effectiveness for new developers who may not have the resources to invest heavily in their projects.\n\nInteroperability\n\nEthereum\u2019s interoperability allows several blockchains to communicate easily. Interoperability enables different games to combine resources across chains so players can enjoy more exciting in-game options. Ethereum interoperability standards, including ERC-20 and ERC-721, help developers define rules for creating and issuing tokens, and promote collaboration between gaming projects. In addition, these standards help compatible wallets connect with multiple games such that a player can integrate any existing wallet and fund gaming accounts to purchase assets or NFTs."

        "title": "Investing in Cryptocurrency ETFs: Bitcoin Futures vs. Ether Futures - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin and ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enable retail and other investors exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding them. These ETFs offer shares in baskets of either Bitcoin or ether futures contracts.\n\nInvestors can buy shares of these ETFs on traditional stock exchanges\u2014a regulated and convenient, though indirect, way to speculate on the price moves of these cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs deliver exposure to the price of these cryptocurrencies by holding futures contracts that track their currency price.\n\nKey differences between Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs include the underlying blockchain technology, the specific purposes of each cryptocurrency, and the amount of liquidity.\n\nSeveral advantages of Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs include their accessibility, their place in regulation markets, portfolio diversification, and institutional adoption.\n\nKey disadvantages of Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs include their reliance on futures contracts, tracking errors, increased volatility, and lower liquidity.\n\nBitcoin and ether futures ETFs are different from spot ETFs, which directly own the underlying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ETFs derive their value from the performance of bitcoin and ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and investors can have a stake in their price direction without holding the physical assets. These ETFs offer a more familiar investment product for traditional market participants.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Futures ETFs?\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs seek to track the performance of Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the CME. Importantly, the fund does not hold bitcoins. The ETFs enable investors to speculate on Bitcoin\u2019s future price moves without directly owning the cryptocurrency.\n\nUnlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold the asset, futures-based ETFs use contracts where investors agree to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price in the future. This introduces an element of leverage and risk, as gains or losses are magnified based on the price trends of the underlying futures contracts.\n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF to gain regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) on Oct. 15, 2021.\n\nBelow are the three largest bitcoin futures ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM).\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nPerformance over one year: 81.03% (as of Jan. 18, 2024)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.95%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 8.79%\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 19,448,875\n\nAUM: $1.85 billion\n\nInception date: Oct. 18, 2021\n\nIssuer: ProShares\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF)\n\nPerformance over one year: 77.3% (as of Jan. 18, 2024)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.66%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 0.18%\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 39,940\n\nAUM: $50.94 million\n\nInception date: Nov. 15, 2021\n\nIssuer: VanEck\n\nSimplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI)\n\nPerformance over one year: 86.3%\n\nExpense ratio: 11.18%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 273%\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 16,645\n\nAUM: $33.4 million\n\nInception date: Sept. 29, 2022\n\nIssuer: Simplify\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 bitcoin spot ETFs in January, 2024. Unlike futures ETFs, these funds invest directly in the underlying cryptocurrency. As of Jan. 2024, the SEC has yet to approve an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nWhat Are Ether Futures ETFs?\n\nEther futures ETFs are structured like Bitcoin futures ETFs: They both aim to track the performance of cryptocurrency futures contracts traded on the CME, not the underlying asset. Ether funds enable investors to speculate on ether\u2019s price fluctuations without directly owning the digital asset.\n\nLike Bitcoin futures ETFs, ether futures ETFs involve agreements to buy or sell ether futures contracts at a predetermined price in the future, which may magnify profits or losses. Ether futures ETFs furnish a regulated means for investors to gain exposure to ether without the hassles or expense of storing the cryptocurrency securely.\n\nBelow are the three largest ether futures ETFs in terms of AUM.\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT)\n\nPerformance over one year: N/A\n\nExpense ratio: 0.66%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: N/A\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 19,111\n\nAUM: $19.1 million\n\nInception date: Oct. 2, 2023\n\nIssuer: VanEck\n\nProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH)\n\nPerformance over one year: N/A\n\nExpense ratio: 0.95%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: N/A\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 48,094\n\nAUM: $24.9 million\n\nInception date: Oct. 2, 2023\n\nIssuer: ProShares\n\nBitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH)\n\nPerformance over one year: N/A\n\nExpense ratio: 0.85%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: N/A\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 5,248\n\nAUM: $4.3 million\n\nInception date: Sept. 29, 2023\n\nIssuer: Bitwise Asset Management\n\n\n\nWhat Are the Key Differences Between Bitcoin Futures ETFs and Ether Futures ETFs?\n\nBitcoin and ether futures ETFs enable investors to have an indirect stake in digital assets through futures contracts. However, they differ in terms of their underlying assets and blockchain networks. Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while ether futures ETFs are tied to Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether.\n\nEach varies in terms of its underlying blockchain technology and purpose. Bitcoin serves primarily as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, while Ethereum is a versatile blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nAdditionally, the ETFs differ in risk and volatility because of their distinct characteristics. Bitcoin, often considered a digital kind of gold and a hedge against inflation, tends to attract different investor sentiment from ether, which is essential for the Ethereum network\u2019s functionality. From a trading standpoint, Bitcoin futures ETFs turn over substantially more volume than ether futures ETFs, given Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance. Liquidity beyond the top-ranked fund for each decreases substantially, which raises the risk of slippage.\n\n\n\nEther futures ETFs posted trading volumes of less than $2 million on their first day of trading in October 2023. By comparison, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF registered inflows of about $570 million on its first day of trading in October 2021.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bitcoin Futures ETFs\n\nAdvantages\n\nRegulatory compliance : Bitcoin futures ETFs are offered within the regulatory frameworks of their markets, making them more palatable to institutional investors.

Factors such as contract expiration, rollover procedures, and the potential for leverage are among those to keep front of mind. Tracking errors: Bitcoin futures ETFs may face tracking errors, which occur when the fund\u2019s share values deviate from the spot price of Bitcoin because of fees or an imperfect replication of futures contracts. For instance, if the ETF sets out to mirror a 2% daily return on Bitcoin, it may only achieve a 1.5% return when considering these discrepancies.\n\nAdvantages Regulatory compliance\n\nDiversification\n\nAccessibility\n\nLower operational risks\n\nInstitutional adoption Disadvantages Price volatility\n\nUse of futures contracts\n\nTracking errors\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Ether ETFs\n\nAdvantages\n\nRegulatory compliance : Ether futures ETFs are offered within the regulatory frameworks of their markets, making them more palatable to institutional investors.\n\n: Ether futures ETFs are offered within the regulatory frameworks of their markets, making them more palatable to institutional investors.

Institutional adoption: Ether futures ETFs make it easier for institutional investors to obtain stakes in futures that track Ethereum, potentially encouraging wider participation and adoption. These investors, often risk-averse, typically prefer traditional financial products such as ETFs.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nLess liquidity : Since ether futures ETFs launched in October 2023, they have had far less trading volume than their Bitcoin counterparts. Not only did these ETFs debut later than Bitcoin futures ETFs, but they also were listed during a cryptocurrency bear market, making it more difficult to attract investor inflows. Lower liquidity can hinder the ease of buying and selling ETF shares, potentially leading to higher bid-ask spreads and increased price slippage.\n\n: Since ether futures ETFs launched in October 2023, they have had far less trading volume than their Bitcoin counterparts.

Liquidity can vary significantly between these two types of ETFs. Bitcoin has been around longer and has broader market adoption. Thus, it has had higher liquidity. Since their debut in October 2023, trading for ether futures ETFs has been far more muted than those for Bitcoin.\n\nWhere Can Investors Acquire Ether and Bitcoin Directly? You have many avenues for buying Bitcoins and ether. Platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance are well-known choices for purchasing them, and you can do so via bank transfers, credit cards, or other cryptocurrencies. You can also seek out decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap or SushiSwap for peer-to-peer trading of ether.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency? Crypto is a digital form of currency that deploys cryptography to produce secure financial transactions and control the supply of new tokens. Traditional currencies, like the U.S. dollar and the euro, are issued by governments or central banks, but cryptocurrencies operate on a technology called blockchain, which is a decentralized network spread among different networks and systems. Bitcoin, created in 2009, is still the best-known cryptocurrency, but thousands of others exist, including ether. Cryptocurrencies, like their government-issued counterparts, are a medium of exchange with vast uses, including buying goods and services, transferring money within and across borders, smart contracts, and further applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nHow Does Futures Contract Expiry Impact Ether Futures ETFs and Bitcoin Futures ETFs? Both kinds of ETFs need to manage the rollover of their futures contracts, which occurs when expiring futures contracts are replaced with others with later expiry dates. However, the ether market is less mature and has less trading volume than Bitcoin futures ETFs. Thus, the process of rolling over ether futures contracts could involve higher costs, affecting the ETFs\u2019 performance.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin and ether futures ETFs enable investors with regulated exposure to cryptocurrency markets by holding futures contracts that set out to track the underlying assets. They are structured as traditional ETFs, providing a familiar investment product for those who want to speculate on the price fluctuations of Bitcoin and ether without having to own and store them.\n\nThe ETFs for each cryptocurrency may differ in risk, volatility, and returns because of their distinct characteristics. Before investing in either, you should consider the funds\u2019 specific market changes to ensure they meet your risk profile and investment goals.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Explores Ethereum Staking Changes \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nSource: a video screenshot, ETHWORLD / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently shared his thoughts on potential changes to Ethereum\u2019s staking system.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin discussed various protocols, including ERC-4337, ZK-EVMs, private mempools, code precompiles, and liquid staking, and explored the trade-offs associated with incorporating them into Ethereum\u2019s code.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind said the goal behind the article was to \u201cstart to build toward a framework for better identifying possible targets where enshrining certain features in the protocol might be worth considering.\u201d\n\nButerin expressed a stronger inclination towards incorporating certain protocols into Ethereum\u2019s code, such as ERC-4337, while being more cautious about others, like private mempools.\n\nERC-4337 is a token standard co-authored by Buterin, Kristof Gazso, Dror Tirosh, Tjaden Hess, Yoav Weiss and Shahaf Nacson that introduces account abstraction without changes to the underlying Ethereum protocol.\n\nMeanwhile, private mempols, or \u201cencrypted mempools,\u201d keep users\u2019 transactions encrypted until the moment they get irreversibly accepted into a block.\n\nHe acknowledged that each of these protocols present complex trade-offs that will continue to evolve over time.\n\nButerin Expresses Concern About Staking Concentration\n\nOne specific concern that Buterin mentioned was the concentration of power among Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking providers.\n\nLido, a prominent liquid staking pool, currently controls over 32% of the staked ether on Ethereum, with holdings distributed across different validators.\n\nAlongside Rocket Pool, Lido is a significant player in the ecosystem, but Buterin highlighted the need for more robust safety mechanisms.\n\nButerin proposed exploring additional solutions to enhance the safety and decentralization of liquid staking.\n\nRather than relying solely on moralistic pressure to encourage stakeholders to diversify their choice of staking providers, he suggested tweaking the Ethereum protocol itself.\n\nThis could involve refining RocketPool\u2019s existing approach or granting enhanced governance rights to a randomly sampled committee of small stakeholders. These measures could contribute to a more decentralized and resilient Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs reported, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of Ethereum.\n\nThe rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.\n\nRocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit rule.\n\nHowever, Lido Finance has decided not to commit to the self-limit rule.\n\nBack in June, the project put forward a proposal to impose a limit on Lido\u2019s maximum stake.\n\nLess than one half of one percent of the votes cast were in favor of the self-limit rule, while those holding more than 99% of Lido\u2019s governance tokens, LDO, voted for the protocol to not hold back on its growth.\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest staking provider, holds only an 8.7% market share, according to data from Dune Analytics."

Uh Talk to us about how Van Eck plans to stand out amongst these nine firms. Absolutely. As it was alluded to all, we're all investing in Ethereum futures contracts. And so really the only ways you can differentiate yourself are obviously cost, which were coming in significantly lower than most of the others at 66 basis points. And then further to that is how you structure the ETF. So we structured our is AC Corp and we feel that's a superior uh tax advantage vehicle for taxable, long term investors. And really that comes down to uh the long term benefit of being able to carry forward and carry back your losses in, in a asset class like crypto, obviously, that can be instrumental for investors. Yeah, if you could explain that a little bit more about the C Corp, uh some of the other structures that, that are out there in the market today. Um And how that, that might benefit certain tax payers. That's right. So essentially Etfs, most etfs that we all know and love are structured as RS. And so the C Corp, the difference between the C CORP is there's one negative and that's taxes accrue, corporate taxes accrue at the fund level daily. And so you may see a NAV underperform in both periods, however, counter to that, you are afforded the ability to carry forward losses. And so in down years, in A R, all those losses are actually just lost. And so in AC Corp, you can carry those forward and offset your future gains. In addition to that, all distributions from A R are taxed at your ordinary income rates, which can be as high as 37%. And so with investors in the CC Corp, you're actually taxed at QDII rates which is about 20%. But you're, you, you're taxed twice, right? You're, you're basically, you're taxed on the C Corp level and then you're taxed on personal, in personal income level that doesn't, uh you, you, you, as you mentioned that the, the carry forward would basically accrue to the C Corp not to the individual, correct, but it accrues to the NAV. So that is in your performance of the fund. And so when, when taxes are offset in the future or even three years back to call back taxes and, and the investor realizes that through the NAV and, and, but that's, that's assuming they're gonna hold for, for extended periods of time. Correct. That's correct. And that's why this structure is really ideal for longer term taxable investors. Let's talk about one of the other differentiators that Cynthia brought up in the last segment. Van E also announced that it's going to donate 10% of all profits from the futures ETF to Ethereum core developers for 10 years. Talk about what went into making this decision and how it's gonna work. Yeah, I think Vanex sits at a really unique intersection of traditional Trad if you will firm uh founded in 1955 to uh a kind of a crypto native uh uh future looking form. And one of the benefits of having this talent uh is people that are working and using this emergent technology daily. And so we are aware of the work and uh the time that these developers spend to maintain this Blockchain that we all are using. And so it makes sense that we all stand to gain both Trad and crypto native that we should be supporting that community. And so it really was a no-brainer. So, so just to be sure though, uh is it, is this gonna be like the Hollywood bottom line where there's never a profit? Uh How is this, how is this gonna work in terms of uh you know, as you mentioned, it's the court and that if there are losses, those losses go, they can basically carry forward to the future of clawback in the past. So how would it work here in this situation? Is it annually, is it uh based on like how, how are you calculating such such profits and, and as a and as a shareholder? Why, why don't I just get the profits? Why, why not let me deal with it and and allocate it to developers the way I want to, why do I have to have you guys do it? Sure. Now to be clear, this is va sharing our profits from the fund with the community. This is not impacting the shareholders of the fund directly. And so we will work with the details with protocol guilt um to figure out the timing, but to be clear, we intend to be fully transparent with this donation. And so to the extent we can be transparent and show transactions online, we will do so. Of course, the these details need to be finalized with the protocol guilt and va so, so, so that's uh that's the profit you're making on, on the uh on the transactions. But let, let me ask about kind of what happens today. I and this is a question asked uh previously to our previous guest. What happens if these uh you and the the other eight or so that have been approved for today? What if it, if it's lackluster? What does that mean? God forbid, I know, you know, this everything's gonna be perfect and great. You can fingers cross the whole works. But the reality is this, the, the world is a different place than it was a couple of years ago. What happens if this is the lackluster uh release? What does it mean for spot ETF S? What does it mean for the overall crypto eco ecosystem? If this underperforms uh investments today? Sure. I, I think, you know, for one, you're right as you alluded to, it's a different market today than even when Bitcoin futures ETF S were launched. Um Certainly things were, were going much better in the crypto space. But I think regardless of the amount of asset managers launching these products, this is, this is a monumental step forward for crypto. And the reality is since 2017, we were one of the first established ef issuers to file for a Bitcoin linked TF. We have always followed that ethos of if you want crypto exposure, you should buy it directly in self custody it. If you can't, then the next best way is to buy that through an EF and so we think there are a lot of investors out there today that either can't or won't buy spot crypto. And this product is really for those, Kyle. Thank you very much for joining the show. This morning and congratulations on the lunch. Good luck. Thank you all for having me. That was head of digital assets product, Kyle de Cruz."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Explains How - NewsBTC",
        "content": "As the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has always dominated the headlines and drives the mainstream hype around cryptocurrencies. In terms of performance, it\u2019s no news Ethereum (ETH) has followed behind BTC in the past few years. However, according to crypto analyst Dave the Wave, Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nDave the Wave took to social media to share his views on the Ethereum/Bitcoin price action. The current trajectory shows Ethereum has been falling against Bitcoin in terms of performance since the beginning of the year.\n\nA more in-depth examination reveals that Ethereum has been following a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative of a continued downward trend. However, according to the pseudonymous crypto analyst, a larger timeframe presents a better view of the general situation of things.\n\n\u201cThe longer timeframe trumps the shorter, and helps to predict future price action, which is what speculation is all about, as opposed to simply describing recent past price action,\u201d he said.\n\nETH/ BTC Careful of [shorter-term] hindsight bias \u2013 it\u2019s a series of lower highs until it\u2019s not. The longer time-frame trumps the shorter\u2026. and helps to predict future price action, which is what speculation is all about, as opposed to simply describing recent past price\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kMrqN3istb \u2014 dave the wave\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf13 (@davthewave) September 29, 2023\n\nA closer look into a multi-year timeframe shows a falling wedge has been forming in the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair\u2019s performance since July of 2022. The current situation shows the formation of this wedge might be nearing its end which indicates a decrease in downside momentum and a potential trend reversal.\n\nThis possible reversal is reiterated by the Fibonacci indicator, which shows the downward trend is at the 0.236 level.\n\nCan Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum has frequently outperformed Bitcoin for periods stretching months at a time. The ecosystem also has a few key advantages over BTX that could help it outperform in the coming years.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin still reigns as the top cryptocurrency, Ethereum seems poised to gain more mainstream traction in the coming years. As more projects and blockchains are built and connected to the Ethereum network, we could see Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of performance as early as next year.\n\nBTC Remains The Primary Vehicle For Wealth Creation\n\nBitcoin still remains the primary vehicle for building wealth in both the crypto and traditional markets. According to Dave The Wave, Bitcoin is poised to continue on this trajectory for the next few years before becoming fully capitalized and on the same level as traditional markets. The analyst makes this prediction by sharing a logarithmic growth curve chart showing BTC still has a higher chance for growth in the longer term.\n\nBTC chart for growth | Source: X\n\nBitcoin, in particular, has led the crypto markets in gains for the past week. Meanwhile, Ethereum has also recorded gains of 9.82% in a 7-day timeframe and is currently trading at $1,730. However, Ethereum faces a resistance at $1,750 which could force a downside correction.\n\nETH price looks strong above $1,700 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from StealthEX, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Grayscale has moved to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn an Oct. 2 statement, the crypto asset investment product said the New York Stock Exchange Arca filed Form 19b-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Ether Trust into a spot ETF.\n\nThe filing is coming on the heels of the SEC\u2019s approval of several Ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the move further indicated the firm\u2019s \u201cunwavering commitment to offering investors transparent and regulated access to crypto through product structures that are familiar.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter.\u201d\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust was launched in March 2019 and has grown to become one of the largest Ether investment vehicles in the world. Per its website, the assets under management of the fund sit at approximately $5 billion, representing 2.5% of all Ether in circulation.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale recently scored a landmark victory over the SEC due to the regulator\u2019s reluctance to approve the transition of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.\n\nETHE discount\n\nLike GBTC, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE trades at a significant discount to the net asset value (NAV), currently around 31%, according to Coinglass data.\n\nThe ETHE discount peaked near 60% in January and has mostly stayed around 40-50% for most of the year. However, the metric began a significant descent after BlackRock submitted its application for a Bitcoin spot ETF in June. The decline continued, reaching its lowest level in a year, following Ark Invest\u2019s application for an Ethereum spot ETF in early September.\n\nCurrently, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE configuration does not support redemptions, a factor contributing to its trading discount. However, the proposed transition from a trust to an ETF, which inherently allows share redemptions, could potentially eliminate this discount."

        "content": "Is ERC20 Ethereum? Exploring the Fungible Tokens and NFTs\n\nBlockchain technology has revolutionized the digital landscape by introducing decentralized networks and enabling peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in this field is the creation of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens come in various forms, including fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIn this article, we will explore the ERC-20 token standard, answer \u201cIs ERC20 Ethereum?\u201d, and the role in the proliferation of tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso read: US Excess Savings Depleted, Will it Impact Stocks And Crypto?\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nUnderstanding Fungible Tokens\n\nWhat are Fungible Tokens?\n\nFungible tokens are digital assets that are interchangeable with one another. In other words, each token is identical in value and can be exchanged one-to-one.\n\nThis interchangeability makes fungible tokens convenient for various use cases, such as digital currencies, loyalty points, etc.\n\nIs ERC20 Ethereum?\n\nThe ERC-20 Token Standard\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 stands for \u201cEthereum Request for Comments 20,\u201d and Fabian Vogelsteller proposed it in November 2015.\n\nThis standard defines a set of rules and functions that tokens on the Ethereum network should adhere to. It allows developers to create interoperable tokens with other products and services built on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso read: GTA 6: Interesting Points About the Use of Crypto In-Game\n\nKey Functionalities of ERC-20 Tokens\n\nERC-20 tokens provide several functionalities that make them highly versatile and widely adopted. These include:\n\nToken Transfer: ERC-20 tokens allow users to transfer tokens from one account to another. This functionality enables peer-to-peer transactions and facilitates the seamless exchange of value. Token Balance: Users can quickly check the current token balance of an account. This feature provides transparency and allows individuals to keep track of their token holdings. Total Token Supply: ERC-20 tokens allow users to retrieve the total supply of a particular token available on the network. This information is crucial for various applications, including market analysis and portfolio management. Token Approval: ERC-20 tokens include a function that allows token owners to approve the spending of their tokens by third-party accounts. This feature is essential for applications that require permissioned access to tokens.\n\nBy adhering to the ERC-20 standard, developers can create tokens that seamlessly integrate with wallets, exchanges, and other decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum network.\n\nExploring Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nWhile fungible tokens represent identical units of value, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.\n\nEach NFT has a distinct value and set of properties, making it one-of-a-kind.\n\nUse Cases for NFTs\n\nNFTs have gained significant popularity in recent years, primarily due to their ability to represent ownership and provenance of digital assets. Some common use cases for NFTs include:\n\nDigital Art: NFTs allow artists to tokenize their digital artwork, providing a secure and verifiable way to prove ownership and authenticity. Collectibles: NFTs enable the creation and trading of digital collectibles, such as virtual trading cards, in-game items, and virtual real estate. Virtual Worlds and Metaverses: NFTs play a crucial role in virtual worlds and metaverses, allowing users to own and trade unique digital assets within these immersive environments. Tokenized Real-World Assets: NFTs can represent ownership of real-world assets, such as real estate, luxury items, and intellectual property rights.\n\nERC-721: The Non-Fungible Token Standard\n\nWhile ERC-20 is the standard for fungible tokens, ERC-721 is the standard for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nERC-721 tokens provide a set of functions and events that allow developers to create, manage, and transfer unique digital assets.\n\nThis standard has facilitated the NFT market\u2019s growth and enabled the creation of various innovative applications.\n\nThe Role of Tokens in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nTokens and Ethereum\u2019s Native Currency, Ether (ETH)\n\nTokens created on the Ethereum network do not have their blockchain but instead rely on the Ethereum blockchain for security and transaction settlement.\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network and is often used as a means of exchange for tokens and as a gas fee to execute smart contracts.\n\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs)\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard significantly impacted the rise of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). ICOs allow startups and projects to raise funds by selling tokens to the public in exchange for ETH or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard provided a common framework for these token sales, making it easier for investors to participate and for projects to distribute tokens.\n\nTokenization of Real-World Assets\n\nOne of the most promising aspects of tokens on the Ethereum network is the ability to tokenize real-world assets.\n\nWith the help of smart contracts, developers can create compliant tokens that represent ownership of real estate, company shares, and other valuable assets.\n\nThis tokenization process can increase liquidity, fractional ownership, and easier transferability to traditionally illiquid assets.\n\nDeFi and Tokenized Finance\n\nTokens have also played a significant role in decentralized finance (DeFi) growth on the Ethereum network.\n\nDeFi applications leverage tokens to enable peer-to-peer lending, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and other financial services.\n\nThese tokenized financial instruments give users greater control over their assets and the ability to participate in a permissionless and open financial system.\n\nConclusion: Is ERC20 Ethereum?\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard and the emergence of NFTs have transformed the digital landscape, enabling the creation and exchange of fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nFungible tokens offer flexibility and interoperability for representing value. NFTs enable unique digital asset ownership and provenance.\n\nBoth types of tokens have opened up new possibilities for decentralized applications, financial services, digital art, and more.\n\nTokens will grow crucial in the evolving Ethereum ecosystem, enabling decentralized transactions across diverse industries.\n\nWhether it\u2019s creating a compliant token, participating in a decentralized finance protocol, or owning a unique piece of digital art, tokens have become an integral part of the decentralized revolution."

        "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Tim Draper Reflects On Bitcoin ETF As Grayscale Announces New Ethereum Fund - Nasdaq",
        "content": "A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF is looking very likely, with the world's leading crypto asset manager, Grayscale, as a possible front-runner to be approved by the SEC. In the meantime, Grayscale is lengthening its lead by applying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale will be speaking at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 14 in NYC.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust represents 2.5% of all ETH in circulation and is the largest ETH investment vehicle in the world. Grayscale stated that the ETHE trust has always been on the path to becoming an ETF. Currently, the Ethereum underlying the trust is discounted at 30%, but the ETH would be worth $5.14 billion at full market value.\n\nShares of ETHE spiked 6.15% in value following the announcement of the spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nTim Draper, a prominent investor and entrepreneur known for successful investments in companies such as Tesla, Skype, and Coinbase, gave Benzinga exclusive comments on the Grayscale spot BTC ETF application. To Draper, approval seems to be a matter of time: \"I am surprised it has taken so long. I'm not sure why the SEC approved futures and not spot trading. It seems capricious,\" Draper said.\n\nHe expects the availability of a spot Bitcoin ETF to encourage more adoption and investments in BTC.\n\n\"It will allow more people to participate in this new global, open, transparent, frictionless economy provided by Bitcoin and its blockchain. It will bring more light on the unbanked who can use Bitcoin to participate in the global economy,\" Draper said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's 'Fake Pump Seems Over:' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nOne month ago, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote a DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that favored Grayscale's application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more accessible Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Rao's opinion said, in part, \"The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nOther applicants for a spot BTC ETF include ARK Investment, BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity/Wise Origin, GlobalX, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck, and WisdomTree.\n\nInvestor, author, and Forbes contributor Clem Chambers said: \"It seems unlikely that there will be much of a gap between applicants if a BTC ETF is cleared\u2026 To me it's anyone's guess when it will be approved, but if the SEC had its way there will be no ETF unless they think it will be a negative for Bitcoin and crypto.\"\n\nThe legal victory in DC compels the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit the Grayscale application for a spot BTC ETF after rejecting it.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart welcomed the news by raising the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of 2023 and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin and its history.

According to CoinGecko data, the Bitcoin competitor is currently valued at a whopping $206 billion.\n\nThe ETF frenzy\n\nAdding fuel to Ethereum\u2019s momentum is the recent decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight Ethereum futures for inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nValkyrie Funds seized this opportunity, integrating Ethereum futures into its existing Bitcoin futures ETF. This development marks the first instance where Ethereum-based futures are accessible to investors through an ETF, potentially paving the way for enhanced market stability and investor confidence.\n\nSeveral other asset managers, including VanEck and ProShares, are also in the running to launch Ethereum futures ETFs."

        "content": "Leading Swiss bank UBS has launched a live pilot of a tokenized version of its variable capital company (VCC) fund as part of Project Guardian, an initiative led by Singapore\u2019s central bank.\n\nIn a press release, UBS Asset Management announced that the fund is part of a broader VCC umbrella designed to bring different types of real-world assets (RWA) to the blockchain. According to Thomas Kaegi, the head of UBS Asset Management for Singapore and Southeast Asia, the project is a milestone in understanding funds tokenization. Kaegi said:\n\n\u201cThrough this exploratory initiative, we will work with traditional financial institutions and fintech providers to help understand how to improve market liquidity and market access for clients.\u201d\n\nUBS Asset Management launched the controlled pilot of the tokenized money market fund through the company\u2019s in-house tokenization service called UBS Tokenize. Using a smart contract on Ethereum, the firm carried out various activities, including redemptions and fund subscriptions.\n\nThe pilot is also a part of the company\u2019s global distributed ledger technology strategy, which focuses on using private and public blockchains to enhance fund distribution and issuance.\n\nRelated: Singapore commits $112M to support fintech solutions like Web3\n\nThe new development realizes previous predictions on the tokenization of RWAs.

According to the executive, the tokenization of RWAs may catch on, as it presents significant opportunities for many industries.\n\nEarlier this year, protocols focusing on RWAs became a hot topic as they outperformed other subsectors of decentralized finance.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a devastating plunge in its price. After a promising surge, the asset is currently trading at $1,663.44, leaving investors and traders scratching their heads.\n\nThe market showed a surge in open interest, which is generally a sign of bullish behavior. Bulls seemed to be pushing the price of Ethereum upward, especially after its recent surge. However, this move appears to have been premature. The asset failed to establish any serious support levels, which are crucial for maintaining upward momentum.\n\nThe lack of strong support levels has made Ethereum vulnerable to a sharp reversal, which is what we are witnessing now. The asset had no cushion to fall back on, leading to a devastating plunge. This situation serves as a cautionary tale for traders to not solely rely on open interest as an indicator of bullish behavior. It is essential to consider other factors like support levels, volume and market sentiment before making investment decisions.\n\nSolana stays strong\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has recently experienced a substantial drop, with many assets losing up to 5% of their value in the last 24 hours. However, Solana (SOL) has managed to sidestep this fate, maintaining a relatively stable price. As of the latest data, Solana is trading at approximately $24.07, showing resilience in a bearish market.\n\nThe most plausible explanation for Solana's stability is the lack of bearish selling pressure. While other assets have been subjected to massive sell-offs, Solana has managed to move sideways, indicating that bears have been effectively sidelined.\n\nThis lack of bearish activity is particularly noteworthy given the asset's recent performance. Solana has been one of the standout cryptocurrencies of the year, and its ability to withstand market pressures suggests a strong underlying asset and community support.\n\nThe absence of a significant price drop on Solana could also be attributed to its increasing dominance over Ethereum in some use cases, which has likely contributed to its resilience. The asset has been gaining traction for its lower transaction fees and faster processing times, making it an attractive alternative to Ethereum for certain applications.\n\nPrice analysis indicates that Solana is holding its ground well. The asset has not shown any significant downward movement, and the trading volume suggests that there is still interest in holding rather than selling. This could be a strong signal for potential investors looking for assets that can withstand market volatility.\n\nCardano faces significant resistance\n\nAs of the most recent data, Cardano (ADA) is trading at approximately $0.2629. The asset is currently facing a significant resistance level at the 50 EMA, which has become a battleground for both bulls and bears. While the bulls are striving to push ADA's price above this critical level, the bears are equally determined to pull it back down.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing the overbought zone, indicating that the asset might be overvalued in the short term. This could lead to a potential pullback if the bulls fail to sustain the upward momentum. Additionally, trading volumes have not been particularly strong, further suggesting that the bulls are losing their grip on the market.\n\nThe ascending trend that ADA has been following recently is not gaining any substantial ground for growth. This lack of momentum is a concerning sign for those hoping for a bullish trend continuation. If ADA fails to break above the 50 EMA resistance level convincingly, we could see a reversal that might push the asset back to its local lows.\n\nGiven current market conditions, traders and investors should exercise caution and closely monitor ADA's price action around the 50 EMA level. A decisive break above or below this point could set the tone for ADA's price trajectory in the coming weeks."

The goal is to gain insights into how to enhance market liquidity and provide better market access for their clients.\n\nThe pilot is part of Project Guardian, the broader MAS-led VCC umbrella initiative, which aims to tokenize various real-world assets. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is the city-state's financial watchdog and central bank; Variable Captial Companies (VCC) are an alternative corporate structure to limited partnerships, trust structures and others.\n\nTokenization of real-world assets is the process of converting ownership or rights to physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis approach uses blockchain technology to transform tangible assets like real estate, artwork, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens that can be conveniently purchased, sold, and traded on a blockchain network.\n\nUBS joins tokenization wave\n\nThe financial regulator\u2019s previous efforts within the blockchain space included the exploration of potential decentralized finance (DeFi) applications in wholesale funding markets.\n\nTo that end, in November 2022, JP Morgan Onyx, DBS, and SBI Digital Asset conducted trials for foreign exchange transactions and government bond trades using modified public lending protocol Aave and the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nThe UBS Tokenize platform was also utilized in Hong Kong for the recent issuance of digital structured notes by Bank of China Investment (BOCI), amounting to CNH 200 million ($27.3 million). These tokenized notes were created and issued on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a similar development toward the end of the previous year, UBS launched the world\u2019s first publicly traded digital bond\u2014a 375 million Swiss franc-denominated three-year bond with a 2.33% coupon, which has the same instrument structure, legal status, and rating as a traditional UBS senior unsecured note.\n\nDespite its interest in blockchain technologies and allowing its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers has in the past ruled out actively offering trading, custody, or lending services related to \"alternative\" crypto assets, while also calling cryptocurrencies an \"untested asset category.\""

It also issued the tokenized notes on Ethereum. Late last year, UBS Wealth Management issued $50 million in blockchain debt securities. Investors included high net worth individuals in Hong Kong and Singapore via a private placement. In that case, it used a permissioned version of Ethereum.\n\nCloser to home, last year UBS issued its own CHF 375 million ($411m) bond via the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), a bond listed on both SDX and SIX, even though the bond is natively digital. This was possible because SDX linked its central security depositary (CSD) to the main SIX SIS CSD. The UBS bond is also possibly the largest digital bond issued so far.\n\nTalking about blockchain earlier this year, UBS Chair Colm Kelleher recently said, \u201cThe technology\u2019s unstoppable. Blockchain technology will reduce huge operational friction, reduce costs and, harnessed properly, will be a very good value additive to the chain.\u201d"

        "title": "VanEck Launches EFUT, the Only Ethereum Futures ETF Structured as a C-Corp. - Business Wire",
        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today launching the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (CBOE: EFUT), a unique new actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts. EFUT is the only ETF providing focused exposure to ETH futures that is structured as a C-Corp., potentially offering a more efficient tax experience for long-term investors. EFUT does not invest in ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\n\u201cEthereum is the layer 1 building block of the decentralized applications ecosystem, driving innovations in digital currencies, global payments, smart contracts and much more, with Ethereum as the platform\u2019s method of exchange. While investors still do not have the means to gain exposure to digital assets here in the U.S. via a spot ETF product, we\u2019re very pleased to be launching EFUT as a means to access the robust futures market that has developed around ETH itself,\u201d said Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Asset Product with VanEck.\n\nEFUT invests in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, the only ETH futures the Fund intends to invest in are those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nEFUT is actively managed by Greg Krenzer, Head of Active Trading for VanEck. Mr. Krenzer joined the firm in 1994 and has more than two decades of experience trading in a host of asset categories, including the futures space.\n\n\u201cExperience matters when selecting a fund manager, and VanEck has a long history of investing across global markets and through different market cycles. Our legacy of offering investors access to important new segments of the capital markets continues with the launch of EFUT,\u201d said Ed Lopez, Head of Product Management at VanEck. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to be bringing this new ETF to market and to be providing a key building block for a diversified digital assets portfolio for individuals and advisors.\u201d\n\nEFUT joins the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) in providing futures-focused exposure to key digital assets. Like EFUT, XBTF is also structured as a C-Corp. XBTF does not invest in BTC or other digital assets directly.\n\nVanEck will be posting updates on EFUT on X (formerly Twitter) at @vaneck_us and the firm is a prolific producer of research and insights on the digital assets space, which can be accessed here.\n\nAbout VanEck\n\nVanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm\u2019s drive to identify asset classes and trends \u2013 including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 \u2013 that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.\n\nToday, VanEck offers active and passive strategies with compelling exposures supported by well-designed investment processes. As of August 31, 2023, VanEck managed approximately $80.8B in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs and institutional accounts. The firm\u2019s capabilities range from core investment opportunities to more specialized exposures to enhance portfolio diversification. Our actively managed strategies are fueled by in-depth, bottom-up research and security selection from portfolio managers with direct experience in the sectors and regions in which they invest. Investability, liquidity, diversity, and transparency are key to the experienced decision-making around market and index selection underlying VanEck\u2019s passive strategies.\n\nSince our founding in 1955, putting our clients\u2019 interests first, in all market environments, has been at the heart of the firm\u2019s mission.\n\nImportant Disclosures\n\nThe value of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoion (BTC) and the Funds\u2019 Futures holdings, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment. The Funds do not invest in BTC, ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the digital asset networks may adversely affect the price of digital assets and therefore cause the Funds to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in digital assets or restrict the use of digital assets or the operations of the digital asset networks or venues on which digital assets trade in a manner that adversely affects the price of digital assets and, therefore, the Funds\u2019 digital asset Futures. Digital assets generally operate without central authority (such as a bank) and are not backed by any government, digital assets are not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of digital assets, and regulation in the United States is still developing.\n\nFutures Contract Risk. The use of futures contracts involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets. The market for digital asset Futures may be less developed, and potentially less liquid and more volatile, than more established futures markets. Digital asset Futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Funds\u2019 ability to achieve its target exposure. Margin requirements for digital asset Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) may be substantially higher than margin requirements for many other types of futures contracts. Futures contracts exhibit \u201cfutures basis,\u201d which refers to the difference between the current market value of the underlying digital asset (the \u201cspot\u201d price) and the price of the cash-settled futures contracts.\n\nThis risk may be adversely affected by \u201cnegative roll yields\u201d in \u201ccontango\u201d markets. The Funds will \u201croll\u201d out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract on a digital asset with a later expiration date. The \u201crolling\u201d feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Funds\u2019 performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the digital asset. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a \u201ccontango\u201d market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) may be subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, risks related to market and volatility, investment (in ETH futures), ETH and ETH futures, futures contract, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, credit, interest rate, liquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bond, ETH-related company, ETH-related concentration, and equity securities risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) may be subject to risks which include, among others market and volatility, investment, futures contract, derivatives, investments related to bitcoin and bitcoin futures, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, indirect investment, credit, interest rate, illiquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/asset-backed securities, and sovereign bond risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nInvesting involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing.

        "title": "Ether Futures ETFs Debut as Crypto Fever Reheats - ETF Trends",
        "content": "The first trading session of October 2023 also marks the launch of the very first U.S.-listed ETFs holding ether futures. Ether is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. Bitwise, ProShares, and Van Eck collectively rolled out a total of six funds that hold such futures. Additional similar funds from other issuers are in the works.\n\nVanEck started the latest Ethereum ETF frenzy with the announcement on Thursday that the launch of its VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) was imminent. That coincided with a flurry of re-filings for similar ETFs. But those funds are only the start. There are more such futures ETFs in registration, and more such physical ETFs are also in the pipeline.\n\nConcerned about the potential for a government shutdown (now averted), the SEC focused last week on cleaning up its backlog. It approved the launches of the ether futures ETFs. However, it pushed off the approval of the ARK 21 Shares spot bitcoin fund.\n\nThe Ethereum Wave Gets Rolling\n\nOn Monday, VanEck launched EFUT, which is largely differentiated by the fact that it is a C-Corp fund, a structure that conveys certain tax advantages. Bitwise launched two funds of its own, the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). Those funds respectively offer exposure to the performance of ether futures and to a 50/50 portfolio of bitcoin and ether futures. Both have expense ratios of 0.85%.\n\nProShares jumped into the pool with three funds. The ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) targets ether futures to capture the performance of the cryptocurrency. The ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE), like Bitwise\u2019s BTOP, offers exposure to a regularly rebalanced equal-weighted portfolio of bitcoin and ether futures. And the ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF (BETH) holds a similar blended portfolio that weights the two cryptocurrencies by their market capitalizations. All three have expense ratios of 0.95%.\n\nHowever, there are other funds yet to debut that will also hold such futures. The Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU), with a 1.15% expense ratio, and the Hashdex Ether Strategy ETF (EX), with an expense ratio of 0.98%, are both in the queue to launch.\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie has filed a supplement to its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) with the intention of adding ether futures to the fund\u2019s portfolio.\n\nSpot Ether Funds in the Queue\n\nWhile there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign that spot ether ETFs are any more likely to be approved than spot bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale is pushing to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF, just as it wants to do with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The NYSE recently filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC to that end, Grayscale announced Monday.\n\nAn appeals court recently rejected the SEC\u2019s reasoning in its refusal to approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the regulator can\u2019t present another argument against the approval going forward. Some see the approval of ether futures ETFs as a sign that spot cryptocurrency funds may also be nearing approval.\n\nAnd Invesco is looking to roll out the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, which does not yet have a ticker but will be structured as a 1933 Act fund and will actually hold the cryptocurrency. In other words, both Grayscale and Invesco are in a race to launch a spot Ethereum fund.\n\nARK and 21Shares have teamed up to file for the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, which would also provide exposure to spot ether. The SEC will issue a decision in January on the two firms\u2019 proposed ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, which would provide spot exposure to bitcoin."

The development comes more than a month after the US court granted Grayscale a victory over the SEC in the spot Bitcoin ETF lawsuit.\n\nGrayscale has filed Form 19b-4 with the US SEC along with NYSE Arca. Interestingly, the filing comes on the same day when the first Ethereum Futures ETF will hit the market. Speaking on the development, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cAt Grayscale, our unwavering commitment is to offer investors transparent and regulated access to crypto through product structures that are familiar. As we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter.\u201d\n\nGrayscale remains committed to overseeing each of its digital asset products through a structured four-phase lifecycle, ultimately culminating in the conversion to an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which was launched in March 2019, achieved a public listing in May 2019, and proactively transitioned into an SEC reporting company in October 2020. Today, it stands as the world\u2019s largest investment vehicle for Ethereum, managing assets valued at nearly $5 billion, equivalent to 2.5% of the total circulating Ether.\n\nWith shares trading in millions of dollars in daily volume, the product has garnered the support of over a quarter of a million American investor accounts. Grayscale Global Head of ETFs David LaValle said:\n\n\u201cThis filing is another important milestone as Grayscale continues to build its best-in-class ETF team, product suite, and capabilities \u2013 serving investors as a globally respected asset manager with unmatched crypto expertise. We are proud to partner with NYSE Arca on this filing and look forward to engaging with the SEC on next steps.\u201d\n\nWill Grayscale Filing Help ETH Price Rally?\n\nNote that Grayscale is not among the first to file for a spot Ethereum ETF. Last month in September, Ark Invest submitted a similar filing with the US SEC.\n\nEarlier today, the ETH price rallied to $1,750 levels amid excitement surrounding the futures ETF launch. However, the ETH price retraced partially and currently trading around $1,731 levels. For the ETH price rally to continue, it must break the resistance of $1,750. The next immediate target would be $1,800 and $2,00 further."

        "content": "The excitement surrounding Ethereum Futures ETFs launching for the first time in the U.S. didn\u2019t quite translate into dollars traded.\n\nNine new ETH futures exchange traded funds (ETFs) started trading for the first time in the U.S. on Oct. 2, but recorded just $2 million in total trading volume combined on the widely anticipated day one.\n\nInvestment firms ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares launched their ETH futures ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The funds track futures contracts tied to the value of ETH, five of which hold ETH futures exclusively, while the other four track BTC and ETH futures.\n\nUnprecedented day today with multiple ETFs all launching at same time. No clear winner has emerged, all of them were pretty average, lower than I would have predicted, but its a long run and remember, these hold futures (ETF investors much prefer physical to derivatives) https://t.co/fKGOv8T7pP \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2023\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the trading volumes were \u201cpretty average\u201d and lower than he would have predicted, but said that it was still too early to declare one issuer a winner.\n\nAfter day one, that fund would be Valkyrie\u2019s BTF, which tracks both BTC and ETH futures, and recorded $882,000 worth of trading volume on Monday. Coming in second was VanEck\u2019s EFUT which recorded $312,000 in trading volume.\n\nThe response to the Ethereum futures ETFs is also significantly lower than what was observed on the first trading day of the first Bitcoin futures ETF \u2013 ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) \u2013 which saw $1 billion in trading volume on its first day, marking the second-highest trading volume in ETF launch history.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that at the time of BITO\u2019s launch in 2021, Bitcoin was trading at more than $66,000. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are now trading far lower than their bull market prices \u2013 at the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $27,600 and Ethereum was trading at $1,660."

Will ETH regain its peak or plummet in the volatile crypto market?\n\nSummary:\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experiences notable price fluctuations, prompting varied expert predictions.\n\nAnalyst Ali Martinez warns of a potential drop to $1200, citing holder losses and weak buying support.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto forecasts a bullish future for ETH, especially in Q4 2023, backed by positive crypto developments.\n\nGareth Soloway predicted a possible decline to $650, though this did not materialize as of June 2023.\n\nTyler Winklevoss optimistically suggests Ethereum could skyrocket to a staggering $75,000 in the future.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has consistently held its ground as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market. With a staggering market capitalization of $200.68 Billion, it stands as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the blockchain industry, tailing only behind the renowned Bitcoin.\n\nThe asset, in the limelight of market speculation due to its market dominance, has witnessed a rollercoaster of price fluctuations, sparking various predictions from analysts across the globe.\n\nEthereum's journey began with a whitepaper in 2013, described by Vitalik Buterin. The subsequent year saw Buterin and his team secure $18.3 million in Bitcoin through an online public crowd sale, selling over 60 million Ether at $0.311 per unit during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The astounding annualized return on investment (ROI) since then has been over 270%, nearly quadrupling investments yearly since its inception in 2014.\n\nGiven Ethereum's historical relevance and impact on the crypto market\u2014dominating it by 18.36% according to CoinMarketCap data, analysts have ventured into predicting its future price movement, especially considering its peak trading at over $4800 in November 2021.\n\nETH Market dominance. Source\n\nAs of the time of writing, 1 ETH stands at $1666.90, prompting several future price speculations. Here\u2019s a look at some of the notable predictions from key individuals in the crypto space:\n\nAli Martinez: A Cautious Perspective\n\nAli Martinez, a notable analyst in the crypto space, expressed his concerns on September 6, when ETH fell below $1680.\n\nLabeling this price range as a \u201ccause for concern,\u201d Martinez warned of a potentially significant price correction to as low as $1200.\n\n#Ethereum below $1,680 is a cause for concern, as it may pave the way for a significant $ETH correction down to $1,200. pic.twitter.com/4XwoxGaofK \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) September 6, 2023\n\nHis predictions, rooted in data from blockchain analytics provider IntoTheBlock, highlighted a concerning number of ETH holders experiencing losses, particularly between the price range of $1,633 to $1,681.\n\nMartinez warned of Ethereum's vulnerability to time capitulation without near-future growth catalysts, potentially leading to a flash crash and a surge in unprofitable addresses among ETH holders.\n\nFast-track to the time of writing, ETH has yet to reach the $1200 level since September 6.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto: Bullish on the Horizon\n\nContrastingly, CrediBULL Crypto envisions a bullish future for ETH, anticipating a market pump in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nThis optimism is backed by positive developments in the crypto space, such as the ETH Futures ETF approval, which he confirmed in response to a user\u2019s post on X.\n\n\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf been saying this for months. \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) September 28, 2023\n\nCrediBULL has maintained a bullish stance on ETH despite acknowledging potential short-term bearishness.\n\nHe expects ETH to be one of the first altcoins to follow Bitcoin\u2019s lead should the latter asset witness a significant increase, stating, \u201cI am very bullish on ETH/USD and expect it to be one of the first alts that follows $BTC's lead to the upside.\u201d\n\nWhile I haven't commented on $ETH in a while because my focus right now is $BTC (as I expect it to lead), I think it's worth pointing out that on this latest dip we hit the HTF zone that I previously said would be a \"fantastic buy\" if we get there back in May- and my opinion on\u2026 https://t.co/I6g1Tl0Z8F pic.twitter.com/hMyZcskJQL \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) August 22, 2023\n\nGareth Soloway: A Cautious Optimist\n\nGareth Soloway, a master trader and analyst known for his accurate predictions, had suggested that ETH might plummet to as low as $650.\n\nDespite this, he remains a long-term believer in the asset. During a YouTube interview in December 2022, he highlighted that if ETH broke the $885 to $890 range in June 2023, it could potentially find no major support until dropping to about $650.\n\nHowever, as of June 2023, Ethereum did not reach these predicted levels.\n\nTyler Winklevoss: A Lofty Prediction\n\nTyler Winklevoss, a prominent American investor and founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, presented a highly optimistic future for Ethereum, predicting it could soar as high as $75,000, according to the Altcoin Daily\u2019s calculation during an interview.\n\nIn the 2020 YouTube interview, he likened Ethereum to \u201cdigital oil\u201d and suggested its potential for significant future growth.\n\nNavigating Through the Predictions\n\nThe future of Ethereum, as seen, is painted with several ideologies by different analysts. From cautious perspectives foreseeing potential crashes to optimistic outlooks predicting bullish runs, the predictions are as varied as they are numerous. With its inherent volatility, the crypto market makes any prediction subject to numerous variables and uncertainties.\n\nInvestors and spectators alike must approach these predictions with a discerning eye, understanding that while expert opinions provide insightful perspectives, the cryptocurrency market remains notoriously difficult to predict accurately. Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions in the ever-fluctuating world of cryptocurrency."

The big win likely encouraged Grayscale to make the same move with Ethereum. The approval of a spot crypto ETF would mark a pivotal development for both investors and the wider cryptocurrency sector.\n\nEther ETF race\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Invesco and Galaxy Digital recently entered the Ethereum spot ETF arena despite looming uncertainties regarding governmental and SEC delays. They added their applications to a growing list of other asset management entities like VanEck and Ark Invest.\n\nLast month, Grayscale also expressed its intent to launch a futures-based Ether ETF. Grayscale will not have to hold the actual cryptocurrency but will invest in contracts that track its price, making it a simpler and more regulated way for people to get into crypto investing. This move is part of Grayscale's larger plan to offer more regulated investment options."

This is because the blockchain has successfully finalized at least one substantial development each year over the last few years.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nNow, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested that more could be achieved on the blockchain through increased experimentation.\n\nVitalik proposes a call for an on-chain increase\n\nOn 30 September, Buterin posted on his blog and titled the article \u201cShould Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?\u201d About six months ago, Buterin had also posted extensively about the viability.\n\nAccording to the new blog post, Buterin disclosed that account abstraction and scaling implemented now were two areas the blockchain had in mind to improve as far back as 2015.\n\nFor context, account abstraction is the process of making it easier for users to interact with blockchain by customizing elements of smart contract accounts, from fee payments to transaction approval mechanisms.\n\nOn the other hand, the main goal of scaling is to improve transaction speed, and transaction throughput without affecting Ethereum\u2019s security or decentralization.\n\nButerin also noted that the Ethereum protocol could enshrine more features. But this would require bringing back some attributes.\n\nFirst off, it could be necessary to bring back ERC-4337. Authored by Buterin himself, alongside five other developers, the ERC-4337 was the token standard that introduced account abstraction.\n\nThe return of the standard could help with censorship resistance, gas efficiency, and support for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) opcodes.\n\nButerin further highlighted that,\n\n\u201cFully functional ERC-4337 wallets are big. This implementation, compiled and put on-chain, takes up ~12,800 bytes.\u201d\n\nZK for storage\n\nAnother aspect Buterin touched upon was the ZK- EVMs. ERC-4337 comes into play in this regard too, but the focus here is more on scaling than account abstraction. According to him, the ZK protocol feature could help with Ethereum\u2019s multi-client philosophy.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the project could face a challenge enshrining this part. This is because of the limited data the Ethereum blockchain can store. But he also mentioned that ZK-EVMs can compress more data.\n\nButerin wrote:\n\n\u201cZK-EVMs are much more data-efficient if they do not have to carry \u201cwitness\u201d data. That is, if a particular piece of data was already read or written in some previous block, we can simply assume that provers have access to it, and we don\u2019t have to make it available again.\u201d\n\nIn other parts of the blog post, he also mentioned how liquid staking could encourage ecosystem participation, particularly on Lido Finance [LDO] and Rocket Pool [RPL]."

The new system is currently deployed to the Optimism Goerli network.\n\nOptimism Goerli block explorer. Source: Etherscan\n\nCurrently, OP Stack-based networks use centralized sequencers to bundle transactions and submit them to Ethereum. Users cannot submit fraud proofs to block the sequencer if it submits incorrect data, creating the possibility of fraudulent transactions being confirmed if an attacker can control it.

Otherwise, they\u2019re not truly decentralized.\n\nIn November 2022, Buterin claimed that some rollups could have \u201ctraining wheels\u201d that keep them temporarily centralized while they work on a fraud-proof system but argued that they should work toward decentralization.\n\nOP Labs claims the new fault-proof system will help fulfill the goal of decentralization for OP Stack networks: \u201cThe system is designed to eventually enable secure bridging without central fallback.\u201d\n\nRelated: BNB Smart Chain Optimism-powered layer-2 opBNB hits mainnet\n\nIn addition, it claimed the new system is modular, allowing each network to develop its own system for preventing fraud. It consists of three separate components: a fault-proof program (FPP), a fault-proof virtual machine (FPVM) and a \u201cdispute game protocol.\u201d Because these three components can be implemented separately, it opens up the possibility for each network to \u201ccustom-build a fault proof system.\u201d\n\nAccording to the post, this will create more diversity in the Optimism Superchain, ultimately making the whole ecosystem more secure. A network could even decide to use zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) as a type of fraud-proof, the team stated. ZK-proofs are generally utilized in zero-knowledge rollups, but not Optimistic ones.\n\nOP Labs has been trying to build an interconnected web of blockchain networks called the \u201cSuperchain.\u201d To accomplish this, it created the OP Stack, a set of software tools that can be used to create custom blockchain networks. Avail network has created \u201cOpEVM\u201d software designed to accomplish the same objective while using Avail as the base layer instead of Ethereum. Polygon\u2019s ZK Supernets and zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine Hyperchain are other examples of Superchain competitors.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "Bitcoin, BTC/USD, Ethereum, ETH/USD - Price Action:\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have cleared above minor resistance.\n\nImportant for BTC/ USD and ETH/USD to sustain gains if the rebound is for real.\n\nWhat is the outlook and what are the key levels to watch?\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Get Your Free Top Trading Opportunities Forecast Get My Guide\n\nBITCOIN: Takes on vital resistance\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise to a minor resistance at the mid-September high of 27500 raises the odds that the two-month-long decline could be over. This follows a hold above strong support at the June low of 24750, which has kept intact the higher-top-higher-bottom formation since the end of 2022. Importantly, this keeps alive the possibility of a further recovery given the sharp 2021-2022 decline.\n\nBTC/USD is now testing a key ceiling at the end-August high of 28150, coinciding with the 200-day moving average. A decisive break above could clear the path toward the July high of 31800, which could be a defining moment for Bitcoin. Any break above would not only trigger a double bottom but would reinforce the bullish medium-term trajectory, first highlighted earlier this year \u2013 see \u201cBitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC/USD Turns Bullish\u201d, published January 18.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe potential price objective of the double bottom pattern (the June and the September lows) works out to around 39000. Such a move would imply a break above the 89-week moving average and a cross above the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts \u2013 for the first time since 2022. For the bullish view to unfold, BTC/USD needs to stay above the June low of 24750.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nETHEREUM: Beginning to flex muscles\n\nEthereum\u2019s break above the mid-September high of 1670 appears to have reduced immediate downside risks. This follows a hold above a crucial floor at the August low of 1535, not too far from the lower edge of a declining channel since early 2023.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nETH/USD is now testing a fairly strong resistance area. This includes the end-August high of 1745, the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, and the 200-day moving average. Ethereum needs to break above 1745-1805 for the medium-term recovery trajectory to play out. So far, ETH/USD has been holding above significant long-term support on the 200-week moving average \u2013 despite the weakness since 2021, ETH/USD hasn\u2019t decisively fallen below the average.\n\nIf this morning\u2019s rebound is indeed a turning point for cryptocurrencies, ETH/USD needs to hold above the stiff support at 1450-1550.\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Top Trading Lessons Get My Guide\n\n--- Written by Manish Jaradi, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\n--- Contact and follow Jaradi on Twitter: @JaradiManish"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe crypto market has experienced a relatively underwhelming couple of months, with Bitcoin stuck between $25-$32K since March. While many other top cryptos have followed a similar path, Launchpad XYZ\u2019s Telegram signals group has been on a tear. It has made numerous 10-30x trading calls and protected its community from market dips.\n\nIts profitable calls have been widely celebrated, yet the most lucrative trade may be buying its native token, $LPX, currently in presale.\n\nLaunchpad XYZ Telegram Group Warns of Upcoming Ethereum Crash\n\nAlthough the Launchpad XYZ platform is renowned for its profitable calls on emerging cryptos, its analytics tools also warn investors of impending market risk.\n\nA recent Launchpad XYZ Telegram community update warned that Ethereum\u2019s price could be about to crash. The analytics platform leverages several cutting-edge tools to forecast the market\u2019s next move, then prompts Telegram members with signals to help boost their profitability.\n\nFollowing its recent call, investors could short or sell Ethereum, helping protect from losses and even profit.\n\nAnother notable call the team made was a buy signal for a meme coin called ELON 2.0. Following the signal, the token rocketed in price, netting some investors a 29x profit.\n\nIt also made early calls on ECHOES and WAGIEBOT, which pumped 10x and 11x, respectively.\n\nThere are endless examples of Launchpad XYZ making such calls. The community can attest to this in its trading success room on its presale Telegram channel.\n\nOne of the exciting things about Launchpad XYZ is that users can buy a lifetime membership for a low fee.\n\nThe project is currently in its presale, and those who buy $50 worth of $LPX get a free NFT and lifetime access to the signals group. In comparison, many other signal providers charge over $50 monthly, with much less proven success.\n\nAnother benefit to the $LPX token is that it holds notable upside potential since it powers the Launchpad XYZ ecosystem. Users require it to pay for pioneering tools like an AI trading assistant, a trading terminal, decision-making frameworks, a learning platform, and much more.\n\nThe platform is one of the best ways for users to find new emerging projects before they explode. This provides significant demand for the $LPX token, potentially bolstering its price.\n\nVisit Launchpad XYZ\n\nBesides the $LPX token, three other promising cryptos to buy now are Bitcoin Minetrix, Meme Kombat, and TG Casino.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Lets Users Easily Mine Bitcoin By Staking on Ethereum\n\nAlthough the broader crypto market looks bleak, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies, boasting a groundbreaking use case that has captured the attention of investors and prominent analysts.\n\nThe project facilitates Bitcoin cloud mining, with users simply staking the $BTCMTX token on its Ethereum-based protocol. Essentially, users stake $BTCMTX, receive cloud mining credits, and burn them in exchange for Bitcoin cloud mining power, resulting in free Bitcoin.\n\nAs well as that, presale investors can earn free $BTCMTX tokens right away by selecting the \u201cBuy and Stake\u201d option when purchasing the presale.\n\nIts compelling use case provides a no-fuss, no-expertise-needed way for anyone to begin mining Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Also, incorporating the decentralized $BTCMTX token solidifies the project\u2019s transparency and security, eliminating the risk of cloud mining scams, which are common in the industry.\n\nTop analysts have weighed in with their predictions for the project. YouTuber Jacob Bury called it the next 10x potential presale, noting that it mines Bitcoin for you as its main advantage.\n\nSince users require $BTCMTX to begin earning Bitcoin, this provides massive demand potential, which translates to upside potential. Furthermore, staking bolsters its supply-side tokenomics since most tokens will be locked in the platform\u2019s smart contract.\n\nAs such, investors looking to buy the Bitcoin Minetrix token for a low price should not wait, as it could explode once it goes live on exchanges.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nP2E Staking Coin Meme Kombat Lets Users Wager on Meme Character Battles and Offers 112% Staking APY\n\nAnother project illustrating massive upside potential is Meme Kombat ($MK). With the fall of Pepe and other top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, there is a gap in the market for the next meme coin king.\n\nMeme Kombat wants to fight for the crown, hoping to win over investors with added utility and generous community rewards.\n\nThe project blurs the line between P2E and meme coins, enabling users to wager $MK on battles between meme characters. There are numerous game modes, including player vs. player and multiple player vs. game options. It leverages traditional odds mechanics to provide fair and engaging gambling.\n\nIts other core feature is its staking mechanism, offering a fixed 112% annual percentage yield (APY). This is well above the market average, with Ethereum staking offering just 4% APY. Moreover, given its viral meme coin allure and utility-driven tokenomics, Meme Kombat likely holds significantly higher upside potential.\n\nDespite just launching, the presale has already raised over $230K. With its next goal at $1 million, investors looking to secure a low price should act fast. Presale investors can also begin staking and compounding their holdings right away.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat Presale\n\nAnonymous Telegram-Based Casino TG Casino Raises $360K at Presale and Offers 1,176% Staking APY\n\nThe popularity of crypto casinos has been booming recently. Therefore, traders are punting on the next one to explode, and TG Casino ($TGC) has proved a favorite.\n\nTG Casino is a Telegram-based casino offering KYC-free, secure, and private gambling on hundreds of games and events. The project is one of the first Telegram-based casinos to be fully licensed and regulated, providing investors with peace of mind that they are engaging with a legitimate and reputable platform.\n\nIt has just launched its native $TGC token in presale and has raised over $360K in under a week. The presale\u2019s goal is to reach just $1 million, which it will hit very soon.\n\nTG Casino\u2019s token offers holders a range of benefits, like rewards, exclusive access to games and rooms, and an impressive staking APY of 1,176%.\n\nFurthermore, presale buyers will receive additional rewards following its exchange launch, and those who invest over $5K will be deemed \u201chigh rollers,\u201d receiving exclusive NFTs and other benefits.\n\nOn top of that, the $TGC token looks primed to explode. Besides its ecosystem utility, TG Casino\u2019s buyback mechanism could bolster its price. It will repurchase $TGC tokens with a portion of the platform\u2019s revenue, then 60% will be allocated to staking rewards, and 40% will be burned.\n\nThis adds buying pressure to the token while alleviating supply through burning, hinting at long-term potential.\n\nYet, with the presale selling fast, investors are running out of time to secure $TGC at a fixed price.\n\nVisit TG Casino Presale"

Readers should do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. U.Today is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods or services mentioned in the article.\n\nThe fusion of Bitcoin and Ethereum with a tangible, real-world product has all chances to propel BTCS ICO into a realm of explosive growth. By merging the strengths and capabilities of these two prominent cryptocurrencies and integrating them with a practical, tangible BTCS product, this Bitcoin Spark ICO holds the potential to enhance the market and capture significant attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBTCS is a Bitcoin hard fork addressing scalability, transaction speed, and energy consumption challenges. BTCS aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of digital transactions and blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Bitcoin Spark is its innovative and accessible consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Process (PoP). PoP takes PoS and PoW concepts and repackages them to allow diverse users to validate transactions and secure the network by renting their device power and staking BTCS, its native token.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark Application is an essential component allowing users to engage in mining, processing power provision, trading, storing BTCS, and rewards distribution. The application combines PoS and PoW mechanisms to create a dynamic robust network. It strives for a more decentralized and secure network featuring active participation, preventing centralization, and fostering a balanced ecosystem. BTCS runs an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to attract early investors while providing an opportunity for potential returns on investment. One BTCS token is $2.75, with a bonus of 8% in the current phase six.\n\nBitcoin mining\n\nBitcoin mining creates new bitcoins to be added to the circulating supply. It serves as a crucial mechanism for securing and validating transactions on the Bitcoin network. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex math problems that group transactions into blocks. These blocks are added to a public ledger containing a record of all transactions called the blockchain.\n\nMiners compete to solve these mathematical problems and the first one to solve it adds a new block to the blockchain. For their efforts, a reward of newly created BTCs through block rewards and transaction fees paid by users. Bitcoin mining has become highly competitive and resource-intensive, requiring specialized ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners to provide a competitive edge. Nonetheless, the total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, and mining rewards are sliced approximately every four years in an event known as the \"halving,\" making it progressively challenging and reducing the rate of new Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nEthereum staking\n\nEthereum staking is a process that involves actively participating in the Ethereum network to help validate and secure transactions, create new blocks, and maintain the network's overall integrity. It's a fundamental component of Ethereum's transition from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, part of the Ethereum upgrade.\n\nIn a PoS, validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of Ethereum coins (ETH) they hold and are willing to \"stake\" or lock up as collateral. The more ETH a validator stakes, the higher the chance of being chosen to create a block and earn rewards.\n\nThe validators staking ETH and actively participating in the network are incentivized to follow the rules, and if they attempt to act maliciously, they lose the ETH staked. This design increases network security and reduces energy consumption compared to PoW, making the Ethereum network more sustainable and efficient.\n\nEthereum staking is anticipated to significantly improve the network's scalability, speed, and overall functionality as it evolves, playing a crucial role in the broader adoption and success of the Ethereum merge.\n\nMore details on BTCS and ICO here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn crypto investment circles, identifying the perfect projects can amplify your portfolio by margins that Bitcoin and Ethereum might not achieve. In this fast-paced arena, strategic selection and foresight in emerging projects like Bitcoin Spark can lead to exponential growth, offering an exciting journey into the future of digital assets.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS): Enriching Portfolios Beyond BTC and ETH\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark Application introduces a mechanism to ensure fairness and inclusivity. Miners and stakers receive rewards based on their contributions to the network, proportionally distributed to acknowledge their endeavors. This Proof-of-Process (PoP) approach promotes active engagement and mitigates mining centralization, fostering a more decentralized and secure network.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) seeks to revolutionize cryptocurrency mining by making it more inclusive and user-friendly while enhancing network security and decentralization. Miners and validators are rewarded for providing processing power to the network, promoting decentralization and security without excessive energy consumption. By leveraging innovative technologies and a unique PoP consensus mechanism, BTCS creates a distinct ecosystem, ensuring a fair distribution of rewards. With its potential for growth and adoption, BTCS presents an exciting opportunity and a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s record-breaking 100x ICO is in phase six with one BTCS at $2.75, accompanied by an 8% bonus offer. Investors can expect 393% gains on launch at $10.\n\nBTCS is set to incorporate a smart contract layer within the Bitcoin Spark network. The system will operate on multiple layers converging on the main network, enabling diverse programming languages for application development. Initially, an in-house blockchain explorer will be established, and plans are in place to collaborate with third-party developers for further solutions. In line with its roadmap, the GitHub release for third-party developers is slated to be rolled out shortly after the mainnet launch.\n\nBitcoin price\n\nBitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, boasts a decade-long track record in trading. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s price encountering multiple bearish markets, it has consistently demonstrated remarkable recoveries. Looking back at its history, each time Bitcoin bounces from a low, it tends to surge to set unprecedented highs. Bitcoin price has surged by over 80% since the start of the year, surpassing major assets and offering significant returns for those who bought it during dips. Discussions circulate about Bitcoin hitting $100,000 by 2025, with various predictions and beliefs from notable figures in the crypto world. However, many crypto watchers think that while Bitcoin might reach such levels, achieving this in 2025 could be improved. In the current uncertain market, traders might avoid investing in or purchasing risky assets, while the existing BTC holders might sell their holdings, adding unnecessary strain on the crypto.\n\nEthereum price\n\nEthereum serves as a primary platform for dApps and NFTs creation, transaction, and management. The Ethereum blockchain\u2019s robust infrastructure and support for smart contracts make it a perfect fit, solidifying its position as a fundamental pillar of the crypto space. Ethereum\u2019s network upgrades and expanding ecosystem have displayed resilience when it faces market fluctuations. The PoW transition to PoS through Ethereum 2.0 was expected to drive Ethereum prices higher. In addition, its historical performance and position as a leading smart contract platform make it a favored choice among investors. In the past week, ETH reached a high of $1,669.05 and a low of $1,574.86. ETH has maintained a range between $1,550 and $1,650 this year. The current market cap is 191B. However, external factors, including the deepening banking crisis and currency weakening, have stagnated cryptocurrencies like ETH. Before getting involved, potential investors and users should conduct thorough research and due diligence.\n\nMore on BTCS and ICO here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"

        "title": "Best NFT Marketplaces for March 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Here's a recap of the top NFT marketplaces right now.\n\n1. OpenSea\n\nOpenSea is the leader in NFT sales. OpenSea has all sorts of digital assets available on its platform, and it's free to sign up and browse the extensive offerings. It also supports artists and creators and has an easy-to-use process if you want to create your own NFT (known as \"minting\").\n\nThe marketplace supports more than 150 different payment tokens, so the platform's name is appropriate. For an introduction to the NFT world, OpenSea is a great place to start.\n\n2. Axie Marketplace\n\nAxie Marketplace is the online shop for the video game Axie Infinity. Axies are mythical creatures that can be bought and trained and then pitted against other players' Axies to earn rewards. On Axie Marketplace, players can buy new Axies, as well as entire lands and other items, as NFTs for use within the game.\n\nAxie Infinity tokens (called Axie Shards) are built on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, they can be bought and sold on a variety of other NFT marketplaces, as well as on some cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).\n\n3. Larva Labs/CryptoPunks\n\nLarva Labs is best known for the viral CryptoPunks NFT project. They were originally given away for free back in 2017, but some CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars since then. Larva Labs has other digital art projects going such as Autoglyphs, as well as other Ethereum blockchain-based app development projects.\n\nLarva Labs' CryptoPunks NFTs are sold out, but they can be bid on and bought from various third-party marketplaces. Nevertheless, Larva Labs' various projects are worth keeping tabs on -- including the Meebits, which can be bid on directly from the company's built-in marketplace.\n\n4. NBA Top Shot Marketplace\n\nNBA Top Shot is the National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association's foray into the NFT world. On its marketplace, collectible moments (video clips and play highlights) and art can be purchased from the world's premier basketball leagues.\n\nThe NBA built it as a closed marketplace (you can only buy and sell on Top Shot) using the Flow blockchain built by Dapper Labs. It's easy to sign up and buy directly on the Top Shot marketplace website. Collectible moments can be purchased for as little as a few dollars.\n\n5. Rarible\n\nRarible is another large marketplace for all sorts of NFTs, similar to OpenSea. All kinds of art, videos, collectibles, and music can be bought, sold, or created on the platform. However, unlike OpenSea, you'll need to use the marketplace's own token Rarible (CRYPTO:RARI) to buy and sell on the marketplace. Rarible is built on the Ethereum blockchain (although artwork can be managed on OpenSea as well using Rarible tokens).\n\nThe company has partnered with some notable companies. Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Taco Bell has listed art on Rarible, and cloud software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently partnered with Rarible to help secure NFT artists' and creators' work.\n\n6. SuperRare\n\nSimilar to Rarible, SuperRare is also building a marketplace for digital creators. The site includes art, videos, and 3D images, but collectors can purchase artwork using Ethereum.\n\nSuperRare recently announced its own token of the same name based on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens will be used to find and curate new talent for the marketplace. Like Rarible, SuperRare NFTs can also be bought and sold on OpenSea.\n\n7. Foundation\n\nFoundation.app was designed as a simple, no-frills way to bid on digital art. Sales are made using Ethereum. Since the marketplace's launch in early 2021, it has sold more than $100 million of NFTs.\n\nArtists are invited to the platform by the Foundation community, and buyers simply need a crypto wallet funded with Ethereum to start making purchases. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to start creating your own NFTs, Foundation probably isn't the best place to begin, but the marketplace has plenty of artwork that can be perused in a simple format.\n\n8. Nifty Gateway\n\nNifty Gateway has facilitated the sale of some of the most popular digital artists such as Beeple and singer/musician Grimes. It's an art curation platform powered by the crypto exchange Gemini (controlled by the Winklevoss twins). The NFTs, known as Nifties, are built on Ethereum.\n\nBesides being a curated platform, Nifty Gateway also hosts any NFTs purchased -- meaning the NFTs aren't stored in your own wallet but are actually stored for you by Nifty Gateway and Gemini. While that may not work for NFT collectors who want more flexibility with their art investments, Nifty purchases and sales also can be made in fiat currency (e.g., U.S. dollars) without making a cryptocurrency purchase first.\n\n9. Mintable\n\nMintable, backed by billionaire Mark Cuban, aims to be an open marketplace similar to OpenSea. To participate in buying and selling NFTs on Mintable, you'll need Ethereum. The platform also supports minting of NFTs for creators of all types (from photographers to musicians) who want to sell their work as a digital asset.\n\nAn aspiring NFT collector or creator will need to purchase Ethereum from a crypto exchange first, then connect their wallet to Mintable to facilitate bidding and buying on the marketplace.\n\n10. Theta Drop\n\nTheta is a blockchain platform built for the decentralized distribution of video and TV on the internet. The NFT marketplace Theta Drop made its debut in 2021 with the World Poker Tour's digital collectibles. The World Poker Tour was an early adopter of ThetaTV and uses the platform to stream content.\n\nTheta utilizes its own blockchain technology. To participate in the Theta Drop NFT marketplace, you'll need to purchase Theta Token (CRYPTO:THETA). Various crypto exchanges such as Binance support Theta, and the tokens and NFTs purchased with them can be stored in a crypto wallet, as well as in Theta's own crypto wallet app."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, proposed a new approach to add features in the Ethereum blockchain called \u201cminimal viable enshrinement.\u201d\n\nMinimal viable enshrinement involves enshrining specific functionalities in blockchain to simplify implementation without imposing strict rules.\n\nFor example, instead of enshrining a full liquid staking system, the protocol could enshrine a specific piece that solves the key challenges. This will help to implement the functionality in an easy way, without complexing things.\n\nShould Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?https://t.co/7F7yOLBoUr \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 30, 2023\n\nInspired by the Unix philosophy, Buterin argues that this approach is necessary because blockchains are unique social systems.\n\nHe believes that enshrinement can help prevent centralization risks that arise when complexity is pushed to external layers.\n\nButerin explains that excessive enshrinement can compromise the protocol\u2019s trust and governance. He also suggests that de-enshrinement may also be necessary for rarely used features, ensuring backward compatibility and a lighter protocol. This would help in keeping ethereum blockchain compatible with older versions.\n\n\n\nIn the blog post Buterin also discussed the challenges of verifying Ethereum-like blocks within ZK-SNARKs. He conceptualizes whether Ethereum can introduce \u201cverify EVM execution in ZK\u201d as a protocol feature.\n\nHe argues that this would allow Ethereum\u2019s social consensus to handle exceptional situations as it would make things smoother. It could also reduce the need for additional governance in the rollup ecosystem.\n\n"

        "content": "ETH, BNB, and XRP showcased bullish metrics, suggesting price upticks.\n\nDOGE was lying low while SHIB\u2019s price surged by over 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMajor altcoins like Ethereum [ETH], BNB Chain [BNB], and Ripple [XRP] have been disappointing investors for quite some time now with their slow-moving performances. However, if the latest data is to be considered, things might take a U-turn soon.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBut as we enter the last quarter of 2023, the crypto market has the potential to turn volatile, and here\u2019s how.\n\nIs the altcoin market getting ready for a bull run?\n\nMags, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet revealing details about the current market condition. As per the tweet, the altcoin market cap has been trading inside a massive Wyckoff accumulation pattern.\n\n#Altcoin Bull Run Is Finally Here ?? ? The Altcoin Market Cap has been trading inside a Massive Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern ? This Pattern consists of 5 Phases : \u2022 PHASE A : This phase marks the end of the downtrend as supply weakens after intense selling. \u2022 PHASE B :\u2026 pic.twitter.com/h9B9e0YfHh \u2014 Mags (@thescalpingpro) September 30, 2023\n\nThis pattern consists of five phases. At press time, the chart was in the fourth phase, named D. During this phase, the price will reportedly move at least to the upper resistance lines as demand takes over.\n\nAfter the completion of Phase D, Phase E will take over, in which the price will break out, demand will be in full control, and the uptrend will be obvious to everyone.\n\nDoubts still remain\n\nThough the aforementioned data looked optimistic, a closer look at the top altcoins provided a better understanding of what might be ahead. For instance, Ethereum, which is the largest altcoin by market capitalization, failed to breach the $1,700 mark of late.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,686.51 with a market cap of over $202 billion. CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was increasing, meaning that the token was under selling pressure at press time.\n\nAnother bearish signal was that ETH\u2018s total number of coins transferred has decreased by -57.66% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, its takers buy/sell ratio was also in the red, suggesting that selling sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market at the time of writing.\n\nThis further increased the chances of a downtrend in the days to follow.\n\nA look at how other altcoins are doing\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s performance was underwhelming, the second-largest altcoin, BNB, also failed to surprise investors. As per CoinMarketCap, BNB only moved marginally over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $215.89 with a market cap of over $33 billion.\n\nBut BNB\u2019s MACD displayed a bullish crossover, which hinted at a more volatile price movement towards the north. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and was headed above the neutral mark.\n\nNonetheless, its Money Flow Index (MFI) went the other way around as it dropped.\n\nThough a few of the market indicators were in BNB bulls\u2019 favor, its social metrics soared. As per LunarCrush, BNB\u2019s social engagement soared by more than 33% last week.\n\nAdditionally, its Altrank and bullish sentiment also improved considerably last week, suggesting a price uptrend soon. A similar slow-moving trend was also seen on XRP\u2019s graph, which merely moved in the last 24 hours in terms of price.\n\nAfter a massive spike, XRP\u2019s trading volume also dropped. But the good news was that its 1-week price volatility was up. The token\u2019s Binance Funding Rate also remained green, reflecting its popularity in the derivatives market.\n\nMore bullish indicators were revealed upon checking XRP\u2019s daily chart. As per TradingView, XRP\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) gained upward momentum. Apart from that, the token\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also moved upwards, giving hope for a price uptick in the days to follow.\n\nAt the time of writing. XRP was trading at $0.5207, with a market cap of over $27 billion.\n\nAre the memecoins gaining momentum?\n\nWhile mentioning altcoins, it\u2019s important to also include top memecoins such as Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB]. Notably, both memecoins did not show any sign of decoupling.\n\nTheir daily charts were in the green, but SHIB\u2019s price went up by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, which was encouraging.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000007473, while DOGE had a value of $0.06266. Therefore, considering the performance of all the major altcoins, the possibility of a bull rally in October can\u2019t be ruled out.\n\nHowever, as the crypto market is infamous for its unpredictability, the way the market moves in the coming days will be intriguing to watch."

        "title": "Vitalik's Four Lessons on the Future of Ethereum - CryptoTvplus",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has cautioned the Web3 community, especially those focused on Ethereum, on the future of the blockchain he co-founded.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized global software platform often referred to as \u201cthe world\u2019s programmable blockchain.\u201d It positions itself as an electronic, programmable network with a built-in Turing-complete programming language.\n\nThanks to its programmability, numerous applications worth billions of dollars have been built on the platform. As a result, the protocol has undergone several evolutions, implementing a series of proposals.\n\nOn the flip side, there has been a surge of curiosity surrounding integrating features like privacy, advanced cryptography, account safety, censorship resistance, frontrunning protection, and more into the core protocol.\n\nTo approach this aspect carefully, Vitalik imparted four fundamental lessons that should shape the inclusion of additional utilities within the layer one blockchain.\n\nEnshrining features mitigate centralization risks elsewhere\n\nAccording to Vitalik, embedding certain features outside the Ethereum core offers the advantage of minimizing the likelihood of centralization. Simplifying the base protocol allows for increased flexibility.\n\nNonetheless, he cautioned about the potential risks of centralization within the external ecosystem, often due to elevated fixed costs. Despite these risks, it remains beneficial in reducing de facto centralization.\n\nPossibility of straining protocol trust and governance\n\nAnother lesson pointed out by the co-founder is that when too much is added to the Ethereum core, there is a likelihood that it will be overwhelmed due to overload.\n\nThe effect of this is that trust and governance of the protocol can be affected, potentially weakening Ethereum\u2019s credibility.\n\nToo much load can increase in protocol complexity\n\nThe third reflection of Vitalik is that when too much is given to the Ethereum core, it can also result in a more complex protocol. \u201cProtocol complexity is a systemic risk, and adding too many features in-protocol increases that risk,\u201d he said.\n\nHe provided an example of how the implementation of Precompiles on the Ethereum blockchain has fallen short of expected usefulness over the years. Precompiles are contracts implemented on the Ethereum blockchain via client code, instead of EVM smart contract code.\n\nClient code refers to the code running on Ethereum clients or nodes, which are software implementations that interact with the Ethereum blockchain. They are mostly written in programming languages like JavaScript, Python, or Go.\n\nEVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contract code, on the other hand, is the code that defines the behavior of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. EVM smart contract code is written in Solidity or other programming languages that can be compiled into bytecode\n\nUnpredictable user needs\n\nVitalik also added that the reason behind treading cautiously on the Ethereum core is that enshrined features may not align with users\u2019 actual needs, which can change over time, potentially becoming underutilized.\n\nVitalik suggested a middle road, where the protocol enshrines specific pieces to address key challenges without being overly opinionated.\n\n\u201cRather than enshrining a full liquid staking system, enshrine changing staking penalty rules to make trustless liquid staking more viable; rather than enshrining more precompiles, enshrine EVM-MAX and/or SIMD to make a wider class of operations simpler to implement efficiently; and rather than enshrining the whole concept of rollups, we could simply enshrine EVM verification.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said that the debate over what to enshrine in the protocol and what to leave to other layers will continue to evolve as the blockchain ecosystem advances and user needs become clearer."

        "content": "Ethereum ($ETH) recovers and takes the lead over Bitcoin ($BTC)!\n\nThe fact is that in recent days, Ethereum ($ETH) is slowly breaking the downward trend, and is slowly returning \u201cto the starting road\u201d. Things are looking good for Ethereum ($ETH), and many crypto experts, guided by the recent increase in the value of this crypto, believe that in the coming period, $ETH could even surpass Bitcoin ($BTC)!\n\nWhat drives crypto experts to position $ETH above $BTC is that Ethereum, in their opinion, has a much higher utility value, but also a much higher potential for further upgrading.\n\nThe opposite group of crypto experts will still position Bitcoin above Ethereum, and the main argument for that is that, in their opinion, Ethereum lost its ability to be decentralized due to the transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nSo who should you listen to, experts who believe in the success of Ethereum or those who have hopes for Bitcoin\u2019s success? The advice is to look at the situation realistically and based on the available information, judge for yourself what is a better investment.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nThe value of Bitcoin ($BTC) is currently hovering around $27,132, and by the end of the year, this crypto could reach a maximum value of around $27,604.54, in the best-case scenario. As for Ethereum ($ETH), this crypto could reach a value of $2,000 in the same period, which, you will admit, compared to its current value of $1,679.51, is a really good result.\n\nHowever, even though Ethereum is slowly threatening to take the lead over Bitcoin, the fact that crypto experts are not convinced that the victory of $ETH over $BTC will happen brings uncertainty and doubt among crypto users, who now simply do not know what to do and whose advice to follow.\n\nPrecisely because of these differing opinions, users prefer to invest in coins that experts agree will explode in price very quickly, which are set for big gains, and which at the same time do not require huge investments. At this moment, the entire crypto world has put the spotlight on 3 new ERC-20 tokens poised for October success, namely Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX), Meme Kombat ($MK) and Chancer ($CHANCER).\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX): A new, innovative ERC-20 token which is an ideal choice for October!\n\nCrypto experts are convinced that investing in the young Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is the ideal choice for October because this innovative cryptocurrency brings a handful of benefits to users!\n\nBitcoin Minterix ($BTCNMTX), primarily aims to simplify the process of mining Bitcoin in the cloud, which users accepted with great delight. This is supported by the fantastic success of Bitcoin Minetrix presale and more than $265,000 raised so far, which certainly confirms that!\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix platform allows users to easily and simply buy $BTCMTX tokens, and just as easily stake them to earn cloud mining credits. What also affects the growing interest in $BTCMTX is that users have the opportunity to generate passive income, which means that the Bitcoin Minetrix platform offers a fantastic opportunity: for earning through mining but also for phenomenal rewards!\n\nIt is predicted that Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) will continue to flourish even during \u201cUptober\u201d, so it would be best to grab it as soon as possible, while it can be bought at a great price of only $0.011 per token!\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nMeme Kombat ($MK): a new exciting crypto project you shouldn\u2019t miss!\n\nAnother young crypto project for which crypto experts have positive predictions, and which shows huge chances for success in October (much higher than Ethereum and Bitcoin), is Meme Kombat ($MK).\n\n>>> Buy Meme Kombat Now<<<\n\nMeme Kombat ($MK) managed to position itself as extremely promising in record time, because by combining memes, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, it provides users with a comprehensive and unique gaming experience, and allows them to simultaneously \u201cstake, play and get rewards\u201d.\n\nA particularly interesting feature of the Meme Kombat ($MK) ecosystem is the Battle Arena, and to enjoy everything this Battle Arena has to offer, the only thing required is the possession of a native $MK token. By owning the $MK token, you will not only be able to experience all that the Meme Kombat ecosystem has to offer, but you will also make a wise crypto-related step, considering that the $MK token is set for huge gains (some of the crypto influencers believe potentially even 100x). So, jump into the Meme Kombat ecosystem ASAP, and grab $MK coin while its price is only $1,667!\n\n>>> Buy Meme Kombat Now<<<\n\nChancer ($CHANCER): Another new ERC-20 token that arouses the user\u2019s interest.\n\nChancer ($CHANCER) is another new ERC-20 token that arouses users\u2019 interest, but it must be noted that crypto experts, despite the solid start of this coin\u2019s \u201ccareer\u201d, do not have high hopes for its success, at least not during October.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nChancer ($CHANCER) presale is taking place solidly, however, although this crypto project has a clear and concrete vision, unfortunately, there is little chance that $CHANCER will explode in price in the future and realize some significant gains.\n\nThe Chancer platform indeed provides users with a fair and transparent betting experience, but the fact is that, although the very start of the $CHANCER token presale seemed promising, over time that interest decreased. Users have massively reoriented themselves to crypto projects that offer more from the very start, such as the projects we talked about a little while ago.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are chances that Ethereum will take the lead over Bitcoin, but that does not mean that $ETH should be your first choice because there are far more promising cryptos that require less investment and promise much more! If you are looking for \u201cthe next big thing\u201d, be sure to pay attention to young and promising coins that are poised for October\u2019s success. Don\u2019t miss out on Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) and Meme Kombat ($MK) and grab them while the price is this good!\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum and Systemic Crisis: Vitalik Warns Against DAOs - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 03 Oct 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nVitalik Buterin, who had recently engaged in extensive discussions about the possibility of integrating even more features into Ethereum, has once again made waves in the cryptosphere. In his view, Ethereum staking pool operator DAOs could be the source of a major systemic crisis. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nConcerns Over Ethereum\u2019s DAOs\n\nIn a recent publication, Vitalik Buterin advocated at length for the potential integration of more advanced features directly into Ethereum. This may contradict the fundamental philosophy of blockchain, which emphasizes minimal complexity. However, it won\u2019t prevent the deployment of layer 2 applications and solutions on Ethereum.\n\nDans un r\u00e9cent article de blog, Vitalik Buterin, cofondateur d'Ethereum, met en garde contre les vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s possibles aux attaques lorsque les pools de liquidit\u00e9 adoptent l'approche DAO. https://t.co/N9iH88BAwY \u2014 Cointelegraph France (@FRCointelegraph) October 1, 2023 Cointelegraph France\n\n\u201cVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, warns that when DAOs control node operators in staking pools, they could become an \u2018attackable governance gadget\u2019 if a single staking token becomes dominant.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, Vitalik has a solution to reduce the chances of such a danger associated with the current DAO approach to node operator governance. Note that these decentralized autonomous organizations also manage the funds of ETH pools.\n\nHere is the opinion of Ethereum\u2019s co-founder:\n\n\u201cEach version of staked ETH needs to have some mechanism determining who can be the underlying node operators. It can\u2019t be unrestricted, because then attackers would join and amplify their attacks with users\u2019 funds. Currently, the top two are Lido, which has a DAO whitelisting node operators, and Rocket Pool, which allows anyone to run a node if they put down 8 ETH (ie. 1/4 of the capital) as a deposit. These two approaches have different risks: the Rocket Pool approach allows attackers to 51% attack the network, and force users to pay most of the costs. With the DAO approach, if a single such staking token dominates, that leads to a single, potentially attackable governance gadget controlling a very large portion of all Ethereum validators. To the credit of protocols like Lido, they have implemented safeguards against this, but one layer of defense may not be enough.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of such an attack, we have Curve Finance, which paid a heavy price for a vulnerability in its pools. The crypto community, as well as Ethereum developers, would not want a similar incident to recur.\n\nFears of Ethereum Centralization\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has completely changed the landscape across the ecosystem. The Merge has indeed made the blockchain more environmentally friendly.\n\nIf in 2022, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption ranged from 90 to 115 terawatt-hours, The Merge has nearly reduced it to zero: 0.03 kilowatt-hours per transaction. Perhaps the research commissioned by the European Union on this subject will confirm (or not) the accuracy of these figures.\n\nThe Shapella update, successfully implemented by the Ethereum team in April, has revised the ETH staking process. Liquid staking providers like Rocket Pool and Lido, mentioned earlier, are among the major beneficiaries of this mini-revolution.\n\nWhen analysts tackled Ethereum\u2019s centralization issues, many pointed fingers at Lido, which currently holds 72% of all staked ETH tokens.\n\nIs this Vitalik Buterin\u2019s goal, as he did not overlook this pseudo-centralization of Ethereum in his recent exposition? The integration of additional features into the blockchain could address this situation. And concerning this security matter, Vitalik has already announced, in another blog post, the creation of secure ETH wallets.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum Futures ETFs near launch, and JPMorgan\u2019s UK subsidiary bars crypto payments\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) went up steadily throughout the week, starting at around $26,000 to now trade at $28,300 after a significant upswing over the weekend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation, moved in a similar way, starting the week at $1,680 and seeing a quick jump throughout it to the $1,700 mark, to now trade at $1,730.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week were partly focused on the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) attitude towards a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House Financial Services Committee sending a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler saying the regulator should listen to the courts and approve a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFour prominent members of the Committee wrote a letter to Gensler, who is scheduled to testify before them soon. They claimed that there is no difference between a spot Bitcoin ETF and a Bitcoin futures ETF, which the SEC has already given the green light.\n\nThe letter urged the SEC to approve the applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs from companies like Fidelity and BlackRock\u2019s iShares. It comes after last month the SEC was ordered by a DC Circuit Court of Appeals judge to reconsider its position on these applications.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts expect Ether futures ETFs to launch as soon as this week as they believe the SEC is gearing up to greenlight a series of ETH futures ETFs. Investment management firm VanEck has raised its market efforts for these products with the release of two \u201cEnter the Ether\u201d-themed television commercials.\n\nVanEck is looking to launch its Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), which is set to invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts trading on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nCOMING SOOON. \ud83c\udfb7\ud83c\udfb7\ud83c\udfb7\n\n\n\nFollow for updates on how to Enter the Ether. pic.twitter.com/abXxw2tnaW October 1, 2023\n\nOver the week, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also saw its non-US exchange Coinbase International Exchange, secure regulatory approval from Bermuda\u2019s financial regulators to offer non-US retail customers perpetual futures contracts.\n\nThe firm is now set to offer these perpetual futures contracts to its users in the near future through Coinbase Advanced.\n\nMeanwhile, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance revealed payments solution provider Paysafe \u201cunilaterally\u201d stopped processing euro deposits for its users. Binance has urged its users to either withdraw their EUR or trade them for USDT before the end of October, while it works on integrating new fiat currency channels.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s UK subsidiary to ban crypto\n\nStarting from October 16, JPMorgan\u2019s UK subsidiary Chase will limit crypto-related payments for its clients in a bid to prevent scams and fraud by malicious actors. This is a stricter measure than other UK banks like HSBC and NatWest, which have only imposed some restrictions on crypto transactions.\n\nChase said that its customers will get a message saying that their transaction was declined if they try to make a crypto-related payment after that date. The decision is based on data that reveals a high incidence of crypto scams and frauds in the UK, such as fake celebrity endorsements and bogus investment schemes.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken seemingly started laying the groundwork to facilitate trading of US-listed stocks and ETFs on its platform, and is seemingly looking to offer the new service to customers in the US and UK.\n\nKraken is said to have obtained the required regulatory approvals in the UK and is seeking a broker-dealer license in the US from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). It aims to launch the new service in 2024.\n\nThe week also saw Binance reveal it\u2019s fully divesting from the Russian market as it agreed to sell its business in the country to crypto exchange CommEX.\n\nBinance has entered into an agreement to sell the entirety of its Russia business to CommEX (https://t.co/JJRKCo9coA).\n\n\n\nTo ensure a smooth process for existing Russian users, the off-boarding process will take up to one year. All assets of existing Russian users are safe and\u2026 \u2014 Binance (@binance) September 27, 2023\n\nCommEX is notably a newly launched cryptocurrency exchange that offers \u201ca wide range of product suites including Spot, Futures, Simple Futures and P2P service to engage with the world of cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nGoogle Cloud adds 11 new blockchains to BigQuery\n\nAs blockchain adoption grows, Google Cloud, the tech giant\u2019s computing arm, added 11 new networks, including Polygon, Optimism, and Polkadot to its BigQuery program, which is described on its webpage as a \u201cserverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse\u201d is tailored to cater for \u201cpractitioners of various coding skills\u201d.\n\nAccording to Google Cloud, one of its key advantages is allowing users to fetch historical data from an off-chain source faster than they would query the blockchain directly.\n\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s move came the same week a new report published by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) called for the global harmonisation of cryptocurrency regulation to ensure broader market stability.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "content": "A few days ago, Anatoly Yakovenko, founder of the Solana crypto project, strongly criticised Ethereum for creating a social hierarchy that seems to benefit the upper-middle class at the expense of the working masses.\n\nThe accusations are mainly related to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s concept of centralising the validators of the chain, as the access requirements are limiting for the lower classes.\n\nIn fact, in order to join the group of independent validators, it is necessary to have at least 32 ETH, or about 53,000 dollars at the current exchange rate.\n\nVitalik had previously praised Solana\u2019s developer community, calling them \u201cserious\u201d and saying that the project could survive for years to come.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nLatest news from the crypto world: Solana\u2019s founder thinks Ethereum is only for the upper middle class\n\nThe latest news from the crypto world is about the clash between Ethereum and Solana, specifically Anatoly Yakovenko and some heavy accusations made 2 days ago on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe founder of the Solana blockchain, born in 2018 with the nickname \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d, stated that although the rival network was conceived as the engine of a decentralised economy open to all, so far it has turned out to be a tool dedicated exclusively to the upper middle class.\n\nIn the published text, words such as \u201coppression\u201d and \u201cstateless digital domain\u201d can be read, highlighting the most negative aspects of the world\u2019s second most capitalised crypto project after bitcoin.\n\nHere is the original tweet.\n\nIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval. As the petite bourgeoisie revel in this digital carnival, the visage of oppression subtly transforms, yet its\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) October 1, 2023\n\nThe core of Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s speech concerns the strict requirements needed to become an autonomous validator within the Ethereum protocol, which act as an access barrier for the poorer masses.\n\nIn fact, it is common knowledge that in order to access Ethereum stakes as a validator, one must block a minimum of 32 ETH, which at the current price of the cryptocurrency is equivalent to over $53,000.\n\nAs of today, we can count a total of approximately 126,000 Ethereum addresses holding at least 32 ETH. With a total of 245.9 million unique addresses on the network, we can conclude that only 0.05% of all addresses can participate in the validation of network blocks.\n\nAs the more experienced in the industry probably know, there are alternative ways to participate in Ethereum staking (not validation), such as using third-party services like Lido, Rocket Pool, Frax and Stakewise, where the minimum requirements are more affordable and in everyone\u2019s pocket.\n\nThe problem is that the trend towards liquid staking (LSD) platforms is only helping to further centralise the chain, with Lido having a market share of over 32% in coin staking.\n\nThis narrative has been echoed in recent weeks by many representatives of these platforms who are looking for a solution to limit the power of Lido and the richer middle class masses.\n\nAdd to this the fact that Ethereum has always been defined as a chain for the rich, as the commission costs to execute a TX are much higher than its current competitors.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum: comparing the two blockchain networks\n\nThe harsh words of the founder of the Solana crypto project make even more delicate a competitive relationship that has been going on for years, with the two blockchains fighting for market supremacy.\n\nTo tell the truth, it is mainly Solana and its exponents who have centred the narrative of the \u201cL1 killer\u201d as a marketing tool to attract new traffic to the network, followed by the \u201cEthereum fan boy\u201d who has responded punctually in tone on social media to remind them of their superiority.\n\nVitalik Buterin, on the other hand, has never shown any rivalry with Solana, even going so far as to praise the community of crypto network developers as a group of \u201cserious and smart people\u201d.\n\nIn June 2023, Vitalik himself expressed his solidarity with the repressive actions of the US federal authorities, who were trying hard to define SOL as a security, suggesting that he would be happy to see the blockchain landscape expand in favour of other competitors such as Solana.\n\nThe one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that @solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don't deserve it, and if ethereum ends up \"winning\" through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that's not an honorable way to win, and in the long term\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 30, 2023\n\nIf we look at the data of both networks, it is easy to see that Ethereum is the most used in all areas: from the number of active addresses, to the volume moved on-chain, to the number of dApps built on it.\n\nOn Ethereum, for example, we can count a number of active addresses of 12.65 million in September 2023 against Solana\u2019s 6.13 million, as well as three times the volume generated on-chain.\n\nAll this is not due to a better technology or a more functional blockchain architecture, but simply to the fact that Ethereum is a historical chain, born long before its \u201crival\u201d, which has gained public legitimacy as the main blockchain engine of the DeFi and NFT market, given and also taking into account the stress tests it has been able to face.\n\nSolana, despite being cheaper, faster and accessible to everyone, still suffers from some problems related to the synchronisation of nodes and it happens very often that it goes down for a few minutes/hours. And let\u2019s not forget the beating it took immediately after the collapse of FTX in November 2022, which was the project\u2019s main backer.\n\nA struggle for supremacy or a silly narrative?\n\nReturning to Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s talk, we feel it is worthwhile to provide some food for thought regarding the future of the decentralised network landscape in the coming years.\n\nAs investors and supporters of each other\u2019s projects wage war on each other on social media, they come up with complex techniques to generate FUD, it is important to realise that no one here cares about the \u201cwar for supremacy\u201d.\n\nIf one or the other blockchain were to disappear in the next few years, it would be detrimental to the entire cryptographic industry.\n\nWhat really matters is that the industry as a whole grows to a market that can satisfy both sides.\n\nWe are not here to make political propaganda or to start a war between rich and poor.\n\nWe are here to support a world that in its broader background sees the participation of a long series of protocols and networks that contribute to creating a parallel economy that fully expresses the concept of financial freedom, disconnected from financial intermediation and bank control."

        "content": "Hashdex is seeking approval to present the combination of spot and future contract Ethereum ETF. It has submitted the application by the Nasdaq Stock Exchange to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the September 11 filing, the investors will be facilitated with both Ethereum spot and future contracts. But, this could lead to price fluctuations.\n\nThe fund investment aim is to track the price of the benchmark by investing in Ether and Ethereum future contracts. Changes in the price may vary from changes in the price of Ether.\n\nFiling States Investment Limits\n\nThe filings also state that the wide range of portfolios has some investment limits. The rules include the capping of the amount of spot Ether that the fund can hold to lessen the risk of manipulation.\n\nThe fund will be managed by Torso Investment. Torso has faith that the investment strategy aims to reduce manipulation risk by diversifying the holdings. It also declares the SEC\u2019s ongoing concern about spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nBesides holding 100% spot Ether which will make it more prone to price manipulation in the spot market, the fund will hold a blend of spot Ether, Ether future contracts, and cash filing states.\n\nSamir Kerbage, Chief Investment Officer at Hasshdex, indicated his faith by saying that Brazil is leading the way in the world of crypto ETFs. In 2021, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission approved both Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF. Both of them are listed on Brazil\u2019s second oldest stock exchange B3.\n\nHe also states that other countries should also consider Brazil\u2019s approach to the ETF. And, they believe that the Brazil model will help the U.S. and other countries in making their crypto regulatory framework.\n\nKerbage mentions that he believes the Brazilian government recognized crypto early interest and prioritized regulatory framework for investor protection. The country has the most developed crypto market which consists of many index strategies.\n\nThe SEC is nearing approval for the first Ethereum Future. It shows potential authorization in just a few weeks. A report of August 18, shows that by October many firms will get approval to launch Ether and Future ETF.\n\nThe regulator will most certainly not block the product which would be based on the second largest cryptocurrency. Though many firms have submitted applications, it remains unclear which firm will get the approval first.\n\nSummary\n\nHashdex is looking for consent from the Security and Exchange Commission to make available the combination of spot and future contract Ethereum. The investors will be facilitated with both. This can cause price fluctuations."
