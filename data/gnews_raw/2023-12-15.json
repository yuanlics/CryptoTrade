        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has had a great 2023, so has Ethereum (ETH), the second-most traded and recognizable crypto coin in the world. Ethereum is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform and has risen 89.4% in value as of date in 2023.\n\nThe crypto behemoth has paved its path to winning over new customers by making a significant update this year, known as the Shanghai Upgrade. Under this upgrade, ETH shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively short history of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nPowered by this development and what promises to be a significant 2024 for cryptocurrency, analysts around the world have turned bullish on it. There is a consensus that ETH might outperform BTC in 2024 with regard to growth rate and will gain more market share based on its proposals to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second. In fact, its planned upgrade, called EIP-4844, might ensure that transaction costs could fall to as low as $0.01.\n\nPer Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, ETH revenues could double from 2023, up to $5 billion in 2024. Also, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, with markets widely betting on rate hikes having come to an end and the first rate cut as early as first-quarter 2024, the crisis for crypto may have been averted.\n\nEthereum has already started to make good of the state of the market, and it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform. Here is a selection of two stocks that we believe should be tracked. These currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture plc ACN: This global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved by 0.1% over the past 60 days. ACN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nCME Group Inc. CME: This company operates as one of the world's largest futures exchange, offers a wide range of derivatives contracts and provides various solutions to invest in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.\n\nCME Group\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14.7%.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum could do surpass Bitcoin in performance next year due to the upcoming Protodanksharding upgrade.\n\nThe JPM report says the potential impact of Bitcoin halving on its price is already factored into current valuations.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are stating that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs may not lead to a significant influx of new capital.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s crypto outlook for 2024 is marked by caution, particularly regarding Bitcoin (BTC). The financial institution perceives Bitcoin as being overbought, driven by what they consider \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIts new report suggests Ethereum (ETH), currently the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, may surpass Bitcoin, the largest, in performance next year.\n\nProtodanksharding To Drive Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nThe report, authored by JPMorgan analysts including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglo, cites the anticipated Ethereum network upgrade, dubbed \u201cProtodanksharding ,\u201d as a key factor in this potential shift. This upgrade, expected in the first half of 2024, aims to significantly enhance the efficiency of the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to the JPMorgan report, Protodanksharding is the primary catalyst for this expected outperformance. Analysts believe that this upgrade will be a significant step in improving the activity on the Ethereum network, thereby boosting its performance relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThe report also addresses the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin halving. It notes that current valuations already factor the potential impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price into their predictions.\n\nJP MORGAN EXPECTS ETH TO OVERSHADOW BTC AFTER PUBLIC CRYPTO SHADE Is JP Morgan\u2019s CEO having a change of heart? \u2013 JP Morgan analysts expect the forthcoming EIP-4844 upgrade or \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d to be immensely bullish for #Ethereum \u2013 \"Protodanksharding\" is essentially a\u2026 https://t.co/RZGGTqvsWj pic.twitter.com/Q6d3gjOGTj \u2014 BSCN (@BSCNews) December 15, 2023\n\nDespite speculations that the halving event would lead to a substantial price increase for Bitcoin, JPMorgan suggests that this is not a certainty and that Ethereum\u2019s advancements could position it for stronger performance in comparison.\n\nThe report said: \u201cGiven the current ratio of the Bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 Bitcoin halving event is largely in the price.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs May Not Boost Crypto Markets\n\nThe JPMorgan report presents a skeptical view on the potential impact of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIt says the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), anticipated in 2024, may not lead to a significant influx of new capital into the crypto markets. This is based on observations from Europe and Canada, where the approval of spot crypto ETFs did not substantially increase investor interest or capital flow into the volatile Bitcoin or Ethereum markets.\n\nA few months ago, JP Morgan wasn't feeling Ethereum, and now they're singing a bullish tune. pic.twitter.com/1yPiiA9FSs \u2014 fity.eth (@Fityeth) December 14, 2023\n\nGrayscale ETF Woes Loom\n\nJPMorgan analysts believe that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could redirect investments towards existing Bitcoin-related products. These include Bitcoin mining companies, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThis conversion could lead to investors seeking to capitalize on the SEC\u2019s approval. This could result in up to $2.7 billion in losses for the Trust. Such a scenario is expected to exert \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPerfect timing for @JSeyff note today on why cash creates kill one \"superpower\" of ETFs, and how Grayscale would be hit hardest given they have sitting on tons of bitcoin they bought at lower prices that they'd have to sell. pic.twitter.com/3Uvji7mMya \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2023\n\nAdding to the cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed his negative view during a Senate banking committee hearing last week. Dimon stated his willingness to \u201cclose [crypto] down,\u201d indicating a strong skepticism towards the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDimon said: \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance, I\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, et cetera.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has achieved decentralized governance, according to a message from the project\u2019s creator on Dec. 14.\n\nENS is a naming system for the Ethereum blockchain that adds human-readable names to various resources, including crypto wallets and websites. Until now, the project\u2019s root node was managed by members of the Ethereum community.\n\nNick Johnson, ENS founder, endorsed the change in ownership. He wrote on X:\n\n\u201c[This is] truly the end of an era. Here\u2019s the message I just sent to the ENS root keyholders, requesting the transfer of the last of their powers to the DAO.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s attached email stated that the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of ENS, which is a governance group formed and controlled by ENS token holders, voted unanimously to acquire control of the project\u2019s root node.\n\nHe said that, in response to those voting results, he created a transaction to execute two actions that transfer root control to the DAO address (wallet.ensdao.eth). He wrote that this transaction transfers all remaining multisig responsibilities to the DAO, thereby \u201cretiring the multisig entirely.\u201d It is unclear whether the other multisig owners have approved the transaction.\n\nIndividuals who previously managed ENS\u2019 multisig include Chainlink\u2019s Sergey Nazarov, Metamask\u2019s Dan Finlay, MyCrypto\u2019s Taylor Monahan, Colony\u2019s Aron Fischer, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Jason Carver and Martin Swende, and Johnson himself. Johnson addressed those individuals in his message, writing: \u201cThank you so much \u2026 for your service to ENS over the years.\u201d\n\nENS governance will be more open\n\nENS\u2019 DAO is a governance group comprising token holders that vote on decisions and issues related to the project by staking tokens.\n\nAccording to the latest proposal, the DAO already has several ownership responsibilities but did not have control over the core ENS root name until now.\n\nThe DAO will gain specific capabilities by controlling the ENS root. The ownership change will allow the DAO to create, manage, and permanently lock top-level domains apart from the permanent and unchangeable .eth domain. It will also allow the DAO to update reverse resolutions that map addresses back to a name. The DAO may also introduce primary domain names on layer-2 networks.\n\nA snapshot indicates that voting concluded on Dec. 15, 2023. Virtually 100% of the staked tokens, or 1.9 million ENS, were staked in favor of DAO ownership. Johnson was one of the largest voters, staking 155,000 ENS in favor. Less than 17 ENS tokens were staked against the plan or were used to abstain."

        "title": "Ethereum Restaking is Gaining Steam: OETH Joins EigenLayer - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Ethereum staking has taken the space by storm since 2021\u2019s Merge. The new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism allows anyone to participate in securing Ethereum\u2019s network in exchange for a share of rewards primarily derived from transaction fees.\n\nSince launching, ETH staking has garnered tremendous demand from individuals and institutions alike. The advent of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) has further boosted adoption by drastically lowering barriers to entry. As a result, nearly 24% of ETH\u2019s supply is now securing the network, making it highly resilient.\n\nHowever, novel networks struggle to build similar staking support. This means that they\u2019re forced to develop their products without the same resources or robust security.\n\nEnter EigenLayer. Launched in June 2023, the bleeding-edge restaking protocol allows new chains and protocols to share ETH\u2019s network security and strengthen their offerings. The tokenless protocol has seen impressive demand, garnering more than $260M in TVL thus far.\n\nKeep Reading Lisk Announces New Partnership with Indonesian Ministry of Communications & Informatics\n\nIn line with this growing interest, EigenLayer has onboarded a host of leading LSTs as collateral on the platform. Origin Ether (OETH), Ethereum\u2019s second largest yield aggregator, is among the latest additions to the protocol, bringing restaking to a brand-new audience.\n\nHow Does Restaking Work?\n\nRestaking provides an avenue for developers to harness Ethereum\u2019s robust security on novel chains and dApps.\n\nUsers can restake native staked ETH, LSTs, and ETH LP tokens on EigenLayer. These restaked assets are lent out to builders to provide a solid foundation for protocol security. Projects using restaked assets pay a premium for this service, which is distributed to restakers in the form of rewards.\n\nBeyond allowing projects to share ETH\u2019s security, restaking also offers a unique opportunity for ETH stakers to compound their returns.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that restaking carries additional risks, as the same assets are being reused across multiple networks. As a result, restaked assets are exposed to heightened slashing risks, as each network carries its own set of rules and parameters.\n\nHowever, restakers are compensated for this risk in the form of heightened rewards.\n\nPreparing to Scale\n\nIn tandem with the addition of OETH and other LSTs, EigenLayer is raising its deposit cap on restaked assets. From Monday, users will be able to deposit a total of 200K ETH in assets per LST. However, should total LST deposits exceed 500K ETH, a pause mechanism will be activated.\n\nThis incremental approach allows EigenLayer to support new assets without compromising security.\n\nGiven the significant demand for EigenLayer\u2019s services, it\u2019s possible that the current caps may be reached soon after the new deposit caps go live.\n\nOETH\u2019s EigenLayer Integration\n\nThe addition of OETH to EigenLayer is particularly exciting given Origin Ether\u2019s rapidly expanding presence across DeFi. Since launching in May, OETH has garnered more than 30,000 ETH in TVL. The novel LSTfi protocol is backed by ETH and reserves of Lido stETH, Frax\u2019s frxETH, and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, offering LST holders a seamless platform to boost their returns.\n\nOETH\u2019s incisive strategies generate yields well above base rewards rates for users, boasting a trailing 30-Day APY of over 6%.\n\nThe EigenLayer integration marks one of many milestones on OETH\u2019s quest to become one of DeFi\u2019s most integral money legos. Beyond restaking, OETH holders can also leveraged yield on Pendle Finance, and liquidity mine incentivized pools on Curve and Balancer.\n\nRestaking OETH via EigenLayer allows users to further compound their yield, while also participating in instruments at the very forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nAs crypto continues its march toward mass adoption, primitives like restaking will be invaluable for new builders who lack the deep resources of established Ethereum projects. By harnessing OETH and leading LSTs for restaking, savvy investors could position themselves well for the sector\u2019s future growth."

        "title": "How to Stake Ethereum? - Latest Cryptocurrency Prices & Articles",
        "content": "Crypto has come a long way since 2009, when Bitcoin was launched. So many things have changed, and thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been developed. Users now have endless options when it comes to crypto, blockchain, Web3, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), mining, staking, yield farming, and many more. Even mentioning those crypto-related terms can show how much crypto has grown.\n\nWhile there are so many crypto projects on the market, some of them still remain in the spotlight thanks to their features, the many years they have been traded for, and the security and safety they provide. Among them, there is Ethereum, one of the cryptocurrencies that progressed the most and revolutionized many concepts in the crypto industry.\n\nSo, if you have been around for the littlest of time, you might have considered purchasing Ethereum. Are we right?\n\nAnd you may have also asked yourself what it takes to earn more by staking those ETH coins. Well, you are in the right place, as in this article, we will talk about Ethereum staking, its main requirements, benefits, and the best ways to stake your ETH.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nOfficially launched on July 30, 2015, by a team of 5 founders, Ethereum is the 2nd largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. Unlike some may think, Ethereum was not conceived with fast transactions in mind.\n\nHowever, the network\u2019s initial developers, Vitalik Buterin, Jeffrey Wilck, and Gavin Wood, aimed to develop an ecosystem that can store decentralized applications (dApps) and help the DeFi industry evolve as much as possible.\n\nThe whitepaper of Ethereum, which was published in 2013, explained what dApps are, how they work, and how they can rely on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, Ethereum is home to numerous decentralized applications and many other types of crypto projects, being the most developed blockchain.\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has passed through plenty of updates and new launches, but the most significant remains The Merge. While Ethereum first worked based on a PoW (Proof-of-Work) consensus mechanism, on September 15, 2022, the network switched to PoS (Proof-of-Stake), thus moving from mining to staking.\n\nThe Merge was a major change for Ethereum and came with various significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption. After switching from PoW to PoS, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption was reduced by approximately 99.95%, a tremendous decrease in carbon emissions.\n\nEthereum Staking\n\nOnce The Merge was completed, the Ethereum network moved to Ethereum 2.0, or the 2nd version of the blockchain. This way, users can now stake their ETH to earn staking rewards based on the amount of ETH they lock up and the lock-up period.\n\nStaking ETH implies using your coins to verify, secure, and validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Once a transaction is verified, you can receive a reward. That reward basically is the network fee required by the blockchain to complete that transaction.\n\nWhere and How to Stake Ethereum\n\nConsidering that Ethereum switched from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, crypto enthusiasts can now stake their ETH coins.\n\nIt is widely known that, overall, the staking process is a little less complex than mining. Furthermore, you need less powerful (and expensive) hardware for staking than you do for mining.\n\nSo, many crypto investors were eager to start staking Ethereum once this was possible.\n\nAt the moment, there are multiple ways to stake ETH, and you have to choose the one that is most profitable and easy to complete, depending on your needs, holdings, and knowledge.\n\nThe most popular Ethereum staking options include solo staking, staking pools, staking through a centralized crypto exchange, or even SaaS (Staking as a Service).\n\nWe will take them one by one and highlight their features and advantages.\n\nStaking Ethereum on Crypto Exchanges\n\nThere are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges on the market, each one coming with new or improved features and products. Most of them also support Ethereum, among other cryptocurrencies, and some also allow users to stake their ETH tokens to improve the Ethereum network and earn extra coins.\n\nStaking on a crypto exchange is easier than you think. First, you have to sign up on a platform if you do not have an account already. Then, you should purchase ETH or move it from another platform. Afterward, all you have to do is select the amount of ETH you want to lock up and start staking it.\n\nTop Crypto Exchanges\n\nBinance\n\nBinance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, with over 168 million registered users. The platform is user-friendly, but it is most suitable for crypto investors who already have at least a little trading knowledge.\n\nBinance supports over 350 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, the platform allows users to stake their ETH coins on its platform. The minimum amount required is 0.1 ETH, and the reference APR varies, but it is approximately 3.5%. At the moment of writing, the reference APR was 3.22%.\n\nStaking ETH on Binance is as straightforward as possible. You do not need extensive knowledge of crypto to do this, and Binance is in to help its users stake their Ethereum coins by explaining the process on its official website.\n\nStep 1: Sign up on Binance\n\nFirst, if you do not have a Binance account, you should sign up. To do this, you will have to provide an email address, your phone number, and other similar information. However, Binance will never ask you to provide too much information, as it only requires what it needs to create your account.\n\nStep 2: Click on \u201cEarn\u201d\n\nOnce you are registered and signed in, you can go to the staking page. To do this, you will have to click on \u201cEarn\u201d from the top of the screen.\n\nStep 3: Click on Ethereum\n\nThen, you should see multiple cryptocurrencies available, each having a dropdown. Click on \u201cEthereum.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Click on \u201cETH Staking\u201d\n\nThen, you will see the staking option.\n\nStep 5: Start Staking Ethereum\n\nAfter you click on \u201cETH Staking,\u201d you will be able to stake your Ethereum coins as desired. You will also notice the reference APR, the conversion ratio, and the total value staked on Binance.\n\nOf course, it is essential to note that you must hold ETH to stake it on Binance or any other platform. So, if you do not hold it yet, you can purchase it directly on Binance.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase is the 2nd largest crypto exchange on the market, being available almost worldwide and offering numerous trading services. Coinbase allows users to buy, sell, and trade over 250 cryptocurrencies through 2 main platforms: Coinbase Simple Trade and Coinbase Advanced Trade .\n\nStaking on Coinbase is pretty easy. The platform is user-friendly, and the staking feature is not significantly more complicated than other processes supported by the Coinbase exchange.\n\nOnce you have some ETH coins in your account, you can start staking it and earn ETH staking rewards. The estimated reward rate for Ethereum staking is 3.49%. Thus, depending on your holdings and the amount you lock up, you can earn approximately 3.49% of the amount of staked ETH.\n\nKraken\n\nKraken is one of the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and exchange over 220 cryptocurrencies, including the most popular, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the staking feature is a little affected at the moment by a lawsuit filed by the SEC against Kraken at the beginning of the year, the crypto exchange still offers staking for various cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Cosmos (ATOM), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), or Tron (TRX). However, it is essential to note that the feature is still not available for US citizens.\n\nStill, if you want to earn rewards by staking ETH, you can use Kraken, as the platform is extremely intuitive, so the process should not take too much. The yearly rewards for Ethereum staking range between 3% and 6%, depending on the amount of staked ETH and the period you decide to lock up your coins.\n\nCrypto Wallets\n\nStaking Ethereum through crypto wallets is as easy as with crypto exchanges. Things do not differ that much, the main requirement being to hold some ETH coins in your account. At the moment, numerous wallets allow users to stake ETH, some of the most popular being MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetaMask may be one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets on the market. It is available as a web browser extension (available on Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Opera) and a mobile app (available on Android and iOS devices), and users usually praise the wallet for its user-friendliness. MetaMask allows you to stake crypto on both its extension and app.\n\nIn the app, for instance, you have to go to the \u201cExplore\u201d section and search for \u201cMetaMask Portfolio.\u201d Afterward, all you have to do is access the MetaMask dashboard and tap on \u201cStake.\u201d Then, you can select Ethereum and choose a platform.\n\nAt the moment, you can choose from Lido and Rocket Pool. The rewards differ, too. Lido offers rewards of up to 3.83%, while Rocket Pool has a reward rate of approximately 3.65%.\n\nMyEtherWallet\n\nMyEtherWallet is one of the best Ethereum wallets on the market, supporting all ERC-20 and ERC-271 tokens. On MyEtherWallet, users can buy, sell, swap, and exchange crypto seamlessly, thanks to the user-friendly platform provided by the company. The wallet is free to use, and investors are required to support network fees.\n\nMyEtherWallet also allows users to stake ETH on the platform, offering 2 types of staking. Users can choose to run a validator node or stake smaller amounts of ETH through pooled or liquid staking.\n\nUsers can check their rewards on the MyEtherWallet platform, which is available on web and mobile devices. The rewards vary depending on the amount of staked ETH and the lock-up period.\n\nSolo Staking\n\nAlso called \u201cnative staking,\u201d solo staking brings you the most significant rewards, but there is a catch: to be a solo staker, you have to get your own validator node, and this requires 32 ETH. Now, for some users, such an amount of crypto may be too much, considering that ETH exceeded $2,000.\n\nHowever, solo staking is quite profitable, and the hardware required for this type of staking is not that expensive, especially compared to the hardware you need to mine crypto.\n\nIf you decide to stake ETH on your own, you will have to do all the work. Solo Ethereum validators will have to wait a little bit more to earn rewards, as they also have to go through an activation process enforced by the protocol. The process might take a few days, but in some cases, it can also take a couple of weeks.\n\nOverall, solo staking is considered to be the least risky staking option, considering that you have full control over your staked ETH and validator rewards.\n\nStaking as a Service (SaaS)\n\nIf you hold at least 32 ETH and want to earn native block rewards but do not want to get directly involved with the staking process, you can choose SaaS (Staking as a Service). There are certain staking platforms that can manage the validator on your behalf.\n\nOf course, if you choose to do this through such staking services, you will have to pay a little commission to the company managing your validator. All in all, staking-as-a-service is a great option for those who aim to earn crypto through staking but do not have the time or the right hardware to do it themselves.\n\nOf course, once you give your ETH to a SaaS platform, the entire staking process becomes a little less safe. However, just like with any other crypto-related process, we strongly advise you to research the platforms available and choose the safest option.\n\nWith so many crypto platforms out there, you will surely find a trustworthy platform to manage the staking process for you.\n\nPooled Staking\n\nIf you do not have 32 ETH, you can join a staking pool, where users\u2019 ETH coins are combined to get the total required for running a staking node. Pooled staking platforms offer many users the opportunity to join the Ethereum ecosystem without the burden of having to purchase 32 ETH (approximately $70,630).\n\nWhile the Ethereum network does not directly support pooled staking, there are various platforms that allow you to join staking pools in no time. This way, that platform will be responsible for activating and deactivating validators according to deposits and withdrawals. Furthermore, they will have to manage and ensure that it supports the pool.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking is similar to pooled staking, but there are some differences worth considering. This staking method implies staking your coins into a pool, but the reward part is entirely different.\n\nIn liquid staking, rewards are distributed to users based on their percentage ownership. However, you will not receive tokens but transferable receipt tokens (also called liquid staking tokens). These tokens will act as proof of ownership and will allow you to withdraw your funds.\n\nKeep in mind that many consider liquid staking to be one of the riskiest staking methods, as it implies counterparty risks with the transferable receipt. However, once you get the ETH staked to a safe place, everything should be under control.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nStaking Ethereum is a great opportunity to earn passive income by locking up the coins you already hold for as much time as you want. With so many staking options, it may seem hard to choose the best option for your funds.\n\nSolo staking requires more advanced hardware and a minimum of 32 ETH to become a validator. However, with pooled or liquid staking, things get a whole lot easier.\n\nFurthermore, if you hold 32 ETH, you can choose staking-as-a-service, and a staking provider will manage your funds and complete the staking process.\n\nBesides, you can always consider staking through a crypto exchange or wallet, as many such platforms also provide staking services. On exchanges and wallets, things get a lot easier, but there is a possibility that the rewards will decrease once you choose such a staking method.\n\nShare this Post Twitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n* The information in this article and the links provided are for general information purposes only and should not constitute any financial or investment advice.

        "content": "Although investors \u2018have been heavily\u2019 allocating to Solana throughout 2023, Ethereum will still be the top smart contracts platform in 2024, Coinbase says.\n\nIn a new report titled \u201c2024 Crypto Market Outlook,\u201d Coinbase noted that throughout 2023, net fund inflows to Solana-related (SOL) investment funds were second only to Bitcoin (BTC), surpassing Ethereum (ETH) and other multi-asset funds flows.\n\nAnalysts at the U.S.-based crypto exchange attributed the surge in Solana investment to the network\u2019s ability to handle high transaction volumes and low fees, which they say are necessary to support a new wave of highly performant applications.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we believe that improved transaction throughput and lower fees are necessary to improve UX to onboard a series of new use cases, and Solana has an early lead in that regard.\u201d Coinbase\n\nDespite the growing popularity of Solana, Ethereum is still the most important smart contract platform in the cryptocurrency space, Coinbase noted. Processing an average of around 1 million transactions per day and maintaining a consistent daily transfer volume between $1 billion and $3 billion, Ethereum\u2019s status as the top platform for decentralized applications \u201cmay not be displaced anytime soon,\u201d Coinbase claims.\n\nAs of press time, ETH is trading at $2,280, demonstrating a 91% year-to-date increase, according to CoinGecko data. Solana\u2019s SOL is trading at $78.3 with a staggering 697% increase in 2023.\n\nCoinbase noted, though, that while Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the smart contract space is likely to persist in the near future, Solana\u2019s scalability and performance could make it a viable alternative for some use cases in 2024.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s experts added that in addition to Solana, a group of other layer-1 networks such as Aptos, Sui, Sei, and others are likely to increase competition in the space as they \u201chandle scalability demands at the base layer.\u201d\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary trader and investor Peter Brandt has once again shown he is not a fan of Ethereum (ETH), with a mind-numbing forecast about the coin\u2019s future. According to Peter Brandt, he did not foresee Ethereum living up to be a listed digital currency in the next 10 years, a rather gloomy projection for a coin that is currently the second largest, after Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands for $2,269.34, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours and by more than 3.7% in the trailing seven-day period. While Peter Brandt's decade prediction of Ethereum is a major concern to note, his differing position stems from the belief that the digital currency is not a worthy store of value.\n\nIn his post on X, Peter Brandt said ETH is not a comparable store of value when placed side by side with Bitcoin, and he acknowledged not understanding why traders often choose to HODL the coin.\n\nEther $ETH is not comparable to $BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC\n\nAnd the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\n\nMy prediction is that ETH may not even be a listed asset in 10 years https://t.co/4WQ7wnFWEO \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 14, 2023\n\nTo Peter Brandt, the bad functionality of Ethereum and the skyrocketing gas fees might eventually be its demise in the long run. With how relatively unusable ETH is, Brandt boldly labeled the asset as a \"piece of junk.\"\n\nEthereum on radar of most experts\n\nThe fact that Ethereum pioneered a different aspect of the industry makes it a subject of comparison for many experts in the space.\n\nBesides the gloom shared by Peter Brandt, Raoul Pal also waded into the Ethereum versus Solana debate recently. The top analyst labeled Ethereum as the Android of the crypto ecosystem while naming Solana as the iOS of the industry.\n\nUnlike Brandt, many experts foresee a brighter future for Ethereum, especially as it currently powers some of the most innovative layer-2 protocols in the industry, including Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), among others."

        "content": "The latest report from Coinbase indicates that despite the emergence of competing networks like Solana, Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum presently accounts for around 57% of the total value locked in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with its market capitalization being second only to that of Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Resilient Position\n\nCoinbase\u2019s 2024 Crypto Market Outlook reveals that Ethereum is still leading in the smart contract space.\n\nDespite the rapid expansion of Layer-2 scaling solutions and the emergence of new rollup stacks, Ethereum\u2019s mainnet remains a hub of activity. The report highlights that these Layer-2 solutions are vying more with alternative Layer-1 platforms rather than detracting from Ethereum.\n\nNotably, the share of Ethereum (ETH) locked on rollup-linked bridges has surged, showing its steadfast position even as the landscape shifts.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, JPMorgan\u2019s analysis projects a bright future for Ethereum. They predict a sustained market presence and a potential increase in Ethereum\u2019s market share within the crypto ecosystem, possibly even outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is supported by the anticipated Proto-danksharding upgrade, set for release in the first half of 2024. This upgrade, pivotal for Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency, is particularly beneficial for Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe upgrade aims to improve the efficiency of these networks by promising to increase network throughput and decrease transaction fees.\n\nThe Rise of Solana\n\nOn the other hand, Solana has been getting attention for its potential rise. According to Finbold\u2019s report, Solana is expected to continue its upward trajectory, potentially reaching 10% of Ethereum\u2019s market cap, a milestone previously achieved.\n\nThis projection is based on Solana\u2019s transaction speed and scalability, which outpaces Ethereum. Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem has also been on a steady rise, reaching a new yearly peak in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nThese factors feed into the narrative that Solana might eclipse Ethereum in future bull markets, particularly in areas demanding high throughput, like decentralized exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s landscape continues to diversify, with each platform establishing its niche based on distinct strengths and capabilities.\n\nEthereum\u2019s anticipated upgrades and sustained dominance in the DeFi space solidify its position as a key player. However, the agility and scalability of Solana present a compelling narrative for its potential expansion in the years ahead."

        "content": "In the ongoing debate of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, renowned market trader Peter Brandt has expressed significant doubts about Ethereum\u2019s future, contrasting sharply with other market experts. Brandt, known for his blunt analysis, questioned Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability, particularly in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nPeter Brandt Predicts Dim Future for Ethereum\n\nBrandt, a respected figure in market trading circles, has openly criticized Ethereum, challenging the popular notion that it might soon outpace Bitcoin. He raised a fundamental question regarding investors\u2019 preference for Ethereum over Bitcoin, which he sees as a superior store of value. His comments come amidst bullish forecasts from other market experts and institutions, including JPMorgan. These predictions often highlight Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, especially with its upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Protodanksharding.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Brandt\u2019s skepticism about Ethereum is rooted in its structural and functional aspects. He specifically pointed out the high transaction fees, or \u2018gas fees,\u2019 associated with Ethereum, labelling the digital currency as inefficient. These fees, in his view, severely detract from Ethereum\u2019s value as an investment asset. Furthermore, he controversially suggested that Ethereum might lose its relevance entirely within the next decade.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Fate Tied to Key Price Level\n\nBrandt\u2019s stance starkly contrasts with other leading analysts like Raoul Pal, who have a more favorable outlook on Ethereum. Despite differing opinions, Brandt acknowledged his respect for these analysts but did not waver from his critical perspective.\n\nIn his analysis, Brandt emphasized the importance of the ETH/BTC price chart. He pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s future could hinge on its performance relative to Bitcoin, specifically if it manages to maintain above the 0.04803 level. Should this level hold, Brandt conceded that the \u201cimminent funeral\u201d for Ethereum could be postponed, albeit temporarily.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Brandt has expressed skepticism about Ethereum. In previous statements, he has questioned its decentralization and even referred to it as a \u201cpiece of crap\u201d cryptocurrency. His consistent critique of Ethereum has been a topic of discussion in trading circles, influencing perceptions among investors.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Price Prediction As Bull Trap Puts $ETH At Risk of 12% Drop"

        "content": "In a new development for the tokenization ecosystem, the ERC3643 standard has achieved \u2018Final\u2019 status in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP). The EIP process, essential for proposing and implementing upgrades, features, and standards, has seen the ERC3643 standard join the ranks of influential protocols like ERC20 and ERC721. What sets ERC3643 apart is its specialization in compliant tokenization, addressing the limitations of the widely-used ERC20 standard, particularly in the realm of securities activities.\n\nUnlike ERC20, ERC3643 integrates controlled advanced functions and compliance modules, making it the permissioned token standard for a wide array of use cases, including securities, real-world assets, payment systems, and loyalty programs. The standard dynamically verifies user eligibility through a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, ensuring compliance via anonymous but verifiable credentials. This empowers token issuers with continuous control over tokens, facilitating governance and adherence to regulatory requirements.\n\nThe association emphasizes that achieving \u2018Final\u2019 status for ERC3643 is a testament to their commitment to providing a robust standard for enterprises seeking to deploy permissioned tokens on any EVM-compatible blockchain efficiently and compliantly. This achievement is poised to enhance collaboration and interoperability, aligning with the overarching goals of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe ERC3643 standard is positioned to redefine how enterprises engage with blockchain technology, offering a secure and compliant framework for tokenizing diverse assets. Its recognition as an official standard underscores the Ethereum community\u2019s dedication to meeting the diverse needs of its users and establishing a benchmark for institutions looking to leverage ERC3643 for their tokenization initiatives.\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into the ERC3643 EIP, further information is available on the association\u2019s platform.\n\nAbout ERC3643 Association\n\nThe ERC3643 Association is a non-profit organization regrouping industry leaders within a shared mission to advance the adoption of the ERC3643 standard and promote the development of a standardized, secure, and compliant tokenization framework. The association brings together the expertise and resources of its members to foster collaboration, drive innovation, and create a more inclusive, efficient, and secure financial landscape. By supporting the widespread adoption of the ERC3643 standard, the association aims to unlock the full potential of tokenization and pave the way for a new era of global asset management.\n\nRead other stories: Pave Bank Emerges with $5.2 Million Funding to Pioneer Programmable Banking\n\nProject Diamond Launches Smart Contract Platform for Digitally Native Assets"

        "content": "After a year of dormancy, a significant Ethereum whale has reemerged, creating ripples in the cryptocurrency market, with Lookonchain reporting this unexpected move. The whale, silent for over twelve months, initiated a substantial selling spree, offloading 18,865 ETH for a staggering 42 million DAI through four newly created wallets. This activity translates to an average selling price of $2,229 per ETH.\n\nThe market has been abuzz with speculation and analysis following this development. The revived whale\u2019s actions have led to the sale of a considerable amount of Ethereum, amounting to a current value of $12.5 million, with 5,588 ETH remaining in their possession. This event has caught the attention of both investors and analysts, given the significant amount of cryptocurrency involved and its potential impact on the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrasting Whale Behaviors\n\nThis selling trend by a dormant whale contrasts sharply with the behaviours observed in other segments of the Ethereum whale community. Crypto analyst Ali highlighted a contrasting scenario where several of the largest Ethereum whales have been actively accumulating ETH.\n\nETH/USD price chart\n\nOver the past week, these whales have reportedly added over 100,000 ETH, valued at approximately $230 million, to their holdings. This divergence in strategies underscores the varied approaches and sentiments prevalent among significant investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Current Market Position\n\nAmidst these developments, Ethereum\u2019s market performance remains a focal point. At the time of reporting, ETH experienced a slight upturn, with a 1.12% increase over the last 24 hours, bringing its value to $2,255.\n\nIntoTheBlock data suggests that Ethereum is trading in a crucial zone, with significant support and resistance levels identified. The $2,332 and $2,403 price points are key barriers in ETH\u2019s potential ascent towards the $3,000 mark, while support is around $2,127.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees continue to play a critical role in its market dynamics. The past week saw approximately 35,000 ETH burned, continuing a trend of negative net issuance that started in early November. These factors collectively contribute to the ever-changing landscape of Ethereum\u2019s market as investors and analysts closely watch these developments unfold.\n\nRead Also: XRP Ledger (XRPL) Hosts Phase 2 of Palau Stablecoin Project"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surge in volatility as the digital assets Bitcoin and Ethereum entered into a minor correction. This pullback has plunged the ETH price from a recent top of $2400 to $2238, registering a 7.4% loss. However, this retracement lies within the range of a rising channel pattern and projects the recovery is intact.\n\nAlso Read: Peter Brandt Stirs Debate with Harsh Critique of Ethereum\n\nadvertisement\n\nChannel Pattern Hints Next Jump Above $2500\n\nA channel pattern leads the current recovery trend in the ETH price\n\nUntil the pattern\u2019s lower trendline is intact, the coin holders can enjoy the bull rally\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nSince mid-October, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a robust recovery, beginning with a rebound from the $1522 support level. This rally is best understood through the lens of a channel pattern, characterized by two ascending trendlines that have been providing dynamic resistance and support to the price movements.\n\nOn December 13th, the Ethereum price marked its latest recovery from the lower trendline of this pattern, evidenced by a morning star candle formation. This reversal propelled the price to its current level of $2243, signaling the onset of a new bull cycle within the confines of the channel pattern.\n\nIf the ETH price continues to adhere to the trajectory set by this channel pattern, we could see a 12-15% surge, potentially reaching the upper trendline in the region of $2500 to $2600. As long as these two trendlines remain intact, Ethereum is likely to maintain its upward trajectory, albeit with minor pullbacks along the way.\n\nHowever, a breakout above the channel\u2019s resistance could significantly amplify buying momentum, potentially leading to a more substantial recovery. In such a scenario, initial targets could be set at $2730, with a further potential rise to $3260, marking key milestones in Ether\u2019s bullish journey\n\nCan ETH Price Fall Back to $2000\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum price seems strongly bullish, the rising channel pattern in a strong rally can commonly lead to a decisive breakdown from the lower trendline. This breakdown would likely intensify the selling pressure and trigger a significant correction in ETH price. Thus, under the influence of this pattern, the Ethereum coin may revisit $2000 coin again\n\nBollinger band: Despite the current retracement in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator , indicates the recovery momentum is active.\n\nRelative Strength Index: A lower high formation in the daily RSI slope reflects the weakening of buyers\u2019 strength in the market."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThere is an ongoing dramatic shift in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world as power is changing hands between Solana (SOL) and the de facto industry leader Ethereum (ETH). Over the past 24 hours, data from DefiLlama shows that Solana has flipped Ethereum in total decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for the first time in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data shows that Solana has recorded an impressive boost of $1.536 billion in 24 hours, while Ethereum has amassed only $1.164 billion. The weekly change in Solana comes in at 54.21% at the time of writing, while Ethereum suffered more than an 8% decline. This impressive flipping has been labeled by many as a rare occurrence, with Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko acknowledging his disbelief at the huge milestone.\n\nSolana's growth tempo has been encompassing thus far this year as it previously surpassed Ethereum in the NFT sales stat. While the digital currency has the highest growth margin in the year-to-date (YTD) period among the cryptocurrencies in the top 15, it achieved this run at a time when its future was destabilized following the implosion of FTX and the accompanying SOL sell-offs.\n\nWhile the daily flipping has been recorded, Solana now sets sight on outranking XRP in market cap and Ethereum in total value locked (TVL) and cumulative volume.\n\nSolana price outlook\n\nSolana's price is shockingly buckling under its own weight with a menacing sell-off. At the time of writing, Solana is changing hands at a price of $74, down by 5.65%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe ongoing sell-off is reflected in the 5.5% slump in market cap to $31,636,851,169 and the over 20% drop in trading volume to $2,358,903,714. While the sell-off is a major concern, Solana is still relatively in a better place with the price generally trading at its highest level for the year.\n\nSolana's year-to-date growth is 657%, and many see the current price drop as a healthy correction."

        "content": "The Ethereum community has officially signed off on the ERC-3643 Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), establishing it as a recognized standard for compliant tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).\n\nAccording to a Dec. 15 announcement, the proposal reached its final status, meaning it has been formally reviewed, discussed and agreed upon within the Ethereum community. It\u2019s a similar process to the way ERC-20 and other popular standards were established in the past.\n\nEthereum Community Approves #ERC3643 as the First #Tokenization Standard\n\n\n\nWe're proud to announce that the ERC3643 standard has achieved 'Final' status in its #Ethereum Improvement Proposal (#EIP).\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://t.co/Z4XzijY6se#RWA pic.twitter.com/DhR3XmGrVU \u2014 ERC3643.org (@ERC3643Org) December 15, 2023\n\nERC-3643 is a standard for securities tokenization, RWAs, payment systems and loyalty programs. It verifies users\u2019 eligibility for a token via a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, providing anonymous yet verifiable credentials, the association behind the proposal explained.\n\nThe approved standard, which was proposed in 2021, is built on top of ERC-20 and incorporates two distinct permission layers to enhance security and compliance.\n\nThe first layer focuses on the identity and eligibility of the transaction\u2019s receiver, utilizing ERC-734/-735 standards to verify if the necessary claims are present on the identity and are authenticated by trusted claim issuers. The second layer implements global restrictions on the token itself, such as limits on daily token volume and the maximum number of token holders, providing controlled and regulated token circulation.\n\nAsset tokenization involves converting the value of a physical or digital asset into a digital token on a blockchain or distributed ledger. Possible benefits of asset tokenization include increased liquidity, faster settlements, transparency and accessibility to various markets. Real-world applications include enabling fractional trading of real estate, art, financial assets and intellectual property.\n\nManagement consulting firm Roland Berger estimates that asset tokenization will have grown to a market worth $10 trillion by 2030, a significant rise from the current value of around $300 billion.\n\nAsset tokenization is being considered by a wide range of traditional and crypto-native firms as one of the main trends in finance. Notable companies exploring the technology include JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale. Data from VanEck Research shows the total market capitalization for RWAs reached $342 billion in September despite the crypto industry\u2019s headwinds.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto \u2014 Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

        "content": "In a recent episode of The Scoop podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predict a high likelihood of the SEC approving a series of spot Bitcoin ETFs between Jan. 5-10.\n\nSeyffart and Balchunas\u2019s prediction aligns with the final deadline for the ARK and 21Shares application, initially filed in April, preceding other major players like BlackRock in June in a competitive field of 12 firms.\n\nSeyffart speculates that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been strategically delaying decisions, possibly to align multiple approvals simultaneously. This approach would prevent any single firm from gaining an unfair advantage. Seyffart warns that if the SEC were to deny these applications, it would represent a significant shift in its approach, akin to \u201cgoing nuclear.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ashcryptoreal/status/1735690467126169851\n\nYou might also like: Goldman Sachs forecasts dramatic surge in blockchain asset trading volumes by 2025\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reluctance to play kingmaker in the cryptocurrency ETF arena reflects its efforts to maintain neutrality and fairness. Seyffart, citing various sources, believes that the SEC\u2019s pattern of behavior, especially observed during the approval of ether futures ETFs earlier this year, indicates a likelihood of mass approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nThe conversation also touched on Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory against the SEC, which could influence the approval of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Seyffart notes that this case has backed the SEC into a corner, potentially accelerating approvals.\n\nHowever, the path for spot ether ETFs appears more complex, given the differences in market robustness and underlying technologies between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). While optimistic, Seyffart suggests that approvals for ether spot ETFs are more likely towards the end of May 2024, yet with less certainty compared to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYou might also like: SEC is taking \u2018new look\u2019 at spot Bitcoin ETF applications\n\nSeyffart also explains that following the SEC\u2019s 19b-4 process approval, ETFs \u201cmust have their S-1 prospectuses cleared by the SEC\u2019s Corporate Finance division before trading can commence.\u201d This process could introduce delays, adding to the uncertainty of a precise timeline for the ETFs\u2019 market debut.\n\nSeyffart anticipates a cautious initial uptake regarding market reception due to the rigorous due diligence processes of major brokerages and banks. However, he predicts that BlackRock might expedite the inclusion of these ETFs on various platforms, given its strong industry relationships.\n\nNice find here: Gensler's staff met with BlackRock yesterday to talk $IBTC but it wasn't normal crew, more public policy folks incl BlackRock's Public Policy Director Ben Tecmire who btw used to be senior counsel at the SEC's Division of Inv Mgmt https://t.co/bMePGpOufK \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 15, 2023\n\nSeyffart expressed confidence in the long-term success of these ETFs, projecting substantial capital inflows driven by both hype and the strategic interests of major asset owners.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum market has recently witnessed a tempting approach toward the $2,500 mark. However, this price movement occurs amid a less-than-ideal backdrop for its decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which is currently struggling and showing no imminent signs of regaining its lost positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe underperformance of Ethereum's DeFi sector can be attributed to several factors, one of which is the soaring transaction fees that have rendered the layer-1 platform challenging for average users.\n\nNetwork fees have escalated to levels that are widely considered unreasonable, severely impacting usability. In response to these persistent issues, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at the integration of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) scaling solutions directly into the mainnet, an advancement eagerly anticipated by the community.\n\nAmid Ethereum's challenges, competitors like Solana are capturing attention, with its platform maintaining lower fees and higher transaction throughput. This competition has intensified the pressure on Ethereum to enhance its scalability and efficiency to maintain its leading position in the blockchain space.\n\nEthereum's price action offers a compelling narrative. The chart illustrates a notable uptrend, with the price having recently surged above multiple key moving averages, a bullish indicator for many traders. The convergence of the 50-day moving average above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages could suggest sustained bullish momentum. However, this positive trend is met with caution as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hints at a market that is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for volatility.\n\nThe chart also reveals that Ethereum has encountered resistance as it approaches the $2,500 level. This resistance zone is critical, and a convincing breakout above it could signal the start of a new rally. However, with the current strain on Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem and the competitive heat from blockchains like Solana, the potential for a breakthrough to $2,500 is enveloped in uncertainty.\n\nBONK's meteoric meme rise\n\nThe meteoric rise of Bonk (BONK) has sent ripples across the crypto industry, with its valuation reaching the billion-dollar mark and positioning it as a serious contender in the meme coin space. The recent listings on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, have played a pivotal role in propelling BONK to new heights, reminding us of the astonishing ascent of Shiba Inu (SHIB) during the previous year's bull run.\n\nThe price chart for BONK displays a sharp upward trajectory, indicating a frenzied accumulation phase that often accompanies a new listing's excitement. Such price action is not uncommon for meme coins, which can capture the imagination of the trading community and lead to explosive short-term gains. The high social media buzz and community backing seem to reinforce the potential of BONK as the next viral sensation.\n\nHowever, seasoned market observers and analysts caution that the meme coin sector is notorious for its boom-and-bust cycles. As BONK's market cap has eclipsed that of other well-known meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE, comparisons to SHIB's rise are inevitable. Yet, there is an air of skepticism about whether BONK can maintain this blistering pace or if it will succumb to the same fate that befalls many high-flying tokens after the initial euphoria fades.\n\nIt is also important to stay extremely cautious when interacting with assets like Bonk: meme coins often experience significant corrections after such rapid expansions in price. The historical performance of similar assets suggests that BONK could face a challenging road ahead, especially if broader market sentiment shifts. While the dream of dethroning SHIB as a top meme coin is alive, the path is fraught with the potential for high volatility and sudden market turns."

Currently, all execution layer (EL) and consensus layer (CL) client combinations, including the Prysm client, have been onboarded to Devnet 12. MEV-Boost software has been activated for the majority of these client combinations, except for Prysm client combinations.\n\nThe much-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade will bring changes across Ethereum's two mainnet layers: the execution layer (EL) and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nThe upgrade to the execution layer is dubbed Cancun, while the consensus layer will receive the Deneb upgrade, forming the name Deneb-Cancun (or Dencun).\n\nThe exciting Dencun upgrade aims to tackle Ethereum's scalability challenges by implementing an improvement proposal named EIP-4844.\n\nAs earlier reported, developers might most likely begin upgrading public Ethereum testnets after the holidays in Q1, 2024.\n\nThe Goerli testnet, as it is presently known, will be sunsetting soon. Teams will begin exiting their validators either three months after the Dencun activation or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later. Notably, the Dencun network upgrade will be the last one implemented on the network."

        "content": "The Ethereum network has reached a new milestone by adopting the ERC-3643 Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP). This development marks a significant step forward in compliant asset tokenization. Following rigorous review and discussions, the Ethereum community has officially recognized ERC-3643, mirroring the path previously taken by standards like ERC-20.\n\nDetails of the ERC-3643 Standard\n\nERC-3643 introduces a robust framework for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), securities, payment systems, and loyalty programs. It distinguishes itself by integrating a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework. This feature verifies users\u2019 eligibility for a token, offering anonymous yet verifiable credentials. The standard builds upon the foundation of ERC-20 and incorporates two critical layers of permissions to enhance security and compliance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe first layer scrutinizes the identity and eligibility of transaction recipients. It leverages ERC 734/735 standards to ensure that identities hold necessary claims authenticated by trusted claim issuers. The second layer places global restrictions on the token itself. These restrictions include limits on daily token volume and the maximum number of token holders, ensuring regulated token circulation.\n\nImpact on Asset Tokenization\n\nAsset tokenization, which involves converting the value of physical or digital assets into blockchain-based digital tokens, can benefit significantly from this development. Benefits of this process include heightened liquidity, faster settlements, increased transparency, and broader market accessibility. The applications span diverse fields, ranging from fractional trading of real estate and art to financial assets and intellectual property.\n\nThe market potential for asset tokenization is vast with Roland Berger, a management consulting firm, projecting the market to grow to $10 trillion by 2030, up from the current $300 billion. Traditional financial institutions and crypto-native companies alike are exploring this technology.\n\nMoreover, major firms like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale are already delving into this domain. Despite the crypto industry\u2019s challenges, VanEck Research data indicates that the total market capitalization for RWAs stood at $342 billion as of September.\n\nRead Also: Coinbase vs SEC: XRP Lawyer Says SEC Chair is \u201cGas Lighting\u201d Americans"

Blockchain and non-fungible tokens can be used to establish the provenance of images, video, music, and other media.\n\nMoreover, blockchain can help make the decision-making processes of generative AI models more transparent, allowing users to scrutinize the logic and reliability of the AI-produced outcomes."

Despite being the second-largest cryptocurrency, Brandt questions Ethereum\u2019s ability to serve as a reliable store of value, especially when compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHe criticizes Ethereum for its functionality issues and high gas fees, foreseeing potential challenges ahead. In straightforward terms, Brandt labels Ethereum as a \u201cpiece of junk\u201d due to what he sees as its lack of usefulness.\n\nEthereum Under the Slammer\n\nIn a recent X post, Peter Brandt voiced his dissatisfaction with Ethereum, deeming it an inferior store of value compared to Bitcoin. He expressed confusion about traders choosing to hold onto the coin.\n\nEther $ETH is not comparable to $BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC\n\nAnd the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\n\nMy prediction is that ETH may not even be a listed asset in 10 years https://t.co/4WQ7wnFWEO \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 14, 2023\n\nAccording to Brandt, Ethereum\u2019s poor functionality and soaring gas fees could potentially lead to its downfall in the long run. He boldly went so far as to label the asset a \u201cpiece of junk\u201d due to its perceived lack of utility and usability. This critical stance from a seasoned trader like Brandt adds to the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,274.34, experiencing a 0.6% dip in the past 24 hours and a more substantial 3.7% decrease over the last seven days, as per Coinpedia news.\n\nBrandt\u2019s skepticism about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects is grounded in his assertion that digital currencies, in general, do not serve as reliable stores of value.\n\nHere\u2019s A Contrasting View: JPMorgan Claims Ethereum Will Outshine Bitcoin in 2024; Here\u2019s Why\n\nPutting the Spotlight on Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s unique position as a pioneer in the blockchain industry has made it a focal point for comparison among experts. While Peter Brandt\u2019s assessment paints a gloomy picture, other industry figures, such as Raoul Pal, have engaged in the Ethereum versus Solana debate.\n\nI do think there is a >20% chance that this cycle in Crypto and Exponential Age tech is an Everything, Everywhere, All at Once adoption cycle. The narrative/price will probably outrun the reality however, but by 2030 all forecasting will go out the window\u20261/ \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 10, 2023\n\nPal characterized Ethereum as the \u201cAndroid\u201d of the crypto ecosystem, contrasting it with Solana, which he likened to the \u201ciOS\u201d of the industry.\n\nThere Is Still Hope!\n\nDespite Brandt\u2019s less optimistic stance, a group of experts remains hopeful about Ethereum\u2019s future. The blockchain keeps innovating through various layer-2 protocols, including Polygon zkEVM, Arbitron (ARB), and Optimism (OP). These developments show a lively and robust ecosystem within the Ethereum network, countering the prevailing doubt and hinting at potential breakthroughs.\n\nAs Ethereum faces skepticism, we\u2019ll see if it can overcome the hurdles pointed out by Brandt.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has been showing some good price action with the ETH price shooting all the way to $2,300 earlier this week. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,281 with a market cap of $274 billion.\n\nFTX and Celsius Deposit Large Amounts of ETH to Exchanges\n\nAs per the latest data, two bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Celsius Networks have been depositing large amounts of ETH to the crypto exchanges. Both FTX and Celsius Network have initiated substantial Ethereum (ETH) transfers following the resurgence of ETH prices above $2,300.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per data by SpotonChain, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network executed a substantial ETH deposit of 7,500 ETH (equivalent to $17.4 million) to FalconX approximately 8 hours ago. This move comes on the heels of Celsius depositing a staggering 25,000 ETH (equivalent to $57 million) to both FalconX and Coinbase in the past week. The strategic transfers indicate notable activity and investment decisions within Celsius Network.\n\nOn the other hand, FTX made a significant move by transferring 1,593 ETH (equivalent to $3.66 million) to the address labeled 0xCeF around 55 minutes ago. Notably, the destination address 0xCeF currently holds 2,244 ETH (equivalent to $5.16 million) and hints at a potential ETH deposit to Coinbase in the near future. FTX\u2019s timely and sizable transactions add to the dynamic landscape of crypto exchanges responding to market movements.\n\nThese substantial ETH transfers from Celsius Network and FTX underscore the evolving strategies and positions of major crypto entities amid the cryptocurrency market\u2019s continuous fluctuations. Investors and enthusiasts are keenly observing these movements for potential insights into market trends and upcoming developments.\n\nEthereum Price Action Ahead\n\nThe Ethereum (EHT) price has been able to sustain above $2,300 and has been facing rejection at those levels. On the downside, the crucial demand zone for ETH is from $1,934 to $2,160. Within this demand zone, 5.58 million addresses have been holding a total of nearly 40 million $ETH.\n\nIf there is a decline below the $2050 level, where the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned, it would signal a negative development, prompting a reassessment of the overall situation. However, the likelihood of such a scenario occurring in the near term appears low. Therefore, the current perspective suggests adopting a strategy of buying on market downturns. The $2100 level is anticipated to act as a significant support zone. In the event that prices approach this level, there is an expectation that a considerable number of buyers will seize the opportunity to acquire \u201cdiscounted Ethereum,\u201d contributing to a substantial upward movement in the market. Baking giant JPMorgan believes that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the coming year 2024."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the largest and most used decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 layer-1 blockchain infrastructure. Its native token, ETH, is also the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with $270 billion at the time of publication.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s price is up 85% in the last year, now trading at $2,249 per token. This surge has rewarded ETH holders, who are now 76% in profit, according to data by IntoTheBlock on December 16.\n\nIn particular, the percentage of Ethereum investors in profit is the same as long-term holders, who have kept their positions for over a year. Both data sets are achieved by looking at all active addresses in the network from the received and spent transactions.\n\nHowever, 23% of all Ethereum wallets are holding a losing ETH position, while 1% acquired the token at current prices. At the same time, 21% of Ethereum holders have held their position for between one and 12 months, while 3% just recently bought ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders data. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIs it time to buy ETH with 76% of Ethereum holders in profit?\n\nIt is important to understand that the higher the number of Ethereum holders in profit, the higher the likelihood of a sell-off, as they might want to realize the, so far, unrealized profit. Therefore, buying ETH right now could mean becoming the profitable exit liquidity for 76% of all Ethereum holders.\n\nMeanwhile, only 46% of the tokens are concentrated in the hands of addresses holding at least 0.1% of its supply. The low concentration of whales and institutional investors lowers the risk of huge coordinated sell-offs. Balancing the previous analysis.\n\nCryptocurrency traders controversially believe we are experiencing either a bull rally in a bear market or a bull market already. Understanding the current status of cryptocurrencies is essential to make a profitable decision of buying or not buying ETH.\n\nMoreover, further developments and DeFi ecosystem growth for Ethereum could generate more demand for its token. An increased demand would drive ETH prices up, while a reduced demand would create an opposite outcome.\n\nAll things considered, the decision to buy ETH is personal, and investors must be aware of the risks. Essentially, having a good risk management start is necessary while investing in such a volatile and experimental market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Greed remains the main driving force of the crypto market in recent days, and the corresponding index is on its way to the extreme greed zone. Its cap has risen by 0.3% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has seen about zero change, with trampling around $42.8K.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard was designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain and tokens like RATS, SATS and ORDI are BRC-20 tokens. One of the key reasons for BRC-20 popularity is that the token standard unlocks new capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain when used in DeFi applications.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is likely to overshadow Bitcoin price performance in 2024 said JP Morgan analysts in a recent note. Ether traded in the $2,400 region after nearly three weeks of consolidation but this uptrend seems to have lost momentum as Bitcoin price takes a hit this week . Despite the Bitcoin ETF approval hype, ETH continues to remain largely neutral as other altcoins outperform Ether. In the near future, ETH is likely to slip into sideways movement due to a few reasons: a slump in on-chain activity, a delay in ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a fast-approaching holiday season, and a lack of momentum to push Bitcoin price higher.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the 2nd-largest digital asset, made a strong surge earlier this week, briefly reaching $2,300 before settling at $2,281, boasting a hefty market cap of $274 billion. Ethereum\u2019s price action has been crucial, consistently testing the $2,300 mark while encountering resistance.\n\nWith 5.58 million addresses holding nearly 40 million ETH in the critical zone from $1,934 to $2,160, ETH\u2019s resilience remains noteworthy. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around 60 levels indicates upward momentum, reflecting a favorable scenario for the bulls.\n\nHowever, the market is on high alert for potential downtrends, eyeing support levels at $2,050 and $2,100. A drop below these thresholds might trigger a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to ETH\u2019s price falling further to $1,531 or $1,369.\n\nDespite the downtrend, Ethereum\u2019s price performance is promising today, there\u2019s an air of caution among investors. The prevailing strategy suggests capitalizing on market downturns, reinforcing the belief that opportunities arise amidst volatility.\n\nFTX, Celsius Network ETH Transfers Caused Market Ripples\n\nSimultaneously, bankrupt crypto firms FTX and Celsius Networks caused ripples in the market by executing significant ETH transfers. Celsius Network, in particular, conducted massive ETH deposits, funneling 7,500 ETH (worth $17.4 million) to FalconX and another substantial 25,000 ETH (valued at $57 million) to FalconX and Coinbase within the past week.\n\nFTX also joined the party, initiating a sizable move by transferring 1,593 ETH (equivalent to $3.66 million) to an address labeled 0xCeF, hinting at a potential ETH deposit to Coinbase shortly. These transactions from both entities reflect their strategic positions in response to Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics, closely observed by investors for future market trends.\n\nIn a Negative Market, Can Ethereum Hit $3,000?\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s daily chart showcases a promising green candle, hinting at potential price growth. Altcoin Sherpa, the crypto analysts speculate that the current scenario might be an opportune moment to acquire Ethereum before an anticipated rally. Some even predict Ethereum could soar to $3,000 in this impending uptrend.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s current positive sentiment fuels optimism for Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, igniting speculations on whether the ETH rally will continue with more consecutive green candles or retrace amidst fluctuating market sentiments. The next moves for Ethereum are being closely monitored as the crypto space braces for potential market shifts and ETH\u2019s continued price action. Will you buy before it rallies to $3K?"

        "content": "ETH\u2019s supply has dropped to its lowest level since the merge.\n\nA key indicator has shown the re-emergence of the bears in the ETH spot market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] supply has fallen to its lowest since the blockchain transitioned from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network in an event popularly referred to as \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nAlthough the week has witnessed an elevated cost of sending and receiving ETH, the network has also burned a significant amount of the cryptocurrency, leading to a shrinking overall supply.\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound.money, 31,829.06 ETH worth around $71.58 million have been burned in the last week. Within the same period, newly issued coins totaled 16,535 ETH.\n\nAMBCrypto found that since the merge, 320,870.92 ETH worth $721.68 million at the coin\u2019s current price has been removed from circulation. At press time, the leading altcoin\u2019s supply was 120.2 million ETH.\n\nProfit-takers control the market\n\nAt press time, the network\u2019s native coin traded at $2,249. Sharing a statistically significant correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], whose value has fallen by 5% in the last week, ETH\u2019s value has dipped by 6% within that period.\n\nAs profit-taking activity intensifies, there has been a steady decline in ETH accumulation. An on-chain assessment of the coin\u2019s network activity on a seven-day simple moving average revealed a drop in demand for the altcoin.\n\nData from Santiment showed that in the last week, the daily count of active addresses involved in ETH transactions has decreased by 2%.\n\nThe decline in ETH\u2019s network activity coincides with the re-emergence of the bears, as readings from the coin\u2019s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) showed.\n\nOn 12th December, the MACD line crossed below the trend line. This movement signaled the weakening of the coin\u2019s upward momentum, which ushered in the bears.\n\nSince then, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have trended downwards, suggesting that coin distribution has exceeded accumulation.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMoreso, amid the decline in demand for the alt, there has been an increase in its supply on exchanges in the past few days. According to data from CryptoQuant, ETH\u2019s exchange reserve has seen a 0.35% uptick in the last week.\n\nThis confirmed the trend of ETH holders sending their coins to exchange for onward sales to take a profit. As of this writing, ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was 14.27 million ETH."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum scaling network Arbitrum reported a \"partial outage\" Friday, bringing activity on the Arbitrum One blockchain to a standstill for the first time since June.\n\nOffchain Labs, the company that developed Arbitrum, announced that the network stalled at 10:29am ET Friday due to \u201ca significant surge in network traffic.\u201d The issue remained unresolved for well over an hour, ultimately resuming at 11:57am ET.\n\nFriday afternoon, Offchain Labs confirmed that the cause of the activity surge was indeed an abundance of \"inscriptions,\" as widely suspected\u2014that is, artwork and media being etched onto the blockchain, akin to NFTs but entirely on-chain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We can confirm that a sustained surge of inscriptions triggered the sequencer to stop relaying transactions properly,\" the Arbitrum account tweeted. \"We've resolved this issue, but due to the backlog, gas prices are recovering from the transaction volume. These should normalize soon.\"\n\nThe Arbitrum One sequencer is up and running after a temporary outage starting at 10:29 AM EST and resuming at 11:57 AM EST. The team is actively investigating, but we can confirm that a sustained surge of inscriptions triggered the sequencer to stop relaying transactions\u2026 \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) December 15, 2023\n\nOn Twitter, numerous Arbitrum users and Arbitrum-based services reported a complete inability to process transactions on the network since the outage began.\n\nArbiscan, a blockchain explorer for Arbitrum, initially attributed the network\u2019s failure to a \u201csurge in activities due to inscriptions,\u201d according to multiple Twitter users. It has since adjusted language on its website to match Arbitrum\u2019s official statement, deleting the reference to inscriptions.\n\nInscriptions, first popularized by the massive success of Bitcoin Ordinals earlier this year, are detailed images or other pieces of media that are carved into denominations of cryptocurrency. While incredibly costly and a major lift for blockchains to process, inscriptions made a fair deal of sense for the Bitcoin network, which due to its lack of smart contract capabilities has never been able to support NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut recently, some users have begun embarking on the incredibly energy-intensive project of creating inscriptions on networks that already support NFTs. Last week, inscriptions on the Polygon, BNB Chain, and Avalanche blockchains accounted for a whopping 57% of traffic across the three major networks, according to the pseudonymous blockchain analyst Hildobby.\n\n.@arbitrum is down. All DLN trades into Arbitrum are pending fulfillment until the network is up again pic.twitter.com/DUdVwelkLo \u2014 deAlex (@AlexSmirnov__) December 15, 2023\n\nIn the last week, inscription transactions have accounted for 30% of all traffic on Arbitrum One specifically, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nPrior to official confirmation of the cause, numerous Twitter users expressed their frustration at the possibility that inscription-related traffic brought down Arbitrum, as they feel the innovation is both unduly costly and fails to serve a practical function.\n\nWhat's the value prop of inscriptions on a layer two like Arbitrum? I need to know who is this fucking bored. \u2014 themovingavg (@themovingavg) December 15, 2023\n\nif this is because of inscriptions I will lose my shit lmao this is the 4th time that these things have totally destroyed a blockchain \u2014 mert | helius.dev (d/acc) (@0xMert_) December 15, 2023\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details after the cause was confirmed.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "A trader who accurately called Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 price floor is predicting massive moves to the upside for two top 50 altcoins.\n\nStarting with Solana (SOL), the analyst and trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 232,000 followers on the social media platform X that the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap will surge in value against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\nAccording to the analyst, the bullish SOL/BTC chart indicates that Solana will likely soar against the US dollar.\n\nThis was another banger SOL/BTC picolow call. Since the original post, it has rallied impulsively from the low in five waves and has now done yet another ABC down.

Initially, the pseudonymous crypto analyst had warned of a possible downward move for Bitcoin and Ethereum after the two leading crypto assets pulled back from their ascending channel highs.\n\n\u201cOvernight price action made me do a 180 on this take.

This is one of the few altcoins that managed to hit the highs since May 2022 in the last hours. At the $78 level, it has a chance to hit resistance. Here, we saw significant support for the declines in the first half of 2022, and its overcoming triggered a solid downward momentum.\n\nSo even now, we should be ready for a prolonged recharge with a potentially deep correction down to $55.

For traders, this could be the ideal reloading point to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Qh1P8lQMhk \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 13, 2023\n\nSince ETH was in a critical demand zone, AMBCrypto took a look at Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to see whether there were any sell-offs near those marks.\n\nAs per our analysis, when ETH\u2019s price reached the $2,170 mark, the token\u2019s liquidation did increase, as evident from the fluorescent lines. However, soon after that, the token\u2019s price rebounded and went up.\n\nThanks to that, ETH\u2019s price rallied by more than 4% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,264.32 with a market capitalization of over $272 billion.\n\nHowever, if ETH has to sustain its bull rally, it does have to cross a few resistance levels. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s liquidation heatmap revealed that it has to cross a crucial resistance level at the $2,300 mark in the near term.\n\nIf ETH manages to go above that, then ETH has to encounter another crucial roadblock at $2,450.\n\nSelling pressure on ETH is increasing\n\nHowever, the viability of ETH maintaining its bull rally looked slim if supply distribution was to be considered.\n\nAccording to an analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s exchange reserve was increasing, meaning that selling pressure was high.\n\nIts aSORP was also red, clearly suggesting that more investors were selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, it can indicate a market top.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum\u2019s derivatives metrics looked bullish as its taker buy/sell ratio remained green. Additionally, ETH\u2019s funding rate also remained green while its price increased.\n\nThis meant that futures investors were buying ETH while its price rose, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign."

        "content": "Buterin\u2019s proposal to restrict the maximum supply to 120,204,432 was rejected earlier.\n\nAs of this writing, 120,203,611 ETH coins were in circulation.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] supply dipped below the hard cap proposed by co-founder Vitalik Buterin some five years ago, sparking discussions about the asset\u2019s monetary policy within the community.\n\nNoted Ethereum developer Evan Van Ness took to social platform X to draw attention to this intriguing development.\n\nVitalik\u2019s dream comes to life!\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal to restrict the maximum supply to 120,204,432 was rejected in April 2018. However, little did he know that his objectives would ultimately come to fruition albeit through a different approach.\n\nAs of this writing, 120,203,611 ETH coins were in circulation, AMBCrypto discovered using ultra sound money data.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin [BTC], ETH doesn\u2019t have an issuance limit. Buterin\u2019s case for limiting ETH supply stemmed from concerns about centralization in the then proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, as well as a desire to improve the coin\u2019s long-term market prospects.\n\nAs per the proposal, the supply would exponentially approach the max cap and the rewards would exponentially approach zero, much on the lines of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, much water has flown under the bridge. Three years after his suggestion was dismissed, Ethereum implemented EIP-1559 as part of the London Hardfork. This included burning a portion of gas fees paid to miners, thus driving coins out of circulation.\n\nA year later, the Merge was executed, marking a shift from the PoW to the proof-of-stake (PoS) model. The pivotal event applied considerable deflationary pressure on ETH.\n\nAs seen by AMBCrypto, more than 307,000 ETH have exited circulation since the event, causing the net supply to shrink at an annual rate of 0.211%. The circulating supply was projected to drop to 117 million by the end of December 2025.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH looks set to push higher\n\nAs of this writing, ETH stayed strong above $2,200, according to CoinMarketCap data. Profit-taking by weak hands pulled the crypto down by more than 3% over the week.\n\nHowever, the broader sentiment still tilted towards buying. AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Hyblock Capital revealed a predominantly greedy ETH market. This could continue to sustain the momentum in the days to come."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nThe Ethereum community has approved the ERC-3643 standard. This standard is the first-ever designed specifically for compliant tokenization. This new standard improves upon the widely used ERC-20 standard, particularly in securities activities. It enhances ERC-20 tokens with controlled advanced functions and compliance modules.\n\nJoachim Lebrum, Chair of the Technology Working Group ERC-3643 Association, stated that:\n\n\u201cThe ERC3643 standard is a groundbreaking step towards integrating advanced blockchain solutions into the enterprise sector, and this validation sends echoes across the ecosystem that ERC3643 is the superior standard for such use cases.\u201d\n\nERC-3643 is a permissioned token standard for tokenizing securities, real-world assets (RWAs), payment systems, and loyalty programs. The standard uses a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework to verify users\u2019 token eligibility dynamically. This feature ensures compliance through anonymous but verifiable credentials.\n\nThe new ERC-3643 standard sets out to revolutionize how companies leverage blockchain technology. It provides them with a secure, compliant framework to tokenize various assets. Ethereum\u2019s official recognition of this standard demonstrates its goals to address users\u2019 diverse needs. It also establishes a benchmark for institutions implementing this framework in tokenization projects.\n\nCompanies now have an approved standard to actively deploy to bring real-world assets onto blockchains while integrating the necessary compliance controls and permissions.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, experts predict the momentum behind asset tokenization will accelerate. HSBC\u2019s research group forecasts the market for tokenized assets will swell to trillions of dollars by 2030. Governments and significant investment funds are demonstrating growing interest in this area. The next wave of tokenization will likely see bonds, equities, and other mainstream financial assets transitioning to blockchain-based models."

        "content": "The last month has seen resurging activity in Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work network.\n\nThis has been due to the general market rally.\n\nThe EthereumPoW [ETHW] network has witnessed a significant upsurge in activity due to the recent market rally, on-chain data has revealed.\n\nThis comes after an extended period of decline, during which demand for the chain plummeted to its lowest levels.\n\nEthereumPoW has seen traction in the last month\n\nA major indicator of the uptick in demand for the EthereumPoW network has been its hashrate, which has risen consistently since the 20th of November.\n\nAccording to data from 2Miners.com, in the 14 months prior, the network\u2019s hashrate had declined by 65%.\n\nThe drop in a network\u2019s hashrate is often due to a decline in the value of its native cryptocurrency. This makes mining less profitable, leading to miners leaving the network.\n\nInasmuch, in the 14 months preceding the hike in hashrate, ETHW\u2019s price had fallen by 98%.\n\nHowever, since the 20th of November, EthereumPoW\u2019s mining hashrate has grown. At 16.28TH/s at press time, it has since climbed by 52%.\n\nThe steady increase in the network\u2019s mining hashrate coincided with the rally in the value of its native coin. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETHW\u2019s price has grown by 70% in the last month.\n\nAs expected, the uptick in mining activity on the blockchain has also resulted in a similar uptrend in the chain\u2019s mining difficulty.\n\nAt press time, EthereumPoW\u2019s network difficulty was 209.59T, recording a 55% growth since the 20th of November.\n\nFurther, the total value of assets (TVL) locked by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols housed within EthereumPoW has also increased, data from DefiLlama showed.\n\nThe uptrend began on the 22nd of November, and the network\u2019s DeFi TVL has since gone up by 90%.\n\nHowever, EthereumPoW\u2019s DeFi TVL remained significantly lower than its October 2022 peak of $6 million at press time. The network\u2019s TVL was $215,294 at the time of writing, logging a 72% decline year-to-date (YTD).\n\nNetwork activity in the last 24 hours\n\nPer data from OKLink, EthereumPoW saw an influx of new addresses in the last 24 hours.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETHW Profit Calculator\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, 2469 new addresses were created on the blockchain, bringing the total number of addresses on the chain to 381 million.\n\nHowever, out of the 381 million total addresses on the chain, only 9,369 were deemed to be active."

        "content": "In this journey, we must keep an eye on the $2050 level, which is where the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average sits. If Ethereum drops below this level, it could spell trouble.\n\nEthereum has been on a roll lately, and it's not just a fluke.\n\nThe reason behind this rally is the growing speculation around central bank policies worldwide. You might wonder how these bank policies are connected to a digital currency like Ethereum, but the answer is simple.\n\nWhen central banks make big decisions, it affects the entire financial world, and Ethereum is part of that world.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nSo, what's the deal with Ethereum's recent price surge? Well, it's all about risk appetite. When people are feeling bold and ready to take risks, they tend to invest in assets like Ethereum. It's like a rollercoaster ride for investors, and Ethereum is one of the exciting markets when it comes to momentum and risk appetite aspects.\n\nBut here's the catch: even rollercoasters have their ups and downs. Ethereum is no different. We can expect a short-term pullback in its price. Think of it as a small dip in the rollercoaster ride. However, this dip can be a golden opportunity for smart investors. If Ethereum's price gets close to $2100, many buyers will swoop in to grab some \"cheap Ethereum.\"\n\nNext Target: $2500\n\nNow, let's look at the next target: $2500. This is the level that Ethereum enthusiasts are eyeing in the short term. If Ethereum manages to break above this level, we could see it go even higher. But breaking that barrier won't be a piece of cake; it's like reaching the summit of a challenging mountain. Nevertheless, it's not impossible, and Ethereum could conquer it eventually.\n\nIn this journey, we must keep an eye on the $2050 level, which is where the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average sits. If Ethereum drops below this level, it could spell trouble. We'd have to rethink our whole strategy. However, the chances of that happening in the near future seem slim. So, for now, it's best to see this as a \"buy on the dips\" opportunity.\n\nBut Ethereum isn't alone in this crypto adventure. Bitcoin, often considered the leader of the crypto pack, can influence the entire crypto world. So, if you plan to trade Ethereum, keep a watchful eye on the Bitcoin market as well. The two are closely connected, and what happens in one can affect the other.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum's recent rally is tied to the global speculation surrounding central bank policies. While we can expect some short-term ups and downs, Ethereum has the potential to reach new heights. Keep an eye on key levels, pay attention to Bitcoin, and stay aware of the US Dollar's influence.\n\nReady to trade our ETH/USD forecast? We\u2019ve made a list of the best Forex crypto brokers worth trading with."

        "content": "The ETH/BTC chart has been in a long-term downtrend.\n\nIn comparison, the strength of Bitcoin was clear and is likely to continue.\n\nSince October, Bitcoin [BTC] has rallied by an impressive 57.5% as of press time. In the same period, Ethereum [ETH] gains measured 48.34%. The difference is not much, but ETH has been underperforming for close to a year now.\n\nThis means that during times when Bitcoin runs higher, Ethereum doesn\u2019t achieve equivalent or higher gains. During periods of a downturn, Ethereum prices suffer more than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIs this trend likely to reverse?\n\nTechnical analysis of the ETH/BTC chart underlined gloom\n\nThe ETH/BTC chart on the one-day timeframe highlighted the downtrend that has been present since early June. The inference was that ETH just wasn\u2019t able to keep up in terms of performance. And the story doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe zone of resistance highlighted at the 0.055 region represented a key resistance zone that ETH bulls will need to breach to reverse their fortunes. However, the market structure was bearish.\n\nThe 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level was tested on 10th November. It was followed by a rapid reversal.\n\nA move below the 0.051 mark would signal that ETH/BTC was headed much further lower. If that happens, traders and investors could exit the ETH market if a higher timeframe bearish market structure break occurs.\n\nAssuming Bitcoin climbs above the $45k key resistance but ETH/BTC falls, participants could look to shift their funds to BTC to ride the trend higher.\n\nAssessing sell pressure on ETH and BTC\n\nA sign that sell pressure is imminent on an asset is if we spot large inflows to exchanges. If that happens, the exchange reserve for the asset would shoot skyward. In the case of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, this has not yet occurred.\n\nThe BTC exchange reserve has consistently trended lower since June. Despite the downtrend, there was a noticeable spike from 5th December to 12th December. Just after this spike, Bitcoin prices tumbled from $43.7k to $41.2k.\n\nThe Ethereum reserves saw less volatility. It, too, was in a downtrend and has been since February 2023.\n\nEthereum saw a small spike in the reserve between 11th-13th December, but the increase came during and after the price drop. This suggested that some holders panicked due to what they perceived as a shift in trend, while BTC\u2019s inflows preceded the fall.\n\nThe inference was Bitcoin reserves and flow could be a more accurate gauge of the next price direction than Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this was based only on the recent spike, and is not a practical finding with a large sample size. Nevertheless it is something to look out for.\n\nWhat is the sentiment of BTC and ETH like?\n\nA look at the social volume for both crypto assets revealed that, as expected, Bitcoin\u2019s social volume was far higher than Ethereum\u2019s. Even so, their trends were pretty similar. This could be because of their price performances being closely interrelated.\n\nWhen Bitcoin rallies, so does Ethereum, but just not as much.\n\nThe MVRV ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum also showed similar trends, but their magnitudes were vastly different. At press time, BTC stood at 41.17% while ETH was at 26.45%.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBoth values were at their respective six-month highs despite the recent dip in prices. The conclusion was that both assets were overvalued, with Bitcoin holders being at a greater profit, and hence, the happier.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these holders choose to realize their profits en masse and cause a large wave of selling."

Notable voices within the crypto space, including analysts from platforms like X, have echoed sentiments of a bullish trajectory for Ethereum.\n\n@CryptoJelleNL, a prominent crypto analyst, has confidently proposed an upward movement for Ethereum, asserting that the altcoin is poised for a rally to the coveted $3,000 mark within the current market cycle.\n\nOther experts, including @AltcoinSherpa, align with this optimistic viewpoint, identifying Ethereum\u2019s recent exit from a consolidation period below $2,000 as a precursor for the anticipated ascent towards $3,000 in the months ahead.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nChallenges Along Ethereum\u2019s Rally Path\n\nHowever, this bullish outlook faces potential hurdles in the form of resistance levels between $2,160 and $2,247.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s data highlights that approximately 1.04 million wallet addresses hold 5.49 million ETH tokens within this range, suggesting a formidable barrier that Ethereum must surpass to validate the optimistic rally projections.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nAt the time of writing this, Ethereum\u2019s trading price lingers around $2,230.38 on Binance, hovering in proximity to the $2,100 threshold, marking a weekly loss of nearly 5% for holders.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s current positioning within this pivotal demand zone sets the stage for a potentially transformative market movement. Analysts\u2019 bullish sentiments and the altcoin\u2019s resilience in the face of recent market turbulence paint an intriguing picture, as the crypto community eagerly anticipates Ethereum\u2019s journey towards the sought-after $3,000 milestone."

        "title": "Ethereum price likely to outperform BTC says JP Morgan report, but short-outlook remains flat despite ETF hype - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nInvesco Digital\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF\u2019s approval is delayed.\n\nEthereum price is likely to hover between the $2,030 and $2,539 levels for the next few weeks.\n\nOn-chain metrics note a decline in user activity, which could add headwinds to the uptrend.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is likely to overshadow Bitcoin price performance in 2024 said JP Morgan analysts in a recent note. Ether traded in the $2,400 region after nearly three weeks of consolidation but this uptrend seems to have lost momentum as Bitcoin price takes a hit this week. Despite the Bitcoin ETF approval hype, ETH continues to remain largely neutral as other altcoins outperform Ether. In the near future, ETH is likely to slip into sideways movement due to a few reasons: a slump in on-chain activity, a delay in ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a fast-approaching holiday season, and a lack of momentum to push Bitcoin price higher.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum revenue could double to $5 billion and fee may fall to $0.01 in 2024: Bitwise prediction\n\nSEC delays Ethereum ETF\n\nAs noted by Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart, the Commission has decided to delay the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF. The analyst adds that \u201cthis was early but completely expected.\u201d\n\nUpdate: SEC delayed @InvescoUS / @galaxyhq Ethereum ETF application -- This was early but completely expected. (Wasn't due until Dec 23rd I think) pic.twitter.com/jFCjnND3Rf \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 13, 2023\n\nInvesco and Galaxy Digital filed for an Ether spot ETF in September, but like Bitcoin\u2019s ETFs, Ether\u2019s is likely to be delayed before the SEC gives a decision. Additionally, the Commission remains unclear on its stance as to whether Ether is a security or a commodity, which makes the approval of an Ethereum ETF highly speculative.\n\nRead more: Hashdex tips spot Bitcoin ETF s to trade by Q2, followed by Ethereum\n\nEthereum price remains neutral-to-bullish\n\nEthereum price action between June 2022 and November 2023, created an ascending triangle setup. This technical formation is a bullish pattern in which the asset price creates higher lows and equal highs. In Ether\u2019s case, three distinctive higher lows and three equal highs formed.\n\nConnecting the equal highs shows a horizontal resistance level at $2,030. This level was broken on November 20, indicating the upside potential of the pattern was activated. The ascending triangle setup forecasts a 43% upswing to the $2,943 level, obtained by measuring the distance of the widest part of the triangle and extrapolating it higher.\n\nEthereum price\u2019s breakout was succeeded by a 16% rally to a local top at $2,403. Since then, ETH has dropped 6.3% and currently trades at $2,252. Going forward, the smart contract token is likely going to move sideways between the ascending triangle\u2019s base at $2,030 and the weekly resistance level at $2,539.\n\nA decisive flip of the $2,539 will open the path for Ethereum price to continue rising to its theoretical target of $2,943 or the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s Social Dominance metric has been trending lower since September 30, showing a decline in interest for ETH among investors.\n\nETH Social Dominance\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, On-chain Volumes saw a spike on November 10 but has been steadily slumping since then. The same can be said about Whale Transaction Count, which has also seen a decline.\n\nETH On-chain Volume, WTC\n\nWhile this is bearish in the short term, the Active Addresses have been in an uptrend since mid-September. Network Growth has also remained consistent, which shows that the investors are being patient about the mid-to-long term outlook.\n\nETH Active Addresses, Network Growth\n\nA decisive breakout above $2,539 could signal a bullish outlook for ETH. In such a case, the Ethereum price could eye a retest of the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $2,030 support level could trigger a 15% crash in Ethereum price to $1,727."

        "content": "The blockchain cryptocurrency industry has evolved substantially since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are two top altcoins that have contributed to the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nWhile Ethereum was the first to implement smart contracts, Solana expanded the possibilities by increasing scalability. Both have contributed to the emergence of Pullix (PLX), the new trifecta of crypto success. Let\u2019s find out why Pullix is now referred to as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now.\n\nEthereum Introduces a New Phase in Crypto\n\nEthereum (ETH) is widely considered as the blockchain industry\u2019s backbone. This is because the Ethereum network was the first to provide smart contracts and decentralized apps. The infrastructure has extended throughout the bitcoin industry.\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s popularity has propelled it to the top altcoins in the market today. Ethereum (ETH) is the project that led to the idea of a decentralized future since it created the framework for the launch of many projects.\n\nSolana\u2019s Scalability Increased the Possibilities\n\nWhile Ethereum introduced smart contracts, scalability remained a long-standing issue. In 2017, the Solana network was launched as a game changer. While Ethereum can only handle 8-18 transactions per second (TPS), the Solana network has the potential to handle 65,000 TPS.\n\nThis scalability caused the Solana coin to gain traction. It also led to a massive expansion of the network. The growth of the network has established the Solana coin as one of the top altcoins in the cryptocurrency market today.\n\nThe Emergence of Pullix (PLX)\n\nPullix is now being referred to as a trifecta of crypto success as it combines both concepts introduced by Ethereum and Solana. As an exchange, it combines the decentralization of Ethereum with the great scalability of Solana.\n\nPullix has thus unveiled an exchange platform that exceeds the competitors. As a result, the exchange functions in a safe and decentralized environment. Furthermore, it promotes a transparent trading system that eliminates intermediaries and lowers transaction fees.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s great scalability has enabled it to enter new markets. Users will be able to trade more than just cryptos on Pullix. Users will be able to trade assets from the stock, FX, commodities, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) markets.\n\nPullix has linked its DeFi cryptocurrency, PLX, to the trading platform in order to bring additional incentives to customers. PLX token holders will receive regular passive income transfers via providing liquidity.\n\nDue to these amazing features, there has been great interest in the platform\u2019s DeFi cryptocurrency, PLX. Over the last few days, almost a million PLX tokens have been snapped up. Fortunately, PLX is still available at a great price of $0.042 per token before its projected rally.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe combination of successful two models has made Pullix one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in at the moment. This is the reason why it is referred to as a trifecta of crypto success. Now is a great time to join the project before its projected rally of 100x.\n\nFor more information regarding the Pullix Presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nKeywords: top altcoins, best cryptocurrencies to invest in, DeFi cryptocurrency, altcoins, Ethereum, Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum network, Solana, Solana network, Solana coin\n\nMeta Title: Crypto Trifecta: Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Forge the Path for Pullix (PLX) Success\n\nMeta Description: Find out how Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have paved the way for the success of Pullix (PLX).\n\nShare this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Casinos: Unleashing the Power of Smart Contracts - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum Casinos: Revolutionizing Online Gambling through the Power of Smart Contracts\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of online gambling, Ethereum Casinos have emerged as pioneers, harnessing the transformative power of smart contracts. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology enables casinos to operate with unparalleled transparency, security, and efficiency.\n\nUnderstanding Smart Contracts:\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain allows for the creation and execution of these contracts, automating various processes in a trustless and tamper-proof manner. In the context of casinos, smart contracts bring an unprecedented level of transparency to the gaming experience, ensuring fairness and eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\nTransparency and Fairness:\n\nEthereum Casinos leverage smart contracts to achieve provably fair games. The code governing each game is visible on the blockchain, allowing players to independently verify the fairness of outcomes. This transparency not only builds trust but also addresses longstanding concerns about the integrity of online casino games.\n\nEnhanced Security:\n\nThe decentralized nature of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain enhances the security of transactions and player funds. Traditional casinos often rely on centralized systems, making them susceptible to hacking and fraud. Ethereum Casinos, powered by smart contracts, distribute control and eliminate single points of failure, providing players with a secure and trustworthy gaming environment.\n\nEfficiency in Transactions:\n\nSmart contracts enable automatic and instantaneous transactions, reducing the need for manual processing and third-party intermediaries. Deposits, withdrawals, and even payouts can be executed seamlessly, enhancing the overall efficiency of Ethereum Casinos. Players experience faster and more convenient transactions without the delays associated with traditional banking methods.\n\nDecentralized Platforms:\n\nEthereum Casinos operate on decentralized platforms, reducing the risk of censorship or interference. These platforms are not governed by a central authority, giving players more control over their funds and gaming experiences. The decentralized nature of Ethereum Casinos aligns with the principles of blockchain technology, providing a level playing field for all participants.\n\nTokenization and Digital Assets:\n\nEthereum Casinos facilitate the tokenization of in-game assets and casino chips. Players can own and trade these digital assets securely on the Ethereum blockchain. This introduces a new dimension to the gaming experience, allowing players to have true ownership of their in-game items and participate in broader digital ecosystems.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities:\n\nWhile Ethereum Casinos present exciting opportunities for innovation, they also face challenges, including scalability issues and gas fees. As Ethereum continues to evolve, solutions are being explored to address these challenges and unlock the full potential of smart contracts in the gambling industry.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum Casinos, powered by smart contracts, are at the forefront of a revolution in online gambling. The transparency, security, and efficiency brought by Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and smart contracts are redefining the gaming experience. As the technology continues to advance and scalability challenges are addressed, Ethereum Casinos are poised to shape the future of online gambling, providing players with a new standard of fairness and trust in the digital realm.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "3 Transformative Cryptos Changing The World: Ethereum (ETH), Everlodge (EDLG), Toncoin (TON) - TechCabal",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency was originally created to transform how we make payments. Now, innovative new projects like Ethereum, Everlodge, and Toncoin are taking things one step further. Each project offers an innovative new solution, and as a result could be extremely profitable for early investors. Here\u2019s why investors should consider each for their portfolios.\n\nEthereum Continues To Pioneer DeFi Developments\n\nEthereum is the largest blockchain in the world. Over 1,500 active decentralized apps have been built on the network, with a total value locked (TVL) of over $1 billion. Many analysts believe that Ethereum is now more important than Bitcoin, and could play a more important role in the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum recently experienced its largest price increase of 2023, rising to over $2,350. It has since declined to $2,232, though Ethereum\u2019s value has still increased by 8.65% in the last month. With huge plans for 2024, including a potential spot ETF, experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s value could surge over the next year. Predictions range from $3,000 to $4,000+, though most experts agree that Ethereum\u2019s value will rise.\n\nToncoin Blockchain Slows Following New Protocol Release\n\nToncoin was created to provide seamless DeFi transactions, offering speeds of over 100,000 transactions per second. However, a recent issue with Toncoins transaction processing has cast a shadow of doubt around the project.\n\nLast Tuesday, a new protocol inspired by Bitcoin Ordinals caused a spike in activity on the Toncoin network. This caused the blockchain\u2019s speed to crash to less than 1 transaction per second on Thursday, during which over 2.5 million transactions were pending.\n\nDue to congestion Tonkeeper, a popular Toncoin wallet, had to suspend its services. Later reports suggest that network usage increased by 61 times in just 30 minutes, causing issues for Toncoin. Since this setback, Toncoin\u2019s value has fallen by 8% to $2.17, and Toncoin\u2019s daily trading volume has fallen to $50 million.\n\nCould Everlodge Revolutionize A Trillion Dollar Market?\n\nWhile most crypto projects focus on finance or the blockchain, Everlodge applies DeFi technology to an entirely new market\u2013 travel properties. As a pioneer in this industry, Everlodge is expected to gain significant traction throughout 2024 as thousands of investors discover a new way to build their property portfolios.\n\nEverlodge looks to disrupt the travel property market by minting properties as NFTs. This is designed to streamline the buying and selling process. Once minted, NFTs are fractionalized so investors can buy a percentage of the property instead of the entire property outright. For example, a holiday home in the U.K. worth $1 million could be split into 5 fractions, after which 5 individuals can own a 20% share in the property.\n\n<blockquote class=\u201dtwitter-tweet\u201d><p lang=\u201den\u201d dir=\u201dltr\u201d>We're thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb<br><br>Check out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we've added.

Properties available on Everlodge will include luxury villas, hotels, and holiday homes, with plans to add more property types in the future.\n\nEverlodge is currently in stage 8 of its presale, having sold out at record rates during its previous seven rounds. Its native token, ELDG, is currently available for just $0.027, and will offer numerous benefits to holders once Everlodge officially launches.\n\nInvestors who buy ELDG tokens during the Everlodge presale will automatically be granted access to the Everlodge private members club, which will offer lucrative rewards such as free stays at properties within the Everlodge ecosystem.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nShare this article"

Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and the emerging Meme Moguls (MGLS) have become major hotspots for cryptocurrency whales, drawing significant attention. Google Bard, the AI chatbot, will let you know why.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Vitalik Buterin Makes New Announcements\n\nEthereum (ETH) has long been the flagship of smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Buterin disclosed his plans to revamp Ethereum staking protocols, addressing performance-related concerns.\n\nHe aims to enhance Ethereum\u2019s efficiency by embracing the UTXO payment model and integrating innovations like ZK-EVMs and liquid staking. Google Bard mentioned this forward-looking approach in its analysis.\n\nOver the past month, the Ethereum price surged from $1,788 on October 28 to $2,011 on November 27. Analysts are optimistic with Ethereum now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Their Ethereum price predictions forecast a potential surge to $2,200 before 2023 ends. According to Google Bard, this is why whales are gravitating to Ethereum.\n\nCardano (ADA): Massive Surge\n\nAccording to Google Bard, Cardano (ADA), often dubbed Ethereum\u2019s competitor, has been catching the eyes of whales.\n\nIn recent Cardano news, Charles Hoskinson discussed a potential collaboration with Javier Milei during an AMA session. He also mentioned the possibility of presenting Cardano\u2019s solutions to Milei. Hoskinson emphasized their shared economic views centered around reducing government intervention and sparked optimism.\n\nOver the last month, the Cardano price surged from $0.29 to $0.37 \u2013 a 27% increase. With Cardano exhibiting 18 out of 30 green days and a 9.33% price volatility during that time, analysts have made a bullish Cardano price prediction. They estimate the Cardano price to reach $0.39 in December 2023.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): The Newcomer with a Twist\n\nGoogle Bard believes that the newest contender, Meme Moguls (MGLS), represents the evolving nature of the crypto space. As the world\u2019s first meme-backed stock market, Meme Moguls is bringing something new by allowing users to trade their favorite memes and earn rewards through MGLS tokens.\n\nYou will soon be able to make connections, share tips, and collaborate on strategies with countless traders from around the globe. Traders will have one objective: reaching the top spot on the Meme Moguls Wealth Leaderboard.\n\nAlthough this exchange is the central aspect of Meme Moguls, the team behind its project has also announced three major ecosystem components:\n\nMogul Land: A unique metaverse experience that will provide you with financial activities, be it joining liquidity pools or token mining.\n\nA unique metaverse experience that will provide you with financial activities, be it joining liquidity pools or token mining.

Meanwhile, the MGLS token holders will also receive staking rewards or governance voting rights. It is now worth just $0.021 in Stage 1 of its presale.\n\nHowever, whales gravitate to it as some analysts forecast a 100x value rise before its presale finishes. This fact, plus a $10,000 giveaway at the end of each presale stage, has caused a frenzy among traders. According to The Crypto Basic, Shiba Inu produced a 1.6M% ROI in the past three years.

The Ethereum founder\u2019s publicly known crypto wallets became short of $29 million between December 15 and 21.\n\nThe loss was reported by blockchain analytics service, Arkham Intelligence. According to the analytics platform, the reason for the loss was due to crypto market fluctuations which saw Buterin\u2019s wallets losing 5% of the total value of its assets.\n\nETH price chart at $2,300 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nButerin Crypto Sell-Offs\n\nIn addition to Buterin\u2019s recent large-scale meme coin sell-off, there have been many other crypto sales executed by the ETH founder. Earlier this year, Buterin sold about 9.9 billion CULT tokens worth $332,420 at the time of the sales. The Ethereum founder subsequently revealed reasons for the sell-off, stating that the cryptocurrency held no cultural or moral value.\n\nLater in October, rumors surfaced about Buterin allegedly selling off his ETH holdings after the Ethereum founder sold about 500,000 USDC worth approximately $14.93 million at the time, to the Gemini exchange. Buterin clarified the sell-off allegations stating that the transactions were made to charitable organizations and other initiatives.\n\nMore times than not, large-scale crypto transactions from prominent leaders in the crypto space tend to capture the attention of investors as these sales could lead to a shift in the market. However, Buterin has also revealed that he has never sold Ethereum tokens (ETH) for his gain since 2018.\n\nThe Ethereum founder is known for making multiple ETH donations to charity organizations and COVID-related causes. Buterin is also known for purchasing and constantly dumping meme coins, causing the value of these tokens to plummet in several cases.\n\nFeatured image from Newsway, chart from Tradingview.com"

Like other top altcoins, Ethereum has risen sharply since early November due to calls for spot crypto exchange-traded funds. Trading activity on Ethereum has since shot up leading to a sharp ETH rise.\n\nETH traded at $1,816 on October 31. A month later, ETH jumped by 14.9% to $2,087 on December 1. However, ETH has maintained its bullishness, rising by 12.6% to $2,352 by December 10.\n\nEthereum could capitalize on the growing bullishness due to the popularity of ETH staking in 2023. Since January, Over $40 billion worth of ETH has been staked, thus representing nearly 50% of total staked assets across all blockchains. Furthermore, analysts expect the first approved spot crypto ETFs to come in Q1 2024. This would further boost demand for Ethereum, thus pushing ETH up by 17.0% to $2,752.\n\nNuggetRush: Ethereum-Backed Gaming Ecosystem Takes Market by Storm\n\nThe play-to-earn gaming industry eagerly anticipates the upcoming launch of NuggetRush (NUGX), an adventure game that offers a deep dive into artisanal mining.

One of its latest issues is the resignation of its founder as CEO over the exchange\u2019s involvement in money laundering. The negative news caused a dip in BNB\u2019s performance despite its sharp recovery.\n\nBNB was trading at $253.64 on November 20 following the market-wide bullishness.
