        "content": "BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has officially filed for a spot Ethereum ETH +2.98% exchange-traded fund with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe ETF, dubbed iShares Ethereum Trust, seeks to \"reflect generally the performance of the price of ether,\" reads Form S-1 filed with the SEC by iShares late Wednesday. The iShares brand is associated with BlackRock's ETF products.\n\nThe Form S-1 comes a week after BlackRock registered iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations. Then hours after Nasdaq filed for the proposed ETF, confirming BlackRock is working on a spot ether ETF.\n\nBlackRock has selected Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian for its proposed spot Ether ETF. Additionally, the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate from administrator CF Benchmarks, a subsidiary of Kraken, has been chosen as the proposed ETF's benchmark. These selections align with those made for its proposed spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe price of ether (ETH) jumped nearly 2% to around $2,080 on the news.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBlackRock's bitcoin ETF filing awaits SEC approval\n\nBlackRock filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust in June of this year, which moved markets. The SEC is currently reviewing multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, including one from BlackRock. The asset manager's bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, has also appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp's website since August \u2014 but was noticed only late last month.\n\nBig trading firms, including Jane Street, Virtu Financial, and Jump Trading, are reportedly already in talks to provide liquidity for BlackRock's proposed spot bitcoin ETF if it obtains regulatory approval. Bitcoin's price has rallied over the past month due to the prospect of a spot bitcoin ETF approval. Last month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a rally in the price of bitcoin triggered by a false news report that said its spot ETF was approved served as an example of \"pent-up interest in crypto.\"\n\nEarlier this week, someone registered an entity named \"iShares XRP Trust\" in Delaware and attributed it to BlackRock. At the time, BlackRock said that the filing has no relation to the asset manager. The matter is now under investigation by the Delaware Department of Justice."

        "title": "Ethereum Breakout: Analyst Explains Why The King Of The Altcoins Is Destined For $10,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Crypto analyst Tony The Bull, founder of CoinChartist, has revealed why Ethereum is destined to cross $10,000. According to the crypto analyst, the king of the altcoins has its top just right after $10,000 using the Fibonacci extension.\n\nHow Ethereum Gets To $10,000\n\nIn the latest issue of the CoinChartist newsletter, crypto analyst Tony The Bull used the Hurst Cycle Theory which showed cyclical reoccurrence across the ETH/USDT chart. As the analyst explains, the uptrend noticed in the Ethereum charts has usually come from the accumulation of the token.\n\nTony points out that this accumulation has always taken place \u201cat the bottom boundary of the Ending Diagonal pattern.\u201d The analyst further added that \u201cSince intracycle harmonics come in twos and threes, three cycles should complete one larger cycle that concludes with a breakdown of this Ending Diagonal pattern.\u201d\n\nTaking this Ending Diagonal Pattern into account, Tony reveals that the top of the pattern puts the ETH price at $10,000. However, this is not the only pattern that suggests that the king of the altcoins will end up beating the $10,000 level.\n\nHe also pointed out that the previous ETH rally had started at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension and reached 1.414 the last time that the ETH price peaked. The analyst notes that Ethereum is once again at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension which led to a break out in the price and the same could happen here. But this time, the target is able $10,000 if the 1.414 Fib is reached again.\n\nETH price reaches $2,019 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Moves Into Overbought Territory\n\nOne interesting fact that the analyst points out in the newsletter is the fact that Ethereum is currently in overbought territory. However, where this would usually signal a bearish reversal coming for the digital asset, Tony does not believe this is the case here.\n\nRather, he explains that a cryptocurrency being overbought usually means that it is \u201ca powerfully trending asset.\u201d So even though it could lead to a reversal, it does not invalidate the bullishness of that digital asset.\n\nHe also mentions that \u201cthe Stochastic has confirmed a 1M above 80 on the Stock.\u201d Now, whenever this has happened for Ethereum, it has often resulted in a pushup for the price. At the same time, ETH is moving to the upper Bollinger Band. Both of these setups could paint a bullish breakout for the asset.\n\nSource: CoinChartist\n\nHowever, the analyst warns that for this bullish scenario to play out, the Ethereum price would have to close above $2,450 this month. If the Stochastic moves back below 20, it could invalidate it and trigger a downtrend. \u201cBut if ETHBTC can push back above 20 this will generate a buy signal on the 1M Stochastic and kickstart Ether\u2019s over-performance above Bitcoin,\u201d Tony concluded.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum fees per transaction rose to its highest level in months.\n\nETH Price and volume have gradually declined in the past few days.\n\nThe rise in Ethereum [ETH] prices caused a predictable increase in daily transaction fees. As these daily fees increased, they had a notable effect on the overall network fee as well.\n\nEthereum fee per transaction rises\n\nIn a recent Santiment post, it was highlighted that Ethereum transaction fees reached their highest point since July.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the fee chart revealed a peak of $5.72 per transaction on 13th November. The surge in fees coincided with the upward movement in Ethereum\u2019s price starting around 22nd October.\n\nHowever, as of the latest update, the fee per transaction has decreased to approximately $3.61. Also, this decline suggests a reduction in the number of transactions, contributing to the fee decrease.\n\nDespite this drop, it\u2019s noteworthy that the fees remain within the range of the highest observed in the past three months.\n\nNetwork fees see highest volume in months\n\nThe increase in Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee had a favorable impact on network fees.\n\nAccording to the analysis of the fee chart on Crypto Fees, the network fees began to climb around 25th October, escalating from approximately $1 million to over $5 million.\n\nDespite some fluctuations, the overall trend indicated a consistent upward movement in fees. The chart highlighted a peak in network fees, surpassing $12 million in recent months.\n\nHowever, at the time of this update, the network fee decreased to approximately $9.2 million.\n\nEthereum volume and price dips\n\nThe decline in both network fees and transaction fees can be attributed to a decrease in trading volume and a drop in ETH price.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of the volume chart on Santiment revealed a notable decrease from the levels observed during the recent price surge.\n\nThe volume, which was over $20 billion a few days ago, has since fallen to around $12.6 billion at the time of this writing. CoinMarketCap data also indicated a more than 6% decline in volume over the last 24 hours.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nAdditionally, AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of the daily price trend highlighted a downward trajectory for Ethereum. The chart indicated a nearly 6% loss in ETH\u2019s value over the past few days, with minimal gains.\n\nAs of the latest update, ETH was trading at approximately $1,980. This combination of reduced trading activity and a declining price suggests a waning sense of excitement in the market. Also, it could potentially explain the drop in both transaction fees and total network fees."

        "title": "BlackRock Ethereum ETF Filing Prompts Quick ETH Price Reaction - Milk Road",
        "content": "In the latest updates that surfaced in the crypto spot ETF realm, BlackRock officially filed an application with the SEC for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The proposed ETF would track the price of Ether under the \u2018iShares Ethereum Trust\u2019 brand.\n\nThe S-1 filing comes just a week after BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum Trust entity in Delaware. This foreshadowed the asset manager\u2019s intent to pursue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe ETF would benchmark the CME CF Ether Reference Rate administered by Kraken subsidiary CF Benchmarks. Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian.\n\nEther Price reacts to filing news\n\nThe price of Ethereum climbed nearly 2% to around $2,080 following the ETF filing announcement. Crypto prices have proven sensitive to ETF-related developments amid growing investor anticipation. However, the price quickly dropped by 1.26% to $2,055 according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBlackRock joins several competitors also vying to launch the first US Ether ETF, including VanEck. However, the SEC has yet to approve any spot crypto ETFs despite intensifying industry pressure.\n\nBlackRock has also filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, awaiting SEC approval. The asset manager registered for its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in June, which sparked a bitcoin price surge.\n\nMajor trading firms are already reportedly preparing to support the proposed BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is pending launch. This illustrates the industry\u2019s eagerness for a spot crypto product.\n\nIn August, BlackRock\u2019s planned \u2018IBTC\u2019 Bitcoin ETF ticker appeared on Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. systems ahead of any approval. The crypto market has rallied on mounting spot ETF approval optimism.\n\nFor now, the fates of both the proposed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs remain in the opaque hands of the SEC. But BlackRock\u2019s filings signal its intent to lead the spot crypto ETF vanguard as universal adoption momentum builds."

Discover SCENE\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has filed a form S-1 registration for a spot Ethereum ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn the filing, the asset manager notes that the Trust \"seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether\" with crypto exchange Coinbase serving as the custodian for its crypto holdings.\n\nEarlier this month, BlackRock outlined its proposal for the Ethereum ETF in a filing with the Nasdaq stock exchange, and registered a trust for Ethereum in Delaware.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlackRock's Ethereum ETF filing follows the asset manager's application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, a move that rocked the crypto and TradFi worlds and kicked off a crypto market rally that propelled Bitcoin to its current price of almost $38,000. To date, the SEC has rejected every application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAt time of publication, Ethereum's price stands at $2,069, up 2.7% on the day.\n\nDuring his term as SEC chair, Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to confirm whether the regulator considers Ethereum a security or a commodity, though in 2018, while a professor at MIT, he stated that the SEC considered the cryptocurrency \"sufficiently decentralized\" that it doesn't qualify as a security. At the time, Gensler appeared to be reflecting the opinion expressed by the SEC's former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited \"sufficiently decentralized\" speech of June 2018."

        "title": "Ethereum L2 Starknet aims to decentralize core components of its scaling network - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Starknet has outlined plans to improve the decentralization of three core components of its zero-knowledge (ZK) proof rollup solution.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, StarkWare product manager and blockchain researcher Ilia Volokh outlined the firm\u2019s intent to address certain centralized elements faced across L2s and introduce solutions to Starknet to make its system more robust.\n\nStarknet operates as a validity rollup using ZK-proof technology to bundle transactions, with cryptographic proofs submitted to Ethereum to achieve security and finality for layer-2 transactions.\n\nAccording to Volokh, Starknet\u2019s protocol remains dependent on StarkWare for creating L2 blocks, computing proofs and initiating layer-1 state updates to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\u201cIn this sense, the operation of the network is centralized. This temporary situation, until full decentralisation, is not necessarily a bad thing. Although Starkware operates the network, it cannot steal money and can\u2019t do any invalid state transitions because they require executing the verifier on Ethereum,\u201d Volokh explained.\n\nWhile Starkware remains a \u201ccentralized gateway\u201d to enter Starknet, Volokh added that the protocol is \u201c100% honest\u201d and cannot falsify transactions or information, as Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 blockchain acts as a filter.\n\nThe only tangible way in which Starknet can \u201cmisbehave\u201d is either by being idle in not relaying proofs to Ethereum or by specifically censoring certain parties from including transactions or proofs.\n\n\u201cFor example, if the sequencer decides to exclude a transaction from a particular entity, they\u2019re free to do so. As long as the other things that they are trying to promote are valid.\u201d\n\nFor Starknet, the latter consideration is part of the main reason to decentralize parts of its protocol in an effort to combat two main causes of censorship in consensus-based systems.\n\nIntentional censorship is one consideration, while \u201cnon-robust\u201d systems that have a single point of failure present another threat to decentralization, given that all network participants would be \u201ccensored\u201d if this central point caused a network or system outage.\n\n\u201cWe want to solve both of these problems, and we think the obvious solution to both of them at the same time is to have as many people operating Starknet as possible.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing these different components of Starknet\u2019s system entails varying degrees of difficulty. This includes decentralizing block production through its consensus protocol, decentralizing the proving layer, which is in charge of computing proofs for blocks and decentralizing the process of L1 state updates.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize that it\u2019s crucial to decentralize each of them because as long as even one of them is centralized, you haven\u2019t achieved much,\u201d Volokh added before unpacking the relevant challenges of each component.\n\nDecentralizing block production has been fairly straightforward given that all blockchains rely on a consensus protocol and sybil-resistance mechanism. Meanwhile, decentralizing Starknet\u2019s prover has required a more novel approach.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, we\u2019re the first rollup that has come out with a fairly complete and concrete solution,\u201d Volokh said. He also went on to unpack how competing ZK-rollups all essentially aggregate transactions into proofs and post them on Ethereum, which by extension transfers its own decentralization to rollup solutions.\n\nHowever, these systems all rely on respective central entities to create and prove blocks, which means these layer 2s are \u201cequally centralized.\u201d Whether end users are concerned about the philosophical implications of the centralized components of L2s is another conversation altogether for Volokh:\n\n\u201cThe people who appreciate decentralization do so because they understand that it gives more security, and we share those values more than we think people will like them for commercial reasons.\u201d\n\nVolokh added that Starknet is still in the process of outlining the process of testing and implementing these decentralized mechanics in its network. This is likely to be carried out through a series of interconnected testnets to test the simultaneous functionality of the different components.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "The price of Ethereum jumped by 10% to surpass the $2,000 mark last week, after the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed to launch an ETF, the blockchain\u2019s native currency. If it makes it to market, the ETF will likely have the effect of attracting billions of dollars in new investment to the cryptocurrency. BlackRock\u2019s argument to the SEC about why the new vehicle should be approved is simple: Crypto investors deserve the kind of protection and security that a major asset manager can provide.\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market filed with the SEC to list BlackRock\u2019s ETF last week. \u201cTo this point, the lack of an ETP [exchange-traded product] that holds spot ETH exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek cryptoasset exposure through a spot ETH ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,\u201d Nasdaq said in its filing. \u201cApproval of a spot ETH ETP would represent a major win for the protection of U.S. investors in the cryptoasset space.\u201d\n\nAn Antidote for Ethereum\u2019s Problems\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin. The positive response to the BlackRock registration may help the currency move past some of the concerns that Ethereum investors have noted over the past few years. Ethereum\u2019s notorious transaction costs, known as gas fees, have soared along with the increased activity that has come with more trading. Ethereum\u2019s move to a proof-of-stake system last year was supposed to ease its price and congestion issues, but the BlackRock ETF may exacerbate these problems.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many benefits the currency could derive from working with the world\u2019s largest asset manager. That may be why BlackRock emphasized safety and reliability in its filing with the SEC. Among other things, Ethereum knows that its customers would benefit from increased stability.\n\n\u201cInstitutional investments and support will not only further solidify the industry, but also help with the overall downside volatility over time,\u201d said Joel Hugentobler, Cryptocurrency Analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research. \u201cIt will make a big difference in risk management and retirement planning if the volatility can be dampened.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Ethereum offering, BlackRock also has filed an application with the SEC for a spot bitcoin ETF. CEO Larry Fink said the company wants to diversify its crypto offerings, noting that crypto will \u201ctranscend any one currency.\u201d"

        "title": "Cardano's Hydra and Ethereum's Plasma: Who Copied Who? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum and Cardano are two blockchains at loggerheads.\n\nNow, their fans are arguing about a new blog post from Vitalik Buterin.\n\nCritics say Ethereum\u2019s Plasma is simply copying Cardano\u2019s Hydra.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently posted a proposal to revive Plasma , an earlier scaling approach, in response to major advancements in zero-knowledge proofs. Meanwhile, rival blockchain Cardano continues to develop Hydra , its own layer-2 scaling solution. This has reopened debates on whether the projects are copying each other\u2019s ideas on blockchain scaling.\n\nWhat Is Plasma?\n\nFirst proposed in 2017, Plasma aims to enable faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum by moving some data and computation off the main blockchain while retaining security guarantees. This is achieved by using sidechains that run parallel to the main Ethereum chain and only occasionally batch-commit data to the mainchain.\n\nCongratulations on implementing Cardano\u2019s Hydra \u2014 HOSKY (@hoskytoken) November 14, 2023\n\nHowever, Plasma faced challenges around client-side data availability and complex exit games. Buterin\u2019s latest proposal outlines technical improvements to Plasma, particularly using zero-knowledge proofs to enable validity proofs for off-chain transaction batches. This could resolve issues around data availability and withdrawal game complexity.\n\nWhat Is Hydra?\n\nProposed in 2020, Hydra takes a different architectural approach by using state channels instead of sidechains. State channels allow transactions between two parties to be conducted instantly and freely off-chain, with only the final settlement being committed to the main Cardano blockchain.\n\nHydra is a family of layer 2 protocols designed to make #Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions. The first Hydra head recently opened on mainnet. This video is a great starting point for exploring the current release,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/g1moYifGNj \u2014 Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 4, 2023\n\nThe key difference from Plasma is that state channels manage security and state progression requirements between channel participants instead of a separate chain operator. This avoids some pitfalls of sidechains but has liveness dependencies on the mainchain.\n\nSome critics are saying Ethereum\u2019s revisited Plasma is essentially equivalent to Cardano\u2019s Hydra, but with the footnote that Cardano\u2019s use of an Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) model makes implementing it easier. \u201cIt seems to me that #Cardano is going in the right direction and #Ethereum is the one catching up,\u201d said one pro-Cardano commentator .\n\nIterating On Shared Ideas\n\nThe copycat accusations come amidst a bitter relationship between Ethereum and Cardano founders. Steven Nerayoff, the former Ethereum advisor, swiftly criticized Buterin\u2019s Plasma proposal. He accused Buterin of copying rival blockchain Cardano\u2019s Hydra scaling approach.\n\nWhat timing! This is why I just said @Cardano_CF is my top pick in crypto. You will hear on the recording me telling @VitalikButerin he made a major mistake in getting rid of @IOHK_Charles & should bring him back. Are the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles\u2026 https://t.co/x5w6yDRB4M \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 15, 2023\n\nHe labeled Buterin\u2019s decision to part ways with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson early on as a \u201cmajor mistake.\u201d The irony, Nerayoff asserts, is Ethereum emulating the very person they once dismissed.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Hydra\u2019s and Plasma\u2019s similarities, there are certainly conceptual similarities between using secondary chains or channels to enable faster processing. However, the architectures have fundamentally distinct security assumptions and trade-offs.\n\nIn the last paper, Vitalik talked about liquid staking and on-chain governance. Now we see a paper regarding the UTxO model and something that looks a lot like Hydra. It seems to me that #Cardano is going in the right direction and #Ethereum is the one catching up. \u2014 Cardano YODA (@JaromirTesar) November 14, 2023\n\nAdditionally, building on existing areas of research is quite common in cutting-edge fields like cryptography. For example, Buterin\u2019s proposal leverages recent advances in succinct zero-knowledge proofs to improve Plasma. Scientific progress often works by incrementally improving earlier theoretical foundations. Crypto developers are also known to get a little bitchy from time to time.\n\nOngoing Quest For Scalability Solutions\n\nScalability remains one of the most pressing issues hampering mainstream blockchain adoption. Both Ethereum and Cardano are leading the charge in exploring layer-2 scaling approaches to meet user demands.\n\nThe success of Plasma, Hydra, or any other credible scaling solution will be a boon for the entire blockchain and crypto industry. It may be productive to view the problem through a lens of open intellectual discourse rather than territorial copying accusations between projects. Doing so can keep the advancement of scalability firmly tied to solving user needs."

At the time of this writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $2,079.\n\nEarlier this year, BlackRock also submitted a filing with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. The regulator is currently reviewing around a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF requests, and it has delayed the decision on three of them so far (BlackRock not among them).\n\nStill, many experts believe that by early January 2024, the regulator will approve those BTC funds.\n\nDespite the news of some Bitcoin ETF delays, the price of the world's largest crypto, Bitcoin, soared to the $37,774 high on the Bitstamp exchange on Wednesday."

        "content": "Validium is an innovative addition to the suite of scaling solutions helping to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nValidium is a protocol that was introduced to improve scalability issues on the Ethereum network. In this guide, we look at what Validium is, how it works, and its benefits and challenges.\n\nWhat Is Validium?\n\nValidium is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to verify off-chain transactions. Its primary goal is to enhance the scalability, privacy, and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the solution\u2019s core are sidechains or L2 solutions linked to but handling transactions separately from the Ethereum main chain. In this way, they move transactions off-chain and help ease transactional pressure on the Ethereum network.\n\nConsequently, users can enjoy faster confirmation times while moving more volumes. Furthermore, Validium significantly reduces gas fees due to the reduced computational overhead, as it doesn\u2019t need to verify every transaction individually.\n\nHow Does Validium Work?\n\nValidium bundles sidechain transactions into batches and generates zk-proofs for each batch. Zk-proofs ensure the validity of the transactions and that the off-chain chain has been updated correctly.\n\nEvery sidechain has a validator responsible for aggregating transactions and generating zk-proofs, which are then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet for verification.\n\nIf the proof is valid, the verifiers update the mainnet record to reflect the changes that occurred in the sidechain.\n\nUse Cases and Applications of Validium in Ethereum\n\nValidium has several potential use cases and applications within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi protocols can use Validium to improve their efficiency and usability. For example, they can adopt the technology to create faster DeFi investment platforms with lower gas fees. This efficiency broadens the platform\u2019s accessibility and enhances the user experience.\n\nGaming and NFTs\n\nValidium solutions can facilitate seamless in-game transactions and interactions with NFT marketplaces due to their low fees and faster confirmation times. This provides gamers and collectors with more enjoyable experiences.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nThrough Validium, manufacturers can set up more efficient and transparent supply chain management systems. They can track their consignments off-chain easily and cost-efficiently without overloading the blockchain with data.\n\nKey Benefits of Validium in Ethereum\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the key benefits Validium brings to Ethereum.\n\nEnhanced Scalability\n\nValidium can process thousands of transactions per second (tps), compared to the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s 15-25 tps. This feature makes it ideal for high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. Increased throughputs are crucial to Ethereum adoption as they guarantee timely transactions.\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nValidium uses zk-proofs to verify transactions by allowing one party to prove to another party that they know something without revealing what the thing they know is. As such, zk-proofs provide an elevated level of security for transactions, ensuring that validators cannot cheat or steal user funds. Additionally, Validium improves privacy by excluding sensitive user data from the public Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nReduced computational overhead makes Validium settlements significantly cheaper than mainnet ones. This is a major benefit for users, making Ethereum more affordable.\n\nFaster Transaction Speeds\n\nDue to its off-chain processing, Validium operations are much faster than those on the mainnet. This is important for applications that require fast and reliable transactions, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms.\n\nChallenges and Limitations of Validium\n\nDespite its benefits, Validium also has some challenges and limitations.\n\nCentralization of the Network\n\nUsers must trust the validator to process transactions correctly. This could lead to centralization concerns, as few validators could control a sizable portion of the network. Introducing a trusted third party contradicts the decentralization philosophy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInteroperability and Compatibility\n\nIntegrating Validium with existing Ethereum smart contracts and protocols can be challenging due to potential data structure incompatibilities. Ethereum developers are working on ways to ensure seamless interaction between the mainnet and its sidechains.\n\nDependence on Data Providers\n\nThe technology relies on data providers to make off-chain data available. This dependence on them introduces an element of trust that runs counter to decentralization, a central tenet of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHaving external data providers also puts the data processed on the network at risk of hacking or unauthorized access by malicious parties.\n\nConclusion\n\nValidium is important in Ethereum\u2019s journey toward scalability. Its ability to significantly improve transaction speeds, lower costs, and streamline operations is poised to redefine the network\u2019s experience, with many developers seeking to integrate it into their products."

        "content": "SEC Delays Decision on Grayscale Ethereum Futures Application\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has communicated a postponement in its decision-making process for the Grayscale Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale Investments, a major player in the digital asset management sector, submitted the ETF request in September, aiming to provide investors with exposure to the anticipated future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKnown for routinely extending timelines for crypto-related product decisions, the SEC clarified that it needs additional time to thoroughly assess the proposed changes in regulations and address related issues. While Grayscale's application revolves around an ETF tied to Ethereum futures, the SEC is currently managing a backlog of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from significant Wall Street players such as BlackRock.\n\nDespite persistent investor demand for a Bitcoin ETF, the SEC has consistently rejected previous applications, citing concerns about potential market manipulation. However, Ethereum futures ETFs made their recent debut in the U.S. market, with several firms introducing a total of nine products on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) just last month.\n\nGrayscale has actively been in discussions with the SEC, previously taking legal action against the regulator over its rejection of a spot Bitcoin ETF application. Despite these delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence project a 90% likelihood of the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by January 10, 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

She specifically praised Solana for its speed and efficiency, positioning it as superior to the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether,\u201d she stated .\n\nWood highlighted Ethereum and Solana as pivotal additions to the blockchain ecosystem, emphasizing their roles as essential infrastructure layers with the capacity for a broader range of real-world applications compared to Bitcoin.\n\nWood explained :\n\n\u201cThe reason we have focused as much on Ether is that we think, that is the smart contract network, that is the decentralised finance network. Solana is doing a really good job. I mean if you look at Ether, [it] was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s that\u2019s how we got Ether.

Presently, Solana is trading at just over $66, as per data from TradingView.\n\nWood also commented on the current market anticipation surrounding several pending spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) products. She emphasized the importance of staying focused on the fundamental significance of Bitcoin as \u201cthe money revolution\u201d and cautioned against becoming overly fixated on short-term price movements.\n\n$SOL price spikes 20% as Cathie Wood lauds its speed and cost over Ethereum \ud83e\udee1 Do you think it will hit $80 by this week? \ud83d\ude80@solana #Crypto #SolanaSeason #SolanaCommunity pic.twitter.com/ZxTUb6Lux3 \u2014 Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) November 16, 2023\n\nAcknowledging the possibility of a \u201csell on the news\u201d scenario, Wood noted that there might be an event where investors\u2019 anticipation of an approval exceeds the market demand for the actual event. This could result in a rapid selloff in the days following the anticipated news.\n\nShe said :\n\n\u201cWe put out a Bitcoin monthly piece every month and you can see the health of the network using our on chain metrics. The health of the network is almost as good as it gets and it seems like this is a bull market. Sure we\u2019ll have puts and takes. Nothing goes straight up, but I think this flight to quality.\u201d\n\nWood added she believes that Bitcoin will outperform in the long term, but the current exposure is diversified through equities.\n\nThere is a quest to identify the company poised to develop the pivotal digital wallet. According to her, the search includes assessing candidates such as Coinbase, Square with Cash App, Robin Hood in Latin America, MercadoLibre, or New Bank."

Learn more \u203a\n\nNEW YORK, United States, November 15th, 2023, Chainwire \u2013 Nocturne, a protocol enabling on-chain private accounts, today announced the successful deployment of Nocturne v1 to Ethereum mainnet. This marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more private and accessible Ethereum. For the first time, users will have a compatible and easy-to-use product resembling a private onchain account.\n\nNocturne v1 is a step towards compatible onchain privacy that functions simply as another account rather than a distinct tool or ecosystem. Users will find transacting with Nocturne similar to using a smart contract wallet, with the added benefit of privacy. Nocturne v1 is currently out-of-the-box compatible with any DeFi protocol that represents state via output tokens (e.g. Uniswap swap tokens, Aave aTokens, Compound cTokens, etc). There are plans to later extend this compatibility to arbitrary protocols.\n\n\u201cWith Nocturne v1\u2019s launch, we\u2019re moving away from the notion of a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019 Privacy should be embedded at the account layer and the v1 launch is the first step in making this possible,\u201d said Luke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that everyone, from individual users to large institutions, can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world. This is more than a product; it\u2019s a commitment to making Etherereum more accessible and enabling secure and private money over the internet.\u201d\n\nNocturne is built on the belief that privacy on public blockchains will only become mainstream if it\u2019s seamlessly integrated with the existing user experience. Nocturne\u2019s objective is straightforward: to create private user accounts on L1/L2 that are fully compatible with existing Ethereum accounts. To read more about private accounts, please see Nocturne\u2019s recent blog post.\n\nPrivacy: The Keystone for Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nThough DeFi and other onchain activities have surged in popularity, privacy concerns have prevented broader acceptance and use of crypto as money. Recognizing that the typical user may be uneasy with the idea of their financial dealings being public, and that institutions demand confidentiality for their transactions, Nocturne addresses these critical barriers head-on. Privacy isn\u2019t just a feature\u2014it\u2019s foundational to the broader adoption of crypto.\n\nNocturne\u2019s Future Vision\n\nAs they continue building new versions, Nocturne\u2019s long-term vision is to make the experience so seamless that by default, every Ethereum user automatically has a private account which mirrors their public account. In short, a seamless parallel account layer for privacy.\n\nNocturne\u2019s plans for achieving its longer-term vision include:\n\nTransition to a more permissionless protocol by migrating to proof of innocence, as described by Vitalik and Ameen Solemani in the Practical Privacy & Compliance paper.\n\nBring Nocturne accounts closer to usable as general wallets by extending Nocturne\u2019s protocol compatibility to arbitrary smart contracts.\n\nImprove the compatibility of Nocturne accounts with EOAs and smart accounts through a scheme that allows for public wallet authorization to be leveraged within Nocturne for security.\n\nHow To Access\n\nNocturne v1 is live and can be accessed through a dedicated private vault UI, allowing users to discreetly manage their assets. The current UI capabilities include deposits, transfers to new burner addresses, and private swaps and staking. To get started, visit app.nocturne.xyz.\n\nAbout Nocturne Labs\n\nNocturne Labs is a forward-thinking blockchain technology company committed to addressing the most critical privacy and user experience challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem. With a pioneering protocol for private accounts, Nocturne enables users to transact safely with built-in privacy. This marks a substantial stride in advancing the usability of public blockchains.

        "content": "The largest investment firm in the world is filing for a spot market Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) months after applying for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF.\n\nIn a new filing, BlackRock \u2013 which has over $8 trillion in assets under its management \u2013 is seeking the approval of the iShares Ethereum Trust, which would grant retail investors exposure to the second-largest crypto asset by market cap through traditional stock exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Ether. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in ether rather than by acquiring, holding and trading ether directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange.\n\nThe Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the complexities and operational burdens involved in a direct investment in ether, while at the same time having an intrinsic value that reflects, at any given time, the investment exposure to the price of ether owned by the Trust at such time, less the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities.\u201d\n\nLast week, the investment giant registered an Ethereum Trust in Delaware, a move similar to the one the firm made when it initially registered its BTC trust.\n\nIn July, BlackRock filed its bid to create a spot market BTC ETF. At the time of its filing, the SEC had already rejected numerous attempts by other firms to create Bitcoin ETFs. However, the regulatory agency was known to approve futures BTC ETFs.\n\nIn August, digital assets manager Grayscale won a lawsuit against the SEC when a federal judge ruled that the regulatory body must reconsider its stance on approving Grayscale\u2019s BTC ETF to remain consistent.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has filed its S-1 registration statement and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the anticipated Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nQuick Take\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF will be called the iShares Ethereum Trust and will directly hold Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase Custody Trust Company is named as the custodian for Ethereum.\n\nAn unnamed custodian will hold cash.\n\nThe ETF seeks to track the price of Ethereum before fees and expenses.\n\nThe NAV will be calculated using the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate index.\n\nThe sponsor has discretion on how to handle forks, airdrops, and can abandon assets from these events.\n\nThe management fee was left blank in the current filing, along with additional expenses.\n\nEthereum will be sold periodically to cover fees, creating tax events.\n\nThe ETF plans to list on the Nasdaq under an unnamed ticker.\n\nNo launch date is provided.\n\nBlackRock Ethereum ETF breakdown.\n\nAccording to the filing, the proposed ETF will be called the iShares Ethereum Trust and will track the price of Ethereum, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. The ETF will be structured as a grantor trust and hold Ethereum on behalf of investors. The trust will issue shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets, consisting primarily of Ethereum. The filing states the ETF seeks to reflect the performance of the Ethereum price before fees and expenses.\n\nThe sponsor of the proposed ETF is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a subsidiary of BlackRock. Key service providers named in the filing include BlackRock Fund Advisors as the trustee, Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian for Ethereum holdings, and an unnamed custodian for cash holdings.\n\nBlackRock outlined several benefits of investing in the ETF compared to direct ownership of Ethereum. These include avoiding the complexities of digital asset wallets and keys, the convenience of trading through traditional brokerage accounts, and the continuous creation and redemption of ETF shares.\n\nAccording to the prospectus, the ETF\u2019s net asset value (NAV) will be calculated daily using the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate index published by CF Benchmarks. This benchmark index aggregates trading activity across major Ethereum spot exchanges between 3-4 pm ET to produce a reference rate for Ethereum. The filing also discussed how the ETF will handle network forks, airdrops, and other events that may entitle it to new assets. As reported, the sponsor has discretion over whether to claim or abandon these assets. Abandoned assets will not be reflected in the ETF\u2019s net asset value.\n\nOn expenses, BlackRock stated the ETF would have a currently undisclosed management fee and additional operating expenses. The trust will periodically sell Ethereum to cover fees, creating taxable events for shareholders.\n\nOn listing, BlackRock intends to list the ETF on Nasdaq under an unnamed ticker and will continuously issue shares to authorized participants in exchange for Ethereum deposits. The filing did not provide a planned launch date for the ETF.\n\nOverall, the prospectus provides insights into the structure and mechanics of BlackRock\u2019s proposed Ethereum ETF. As a major financial player, an Ethereum ETF from BlackRock could significantly impact institutional adoption and trading volumes if approved by the SEC. However, the regulatory environment remains uncertain, with several Bitcoin ETF applications still pending approval."

Bitcoin and Ethereum could spike in price after SEC\u2019s approval but the scale of the rise needs to be watched. While gold jumped 350% in 2004 after the Spot ETF approval, BTC and ETH\u2019s performance needs to be watched closely."

This development follows BlackRock\u2019s recent registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity, signaling a significant step towards offering investors exposure to the performance of Ethereum.\n\nNotably, the iShares Ethereum Trust, known as Ether ETF, seeks to mirror Ether\u2019s price performance, as stated in the SEC-filed S-1. It falls under BlackRock\u2019s iShares brand, akin to its Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust, with Coinbase appointed as the custodian for the underlying ETH.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlackRock Files For Ethereum Spot ETF\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF, known as the iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to mirror the performance of the Ether cryptocurrency, as disclosed in the recently filed Form S-1 with the SEC. This move signifies BlackRock\u2019s strategic foray into the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, reflecting the growing institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, the filing comes on the heels of BlackRock\u2019s registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations. Notably, BlackRock has been actively navigating the cryptocurrency space, having previously filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust in June.\n\nMeanwhile, submitting a spot ETF involves a dual-stage process. First, it requires obtaining SEC approval for the 19b-4 filing from the Trading and Markets division and securing approval for the S-1 filing or prospectus from the Corporate Finance division.\n\nThe anticipation around BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF has already influenced markets, with trading firms like Jane Street, Virtu Financial, and Jump Trading reportedly in discussions to provide liquidity if the ETF secures regulatory approval. In addition, institutional interest in spot ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies is increasing amid a crypto market recovery, recouping substantial losses from the previous bear market.\n\nAlso Read: Astrobotic To Send Dogecoin To The Moon This December, DOGE Price To Rally?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Impact on Cryptocurrency Trends\n\nThe market has been closely monitoring BlackRock\u2019s ETF ventures, especially after the filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust earlier this year. Notably, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval has driven a recent surge in Bitcoin prices, with major trading firms positioning themselves to support BlackRock\u2019s endeavors.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, acknowledged the significant interest in cryptocurrency, citing a recent Bitcoin price rally triggered by a false news report about the approval of its spot ETF. Fink emphasized that this incident highlighted the pent-up demand and enthusiasm in the crypto market.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock\u2019s move into Ethereum ETFs adds a new dimension to the crypto investment landscape. As institutional players increasingly explore digital assets, the impact of the firm\u2019s initiatives extends beyond Ethereum, influencing broader market dynamics and investor sentiment.\n\nAs of writing, the Ethereum price noted a surge of 2.63% to trade at $2,060.16, with its volume declining 2.61% to $13.41 billion over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, several experts anticipate that the approval of this Spot Ethereum ETF could bolster more gains in the crypto market in the coming days.\n\nAlso Read: Terra Vs SEC, Court Hints At Summary Judgment In Weeks"

        "content": "Ethereum whistleblowers Steven Nerayoff and TruthLabs have alleged numerous incidents of misconduct by early Ethereum insiders, with Nerayoff currently teasing the release of apparently never-before-heard audio recordings of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nNerayoff is promising to reveal scandalous evidence that he believes proves that Buterin copied his idea of issuing utility tokens via ICOs. He is also threatening to sue over his supposed invention.\n\nOf course, fraud by third-party creators who simply used the Ethereum platform to create scam tokens or NFTs is nothing new. Many Ethereum ICO fundraisers during the 2017-2018 craze turned out to be doomed. Indeed, most ICOs have fallen to near-$0.\n\nSimilarly, most NFTs are now worthless. Ethereum insiders, however, are not responsible for those scams.\n\nWhat is new, however, is the fact that Steven Nerayoff and an unrelated researcher, TruthLabs, have both alleged misconduct by Ethereum founders and their allies and want to release the supposedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nRead more: These six-figure NFTs are down 99%\n\nSteven Nerayoff: Baffling yet impossible to ignore\n\nNerayoff makes sweeping claims that are often difficult to understand, yet he does speak with some authority. He was a former legal advisor to the Ethereum Foundation. He claims that Vitalik Buterin once lived with him in New York and worked in an office that Nerayoff rented for the benefit of Ethereum.\n\nSome observers used to dismiss most of Nerayoff\u2019s claims due to his personal credibility taking a hit when the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged him with criminal extortion in 2019. However, a New York judge dismissed that charge in May 2023, cleaning up his reputation considerably.\n\nAlthough Nerayoff has posted his recent, Ethereum-related claims to X, he says his legal team is working on organizing all the documents involved to substantiate his new claims. Curiously, he claims to have created a non-X platform to ostensibly ensure that the information he publishes will not be censored.\n\nOn November 14, he promised to publish specific allegations against Ethereum insiders \u201cwithin 48 hours, hopefully less.\u201d There have, however, been delays, with Nerayoff claiming that logistics and the creation of NFTs were responsible for most of the hold-ups.\n\nShould be within 48 hours hopefully less. Logistics, setting up Smart NFTs, etc. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nDid Vitalik Buterin ask Nerayoff to rescue the Ethereum Foundation?\n\nNerayoff claims that one of his upcoming NFTs will include a 2015 recording of Vitalik Buterin asking Nerayoff for a \u201crescue plan\u201d for the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nA transcript of Nerayoff\u2019s appearance on one of Mario Nawfal\u2019s \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d indicates that the NFT will include audio asking Nerayoff to help restructure the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nGreat thread @CoinpediaNews . The NFT isn\u2019t about fraud it\u2019s a recording of a rescue plan to save Ethereum Vitalik asked me to create in 2015. It\u2019s a rare unedited historical view into what was really happening & crucial decisions made or not made which shaped much of crypto. https://t.co/4paTF5fseI \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nThis continues Nerayoff\u2019s pattern of claiming he created many of the standards that made Ethereum successful, including the \u2018fungible\u2019 tokens behind ICOs. The ERC-20 standard originally described the most commonly used API for Ethereum-based fungible tokens. The document doesn\u2019t list Nerayoff as a contributor unless he was going by a pseudonym.\n\nDid Vitalik invent anything? No he did not. Ethereum never scaled bc of him. Only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs question Ethereum\u2019s The DAO\n\nTruthLabs supposedly found evidence that the Ethereum Foundation and Slock.it were behind the infamous hack of The DAO that precipitated the hard fork between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nNothing would surprise me but seems more likely others will flip on them. Now let me see, was the DAO an inside job? Oh there are too many to even count. They have a whole industry of people who could turn on them. Frankly I refused to cooperate at all but that\u2019s me most would. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nRead more: Ethereum centralization is becoming a serious problem\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the DAO hack was an inside job. Publicly, Slock.it was hit hard, and eventually sold to Blockchains.com in 2019. Blockchains.com rebranded Slock.it to BC Development Labs.\n\nSo, what did the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say about The DAO? According to Commissioners, The DAO insiders sold DAO tokens as unregistered securities. However, the SEC declined to file charges in that particular case.\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs also call out ex-SEC Director Bill Hinman\n\nBy now, it is no secret that former SEC chief William Hinman likely had an Ethereum-related conflict of interest while working for the SEC. Protos has previously covered Hinman\u2019s financial conflict of interest and its potential impact on the SEC v. Ripple case.\n\nBill Hinman routinely met Simpson Thacher & Bartlett employees, which received funding from a pro-Ethereum entity, including an employee who worked for its Hong Kong division. Hinman also did not divest from his financial interest in the Simpson Thacher, which had done work for the Ethereum Foundation, despite being warned to by the SEC\u2019s ethics office.\n\nAfter the Empower emails, I said a \ud83d\ude4a could prove Hinman violated the criminal financial conflict laws. You can be found violating 18 USC 208 if you allow even only an appearance of impropriety w/o being told you\u2019re violating the law. Here, he was told multiple times but did it. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023\n\nHowever, according to Nerayoff, the corruption among government officials might go far beyond just William Hinman\u2019s opining that ETH offers were not securities transactions.\n\nA transcript of a Mario Nawfal X audio space reveals that Nerayoff believes the SEC, DoJ, and FBI fabricated charges against him. \u201cThey were looking to get as many people in this industry as possible. And that all started at the very same time,\u201d he said. He also implied that Hinman was in on the Ethereum inside job.\n\nSome individuals were skeptical. However, attorney Michael Scotto opined that Nerayoff \u201chas a case.\u201d\n\nYes @StevenNerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. As his attorney I just wish he would stop talking until then, but he is very eager to share his experience. Although I won\u2019t go into details I will say everything he has said is\u2026 https://t.co/cKQuuzgxP9 \u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) October 28, 2023\n\nNerayoff acknowledged that his lawyers advised him not to post about it in a lengthy X post. However, he says he cares more about holding people accountable than the money he allegedly lost.\n\nMistakes in Gary Gensler\u2019s MIT course?\n\nPrior to becoming chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler taught a course about blockchain at MIT.\n\nTruthLabs has questioned why Gensler used this class to spread, in TruthLabs\u2019 opinion, false information about Ethereum\u2019s history. According to TruthLabs, his allegedly false teaching material included Gensler\u2019s claim that Canadian VCs mostly supported Ethereum during its pre-ICO days. Rather than Canadian money, as Protos has covered, Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money. If deflecting attention from China to Canada was intentional, TruthLabs posits that William Hinman might not be the only SEC official with an interest in misrepresenting Ethereum\u2019s financial ties.\n\nWhy is Gary Gensler teaching a false history on Ethereum's ICO in his MIT class?\n\n\n\nIn this \ud83e\uddf5, I will show you that it was the CCP that invested in Ethereum in its pre-ICO days, and not Canadian VC's like Gary teaches. pic.twitter.com/xfGtlux85C \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) April 19, 2023\n\nOther claims made in Gensler\u2019s lecture on Ethereum included the idea that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO. Lubin disagrees with this percentage, claiming he never owned more than half a percent of Ethereum\u2019s supply.\n\nNerayoff called Lubin out on this, citing a video in which Lubin said buying large quantities of tokens, or buying them to speculate, could become a sign that the token is a security.\n\nLubin is saying if you buy tokens in large quantities or to speculate it\u2019s a security. Gensler on video said Lubin was a VC who bought Ether in large quantities to speculate.\n\n\n\nSo, Ether is a security according to Lubin & Gensler due to Lubin\u2019s actions.\n\n\n\nWanna brag some more Joe?\u2026 https://t.co/BFLi3ZRmPv \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 12, 2023\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s why \u2018news\u2019 attacking Gary Gensler is all over crypto media\n\nRevisiting Ethereum\u2019s ties to China\n\nAnyway, TruthLabs claims that Chinese entities Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and Fenbushi Capital were involved in setting up some of Lubin\u2019s Ethereum wallets.\n\nProtos has previously covered Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money.\n\nTruthLabs also found evidence that Wanxiang Blockchain Labs set the Ethereum Foundation wallet up. Wanxiang\u2019s Dr. Xiao Feng went on record about its early support for Ethereum, pledging $500,000 to help launch it.\n\nGary Gensler teached to the public that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO for himself. Whats his source? Lubin claims he never even owned half a percent of Ethereums supply. So whats up with this 10%? And did he know about how Lubin called to disguise all major investors? pic.twitter.com/zpYgnOaWNP \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) April 19, 2023\n\nTruthLabs also notes a coincidence that Wanxiang Group and MIT announced a \u2018partnership\u2019 in March 2018. TruthLabs notes that it is possible that Chinese government-connected individuals could have used proxy or puppet entities to exert influence over Ethereum.\n\nLaura Shin\u2019s book, The Cryptopians, detailed allegations that Vitalik Buterin tolerated an out-of-place Chinese national named Ming Chan, who served as the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s executive director, for a curious span of time \u2014 even after she clashed with other foundation members.\n\nInterestingly, Chan assumed that role in 2015 \u2014 the same year that Nerayoff alleges Buterin asked him about restructuring or saving the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum also famously published its whitepaper first in two languages: English initially, and then Chinese.\n\nFinally, and somewhat off-topic, Nerayoff makes yet another assertion: Vitalik Buterin could have shorted Ethereum at some point.\n\nAwaiting evidence from Steven Nerayoff, TruthLabs\n\nIn summary, Nerayoff and TruthLabs\u2019 allegations are seemingly impossible to ignore. However, it\u2019s important to remember that they are just that: allegations.\n\nNerayoff claims to be releasing another round of evidence today or tomorrow and intends to fight for his intellectual property rights in court.\n\nEthereum initially wanted to build a decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Much of its initial marketing billed it as a \u201cworld computer\u201d that could be used for blockchain applications like smart contracts. However, since inception, Ethereum has maintained strong ties to Chinese executives with curious motivations.\n\nBoth Nerayoff and TruthLabs claim to be interested in publicizing their version of the truth about Ethereum\u2019s origins and initial motivations. Many observers have been and will continue to await their allegedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "title": "What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants to bring back Plasma as a blockchain scaling solution that could sidestep existing data availability concerns.\n\nFirst created in 2017, Plasma networks can be considered \u201cchild\u201d chains of the Ethereum mainnet. These execute transactions away from Ethereum using their own block-validation mechanisms, then periodically post final states back to mainnet.\n\nPlasma chains differ from popular scaling solutions such as Arbitrum or Optimism, which instead post computed data back to Ethereum mainnet, although it is compressed.\n\nIn the blockchain world, data tied to computational tasks \u2014 such as processing transactions \u2014 must be stored somewhere. When stored on-chain this process is often costly and time-consuming for network participants, particularly validators and other node operators.\n\nFull nodes on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 and there are roughly 11,000 of them active worldwide \u2014 download all the data of each block so that network participants can verify it. This redundancy make it difficult for invalid transactions to be mistakenly executed.\n\nAlthough great for security, the consensus process hinders scalability as it is inefficient and reduces throughput.\n\nWith Plasma, all data processing and computational tasks are kept off Ethereum mainnet \u2014 only final verified states are posted to the chain \u2014 and thus less data takes up Ethereum block space.\n\nThe problem with Plasma\n\nAccording to Buterin, Plasma was not considered by the current batch of roll-up solutions for its overwhelming costs around client-side data storage and its application limits. This made it difficult to build Plasma-powered apps which did more than simple payments.\n\nIn his recent blog post, Buterin discussed a previous Plasma implementation known as Plasma Cash. This system sees each individual coin as its own non-fungible token (NFT) with a unique history.\n\nOperators on Plasma chains create new blocks in the form of a root of a Merkle tree. This means that every time there is a transaction, the owner of that transaction can be found by stepping through the tree.\n\nIf an operator chooses to misbehave by publishing an invalid or unavailable block, the owner of that transaction will have seven days to cancel by showing that they are either not the latest owner, that there is a double spend, or that there is an invalid history. This can make for a clunky process in the real-world, Buterin explained.\n\n\u201cIf you receive 0.001 ETH each from hundreds of people who are buying coffees from you, you are going to have 0.001 ETH in many places in the tree, and so actually exiting that ETH would still require submitting many separate exits, making the gas fees prohibitive,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nDefragmentation protocols do exist, Buterin said, but they are difficult to implement in practice. Further, it is difficult to apply the Plasma design to a generalized Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) as the design requires specific owners to object to false transactions.\n\nMany DeFi protocols on-chain, for example, do not have unique or individual owners, meaning that complex applications would not be able to work on Plasma.\n\nEnter zk-SNARKS\n\nButerin noted that concerns around Plasma can be resolved with the introduction of zk-SNARKS and validity proofs.\n\nZk-SNARKS, short for \u201czero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,\u201d enables blockchains to prove that information is accurate without revealing the contents of the information itself.\n\nSNARKS are the proof system, and validity proofs are cryptographic proofs which attest that the information is indeed accurate.\n\n\u201cThe largest challenge of making Plasma work for payments, client-side data storage, can be efficiently addressed with validity proofs. Additionally, validity proofs provide a wide array of tools that allow us to make a Plasma-like chain that runs an EVM,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nValidity proofs will be able to prove that each Plasma block that is on the blockchain is valid \u2014 meaning that it will no longer be necessary to worry about who the last owner of each individual transaction on a Merkle tree is.\n\n\u201cIn a validity-proven Plasma chain, such withdrawals would not be subject to any challenges at all. This means that, in the normal case, withdrawals can be instant,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nConsiderations\n\nAlthough zk-SNARKs and validity proofs can address significant problems with the previous Plasma design, Buterin reasoned, there are still limitations.\n\nThis is most clearly highlighted when a particular state object, such as a token, does not have a clear economic owner.\n\nButerin drew on the example of Uniswap liquidity provider positions: \u201cIf you traded USDC for ETH in a Uniswap position, you could try to withdraw your pre-trade USDC and your post-trade ETH. If you collude with the Plasma chain operator, the liquidity providers and other users would not have access to the post-trade state, so they would not be able to withdraw their post-trade USDC.\u201d\n\nThis shows that although Plasma potentially offers useful solutions, there may still be concerns about bad actors, which should be addressed.\n\nDespite this, Buterin believes that Plasma remains an underrated design in the blockchain technology space and could help ease Ethereum transaction fees.\n\n\u201cRollups remain the gold standard, and have security properties that cannot be matched. This is particularly true from the developer experience perspective: nothing can match the simplicity of an application developer not even having to think about ownership graphs and incentive flows within their application,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cHowever, Plasma lets us completely sidestep the data availability question, greatly reducing transaction fees. Plasma can be a significant security upgrade for chains that would otherwise be validiums.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci is predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are on the cusp of rallies now that a Federal Reserve pivot seems likely.\n\nIn a new interview on Bloomberg Television, Scaramucci says that he believes the Fed is done increasing rate hikes, which he says will take the pressure off of risk assets.\n\nHe also predicts that the Fed will start cutting rates early next year.\n\n\u201cI do think the Fed is done hiking. I think that the inflation data was very positive and it\u2019s likely to go lower over the next quarter\u2026 and I think it\u2019s very, very good for stock prices, very good for assets.\n\nBut of course, what do people want for Christmas in America? They want a low-interest-rate mortgage. And if you look at housing data in the United States right now, those markets are quite sluggish. I think the Fed is going to respond to that. You\u2019ll probably see cuts in interest rates before the end of the first quarter. And so that\u2019s very positive for asset prices across the board.\u201d\n\nScaramucci says he is bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital assets, and thinks they will \u201ctrend higher\u201d in the near future.\n\nOne catalyst for a crypto uptrend, he says, is the likely approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cIf [approval] happens, I think there\u2019s an induction of a tremendous amount of demand for Bitcoin. And of course, you have a halving in Bitcoin, which basically means that the supply is going to get cut in half in April. So a halving, lower supply, more demand, we think prices are going to trend higher for Bitcoin, Ethereum and a few other currencies.\n\nAnd for those reasons, we\u2019re going to stay long in the portfolio. It\u2019s a concentrated bet for us, but we like it. It\u2019s a macro overlay.

I think that this is a scary area but given the overall momentum, it\u2019ll probably keep going. Mid-$20s should be next up, if it can clear this current region.\u201d\n\nThe trader\u2019s chart suggests AVAX could cross a key level at $21.17 and face resistance at around $22. AVAX later broke past $22, and the trader updated his outlook to say that the $29.33 level was now within reach.\n\n\u201cAVAX: Strong f-ing run here, goes to show that even dead forgotten chains can have their moments. $29 is the next target if price can remain above this current level.\u201d\n\nAVAX is trading for $22.49 at time of writing, up 11.7% in the last 24 hours, a more than 150% gain since closing at $8.91 on October 19th.\n\nNext, the trader says that Bitcoin (BTC) is probably heading down to the $35,000 level after failing to cross $38,000.\n\n\u201cBTC: really key area here at this $38,000. It\u2019s quite simple in my opinion: this teleports past $40,000 if we can break this area strongly. If it comes down (probably a higher likelihood), it goes right back to $35,000 in my opinion.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $36,589 at time of writing.\n\nLastly, the trader says that decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK) will likely retest lower Fibonacci levels after soaring in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cLINK: best still to remain patient on this one. $12.50 and $11.50 are my areas of interest.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.10 at time of writing, down 5.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as 24-Hour Trading Volume Surges to $24 Billion \u2013 Time to Buy the ETH Dip?\n\nEther (ETH) continues to chop either side of the $2,000 level as bullish momentum cools following the cryptocurrency\u2019s rejection of a retest of the 2023 highs in the $2,100s earlier this month.\n\nThe ETH price was last down around 3.5% on the day in the $1,980s, but still within this week\u2019s $1,930 to $2,100 ranges.\n\nAs per CoinGecko, trading volumes recently surged to as much as $24 billion in 24 hours, indicative of the fact that market activity remains elevated in wake of BlackRock\u2019s recent moves to set up its own spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Time to Buy the Dip?\n\n\n\nWith Ether back below $2,000 and down more than 7% from its recent highs, some traders might be asking whether now is a good time to buy the dip.\n\nWell, fundamentals certainly suggest so.\n\nNot only is Ether set to continue benefitting from optimism that spot Ethereum ETFs could be coming in 2024, but macro has also been a major tailwind for the crypto market this week, with US stocks pumping and the US dollar and US yields pulling aggressively lower.\n\nThose moves in traditional assets come as macro investors ramp up bets that a US Federal Reserve cutting cycle is coming in 2024 in wake of weaker-than-expected US inflation data for October, that came on the heels of soft US jobs and manufacturing data released earlier in the month.\n\nDovish policy pivots from the Fed (i.e. a switch from rate hikes to rates cuts) have in recent years generally been very bullish for Ether and other cryptos.\n\nEther\u2019s supply also recently turned deflationary again amid an upturn in on-chain activity, meaning a higher ETH token burn rate.\n\nAs per data presented by Glassnode, the ETH deflation rate was last around 2% per year and the narrative of ETH as a deflationary cryptocurrency could soon regain ground, supporting its price.\n\nChart analysis is also suggestive a positive outlook for ETH.\n\nEarlier this month and in wake of the BlackRock ETF news, Ether surged above a downtrend that had been in play since the prior annual highs.\n\nShould the cryptocurrency retest and find support at this downtrend in the $1,900 area, this could be seen as confirmation that a new bullish trend is intact.\n\nA subsequent break above prior yearly highs in the mid-$2,100s could open the door to a swift move higher towards the $3,000s.\n\nCrypto Alternatives to Consider\n\n\n\nThe Ether (ETH) outlook is potentially very strong, but for looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nMany of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nSee the 15 Cryptocurrencies"

        "title": "Ethereum Slammed as Cardano Wannabe by Former ETH Advisor - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Former Ethereum advisor accuses the project of copying Cardano.\n\nSteven Nerayoff holds a personal grudge against Ethereum.\n\nTechnical differences exist between Plasma and Hydra scaling solutions.\n\nAs the leading smart contract layer 1 platform, Ethereum has achieved enormous success, though it continues to face security vulnerabilities and scaling limitations. In order to strengthen the network, Ethereum\u2018s developers regularly propose complex new technical improvements, such as Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent post about off-chain Plasma technology to boost scalability.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, swiftly criticized this proposal. He accused Buterin of copying rival blockchain Cardano (ADA), even labeling the decision to part ways with Charles Hoskinson during the project\u2019s early days as a \u201cmajor mistake.\u201d\n\nEthereum Gets Blasted as a Copycat\n\nIn his latest tirade against Ethereum and its founders, Nerayoff alleged that the platform is merely copying Cardano\u2019s approach to scaling. According to Nerayoff, Buterin\u2019s \u201cmajor mistake\u201d was ditching Hoskinson, who later went on to build Cardano. The irony, as Nerayoff asserts, is that Ethereum has been emulating the very person they once dismissed.\n\n\u201cAre the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles happy now that the boy genius is copying Cardano?\u201d remarked Nerayoff.\n\nDoubling down on the statement, Nerayoff claimed that the crypto industry would have been better off if Hoskinson and Gavin Wood had remained at Ethereum, and it had instead been Buterin and Joseph Lubin who departed.\n\nInterestingly, this is touched upon on the recording. I suggest everyone listen & I\u2019ll expand afterwards as it\u2019s not a simple answer but you ask a very poignant question. It\u2019s not apples to apples but their recent partnership could be extremely positive for crypto.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll say this\u2026 \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 15, 2023\n\nWhile some attribute Nerayoff\u2019s outbursts to his past conflicts with Ethereum, others contend that Ethereum is indeed replicating Cardano\u2019s approach to solving the blockchain trilemma.\n\nCardano Wannabe?\n\nNerayoff is not alone in accusing Ethereum of replicating Cardano\u2019s technology. Cardano YODA pointed out that Buterin\u2019s Plasma proposal bears a resemblance to Cardano\u2019s Hydra scaling approach. Additionally, Cardano YODA drew parallels between a prior paper authored by Buterin on liquid staking, which is a concept that Cardano implemented during the Shelley era in April 2020.\n\nIn the last paper, Vitalik talked about liquid staking.\n\n\n\nNow we see a paper regarding the UTxO model and something that looks a lot like Hydra.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that #Cardano is going in the right direction and #Ethereum is the one catching up.\n\n\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong. \u2014 Cardano YODA (@JaromirTesar) November 14, 2023\n\nIn response to Buterin\u2019s proposal for Plasma scaling, Hoskinson posted the meme of Kermit the Frog and Christian Bale nodding at one another with no further commentary.\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for Plasma relates to scaling solutions that allow data and computation to be kept off-chain, opening the door to large scalability gains not bottlenecked by on-chain data availability. Plasma works by tracking asset histories separately and relying on users to exit their assets if issues arise.\n\nSimilarly, Hydra is Cardano\u2019s layer 2 scaling solution that facilitates fast, low-cost transactions within \u201cHydra heads,\u201d or state channels which are considered secure mini ledgers, that can eventually settle back to the Cardano mainchain.\n\nNonetheless, opinion remains split based on the technical differences between sidechains, off-chain protocols, and state channels.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nNerayoff has accused Buterin and his father of conspiring to damage his reputation. This accusation stems from Nerayoff\u2019s run-in with authorities regarding extortion charges , which were later dropped.\n\nNerayoff maintains that Ethereum is a fraudulent project that has corrupt ties to federal agencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network effect is much greater than Cardano\u2019s with more real-world adoption and a higher number of deployed dApps.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile time will ultimately reveal whether Cardano\u2019s methodical approach or Ethereum\u2019s first-mover advantage prevails, Nerayoff\u2019s persistent accusations of fraud against Ethereum refuse to fade away. In an industry notorious for deception, these claims resonate deeply, casting a shadow of uncertainty over Ethereum, especially in light of the FTX scandal.\n\nLearn more about Ethereum\u2019s scaling woes as fees surge amid crypto rally:\n\nEthereum Fees Surge to Four-Month High Following Price Rally\n\n\n\nFind out the latest on Poloniex resuming normal operations following its recent hack here:\n\nPoloniex Close to Restoring Full Operations After $125M Hack"

        "content": "LAYER 2'S EVERYWHERE: In last week's The Protocol, we dedicated a not-inconsiderable quantity of ink to the fast-growing list of new \"layer 2\" blockchains aiming to provide a venue for fast and speedy transactions atop Ethereum. Grab another well, cause there's been plenty more announcements already this week. The most notable was inarguably Tuesday's disclosure by the crypto exchange OKX that it plans to build a layer 2 using Polygon's technology. Wednesday brought the news of Kinto, which has raised $5 million this year to develop a layer-2 network that's fully compliant with anti-money-laundering laws using Optimism's OP Stack, and Redstone, an \"alternative data availability\" chain designed by the Lattice team for OP Stack. There are nagging questions about just who is going to use all these networks, but developers suggest there's still not enough. \"We're going to need a lot of L2s,\" Ryan Wyatt, who was just hired by a unit of the Optimism Foundation as chief growth officer after leaving Polygon Labs several months ago, told CoinDesk TV this week. \"One chain, a mainnet, is not going to do it.\" Even Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson tried to elbow into the mix, posting Sunday on X (formerly Twitter) that \"I'm game if you are\" \u2013 attaching a link to CoinDesk's article last week about Kraken's discussions with prospective layer-2 technology partners including Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation \u2013 and tagging Kraken Chairman Jesse Powell. One snarky poster replied, \"If this is how we reaching out, most likely not happening.\""

        "content": "Grayscale Investments is using its Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) application as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to corner the United States Securities and Exchange Commission into approving its spot Ether ETF, said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nSeyffart said in a Nov. 15 X (Twitter) post following the SEC delaying Grayscale\u2019s ETH futures ETF bid that he believes, if the SEC approves Grayscale\u2019s application, it would enable Grayscale to argue for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.\n\nIf the SEC denies Grayscale\u2019s bid, the asset manager could argue the SEC is treating Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether futures ETFs differently by allowing one under the Securities Act of 1933 but not the other.\n\n\u201cWatch [the SEC] try to either approve and argue why this is different from spot. Or Deny and argue why 1933 act products are meaningfully different from 1940 act products. Both are bad for SEC [in my opinion]. Genius move.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ether futures ETF bid was submitted via a 19b-4 form, which is filed to inform the SEC of a security-based swap request. Seyffart said none of the 40 or so approved Ether ETF products went through the 19b-4 approval process.\n\nSeyffart was initially unsure why Grayscale filed its Ether futures ETF via a 19b-4. He now believes Grayscale is playing \u201cchess\u201d with the SEC by using the Ether futures ETF as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to obtain a 19b-4 order from the regulator to corner them into a lose-lose situation.\n\nI was initially unsure why they would even file for this. But my thoughts have evolved over the last few weeks and they are basically this:\n\nGrayscale is playing Chess, not checkers here. They're likely hoping to force the SEC into issuing a 19b-4 decision on an ETH futures ETF.\u2026 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 15, 2023\n\nSeyffart and Scott Johnsson, general president at Van Buren Capital General, agreed Grayscale wouldn\u2019t launch the Ether futures ETF.\n\n\u201cDoubtful this product ever trades, but useful as a vessel to get spot ETH over the finish line,\u201d Johnsson said.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs will drive institutional adoption in 2024 \u2014 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\nSeyffart\u2019s comments come as the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale\u2019s Ether futures ETF on Nov. 15 \u2014 two days earlier than its Nov. 17 deadline. Seyffart said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the delay.\n\nHashdex\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin futures ETF into a spot product was also put on hold by the securities regulator on Nov. 15.\n\nBlackRock shared a similar sentiment to Seyffart\u2019s last week, arguing that the SEC doesn\u2019t have a legitimate reason to treat cryptocurrency spot and futures ETF applications differently.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF optimist and Worldcoin skeptic Gracy Chen: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has submitted a Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a week after registering its iShares Ethereum Trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations. The strategic move by BlackRock signals a huge step toward offering its customers exposure to the performance of the industry\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock Files SEC Prospectus For Spot Ether ETF\n\nTraditional finance behemoth BlackRock has filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list a spot-based Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIn the application, BlackRock says that the iShares Ethereum Trust \u201cseeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether\u201d, with San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase serving as the custodian for the underlying ETH.\n\nThe filing comes after the $9 trillion asset manager outlined its proposal for the ETH ETF in a filing with the Nasdaq stock exchange earlier this month. BlackRock further solidified its plans to launch an ETF for Ethereum last week by registering an entity dubbed \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d in Delaware.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF would allow retail investors to gain exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without having to directly procure the asset. The financial instrument could potentially open the door for billions of dollars of new capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock has already made waves in the crypto and TradFi worlds by aspiring to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that caused frenzied bullish price action and drove BTC to its current price of around $36,900. BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has now become an outspoken Bitcoin proponent, essentially reversing his earlier skepticism.\n\nImplications For Ether\n\nThe price of ether jumped circa 2 percent to $2,079 on the BlackRock S-1 filing news before settling at $2,030 as of publication time.\n\nBesides BlackRock, other institutional giants, including Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest, and Valkyrie, have also submitted applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. Any approval could take months as the SEC has repeatedly rejected or delayed previous applications for proposed spot Bitcoin funds but has approved a host of crypto futures ETFs.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s generally believed by crypto and ETF market pundits that the first SEC approval of a spot-based crypto ETF is just around the corner. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predict a 90% chance of a greenlight no later than January 10, 2024.\n\nOthers have suggested that rejection of spot crypto ETFs might ignite some legal turmoil for the SEC, which in August suffered an earth-shattering court loss when it was ruled the regulator must re-review Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF.\n\nAn ether spot ETF would have a similar impact as a Bitcoin counterpart, appealing to sophisticated investors who previously didn\u2019t feel comfortable buying crypto. Moreover, Ethereum adds an extra layer of intrigue as a proof-of-stake (PoS) token, which suggests investors could also stake the underlying ETH for more rewards.\n\nAll of this means that potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would push the price of ether higher as fresh money enters the market of the second-largest crypto."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecently, the trading behavior of an Ethereum whale has sparked intrigue as it deviates from the typical \"buy low, sell high\" mantra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA whale, known to have narrowly avoided the FTX/Alameda crash by timely withdrawing ETH from the exchange, executed a sale of 6,099 ETH for 12 million USDC at a price of $1,964 per ETH, pocketing approximately $14.3 million. This transaction, occurring just fourhours ago, has raised questions among the trading community: is this whale's trading pattern worth emulating?\n\n1/ A whale who made ~$14.3M on $ETH sold 6,099 $ETH for 12M $USDC at $1,964 4 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nIs this whale worth copy-trading?\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at how he trades.\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/JngtszbIDf \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 15, 2023\n\nReviewing the whale's historical activity since December 2022 reveals a series of 22 buy and sell actions, suggesting a strategic approach to trading. However, it is crucial to note that the whale does not consistently buy at the lowest and sell at the peak prices. Instead, they exhibit a pattern that sometimes involves buying and selling in quick succession, regardless of significant price fluctuations, indicating a complex trading strategy that may factor in more than just immediate market prices.\n\nThis behavior indicates a level of risk-taking and a nontraditional strategy that may leverage market sentiment, news or other indicators not immediately apparent to the average trader. The whale's approach, while lucrative in some instances, also comes with its own set of risks, as rapid trading amid volatile price movements can lead to unpredictable outcomes.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is often tempted to mirror the trades of these whales under the assumption that they have access to privileged information or superior market insights. However, the unpredictable nature of these \"weird moves\" suggests that copying such trading patterns without a deep understanding of the whale's strategy could be precarious.\n\nThe Ethereum market remains vibrant and fluid, with significant trades by whales adding to the complexity of market dynamics."

        "content": "An Ethereum insider has made startling allegations against Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin, stating that the Russian inventor had copied his creations.\n\nNerayoff Accuses Buterin Of Invention Replication\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to accuse Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin of copying his inventions. Nerayoff criticized the intelligence of the current Ethereum leadership, making contentious remarks about Buterin and co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin.\n\n\u201cVitalik slept on my couch & copied my inventions. He and SBF are images. They\u2019re not smart because something seems off, something is off. The recording shows his and Joe\u2019s stupidity and ignorance. Hear who understood Ethereum, me or them,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nThe former ETH Advisor continued on his tirade of allegations, casting doubts on Buterin\u2019s contributions to the network. He stated that Buterin had never invented anything substantial and that the ETH founder was the sole reason behind the network never scaling.\n\nThe accusations also suggested that the only significant achievement in the Ethereum ecosystem was the issuance of utility tokens on ICOs, which Nerayoff claimed he had invented.\n\nNerayoff also made startling revelations, accusing Buterin and Lubin of deliberately damaging the cryptocurrency by focusing on issuing fraudulent ICOs to unsuspecting investors and potentially harming them.\n\n\u201cDid Vitalik invent anything? No, he did not. Ethereum never scaled bc of him. The only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs, both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nEthereum Founder\u2019s Scalability Competence Questioned\n\nIn an X post on Tuesday, Stephen Nerayoff presented thought-provoking questions to the crypto community about Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Ethereum scalability capabilities.\n\nNerayoff released a video on X by a community member, Mr. Huber which featured Vitalik Buterin describing plans for the ETH Network. He told the crypto community to remember the video when he eventually released evidential recordings of his conversation with Buterin about his ideas for ETH 2.0.\n\n\u201cRemember this video when I drop the recording and what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures. Is Vitalik the savior they bill him as to make Ethereum scale or is he the reason it never scaled? Decide for yourselves,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nThe question raised by the former ETH Advisor has sparked debates and differing opinions about the Ethereum Founders. Although no proper evidence has been presented regarding the accusations laid against Buterin, the crypto community continues to watch and analyze the situation as it unfolds.\n\nETH bulls reclaim $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from CryptoSlate, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The largest coin by market cap broke through resistance at $37.3k and clipped $37,980 before edging back. Bitcoin is currently trading on either side of $37.3k and if BTC can keep this level as support, then fresh multi-month highs are likely in the days and weeks ahead.

The proposed ETF, named the iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to mirror the performance of Ethereum\u2019s price, as stated in the Form S-1 filed by iShares, a division known for its ETF products under BlackRock.\n\nThis move comes shortly after BlackRock established the iShares Ethereum Trust entity in Delaware and subsequent to Nasdaq\u2019s filing for the anticipated ETF. These developments indicate BlackRock\u2019s active pursuit of a spot ether ETF. BlackRock has also recently filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, further underscoring its growing focus on cryptocurrency.\n\nRead more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Calls Bitcoin an \u2018International Asset\u2019 that Could \u2018Revolutionize Finance\u2019\n\nBlackRock has chosen Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian for the proposed ether ETF. Furthermore, the ETF will use the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, managed by CF Benchmarks (a Kraken subsidiary), as its benchmark. This decision parallels the choices made for BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the value of ether saw an approximate 2% increase, reaching a high of $2,079 at the time of writing. This price movement reflects the market\u2019s positive response to BlackRock\u2019s cryptocurrency initiatives. Notably, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF proposal is still under SEC review, along with applications from other firms.\n\nRead more: BlackRock Updates Bitcoin ETF Filing to Make Access Easier for Wall Street Banks\n\nStill, some people on social media expected a higher increase in the price of ETH, which leads to the question of whether the BlackRock application was already priced in."

The duration commences upon the proposal\u2019s passage in the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM).\n\nBoyaa has also stated that a notice for the EGM and any other necessary information as per the listing rules will be sent to the shareholders in the coming days, on or before November 30.\n\nThe document began by referencing a voluntary announcement made on August 10 by the company, which proposed the purchase of crypto.\n\nThis prominent firm is looking to acquire two primary assets: Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to reports, approximately $90 million will be allocated equally between ETH and BTC. The remaining $10 million will be used to purchase stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).\n\nThe company emphasizes that the potential acquisitions will depend on bidding and asking prices for cryptocurrencies in the open market. Boyaa does not intend to pay premiums exceeding 10% of the market prices for these digital assets. The company plans to fund the potential acquisition using its idle cash reserves.\n\nThe board is responsible for determining which cryptocurrencies to acquire and their respective allocation ratios, including the optimal purchase timing.\n\nWhy Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nIn the documentation, Boyaa has emphasized its investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum and provided insights into its rationale. Specifically, the company aims to acquire cryptocurrencies that align with its business development strategies, passing rigorous risk management tests.\n\nAdditionally, Boyaa seeks to invest in cryptocurrencies with strong market liquidity and significant market values. Notably, Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, and USDT are among the assets with the highest market liquidity.\n\nRecently, large assets such as BTC and ETH have been gaining massive numbers in institutional investments. Reports suggest institutional investors have poured billions into the two significant crypto assets. Institutional investors are looking to take advantage of the long bull season also seemingly nearing."

        "content": "Crypto Macro Weekly: Ether (ETH) Pumps 11% Above $2,100 as BlackRock Files For Spot Ethereum ETF as Broader Market Rally Continues\n\nEther (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain that remains the dominant chain in the DeFi, NFT and broader web3 industries, stole the spotlight from its bigger rival Bitcoin (BTC) this week, and was last up close to 11% since Sunday after BlackRock filed to set up a US spot Ethereum ETF with Nasdaq.\n\nEther (ETH) eclipsed $2,100 for the first time since April on Thursday and came close to hitting new highs for the year as BlackRock revealed via its Nasdaq filing that it will soon apply to set up a spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC, just as it applied to set up a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC back in June.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s June application to set up a spot Bitcoin ETF was quickly followed by a dozen similar applications from rival asset managers and was undoubtedly an important turning point for the Bitcoin market it 2023.\n\nIndeed, the Bitcoin price is up around 45% since the start of June after hitting fresh highs for the year above $38,000 this week as investors bet that spot Bitcoin ETFs will soon gain approval and this will spur significant institutional inflows into the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs per sources cited by Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino in a tweet on Thursday, BlackRock is growing increasingly confident its spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by January\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement of its spot Ethereum ETF plans by BlackRock could be an important turning point for the crypto market.\n\nSince June, Bitcoin has increased its market dominance, outperforming by a significant margin, with the ETH/BTC ratio dropping over 24% at one point.\n\nHowever, in light of ETH\u2019s latest spot ETF optimism-fuelled pump, the tide could be starting to turn.\n\nCould we be about to transition from a Bitcoin-led bull market, into a broader rally with the likes of ETH outperforming.\n\nETH to $3K and BTC to $69K? Bullish Calls Are Growing\n\n\n\nPrior to BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF announcement this week, Matrixport\u2019s head of research Markus Thielen put out a now seemingly very well-timed call for a new period of ETH outperformance, even going as far as calling for a rally back towards $3,000.\n\nThielen cited an improvement in Ethereum network on-chain activity that has turned the ETH deflationary once again, as well as a technical breakout from a long-term pennant structure.\n\nMeanwhile, Matrixport has reiterated calls for Bitcoin to hit a price of at least $42,000 on spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US, while other analysts have outlined the $48,000 level as the next major bullish price target.\n\nTrading.biz analyst Cory Mitchell went even further in a note shared with members of the crypto press earlier this week, predicting that Bitcoin could hit new all-time highs as soon as mid-2024, an 85% rally from current levels.\n\n\u201cBitcoin uptrends tend to move quickly once they get going, moving hundreds of percent often in less than a year,\u201d he noted, calling this stage of the market \u201cthe acceleration phase\u201d.\n\nThe \u201creally big gains\u201d historically come a year and a half after Bitcoin price has bottomed, Mitchell explained, which points to a pump coming sometime around mid-2024, with BTC having last bottomed back in November 2022.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, bitcoin rallied 1200% in approximately 100 days\u2026 in 2017, it rallied 1900% in just under a year\u2026 in late 2020, it rallied 400% in about 140 days\u201d.\n\nMacro Takes a Back Seat, But is a Growing Tailwind\n\n\n\nSpot crypto ETFs are the big talking point right now, with the broader macro picture taking a back seat in the minds of crypto investors.\n\nBut when investors do switch their focus to developments in traditional financial markets, they will notice that current market trends are undoubtedly positive for the crypto market, adding another potentially major tailwind.\n\nWhile Fed policymakers this week, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have tried to warn the market that further rate hikes remain on the table, investors appear to be betting otherwise.\n\nWeaker-than-expected US ISM manufacturing PMI data, seen as a strong lead indicator for the economy\u2019s broader performance, flashed warning signs last week that the US economy is slowing drastically from its strong Q3 performance.\n\nMeanwhile, the US jobs market continues to cool, as evidenced by last Friday\u2019s weaker-than-expected October NFP and unemployment numbers, which should make the Fed\u2019s task in bringing inflation back under control easier, reducing the need for higher interest rates for longer.\n\nLong-term US government bond yields have dumped so far this month, with the 10-year yield last down over 30 bps at 4.6%, and this has helped spur a pump in the US stock market, with the S&P 500 up nearly 5%.\n\nRising stock prices and falling US yields as investors bet on a less \u201chawkish\u201d stance from the Fed represent an easing of financial conditions, and cryptocurrencies tend to perform very well in such an environment, as was very much the case in 2020 and 2021.\n\nSmaller Altcoins Take the Lead\n\n\n\nIn a sign that sentiment in the crypto market is really starting to heat up, major altcoins continue to pump.\n\nIn just the past seven days, Chainlink (LINK) has pumped nearly 35%, Solana (SOL) is up over 30% and Polygon (MATIC) is up over 25%.\n\nAs per blockchaincenter.net, the crypto market Altcoin Season Index was last at 29, up from 17 at the start of the month, suggesting the crypto market has left \u201cBitcoin Season\u201d territory (defined as below 25).\n\nHowever, we remain a long way from being in Altcoin Coin Season (defined as above 75), suggesting that there is a lot of room for disproportionate upside in the altcoin market, assuming the Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to pump.\n\nLooking ahead, crypto traders will remain transfixed on news relating to spot crypto ETFs in the US, but upcoming macro events like next week\u2019s US Consumer Price Index inflation and Retail Sales figures for October could further spur the crypto rally if they trigger a fresh pullback on Fed tightening bets.\n\nBitcoin bulls will be eyeing a potential test of the psychologically important $40,000 level, while Ether bulls will be pushing for a break above earlier yearly highs inn the mid-$2,100s which could open the door to a pump towards $3,000."

Users of dapps that rely on Pyth network data across 27 blockchains\u2014including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism\u2014may be eligible for a token allocation, according to the network. Pyth Network Discord administrators and holders of Pyth NFTs are also likely to receive an allotment.\n\nThe Claim Process for the Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop will open on Monday, Nov 20 at 2 PM UTC. Stay tuned for more details on instructions on how the Claim Process works. Additionally, the Claim Process will be available for 90 days.

DeFi users can check their potential eligibility for the airdrop, as well as the amount of PYTH they are set to receive, at the network\u2019s airdrop check page.\n\nPyth users in several countries, however, will be ineligible to participate by default, due to mitigating legal factors. Residents of the United States and the United Kingdom will not be able to claim PYTH tokens; nor will residents of North Korea, Ukraine, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and eight other nations and territories.\n\nPyth\u2019s native token will have an initial circulating supply of 1.5 billion, according to the network. 8.5 billion additional PYTH tokens will unlock between six and 42 months from launch.\n\nDeFi oracle networks like Pyth connect blockchains with data sources from the off-chain world, allowing DeFi smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs from real-world events and data. They can enable smart contracts, for example, to automatically order products when an inventory drops; to pay out agreements that hinge on the price of stocks and commodities; or to track carbon emissions and tax a company if a certain level is exceeded. Oracle networks are central to the growing integration of the crypto market and traditional financial markets, as well as the application of smart contracts to traditional businesses.\n\nAs intermediaries of information, oracle networks can also be exploited. Last fall, a hacker managed to drain $100 million from decentralized exchange Mango Markets by manipulating the oracle-reported price of the MNGO token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPyth is the fourth-largest such oracle network by total value secured, according to DeFi Llama; Pyth\u2019s chief competitor, Chainlink, boasts over nine times the value secured, and a dominant 45% market share, compared with Pyth\u2019s 4.83%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

While Hoskinson wanted Ethereum to be designed for commercial purposes, Buterin supported the non-profit initiative.\n\nOver seven years after Hoskinson left Ethereum, Nerayoff revealed that he informed Buterin that he made a huge mistake getting rid of the Cardano boss.\n\n\u201cAre the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles happy now that the boy genius is copying Cardano?\u201d he quizzed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nButerin Copied Ripple Smart Contract Functionality\n\nAdditionally, Nerayoff alleged that Buterin copied innovative ideas from Ripple to develop Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality.\n\nFurthermore, Nerayoff claimed that Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin also stole his idea on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and utility tokens.\n\nPer Nerayoff, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality and ICO were the only two things that have been successful for the crypto project. Notably, Nerayoff\u2019s allegations have continued to raise questions about Ethereum\u2019s technological underpinnings.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s latest allegation comes a few hours after he promised to provide proof concerning Lubin and Buterin\u2019s alleged fraudulent activities. In a November 12 tweet, the crypto advisor promised to share this proof within the next 4 \u2013 5 days.\n\nPast Allegations Against Ethereum Team\n\nRecently, Nerayoff has been making shocking allegations against the Ethereum team, especially Lubin and Buterin. As reported earlier, he claimed that both Ethereum execs had secret dealings with SEC chair Gary Gensler and the agency\u2019s immediate past chairman Jay Clayton.\n\nIn addition, Neayoff alleged that the fraud carried out by Ethereum\u2019s founders is 1,000 times bigger than the ones perpetrated by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).\n\nHe recently accused the duo of sabotaging crypto and conducting fraudulent ICOs. To date, neither Buterin nor Lubin have responded to any of these allegations."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Steven Neyaroff has accused Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin of fraudulent activities.\n\nNeyaroff has promised to release evidence within 48 hours.\n\nIf proven true, Neyaroff's claims could have a significant impact on Ethereum's reputation and future.\n\nIn a surprising or rather, shocking, turn of events, Steven Neyaroff, a key player in Ethereum\u2019s early days, has leveled serious accusations against the platform\u2019s founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. Neyaroff, using X (formerly Twitter), has vowed to reveal compelling evidence within the next 48 hours, alleging fraudulent activities by the Ethereum creators.\n\nHere\u2019s what he has to say.\n\nNeyaroff\u2019s Allegations\n\nNeyaroff\u2019s statements have increasingly targeted Buterin, suggesting deeper involvement in what he describes as deceptive practices.\n\nRemember this video when I drop the recording & what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures.

Decide for yourselves.\u201d\n\nButerin is the Target\n\nNeyaroff\u2019s recent messages increasingly focus on Vitalik Buterin, suggesting deeper involvement in what he calls deceptive practices. He confidently questions Buterin\u2019s role in Ethereum\u2019s struggle to scale, hinting at a lack of innovation.\n\nQuestioning Buterin\u2019s originality, Neyaroff asserts that Ethereum\u2019s challenges in scaling can be directly linked to a lack of innovative solutions from Buterin. The cryptocurrency world is left wondering whether Buterin is the scaling savior he\u2019s touted to be or a hindrance to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nFraudulent ICOs?\n\nIn a shocking twist, Neyaroff accuses Buterin and Lubin of orchestrating fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs), claiming these schemes have significantly hampered the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s growth. According to Neyaroff, these ICOs weren\u2019t just diversions but deliberate attempts to profit at the industry\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cOnly killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs, which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people.\u201d\n\nRead More: Did Ethereum Purchase a Free Pass From Hinman?

If proven true, Neyaroff\u2019s claims may have broad implications for Ethereum\u2019s reputation and future.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency world is gearing up for what many anticipate to be a major bull run, and two of the most talked-about players in this potential rally are Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Both blockchains offer unique strengths and have amassed significant interest from the crypto community. This article will explore the current state and future potential of Solana and Ethereum as they prepare for the next big wave in the crypto market.\n\nSolana\u2019s Bull Run Prospects\n\nSolana, renowned for its high-performance capabilities and smart contract functionality, has been on a remarkable rally. The price of SOL has soared by about 44% in a week, testing the $60 mark and currently trading around $59.5.\n\nThis surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including broader market trends and increased optimism about spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Notably, Solana has been one of the top performers in the crypto market, with a nearly 50% increase in 30 days\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn-chain metrics reflect a growing interest in Solana. The number of active addresses on the Solana network has been trending higher, reaching around 270,000 on average over the past week. Additionally, Solana\u2019s TVL (Total Value Locked) has surged to over $2.1 billion, its highest level since October 2022. This indicates a significant uptick in network activity and institutional interest\u200b\u200b.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Interest funding rate for Solana futures contracts has swung into positive territory, reaching its highest level since at least May. This suggests that traders opening long positions are paying premiums,\n\nEthereum: A Titan in the Crypto Space\n\nEthereum, the largest layer-one blockchain in terms of usage and adoption, continues to be a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a slight dip of nearly 0.5%, holding at the $2,051 level.\n\nDespite this minor loss, Ethereum has shown remarkable resilience and growth over the past months. It remains up by 8.5% in a week and an impressive 31% in the last 30 months. This growth has been partly fueled by enthusiasm related to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and the general momentum of the crypto market. Since the beginning of the year, Ethereum has risen by 71%, with expectations of continued strong performance if ETF approvals usher in a new bull market\u200b\u200b.\n\nLooking ahead, ongoing optimism surrounding Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs indicates that Ethereum\u2019s price is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the coming weeks. Predictions suggest that Ethereum\u2019s price could reach $2,500 by the end of the year and possibly retest its all-time high in a fully-fledged bull market by 2024\u200b\u200b.\n\nA Unique Investment Opportunity\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies, where giants like Ethereum and Solana are vying for dominance, Meme Moguls presents itself as a unique and emerging contender. As a meme-backed stock market/exchange, Meme Moguls offers a blend of entertainment and investment, making it an appealing platform for a wide range of users.\n\nIts potential for significant growth and its unique position in the crypto market makes it an interesting alternative or complement to established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has formally submitted an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe ETF, named iShares Ethereum Trust, aims to \u201cgenerally reflect the performance of the price of ether,\u201d as stated in the Form S-1 filed with the SEC by iShares on Wednesday, November 15. The iShares brand is affiliated with BlackRock\u2019s suite of ETF products.\n\nThis filing follows BlackRock\u2019s registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations a week prior, for which there was a dispute on social media about whether it was real or fake, which led to a brief surge in XRP\u2019s price. Shortly after Nasdaq submitted the proposed ETF, it confirmed that BlackRock is actively developing a spot ether ETF.\n\nPrevious ETF developments\n\nIn June of this year, BlackRock applied to the iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust, significantly influencing market dynamics. The SEC is actively reviewing various applications for spot ETFs of this crypto, including one from BlackRock. While the asset manager\u2019s BTC ETF ticker, IBTC, has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp\u2019s website since August, it gained notice only in the latter part of last month.\n\nMajor trading firms, including Jane Street, Virtu Financial, and Jump Trading, are reportedly engaged in discussions to offer liquidity for BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot should it receive regulatory approval. The anticipation of approval for a spot in Bitcoin ETF has contributed to a recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe company\u2019s move into Ethereum indicates a growing interest in digital assets beyond BTC. Throughout history, ETFs have consistently drawn significant investments, offering a convenient entry point and streamlining asset acquisition for institutional players instead of their holdings\u2019 self-custody."

        "content": "Play the BlackRock Ethereum ETF Price Pump with ETHETF Token \u2013 Already 400% Gains at Launch\n\nWednesday, November 15, 2023 \u2013 A 400% gain for early DEX hunters from ETHETF Token is fuelling a robust Ethereum ETF narrative in the crypto market after the new token launched on Uniswap yesterday.\n\n$ETHETF launched at 1pm GMT on Tuesday and secured quick 4x gains for the earliest buyers amidst strong liquidity and volume, signaling the possibility of much higher prices to come once news of its arrival gets out and the Ethereum narrative takes further hold of the market.\n\nA little over 24 hours after stealth-launching, $ETHETF \u2013 playing off positive sentiment around Ethereum ETF news \u2013 reached a market capitalization of over $2 million before finding support around $1.2 million. With $520,000 liquidity \u2013 locked in the Uniswap V3 pool for seven days \u2013 facilitating smooth trading and minimal price slippage, the token has formed a strong foundation.\n\nThe ETHETF Token website states the coin\u2019s intention to be ahead of the curve before BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF is brought to the market, an event that is expected to cause a price explosion for Ethereum (ETH) and all coins associated with it.\n\nTo keep abreast of the latest developments in the ETHETF Token project, follow the X account and join the ETHETF Telegram group.\n\nBlackRock starts off massive Ethereum ETF narrative\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum price broke out towards $2,000 last week following BlackRock\u2019s application for an Ethereum spot ETF, but market watchers have now found another way to play this move.\n\nFor traders, Ethereum\u2019s price has reached historical resistance at the $ 2,000 mark, and staying above this level was a requirement for many analysts to increase their bullish sentiment for altcoins.\n\nSeveral prominent altcoins have seen price increases as much as 100% or more recently as capital rotates from Bitcoin to Ethereum to larger cap alts. Key to sustaining this pump was the bullish BlackRock news for Ethereum.\n\nAs the positive market sentiment surrounding the likelihood of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reaches fever pitch, the hype around a possible Ethereum ETF is only beginning.\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC) surging 42% from a sticking point around $26,000 all the way up to $37,000 upon the news that the SEC has an option to approve all 12 pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications within a current 8-day window, capital now appears to be moving from BTC to other crypto assets.\n\nEthereum (ETH) spiked from $1,800 to close to $2,100 when the BlackRock ETF news was released, only a 16% move, and should be expected to keep going as more details come out regarding this development.\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish narrative continues in 2023/24\n\n\n\nDuring the last bear market in 2022, Ethereum stood firm compared to other assets, thanks in no small part to The Merge \u2013 an event that transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake.\n\nThis event, also known as the \u2018Shangella\u2019 upgrade, announced Ethereum as a greener blockchain with enormous passive income opportunities due to the ease of being able to stake ETH 2.0 without expensive and complicated mining equipment.\n\nEthereum stayed strong throughout the bear market and bounced back well above its previous bull cycle all-time high of $1,400 thanks to hype around The Merge, while Bitcoin dropped below its $19,000 previous ATH for a good while. This set a strong foundation for bullish developments to take the ETH price higher in 2023 and 2024.\n\nAnd while Ethereum has underperformed compared to Bitcoin in 2023, the news that the largest financial asset manager in the world \u2013 with trillions of dollars managed on its books \u2013 intends to offer a spot ETF for Ethereum could open the floodgates for the largest altcoin.\n\nWhy Ethereum is the new silver\n\n\n\nThe excitement surrounding ETFs for Bitcoin is for good reason, and gold is often referenced as a precedent of what could happen when a spot ETF is eventually approved and launched. Gold was mainly being traded by institutions before a spot Gold ETF opened the market to retail investors.\n\nGold skyrocketed nearly 350% after the first Gold ETF was approved in the US in 2004, and something similar is expected to happen for Bitcoin.\n\nEnter Ethereum, which is the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s digital gold. As the second-largest and most-trusted crypto asset outside of Bitcoin, a spot ETF for Ethereum would put the newly bonafide \u2018digital silver\u2019 into the largest portfolios and launch the currency into the stratosphere.\n\nAssuming BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved, it should only be a matter of time before its spot Ethereum ETF is also launched to the market. The knock-on effect of that will be substantial as other financial firms launch their own Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSavvy traders view ETHETF Token as the intelligent way to play the Ethereum narrative\n\n\n\nEthereum is expected to hit $2,400 and eventually $3,000 if the crypto bull market continues to pick up steam. If this happens, tokens associated with Ethereum will pump even more, much like previous bull cycles in the market.\n\nWith capital rotation, the rule to play by is that after Bitcoin pumps, Ethereum pumps, and then altcoins. A surge for Ethereum past $3,000 will likely give a token like $ETHETF multiples that would be difficult to find anywhere else.\n\nETHETF Token is an ERC-20 token that is easily accessible on Uniswap for any trader and offers bullish conditions for traders leading up to an Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nThe website indicates that there was no presale, a stealth launch and that 95% of the 100 million token supply was allocated to DEX liquidity. With liquidity now at $520,000, locked for seven days, and 24-hour volume totaling $4.37 million, conditions are perfect for explosive upside action.\n\nWith 5% of the token supply allocated to CEX listings, it\u2019s an indicator that the team behind ETHETF Token intends to create something unique and not just another meme-style token. In addition to this, 2% of every buy transaction is burned, which decreases the circulating supply all the time. After just one day, 5.35% of the $ETHETF token supply has already been burned.\n\nOne of the project\u2019s major roadmap milestones happens when the first Ethereum spot ETF is approved; this will result in the 2% buy tax being removed from the smart contract, which will release the shackles for $ETHETF and encourage more upside pressure.\n\nTo buy the token, simply connect your crypto wallet to Uniswap, copy and paste it into the contract address to ensure you are buying the correct coin, and make your purchase. Make sure you have enough ETH left over to pay for gas.\n\nBuy $ETHETF todayDextools Link"

        "content": "November 15, 2023 \u2013 New York, United States\n\nNocturne \u2013 a protocol enabling on-chain private accounts \u2013 today announced the successful deployment of Nocturne version one to Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more private and accessible Ethereum.\n\nFor the first time, users will have a compatible and easy-to-use product resembling a private on-chain account.\n\nNocturne version one is a step towards compatible on-chain privacy that functions simply as another account rather than a distinct tool or ecosystem.\n\nUsers will find transacting with Nocturne similar to using a smart contract wallet, with the added benefit of privacy.\n\nNocturne version one is currently out-of-the-box compatible with any DeFi protocol that represents state via output tokens \u2013 e.g., Uniswap swap tokens, Aave aTokens, Compound cTokens and more.\n\nThere are plans to later extend this compatibility to arbitrary protocols.\n\nLuke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne, said,\n\n\u201cWith Nocturne version one\u2019s launch, we\u2019re moving away from the notion of a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019 Privacy should be embedded at the account layer, and the version one launch is the first step in making this possible.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure that everyone \u2013 from individual users to large institutions \u2013 can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world. This is more than a product \u2013 it\u2019s a commitment to making Ethereum more accessible and enabling secure and private money over the internet.\u201d\n\nNocturne is built on the belief that privacy on public blockchains will only become mainstream if it\u2019s seamlessly integrated with the existing user experience.\n\nNocturne\u2019s objective is straightforward \u2013 to create private user accounts on layer ones and layer twos that are fully compatible with existing Ethereum accounts.\n\nTo read more about private accounts, please see Nocturne\u2019s recent blog post.\n\nPrivacy \u2013 t he keystone for Ethereum\u2019s growth\n\nThough DeFi and other on-chain activities have surged in popularity, privacy concerns have prevented broader acceptance and use of crypto as money.\n\nRecognizing that the typical user may be uneasy with the idea of their financial dealings being public, and that institutions demand confidentiality for their transactions, Nocturne addresses these critical barriers head-on.\n\nPrivacy isn\u2019t just a feature \u2013 it\u2019s foundational to the broader adoption of crypto.\n\nNocturne\u2019s future vision\n\nAs they continue building new versions, Nocturne\u2019s long-term vision is to make the experience so seamless that by default, every Ethereum user automatically has a private account which mirrors their public account.\n\nIn short, a seamless parallel account layer for privacy.\n\nNocturne\u2019s plans for achieving its longer-term vision include the following.\n\nTransition to a more permissionless protocol by migrating to proof of innocence, as described by Vitalik and Ameen Solemani in the \u2018Practical Privacy and Compliance\u2018 paper.\n\nBring Nocturne accounts closer to usable as general wallets by extending Nocturne\u2019s protocol compatibility to arbitrary smart contracts.\n\nImprove the compatibility of Nocturne accounts with EOAs and smart accounts through a scheme that allows for public wallet authorization to be leveraged within Nocturne for security.\n\nHow to access\n\nNocturne version one is live and can be accessed through a dedicated private vault UI, allowing users to discreetly manage their assets.\n\nThe current UI capabilities include deposits, transfers to new burner addresses and private swaps and staking. To get started, visit the website.\n\nAbout Nocturne Labs\n\nNocturne Labs is a forward-thinking blockchain technology company committed to addressing the most critical privacy and user experience challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith a pioneering protocol for private accounts, Nocturne enables users to transact safely with built-in privacy.\n\nThis marks a substantial stride in advancing the usability of public blockchains.\n\nBacked by notable investors such as Bain Capital Crypto, Polychain Capital, Bankless and Vitalik, Nocturne is led by a team of experienced developers dedicated to enabling a more secure and accessible Ethereum.\n\nFor more information, visit the website.\n\nContact\n\nKayla Gill, PR manager at Serotonin"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC bulls take advantage of recent dip with $40,000 in sight - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could climb 7%, recouping the ground covered since the November 9 rejection from the $37,972 range high.\n\nEthereum price defends the $1,935 support level at all costs, with success likely to initiate a 10% rally to $2,200.\n\nRipple price shows weakness, breaks the triangle to the south as the 25-day EMA provides support at $0.6183.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing strength again after a stark correction on Tuesday that bruised the market. Ethereum (ETH) is following the trend set by the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, the same cannot be said for Ripple (XRP), at least not yet, as the remittance token's price is showing weakness.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price drops, $90 million in open interest wiped out amid jitter over spot BTC ETF window closing\n\nBitcoin price pulls north as momentum restores\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pulling north, trying to recover all the ground lost in the recent crash that saw up to $90 million in open interest wiped out of the market. With the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) coming into play at $34,572, BTC is trying to reclaim territory above the critical resistance at $36,788.\n\nFor a confirmed move north, investors should watch for Bitcoin price to break and close above the $36,788 level. This will set the tone for BTC to target the $37,972 range high before reaching the $38,000 psychological level.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend its reach to tag the $40,000 psychological level, with such a move constituting a 10% climb above current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is tipping north, suggesting momentum is rising, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) holds in positive territory. This adds credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, another rejection from the $36,788 resistance level could see Bitcoin price losing support due to the 25-day and 50-day EMAs at $34,572 and $32,456, respectively, before dipping into the supply zone turned bullish breaker where it could test the 100-day EMA at $30,528.\n\nAlso Read: Over $1 billion worth of BTC susceptible to be sold as Bitcoin price hints at short-term correction\n\nEthereum price holds above $1,935\n\nEthereum (ETH) price maintains above the $1,935 level, a crucial support that could spell doom for ETH if lost. With the RSI tipping north and the AO holding in the positive zone, ETH could scale north, restoring itself above the $2,029 support in order to ride the ascending trendline. This could ship the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to the $2,136 range high.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if selling pressure increases, Ethereum price could slip below the $1,935 support. A decisive move below this level would confirm the downtrend, with ETH likely to test the 25-day or 50-day EMA at $1,892 and $1,806, respectively.\n\nIn a worse case, Ethereum price could tag the 100-day EMA at $1,763, with a break and close below it invalidating the bullish thesis under the $1,753 support level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: Eighteen-months ascending triangle pattern appraises $4,000 target for ETH\n\nRipple price breaks the triangle\n\nRipple (XRP) price has shown weakness, breaking out of the triangle to the downside amid reducing volatility. Increased selling pressure could send XRP below the 25-day EMA at $0.6181. A break and close below the $0.5981 would lower optimism for a move north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if buyer momentum increases, Ripple price could restore back above the lower trendline of the triangle above $0.6584, which would set the tone for a move to $0.7000.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend toward the Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.7519 to $0.7623, with Ripple price filling the inefficiency and restoring balance.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"

        "title": "Is ETH About to Crash Below $2K? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy GreatestTrader\n\nBuyers in the Ethereum market have recently driven the price into a strong uptrend, reaching a critical resistance level at $2K. However, encountering a significant hurdle around this crucial mark, there exists the potential for a temporary consolidation correction phase in the coming days.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of the daily chart reveals substantial support around the crucial region, comprising the static support at $1,500 and the lower boundary of the wedge pattern. This support fueled a significant surge, indicating strong buying momentum, with buyers targeting the critical $2K resistance zone.\n\nDespite reaching this key level, aligned with the wedge\u2019s upper boundary, Ethereum faced rejection, leading to a slight retracement towards the broken 200-day moving average at $1,783.\n\nConsidering the significance of the resistance at $2K and the associated wedge pattern\u2019s upper boundary, a temporary continuation of the ongoing retracement followed by consolidation around the broken moving averages is highly likely. If the price completes a pullback to the broken moving averages, buyers may re-enter the market, aiming once again for the substantial $2K level.\n\n\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the intensified buying pressure around the $1,5K support region propelled Ethereum toward the substantial $2K resistance. This upward movement demonstrated significant bullish momentum, reflecting the buyers\u2019 dominance in the market.\n\nHowever, the $2K region represents a crucial psychological resistance, posing challenges for buyers to push the price higher. Notably, a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggested insufficient buying pressure, leading to a reversal and slight corrections.\n\nAdditionally, a recognizable double-top pattern around this pivotal resistance confirmed the presence of sellers in the short term.\n\nGiven the existing market dynamics, there is a high likelihood of an extended consolidation correction phase in the short term. This implies that the market might continue its retracement before definitively determining its next course of action. In this scenario, the support range between the 0.5 and 61.8 levels of the Fibonacci retracement ($1,839 \u2013 $1,769) is expected to be the next level of interest for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\n\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy GreatestTrader\n\nThe futures market has been a significant influencer of Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics, making it imperative for the current uptrend to sustain favorable conditions in this market.\n\nIllustrated in the chart is the 30-day moving average of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell ratio, a crucial metric for gauging sentiment in the futures market. During a period of substantial price increase in Ethereum, the taker buy-sell ratio exhibited a robust uptrend, signaling strong buying interest. However, a recent reversal in the metric\u2019s trend has led to a downtrend, dipping below the threshold of 1. This reversal indicates that sellers are now executing more aggressive orders in the aggregate, potentially to realize profits or to take short positions.\n\nSignificantly, this shift in the metric aligns with the recent market rejection and its struggle to move higher. The confluence of these events suggests a potential for a short-term retracement in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nShould the taker buy-sell ratio resume an upward trajectory, surpassing the 1 threshold, it would indicate a revival of bullish sentiment in the short term, potentially supporting the continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a failure of the metric to exhibit upward movement would raise concerns about the sustainability of any bullish momentum."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF Styled ETHETF Token Starts Mammoth Burn Program, Price to Pump 10x? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Spot Ethereum ETF Styled ETHETF Token Starts Mammoth Burn Program, Price to Pump 10x?\n\nThursday, November 16th, 2023 \u2013 Two days after launching, $ETHETF coin has announced a 21 million token burn program, reducing total token supply by 21%.\n\nThe price of $ETHETF jumped 25% on the news to $0.01601 and is now up 12% at $0.1448. News of the burn program comes at the same time as fund giant BlackRock officially filed its application to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn X/Twitter and Telegram posts, the ETHETF Token team has said that the tokens will be burned over a 21-day period, starting with 1 million tokens burned today.\n\nBurning is a method whereby tokens are sent to a null address on the blockchain that only has a receive function, effectively removing from circulation tokens sent to it.\n\nBy removing 21% of the total supply it helps to boost the price of the remaining tokens. For those considering buying the token, the burn program is a strong demonstration of the team\u2019s commitment to the project and its intention to continue seeking out ways to enhance the value of the token.\n\n21% supply burn + 2% transaction buy burn = $ETHETF price pump\n\n\n\nLinked to the spot Ethereum ETF theme, $ETHETF already has a burn mechanism, whereby each buy attracts a 2% token burn. These buy burns will cease when a spot Ethereum ETF is launched. Today\u2019s news of the 21% burn program hugely buttresses the value-creating deflationary properties of the token.\n\nYesterday, in another sign of the team\u2019s commitment to the project, more than half a million dollars of liquidity was locked. This move makes trading much smoother by facilitating both smaller and larger trades. It also is something that traders will look out for when seeking reassurance that a project is not a rug pull.\n\n$ETHETF now trades on the V2 and V3 liquidity pool versions of the Uniswap decentralized exchange. V3 has locked liquidity of $572k while V2 has liquidity of $241k.\n\nThe token has a market cap of $1.35 million and 405 holders, meaning it is early days for the coin with plenty of scope for upside progress. Following the strategic move by the team, the next three weeks will be price-supportive, as, no doubt, will be the news flow.\n\nBlackRock Ethereum ETF Fever can push ETHETF Token price higher 10x or more\n\n\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Form-S1 registration filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that the fund\u2019s name will be iShares Ethereum Trust, just as its Bitcoin stablemate will be named the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWhen the largest asset manager in the financial industry comes calling, it is time to sit up and take notice for all those not already inside the crypto tent.\n\nBlackRock doesn\u2019t make applications for ETFs unless it thinks it can gain approval for them. Bloomberg analysts put the chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved at 90%. If the Bitcoin variant succeeds then an Ethereum product is likely a shoo-in.\n\nThe SEC has previously failed to approve spot Bitcoin products because of the lack of surveillance in the market and the dangers of price manipulation.\n\nHowever, in a recent court ruling the judge called out the SEC for being inconsistent and wrong by approving a futures product that depends on the same underlying pricing environment while applying a higher bar to a spot product.\n\nOn the second point about surveillance, BlackRock is teaming up with Coinbase in a \u2018surveillance-sharing agreement\u2019 to explicitly address those concerns.\n\nA steady flow of corroborating nuggets of news is expected over the coming days and weeks, all of which will reinforce the value of the $ETHETF token, making 10x gains a reasonable probability for this ETH derivative coin.\n\n2% Buy Tax: An innovative feature to enhance community growth, automatically burned with each purchase \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\ude80 After the SEC approval of the #Ethereum Spot #ETF, the buy tax will be lifted, signifying a major step towards mainstream #Crypto adoption!$ETH #CryptoCommunity #Web3 pic.twitter.com/7YhR9vH2E6 \u2014 EthereumETF_Token (@ETHETFToken) November 16, 2023\n\nFOMO will grow as spot Ethereum ETF news flow hots up\n\n\n\nAll those looking for a way to play the spot Ethereum ETF theme are highly likely to come across ETHETF Token while conducting their due diligence research.\n\nChoosing to introduce the supplementary burn program at this time is a masterstroke. There is nothing like rising prices to encourage more buyers and further rises in price. Market participants watching this price action will be likely to succumb to FOMO.\n\nFor traders and investors hunting for a way to leverage the spot Ethereum ETF frenzy, $ETHETF presents a solid way to get ahead of the crowd. It is the perfect way to \u2018buy the rumor\u2019. And because $ETHETF buyers are getting in early, well before the ETF itself is launched, they are protected against any temporary \u2018sell the news\u2019 sell-off.\n\nEthereum is the most-used blockchain for running applications based on smart contracts and as such is the base layer of Web3 decentralized applications. There are many other blockchain ecosystems vying to be Ethereum-killers, but none comes close to Ethereum.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for the approval by the SEC and the subsequent launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, because $ETHETF is already trading on decentralized exchanges, enabling smart traders to get exposure to the Ethereum ETF investment theme immediately.\n\nTo purchase the ETHETF Token, connect a crypto wallet to Uniswap, copy and paste in the contract address to make sure you are buying the correct coin, and then make your purchase.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As Double-Top Pattern Threatens ETH Rally, How To Stay Profitable - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) climbed above $2,000 and tested resistance at $2,130 for the first since April last week amid renewed euphoria around the filing of the first Ether spot exchange-traded fund by global leading asset manager BlackRock.\n\nInvestors are also looking forward to the potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later this week, which could also be bullish for Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the approval of the spot ETFs is not guaranteed since the SEC can decide to postpone its decision.\n\nNevertheless, investors turned their attention back to Ethereum price the moment news broke that BlackRock had made the first step toward applying for a spot ETH ETF.\n\nCan Ethereum Price Uphold Support Above $2,000\n\nEther is trading at $2,010 at the time of writing on Wednesday during US business hours. Holding support above $2,000 seems critical for the continuation of the uptrend, especially with bulls having lost the support briefly after the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, with inflation easing in the country, investors are expected to gain confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, geopolitical tensions occasioned by the Israel-Hamas war may continue to drive investors to crypto with ETH and BTC being the biggest contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, support above $2,000 would mean that Ethereum has the momentum to keep the uptrend intact. It could also help support the bullish outlook from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nIf Ethereum slides below $2,000, it could create instability and possibly lead to a sell-off as traders may want to protect their wallets to avoid liquidations. Investors who bought after the breakout above the seller congestion at $1,900 may want to sell, thus increasing the overhead pressure.\n\nThe presence of a double-top pattern around $2,130 could further complicate the technical situation for the bulls. Another rejection may lead to a spike in selling pressure.\n\nFor that reason, market participants are likely to be concerned about Ethereum\u2019s decline below $2,000 which might trigger a sell-off to $1,900 and the local support at $1,800.\n\nTraders interested in shorting ETH may want to ensure that the blue MACD line crosses below the red signal line. The momentum indicator will have to persistently drop toward the neutral area to affirm the new bearish thesis.\n\nHowever, there is a very narrow chance that declines will intensify, especially with Ethereum forming double bullish crosses on the daily chart. The first pattern occurred with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (red) moving above the 100-day EMA (blue) followed by the second cross where the same 50-day EMA flipped above the 200-day EMA (purple).\n\nCombined, these bull market indicators affirm the bullish outlook in the market, propping Ethereum price rally towards $3,000.\n\nEthereum Network Fees Hit 4-Month Highs\n\nAccording to blockchain data company Santiment, the Ethereum network fees have in the recent past increased to their highest level in four months. This increase also coincided with the token\u2019s climb above $2,000 suggesting that investors were transacting more on-chain.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 #Ethereum's fees have unsurprisingly risen as $ETH rose back above $2K last week & network utility surged. Relatively, though, transactions are still cheap compared to $14 May average fee levels we saw. Watch how other ERC-20's are impacted, as well. https://t.co/yuzXALw53z pic.twitter.com/ndw1PYeVEF \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 14, 2023\n\nThere is always a positive correlation between Ethereum price and the transaction fees. As the price of Ether rallies, investors tend to move more of the token on-chain, which contributes to the volatility and the subsequent uptrend.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Celsius Moves $10 Million in Ethereum to Exchange Following Bankruptcy Plan Approval\n\nCrypto lending company Celsius has transferred over $10 million worth of Ethereum to an exchange on Wednesday, just 6 days after a judge approved the firm\u2019s bankruptcy plan.\n\nAccording to on-chain data tracked by Lookonchain, Celsius moved 5,160 ETH worth around $10.49 million to the institutional trading platform FalconX. The bankrupt company is currently transitioning to a new model under creditor ownership.\n\nCelsius Enters New Chapter Post-Bankruptcy\n\n\n\nCelsius filed for bankruptcy back in July 2022 amid a wider downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Under the newly approved plan, Celsius will be converted into a crypto mining and staking firm called NewCo, which is expected to have a $1.25 billion balance sheet. A portion of this balance sheet will consist of liquid crypto assets that can be staked to generate yields.\n\nWe noticed that #Celsius transferred 5,160 $ETH ($10.63M) to #FalconX. And #Celsius also transferred a lot of tokens to exchanges and #FalconX 5 days ago. It seems that #Celsius wants to sell some assets with the rising prices.https://t.co/3gGOucC9gY pic.twitter.com/ILhpK0qLJy \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 14, 2023\n\nThe transfer of Ethereum suggests Celsius may be looking to sell some holdings to raise capital as part of this transition. Ethereum prices have climbed nearly 70% since the start of 2023, recovering from the lows seen last year. The timing could allow Celsius to offload ETH at relatively favorable rates.\n\nEthereum Sale Preps Celsius for Focus on Staking\n\n\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, Celsius has also recently moved various other tokens to exchanges like Binance and OKX. These include stablecoins, governance tokens like SPELL, and utility tokens like BAT. The bankrupt company seems to be liquidating parts of its portfolio across the board.\n\nLast week, a judge approved a restructuring plan that will formally sign over ownership of Celsius to its creditors. Under the new ownership structure, creditors are expected to benefit from the staking yields generated by Celsius\u2019 remaining crypto assets. Estimates suggest the staking operation could bring in $10 to $20 million per year.\n\nThe decision came after months of uncertainty surrounding the fate of the troubled lender. Celsius halted withdrawals back in June 2022, citing extreme market conditions. The freeze left thousands of customers unable to access their assets held on the platform.\n\nThe firm\u2019s bankruptcy filing followed shortly after, with Celsius owing creditors nearly $5 billion at the time. The restructuring plan lays out the terms for creditors to recover a portion of the owed funds.\n\nWith ownership now being transferred to creditors, Celsius is distancing itself from its former retail lending model. The approved bankruptcy plan explicitly forbids the newly formed entity from \u201cengaging in lending or rehypothecation of assets.\u201d\n\nInstead, NewCo will function solely as a crypto mining and staking enterprise, using protocols like Lido to generate staking yields from assets like Ethereum. Liquidating ETH holdings to exchanges aligns with this strategy pivot.\n\nThe year-long Celsius drama highlights the risks associated with crypto lending platforms. Attractive yields enticed customers, but overly speculative practices put customer deposits in jeopardy when markets declined. With new management in place, Celsius hopes to chart a more sustainable path forward."

        "content": "BlackRock taps Coinbase custodian for its Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has officially filed a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on Ethereum.\n\nThe proposed ETF, named \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust,\u201d aims to provide investors with exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price movements through traditional stock exchange channels.\n\nThe filing, made with the Nasdaq stock exchange, outlines BlackRock\u2019s intention to create an ETF that reflects the performance of the price of ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. The ETF would hold ether as its underlying asset, and Coinbase Global is designated as the custodian for the fund\u2019s ether holdings.\n\nThis move follows BlackRock\u2019s registration of the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations a week ago. The recent filing with the SEC provides more details about the proposed ETF, including the selection of Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian and the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate as the benchmark.\n\nThe iShares Ethereum Trust filing comes in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s previous filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust in June of this year. The SEC is currently reviewing multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, and BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin ETF filing, known by the ticker IBTC, is awaiting approval.\n\nThe announcement had a muted impact on the price of ether, which experienced a modest increase of nearly 2% to around $2,080 following the news. BlackRock\u2019s interest in offering both bitcoin and ethereum ETFs reflects the growing demand for cryptocurrency investment products from institutional investors.\n\nIf approved, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF would provide retail investors with a regulated way to gain exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price without directly holding the cryptocurrency. While the filing provides detailed information about the ETF\u2019s structure, the regulatory agency\u2019s decision is awaited amid previous rejections of spot Bitcoin ETF proposals.\n\nEarlier in October, Grayscale Investments, in partnership with NYSE Arca, also submitted its own application to the SEC seeking approval to transform the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently stands as the world\u2019s largest ether investment product, managing almost $5 billion in assets. When launching a new crypto ETF, regulatory authorization is typically sought from the exchange that lists the ETF\u2019s shares, rather than the sponsor itself."

        "content": "A new meme coin prepares to join the race, but can it hang with the big boys?\n\nGameStop Memes: A Challenger for Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital currency, where Bitcoin and Ethereum have reigned supreme for years, a new player has emerged on the scene - GameStop Memes Coin. The rise of GameStop Memes Coin has caught the attention of the crypto world, and it's making waves with its unique approach and, most notably, its association with the popular meme culture. In this article, we delve deep into the world of GameStop Memes Coin, its origins, potential, and whether it can truly challenge the giants - Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Genesis of GameStop Memes Coin\n\nGameStop Memes Coin, often referred to as \"GMS\" in the crypto community, has a fascinating story. It all started as a meme, much like the popular Dogecoin, which was created based on the Shiba Inu meme. The internet, known for its quirky sense of humor, loves to adopt these digital currencies, turning them into a form of satire. GameStop Memes Coin, with its roots in the GameStop stock market frenzy and meme culture, quickly garnered a cult following.\n\nA New Breed of Cryptocurrency\n\nGameStop Memes Coin is not your typical cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rely on blockchain technology for security and transactions, GMC takes a different approach. It operates on a blockchain, but its primary function is to serve as a satirical token, poking fun at the serious nature of traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\nGameStop Memes Coin vs. Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\nOne of the key metrics to consider when comparing these cryptocurrencies is market capitalization. As of the latest data available, Bitcoin stands as the kingpin with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. Ethereum is no slouch either, with a market cap of over $300 billion. GameStop Memes Coin, on the other hand, lags significantly behind, with a relatively modest market cap.\n\nPopularity and Community\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as cryptocurrencies with strong and dedicated communities. They are recognized worldwide, with countless businesses and individuals accepting them as a means of payment. GameStop Memes Coin, while gaining popularity within meme culture, is yet to make a significant impact in mainstream transactions.\n\nUtility and Functionality\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum serve as decentralized digital currencies that enable secure peer-to-peer transactions and, in the case of Ethereum, smart contracts. Their utility in the real world is undeniable. GameStop Memes Coin, however, does not aim to be a serious player in the crypto world. Its primary purpose is satire, making it less practical for mainstream use.\n\nThe Power of Memes\n\nGameStop Memes Coin's strength lies in its association with internet memes. Memes have a unique way of spreading like wildfire across social media and online platforms. The power of memes can drive interest and curiosity in GameStop Memes Coin, even among those who are not actively involved in the crypto market.\n\nThe Uncertain Future\n\nWhile GameStop Memes Coin offers a breath of fresh air and humor in the world of cryptocurrencies, its long-term viability remains uncertain. The crypto market is highly volatile, and trends can change rapidly. Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as reliable and secure assets over the years, which provides them with a level of stability that GameStop Memes Coin may struggle to match.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn conclusion, GameStop Memes Coin has certainly made a splash in the crypto world, thanks to its association with internet memes and the GameStop stock market saga. However, it's important to remember that GameStop Memes Coin is more of a meme in itself, created for humor and satire rather than serious financial transactions. While it's entertaining and intriguing, it is unlikely to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the foreseeable future.\n\nFind Out More about GameStop Memes:\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Discover crypto outlook of GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano. Explore meme-driven gains, versatile dApps, and academic research. Navigate Ethereum price fluctuations.\n\nEthereum Price Impact: GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano's Crypto Clash\n\nThe explosive growth of the crypto market has led to the emergence of numerous blockchain projects, each offering unique features and innovations. In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, investors and enthusiasts are constantly seeking the next big thing. The intriguing dynamics between three prominent players in the industry: GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano stay debatable with \u0650Ethereum price, which serves as the linchpin connecting these entities, intriguing both crypto investors and news followers.\n\nGameStop Memes: A New Player in the Crypto Arena\n\nGameStop Memes, a curious name in the crypto space, has recently caught the attention of investors and traders. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes operates on a unique premise. It leverages the power of meme culture, tapping into social media-driven investments.\n\nGameStop Memes is essentially a community-driven cryptocurrency project that utilizes meme content to drive interest and investment. It encourages crypto enthusiasts to engage in \"presale\" events. These presales involve early investors acquiring tokens before they are officially listed on exchanges; potentially leading to significant gains as the Ethereum price fluctuates.\n\nTRON: The Versatile Blockchain Platform\n\nTRON is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications on its network. It aims to provide an alternative to traditional web services by offering a decentralized, user-centric environment. This versatile platform has made its mark, standing as a robust competitor in the crypto arena.\n\nTRON has been a significant player in the blockchain industry for some time now. It differentiates itself by offering a versatile platform that can host a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). Understanding its role in the crypto world becomes crucial when exploring the Ethereum price's impact on this platform. Its utilization, however, is less reliant on the Ethereum price and more on the adoption of its platform.\n\nCardano: The Academic Blockchain\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform designed to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has gained recognition for its academic approach to blockchain technology, focusing on rigorous research and development.\n\nInvesting in Cardano is a more calculated and research-driven endeavor. While Ethereum price fluctuations may influence overall market sentiment, Cardano's success is closely tied to the academic rigor and technological advancements it represents.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano each bring a unique perspective to the table.

BTC (-2.8 percent) dropped below the $36,000 mark. The next line of support for BTC is at $33,500; if BTC maintains that, we are still in a good uptrend. The market highlight remains the two-week-old token Celestia (TIA, +26.1 percent) as it pumped close to 50 percent at its peak yesterday and touched $6.3 before retracing back a bit. Celestia is a modular data availability network that had recently airdropped more than $120 million value at the time of airdrop for its active users.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market witnessed a healthy pullback after a continuous rally. The positive US inflation data triggered a correction across crypto assets with BTC and ETH slipping by almost 3% and 4% respectively. US stocks saw an upward trend after the positive inflation data became public signaling renewed interest in traditional assets. The crypto market may face some selling pressure in the coming weeks owing to macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cDespite lower-than-expected United States inflation data, indicating a 3.2% yearly increase and a positive US stock market, the crypto market witnessed a decline yesterday. BTC and ETH both experienced drops of over 3% in the last 24 hours. Currently, BTC is positioned at the 20 EMA 1Day and is trading at $35,450, while ETH is trading at $1,970, below the support level of $2,011. In a positive development, despite China maintaining its prohibitive stance towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there is growing crypto adoption. A Chinese company, Boyaa, has announced a substantial investment of $100 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "The crypto community is eagerly anticipating Ethereum Insider, Steven Nerayoff\u2019s big reveal scheduled for today. Details surrounding the nature of the revelation remain shrouded in mystery, however, the insider has promised to release several evidential documents and a possibly damning recording between him and the Ethereum Founder.\n\nCountdown To Nerayoff\u2019s Big Reveal\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor, Steven Nerayoff announced previously that he would be releasing evidence of fraud accusations he made against ETH Founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. He committed to disclosing this information today, November 16, and urged the crypto community to prepare for its release.\n\nThe former Ethereum Advisor also stated that he would be publishing recordings of him and Buterin having a conversation about the Ethereum Network. He highlighted that the recording was not connected to his accusations of fraud but it would show his involvement with the ETH founder.\n\n\u201cThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,\u201d Nerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post.\n\nHe added that \u201cthis recording won\u2019t necessarily affect anything other than the supposed genius, truthfulness, and selflessness of Vitalik & Lubin.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum insider revealed that he was exposing himself to certain risks by revealing alleged truths about Ethereum. He emphasized his confidence and disregard for the possible repercussions of his decision. Nerayoff also declared that he would go through with his determination to unveil proof of his accusations against Buterin and Lubin.\n\n\u201cHow does one refute the truth backed up with documentation? And I know the risks I\u2019m taking & don\u2019t care. Might be hard for many to understand but after what they put me through for years it\u2019s as if I died & came back to life. Fear simply isn\u2019t present once I survived that war,\u201d Nerayoff stated.\n\nETH price falls to $2,039 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Insider Challenges Founders\u2019 Ongoing Silence\n\nSteven Nerayoff has been consistently publishing fraud accusations against Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. However, the two Ethereum founders have stayed silent, refraining from denying or confirming the allegations.\n\nNerayoff has called out the founders\u2019 silence, asserting that their quiet disposition was because of the evidence he had against them. The Ethereum insider claims to hold several potentially damning receipts, which he has promised to make public soon.\n\n\u201cVitalik & Lubin are vicious if they have leverage. Lubin said to me in July 2018 about a network \u201cIt\u2019s a centralized piece of shit\u201d right after the Hinman speech! They stay silent because I\u2019ll drop more receipts,\u201d Nerayoff said.\n\nFeatured image from Newsway, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as spot Bitcoin ETFs are set to launch by January 2024. This has led to a significant increase in whale transactions across cryptocurrencies, including top altcoins Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and VC Spectra (SPCT), causing their prices to surge. Let\u2019s explore the full story of their bullish stories!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nSummary\n\nInstitutional and whale demand surge propels Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price by 170%, with a bullish prediction expecting a $2,202 value by December 20.\n\nA notable 3,800% increase in transaction volume boosts Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) price by 54%, leading to predictions of a $0.94 value by December 26.\n\nEmerging as a top DeFi coin, VC Spectra (SPCT) impresses with a carefully curated presale, selling over 400 million tokens and projecting a 21% surge to $0.080.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Bullish Momentum Fueled by Whale Accumulation\n\nOn November 11, IntoTheBlock reported a significant surge in institutional and whale demand, notably in Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum (ETH) witnessed a remarkable 170% increase in demand between October and November, grounds for a bullish Ethereum price prediction.\n\nLookonchain highlighted the activities of a whale at address \u201c0xee47,\u201d who strategically amassed an additional 3,200 ETH, equivalent to $6.7 million. This accumulation comes seven months after the whale\u2019s initial acquisition on July 5, 2022. Simultaneously, another notable whale at address \u201c0x78D0\u201d has been actively accumulating ETH since May 24. These movements have been insightful to investors pondering, \u201cShould I buy Ethereum?\u201d\n\nThese notable ETH whale transactions caused a price surge in Ethereum\u2019s price. Between October 31 and November 14, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price went from $1,811 to $2,058. Due to its growing whale transactions, Ethereum price prediction shows that ETH will maintain its bullish momentum, rising to $2,202 by December 20.\n\nPolygon Matic Price Soars Amidst Institutional and Whale Demand Surge\n\nJust like Ethereum (ETH), IntoTheBlock also revealed a substantial surge in institutional and whale demand for Polygon (MATIC), experiencing a remarkable 3,800% increase in transaction volume. Polygon MATIC News shows that 6,999,890 MATIC tokens, estimated to be worth $5,895,339, were sent from Binance to an unknown wallet on November 10.\n\nThe surge in Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) trading volume was mirrored in the Polygon MATIC price, which rose from $0.62 to $0.96 between October 31 and November 14. This marks a whopping 54% increase in Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) price.\n\nThe increase in Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) trading volume suggests a growing interest in MATIC and investor confidence. Market analysts predict this will potentially drive the Polygon MATIC price to $0.94 by December 26.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Emerges as Top DeFi Contender with Remarkable Presale Performance\n\nSince it started its presale in July 2023, VC Spectra (SPCT) has captured attention by distinguishing itself among the top DeFi coins. VC Spectra (SPCT) sets itself apart by meticulously selecting ventures with sustainable growth potential, offering users a diverse range of investment opportunities, including access to lucrative new ICOs.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) doesn\u2019t stop there; it empowers investors with comprehensive risk analysis tools, allowing them to discern market trends and strategically diversify their portfolios for optimal returns with minimal risks.\n\nDuring its presale, VC Spectra (SPCT) experienced an overwhelming demand, selling more than 400 million SPCT tokens. This intense demand catapulted the token price to an astounding 725% increase. Starting at $0.008 per token in Stage 1, the value surged to $0.066 per token in Stage 4, reflecting the VC Spectra\u2019s (SPCT) potential as one of the top cryptos to buy!\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about VC Spectra (SPCT)\u2019s future, projecting its token value to reach $0.080 by the conclusion of the presale. This marks a substantial 21% surge from its current value, a unique opportunity for new investors to make substantial returns from this crypto gem.\n\nTo learn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale, visit:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."

The main problem is that most of them operate without a regulatory license. As such, you need to ensure that not only are your trading funds safe, but that the provider offers competitive fees and support for your preferred payment method. If you\u2019re wondering how to buy Ethereum, we\u2019ve prepared some of the best platforms to consider in 2024.\n\n1. eToro \u2013 Trade Ethereum with a regulated broker that provides a free demo account and copy trading services\n\neToro is a regulated online broker with more than 17 million clients using its beginner-friendly platform. On top of stocks, ETFs, forex, and commodities, this top-rated provider gives you access to 16 digital currencies that you can buy. This does, of course, include Ethereum \u2013 alongside the likes of Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP), EOS, Cardano, Litecoin, and more.\n\neToro is also a popular choice among new crypto investors as the minimum trade amount is 10$. This allows you to buy Ethereum in a risk-averse manner, as there is no requirement to invest large amounts. Additionally, eToro is also home to a number of crypto-cross pairs. This means that you can trade Ethereum against other digital currencies.\n\nThis beginner friendly social trading platform allows you to select a seasoned crypto trader and then copy their buy and sell positions. It also boasts a CopyPortfolio feature professionally managed by eToro that gives you access to a diversified basket of digital currencies that are weighted, based on market capitalization. Both of the aforementioned automated trading tools can be utilized at no extra cost.\n\nPlus, if you\u2019re from the US, there is no deposit fee at all. The minimum deposit is $50 for those in the US, and $200 elsewhere. When it comes to safety, eToro is one of the most regulated crypto brokers in the online space. Not only is the platform registered with FINRA in the US, but it is also authorized and regulated by the FCA, ASIC, and CySEC.\n\nFinally, the eToro mobile app allows you to buy, sell, and trade Ethereum at the click of a button. This is free to download and compatible with both iOS and Android devices. If you want to trade on your mobile, eToro also offers one of the best trading apps we\u2019ve come across.\n\neToro fees\n\nFee Amount Commodities trading fee Spread, starting from 2 pips Forex trading fee Spread, 2.1 pips for GBP/USD Crypto trading fee Spread, 1% for Bitcoin Inactivity fee $10 a month after one year Withdrawal fee $5\n\nPros: Super user-friendly online broker and trading platform\n\nSuper user-friendly online broker and trading platform Trade thousands of assets with tight spreads\n\nTrade thousands of assets with tight spreads You can also trade stocks, indices, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and more\n\nYou can also trade stocks, indices, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and more Social trading and copy trading\n\nSocial trading and copy trading Regulated by the FCA, ASIC, and CySEC, and registered with FINRA in the US Cons: Not suitable for advanced traders that like to perform technical analysis\n\nYour capital is at risk. Other fees apply. For more information, visit etoro.com/trading/fees.\n\n2. Coinbase \u2013 Offers low fees for Ethereum trading as well as a native crypto wallet and network\n\nCoinbase is by far the largest and most recognized cryptocurrency broker globally \u2013 with more than 35 million clients under its belt. It provides a user-friendly platform for individuals and businesses to buy, sell, and store a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others.\n\nThe process of opening an account and trading Ethereum couldn\u2019t be simpler. The platform also provides educational resources to help users understand the basics of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf you want to fast-track the process, Coinbase allows you to buy Ethereum instantly with a debit card. This does, however, attract a rather hefty commission of 3.99%. This means that a $1,000 purchase would leave you with just over $960 worth of Ethereum.\n\nWith that said, the other option is to transfer funds into Coinbase from your bank. This is usually free, although you\u2019ll have to wait a few days for the funds to arrive. If you choose this option, you will pay an Ethereum trading commission of 1.49%. You will have to pay this commission again when you convert your Ethereum coins back to fiat money.\n\nAlthough Coinbase is arguably one of the most expensive Ethereum trading platforms in the space, it offers top-notch security. In terms of internal controls, this includes keeping 98% of customer funds in cold storage. The balance is kept in hot wallets to facilitate fast withdrawals. On the customer side, Coinbase offers two-factor authentication, address whitelisting, and more.\n\nWe should also mention that this popular broker also offers a day trading facility \u2013 Coinbase Pro. This comes with a lot more trading pairs, charts, analysis tools, and crucially \u2013 lower fees. When it comes to storage, you can keep your funds in your Coinbase web-wallet. For added security, you might consider withdrawing your Ethereum out to a private wallet.\n\nCoinbase fees\n\nFee Amount Crypto trading fee Commission, starting from 0.50% Inactivity fee Free Withdrawal fee 1.49% to a U.S. bank account\n\nPros: Coinbase Pro includes advanced order types\n\nCoinbase Pro includes advanced order types Easy to use mobile app\n\nEasy to use mobile app More than 35 million clients\n\nMore than 35 million clients Operational since 2012\n\nOperational since 2012 Monitors the order book for Bitcoin-GBP trades\n\nMonitors the order book for Bitcoin-GBP trades Supports Faster Payments for GBP transactions\n\nSupports Faster Payments for GBP transactions Holds an e-money license from the FCA Cons: Complicated and expensive fee structure\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\n3. Kraken- The most user-friendly app to buy Ethereum that supports staking for passive rewards\n\nWhen thinking of the best Ethereum trading platforms in 2024, Kraken is another top brokerage that comes to mind. The exchange is among the top five best trading platforms in terms of liquidity, thanks to its support for 200+ popular cryptocurrencies and over 10 million customers.\n\nEthereum is one of the most traded crypto assets on Kraken. Mobile-first traders can also trade ETH on the robust Kraken trading app.\n\nYou can also diversify your portfolio by keeping an expansive investment basket containing Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. And if you\u2019re looking to earn passive income, you can opt for the crypto staking option with options like Cardano, Cosmos, and other altcoins for up to 26% annual percentage yield (APY) with the exception of Ethereum.\n\nRegarding security, Kraken ranks among the best online brokers with its various safety features. The exchange stores a good percentage of customers\u2019 assets in offline cold storage. Similarly, there\u2019s a proof of reserves mechanism to encourage transparency and build trust. Buying ETH on Kraken is pretty straightforward. You can invest in the coin using the instant \u201cBuy Crypto\u201d option and execute the transaction using your payment card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe minimum amount of Ethereum you can invest in is $10, so the average investor will have no issues investing in ETH on Kraken. However, each payment option has its corresponding fee. For example, the Instant Buy feature charges spreads that are calculated when you open a trade. Credit and debit card purchases also attract spreads, and the amount depends on your purchase volume and selected provider.\n\nPros: Trading fees as low as 0%\n\nTrading fees as low as 0% Stringent security features\n\nStringent security features 200+ assets, including popular coins\n\n200+ assets, including popular coins Low minimum investment\n\nLow minimum investment High-liquidity exchange Cons: Instant buy fees can be up to 1.5%\n\nInstant buy fees can be up to 1.5% Staking is no longer available in the US\n\nYour money is at risk.\n\n4. Binance \u2013 A reputable crypto exchange with competitive fees and a wide range of features\n\nThis top-rated cryptocurrency exchange offers the perfect balance between low fees and supported markets. An NFT marketplace is also available for NFT trading.\n\nRegarding the latter, Binance offers hundreds of Ethereum-based pairs. This includes everything from ETH/USDT, ETH/BTC, ETH/XRP, and more. In fact, you can also trade Ethereum against smaller, ERC-20 tokens.\n\nIn terms of fees, Binance allows you to trade Ethereum at a small commission of just 0.1%. This is significantly cheaper than what you will get at Coinbase. You can get this commission fee down even further by holding a quantity of BNB. Large trading volumes will also get you reduced commissions.\n\nOn the flip side, if you are planning to deposit funds with a debit or credit card, Binance is a bit expensive. This will cost you 3.5% in the US and 2% in other regions like the UK. Similar to Coinbase, you can usually deposit funds for free and you should opt for a bank transfer. There is no support for e-wallets like PayPal.\n\nNevertheless, the Binance trading platform is particularly popular with day traders, as it comes packed with advanced features and tools. On top of real-time price quotes and chart reading capabilities, Binance is home to some of the largest trading volumes in the crypto space.\n\nIn terms of security, Binance isn\u2019t a regulated entity like eToro. We will explain how to buy Ethereum on eToro in our guide. However, Binance have numerous safeguards and controls in place that ensure your funds are kept safe. This includes wallet address whitelisting, Anti Money Laundering (AML), email notifications, and two-factor authentication. There is also a reserve pot that is funded by transaction fees. This is in place to cover users in the event of a hack.\n\nBinance fees\n\nFee Amount Crypto trading fee Commission, starting from 0.1% Inactivity fee Free Withdrawal fee 0.80 EUR (SEPA bank transfer)\n\nPros: Advanced charting platform with customizable indicators\n\nAdvanced charting platform with customizable indicators Hundreds of pairs supported\n\nHundreds of pairs supported 0.10% commission\n\n0.10% commission Supports fiat currency\n\nSupports fiat currency Extremely low fees with discount for using BNB\n\nExtremely low fees with discount for using BNB Proven security measures Cons: Customer service via ticket system only\n\nCustomer service via ticket system only Charges up to 3.5% on debit/credit card deposits\n\nYour money is at risk.\n\n5. Coinmama \u2013 Easily buy Ethereum with a debit/credit card in the US\n\nCoinmama is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that likes to keep things simple. Technically speaking, it\u2019s not actually a trading platform per-say, rather it allows you to buy cryptocurrencies at the click of a button with your debit/credit card.\n\nOn purchase, Coinmama will instantly transfer the coins to your Ethereum wallet address without the option to keep your ETH funds on the Coinmama website. This is worth bearing in mind, as you will need to have a basic understanding of how best Ethereum wallet works.\n\nNevertheless, before you can buy Ethereum, you do need to go through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process. This requires several documents such as your passport and a selfie of you holding your ID. Once done, it takes just minutes to buy Ethereum.\n\nPerhaps the biggest drawback to this user-friendly Ethereum trading platform is that it charges exorbitant fees. In fact, Coinmama is even more expensive than Coinbase. For example, you will be charged a debit/credit card fee of 5%. Don\u2019t forget you can pay as little as 0.5% on eToro and nothing if you are from the USA, this is one of the main reasons to buy Ethereum on eToro. Coinmama also charges a mark-up of 2% on the average market rate of Ethereum. You would need to see your investment increase by 2% just to break even. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Coinmama also charges a trading commission of 3.90% when you buy Ethereum, and 0.90% on all sell orders. Coinmama also has a more restricted selection of available cryptocurrencies: is supports just 9 assets.\n\nYou can reduce the aforementioned fees slightly by opting for a SEPA or SWIFT transfer. For example, bank transfers cost a flat rate of \u00a320 (if less than $1,000), which is much more affordable than the 5% debit/credit card charge.\n\nCoinmama fees\n\nFee Amount Crypto trading fee Commission, starting from 3.90% Inactivity fee Free Withdrawal fee Free\n\nPros: Buy Ethereum and other altcoins\n\nBuy Ethereum and other altcoins Purchases often take less than 10 minutes from start to finish\n\nPurchases often take less than 10 minutes from start to finish Supports debit/credit cards, SEPA, and SWIFT\n\nSupports debit/credit cards, SEPA, and SWIFT Launched way back in 2013\n\nLaunched way back in 2013 Very easy platform to use\n\nVery easy platform to use Coins are automcaically sent to your private wallet Cons: Limited number of assets\n\nLimited number of assets Debit/credit card deposits add an extra 5% fee to the trade\n\nYour money is at risk.\n\n6. Gemini \u2013 A secure Ethereum US trading platform\n\nGemini is often the go-to Ethereum trading platform for those that plan to invest large amounts. This is because the platform is heavily regulated in the US. This includes regulation in New York as a trust company and regularly audited by the New York Department of Financial Services. You can easily deposit funds with fiat currency and purchase an allocation of Ethereum-based tokens.\n\nYou can also trade Ethereum against the US dollar if you are looking for a short-term trading strategy. When it comes to fees, Gemini is on the expensive side, as you\u2019ll pay a commission of 0.5% per slide. This means that you\u2019ll be charged 0.5% when you enter and exit the market. However, Gemini has since launched its own payment card that allows you to spend your cryptocurrency holdings. This comes with several perks \u2013 such as the ability to earn 3% cash back on your purchases \u2013 with rewards paid in bitcoin.\n\nGemini fees\n\nFee Amount Crypto trading fee Commission, starting from 0.5% Inactivity fee Free Withdrawal fee Free\n\nPros: Popular with large-scale investors and seasoned traders\n\nPopular with large-scale investors and seasoned traders Institutional-grade security practices\n\nInstitutional-grade security practices Buy, sell, and trade 20+ digital currencies\n\nBuy, sell, and trade 20+ digital currencies Based in the US\n\nBased in the US USD deposits are FDIC insured\n\nUSD deposits are FDIC insured Easy to deposit and withdraw funds with fiat currency Cons: Not a great option for newbies\n\nNot a great option for newbies Charges a commission of 0.5% per slide\n\nYour money is at risk.\n\n7. Luno \u2013 A user-friendly mobile trading app with crypto interest of up to 4%\n\nLaunched in 2013, Luno is a popular cryptocurrency exchange that is now active in more than 40 countries. The platform aims to make the process of buying, selling, and trading blockchain assets seamless \u2013 especially for beginners.\n\nThere are several notable features that ensure Luno makes the cut as one of the best platforms in the space. Firstly, it takes just minutes to buy Ethereum with your debit card. Once you have uploaded a copy of your ID, you will benefit from trading commissions of just 0.1%.\n\nWith that said, if you\u2019re planning to deposit funds with a debit card, this will cost you 3.5%. As such, it\u2019s worth considering other deposit options \u2013 such as funding your account with another cryptocurrency. An additional stand-out feature offered by Luno is its crypto savings accounts.\n\nThis allows you to earn up to 4% in interest per year by locking your crypto holdings away for a set period of time. You will, however, need to exchange your Ethereum for Bitcoin to benefit from this. In terms of key Ethereum trading tools, Luno provides advanced charts via TradingView and you will have access to a wide range of flexible order types.\n\nLuno fees\n\nFee Amount Crypto trading fee Commission, starting from 0.1% Inactivity fee Free Withdrawal fee 0.30 EUR (SEPA bank transfer)\n\nPros: Advanced charts from TradingView\n\nAdvanced charts from TradingView Supports market, limit, and stop-loss orders\n\nSupports market, limit, and stop-loss orders Excellent mobile trading app\n\nExcellent mobile trading app It takes just minutes to buy Ethereum Cons: No one-minute price charts\n\nNo one-minute price charts Confusing fee schedule\n\nConfusing fee schedule Only 25 crypto pairs\n\nYour money is at risk.\n\nBest Ethereum Wallet\n\nChoosing the best Ethereum wallet can be a real challenge, especially for novice traders. With so many wallets on the market, not all options are reliable and legitimate. To avoid the risk of fraud, we recommend being vigilant when choosing the best Ethereum wallet.\n\nOur experts recommend that you consider the eToro wallet, which is a digitised and secure wallet. It allows you to store and transfer cryptocurrencies easily and simply. The eToro Money crypto wallet is eToro\u2019s secure, multi-crypto and easy-to-use digital wallet. Store and transfer crypto to your best Ethereum wallet easily and conveniently.\n\nYour capital is at risk. Other fees apply.

As Ethereum\u2019s popularity continues to grow, the case for the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term growth becomes stronger.\n\nEthereum has shown remarkable long-term investment performance, even outperforming Bitcoin over the past three years. According to the source, the current CoinMarketCap ranking is #2, with a live market cap of $266,393,597,382 USD. If you are wondering in your mind should I buy Ethereum or is it worth investing in this cryptocurrency, we recommend you to analyse its evolution in the last period.\n\nConsidering that it is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and by market capitalisation, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency with potential, especially its usefulness in the crypto space and the financial industry. However, there is no certainty that Ethereum will maintain its status as the leading blockchain for dApps in the long term.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum\n\nLately, Ethereum has been changing its consensus mode, giving anyone the opportunity to engage in staking, the process of locking ETH tokens to help secure the Ethereum network and earn rewards. Users wondering how to stake Ethereum and earn rewards should note that there are 3 staking options: solo staking, staking as a service or pooled staking.\n\nThose with small amounts of ETH cryptocurrencies can engage in stacking as a service or pooled staking. Solo staking offer the potential for significant rewards, but come with higher storage requirements and a financial commitment associated with purchasing and managing the hardware required to run a node. This computing device will act as a validator.\n\nHow to Choose an Ethereum Trading Platform in February 2024\n\nBy heading over to CoinMarketCap (CMC), you will see that there are hundreds of platforms and exchanges that allow you to trade Ethereum from the comfort of your home.\n\nThis can make it challenging to find a provider that meets your trading needs. For example, your chosen platform needs to support your preferred Ethereum market at competitive fees and commissions. You also need to consider payments, customer support, and safety.\n\nTo make this process easier for you, below we list the many metrics that need to be considered in your search for the best Ethereum trading platforms of 2024.\n\nRegulations\n\nWe mentioned just a moment ago that there are hundreds of apps to buy Ethereum in 2024. The key problem here is that most crypto-based exchanges are unregulated.\n\nThese platforms are not breaking the law per-say, as they have no relationship with fiat currency.\n\nUnfortunately for you, choosing a trading platform that is unregulated means that your funds are at risk.\n\nThis is why the best exchanges are heavily regulated by reputable financial bodies.\n\nAlthough such providers are few and far between, eToro, is regulated on three fronts and this aspect makes it a good option to buy Ethereum on eToro. This includes a fully-fledged license with the FCA, CySEC, and ASIC. If you\u2019re based in the US and looking to trade ETH safely, eToro is also registered with FINRA.\n\nEthereum trading markets\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, it makes sense that there are plenty of ways to trade Ethereum. With that said, we can generally break these marketplaces down into two key asset classes \u2013 crypto-to-fiat pairs and crypto-cross pairs.\n\nCrypto-to-fiat Ethereum pairs\n\nWhen trading crypto-to-fiat pairs, you are speculating on the exchange rate between a cryptocurrency like Ethereum and a fiat currency like the US dollar. In fact, ETH/USD is the most traded Ethereum pair in the space.\n\nIn simple terms, you are looking to predict whether Ethereum will increase or decrease in value against the dollar. Some Ethereum trading platforms \u2013 such as eToro, also support other fiat currencies that can be traded against Ethereum. This includes the British pound, Euro, and Japanese yen.\n\nCrypto-cross Ethereum pairs\n\nThe vast majority of crypto trading sites do not offer fiat-to-crypto pairs, as they do not have the legal remit to do so. To counter this, unregulated exchanges will allow you to trade ETH/USDT.\n\nFor those unaware, USDT is a cryptocurrency known as Tether and it is pegged to 1 USD. As such, you are effectively trading the price of Ethereum against USD, although, this is still classed as a crypto-cross pair as you are not touching real-world dollars.\n\nAdditionally, the best Ethereum trading apps offer an abundance of other crypto-cross pairs that contain Ethereum. For example, you can often trade Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC), Litecoin (ETH/LTC), and Ripple (ETH/XRP).\n\nFees\n\nIf you are sure that your chosen Ethereum trading platform is regulated and offers your preferred markets, you then need to explore what fees you will be expected to pay. A lot of platforms in this space are known to charge excessively to trade Ethereum \u2013 especially if you are planning to deposit funds with a debit or credit card. With this in mind, here are the main fees you need to be aware of when looking for the best exchange for your needs.\n\nDeposit fees\n\nWe should start with deposit fees, as you will need to fund your account before you can start trading Ethereum online. As we covered in our reviews of the best Ethereum exchanges, using a debit/credit card to deposit funds can be costly.\n\nFor example, Coinbase charges 3.99% to fund your account with a debit card , while Binance charges 3.5% to US residents.\n\n, while Binance charges 3.5% to US residents. Luno is also expensive at 3.5%.\n\nCoinmama is by far the most costly, as it charges a debit/credit card fee of 5%.\n\nThe good news is that regulated broker eToro allows you to deposit funds with a fee of just 0.5%. If you\u2019re based in the US, this fee is completely waived.\n\nTrading commission\n\nIn a similar nature to forex trading platforms and stock trading platforms, you will need to pay a commission when you trade Ethereum online. After all, trading platforms, brokers, and exchanges are in the business of making money. Once again, commissions can vary wildly depending on which platform you sign up with.\n\nAt the higher end, Coinmama charges 3.90% on buy orders and 0.9% on sell orders\n\nCoinbase is also expensive in this department, charging 1.49% per slide\n\nBinance and Luno are very competitive at a commission of just 0.10%\n\nSpreads and mark-ups\n\nThe spread is often overlooked by newbies as they simply don\u2019t understand what it is. This isn\u2019t to the fault of inexperienced traders per-say, as platforms rarely let you know that you are paying a spread. Put simply, it\u2019s the difference between the buy and sell price of the Ethereum pair you are trading. In percentage terms, if the spread was 2.5%, this means that you are entering the trade at 2.5% in the red.\n\nSpread at eToro will cost you around 0.75% when trading Ethereum against the US dollar. This can, however, vary throughout the day depending on wider market conditions. In a similar nature to the spread, you also need to explore whether your chosen Ethereum exchange charges a mark-up. This means that you are paying a price above the market average. As we covered earlier, Coinmama adds a mark-up of 2%, which is very expensive.\n\nYour capital is at risk. Other fees apply. For more information, visit etoro.com/trading/fees.\n\nTrading tools & features\n\nDepending on your financial goals \u2013 for example, if you\u2019re a long-term investor or a short-term day trader \u2013 you may want to have access to a number of tools when trading Ethereum online. Here are some of the tools and features offered by the best Ethereum trading platforms we came across:\n\nAutomated Ethereum trading and investing\n\nA lot of newbies want to enter the Ethereum trading scene because of its long-term potential. However, many fail to take the plunge as they simply don\u2019t know how to trade. If this sounds like you, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that there are several solutions in the market that you might want to consider. For example, eToro offers a fully-diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. This consists of several leading cryptocurrencies \u2013 including Ethereum.\n\nThese portfolios are managed by the eToro, meaning that it will add, remove, and rebalance the basket of assets on your behalf. An additional tool offered by eToro that will allow you to automate your crypto investment endeavors is that of the Copy Trading platform feature. This is similar to the previously mentioned CopyPortfolio tool, as you will be investing passively.\n\nHowever, the main difference is that you will be copying an eToro trader like for like. In other words, every buy or sell position that your chosen trader executes will be mirrored in your own eToro account \u2013 in an amount proportional to what you invest.\n\nLeverage\n\nIf you are an experienced trader but you don\u2019t have access to a large amount of capital, you\u2019ll want to choose a platform that offers leverage. This has the added benefit of being able to enter positions at a value far greater than what you have in your account.\n\nFor example, if your chosen provider offers leverage of up to 1:20 and you stake $100 \u2013 your Ethereum trade is worth $2,000.\n\nTake note, if using a regulated platform, your access to leverage will be capped depending on where you are based.\n\nFor example, Europeans are capped to leverage of 1:2 on crypto CFDs.\n\nThe workaround to this is to use an unregulated exchange. However, we would strongly advise against this, as you cannot be sure that your money is safe.\n\nTechnical tools\n\nThe best Ethereum brokers will give you access to an abundance of research tools. If you\u2019re a day trader or swing trader, then you\u2019ll want to choose a provider that offers chart analysis tools \u2013 such as technical indicators and screeners. Some of the platforms discussed on this page are integrated with TradingView which comes packed with technical research tools.\n\nIf you see yourself as more of a long-term player, then you will want access to fundamental research tools such as real-time news and market insights. This will allow you to make informed investment decisions \u2013 especially regarding the best time to enter or exit an Ethereum position.\n\nOrders\n\nIn order to trade Ethereum online, you will need to place a series of orders. Basic platforms offer buy and sell orders only, which is what you need to enter and exit a trade. However, the best platforms give you access to a full suite of orders \u2013 subsequently allowing you to trade in a more flexible and risk-averse manner. This might include:\n\nStop-Loss Orders\n\nGuaranteed Stop-Loss Orders\n\nLimit Orders\n\nMarket Orders\n\nTrailing Stop-Loss Orders\n\nYou can usually check what order types are supported before signing up to the Ethereum exchange in question.\n\nLiquidity\n\nIn a time not so long ago, liquidity used to be a major problem in the crypto trading scene. After all, it wasn\u2019t until recently that digital currencies like Ethereum became a multi-billion-dollar asset class. With that said, not all trading platforms in the space have access to sufficient liquidity levels.\n\nThis can be fatal, as if you are using a platform that struggles for liquidity, might find it difficult to exit your Ethereum position at your desired price-point.\n\nPlus, low liquidity also results in wider spreads \u2013 meaning you are indirectly paying more to trade.\n\nIf liquidity is one of your main concerns \u2013 which it should be, a great option is to buy Ethereum on eToro. This is because the provider is home to over 17 million active traders, so there\u2019s heavy activity around the clock. An additional option is Binance, which often facilitates more than $10 billion in trading volume \u2013 each and every day.\n\nUser experience\n\nMost people who want to know how to buy Ethereum are new to cryptocurrencies in general. In fact, many have never traded at all \u2013 so the whole experience can be intimidating. This is why the best Ethereum brokers offer a first-class and seamless user experience. For example, the likes of eToro and Coinbase allow you to open an account and deposit funds in a matter of minutes. The aforementioned platforms guide you through the end-to-end process step-by-step, so you can still access the Ethereum marketplace as a newbie.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the process of setting up an account that needs to be user-friendly. The most important thing is that you can buy, sell and trade Ethereum without having to wade through complicated crypto jargon.\n\nFor example, while experienced traders will want to use advanced orders, leverage and other flexible tools, some of you may simply want to buy a quantity of Ethereum. If this is the case, you\u2019ll want to make the process as straightforward as possible. At eToro all you need to do is search for Ethereum, enter the amount you want to buy in US dollars, then confirm the order and buy Ethereum on eToro.\n\nMobile app\n\nThe latest trend in the global investment scene is buying and selling financial assets via a mobile app. This has since entered the Ethereum trading market \u2013 with all of the platforms discussed today offering a fully-fledged mobile app. By downloading an Ethereum trading app, you should be able to perform the following functionalities:\n\nBuy, sell, and trade Ethereum at the click of a button\n\nCheck the value of your Ethereum trade in real-time (against your preferred fiat currency)\n\nDeposit and withdraw funds\n\nExchange Ethereum to and from another digital currency\n\nPerform research and chart analysis\n\nSome Ethereum trading platform apps go one step further by doubling up as a cryptocurrency wallet. This means that you can trade ETH as well as store the coins safely.\n\nPayment methods\n\nWe have discussed payment methods throughout this guide on the best Ethereuam trading platforms. This is important, as in order to buy or trade Ethereum, you will need to add some funds to your trading account. Although most platforms allow you to deposit funds with a cryptocurrency, most of us want the convenience of using a debit/credit card. As such, if you want to deposit using your Visa or MasterCard, make sure the platform supports it and check what fees are applicable.\n\nCustomer service\n\nMost online Ethereum buying platforms only offer support via email or an online ticket system. This often means that you will have to wait several days before receiving a response. This can leave you feeling frustrated, especially if you are having problems with a withdrawal request.\n\nOn the other hand, the best platforms offer a 24/7 live chat feature. This means that no matter where you are or what time of day it is, you can get near-instant assistance with your query. Rarely do online crypto exchanges offer telephone support, so live chat is by far the best option.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum on eToro Wondering how to buy Ethereum on eToro, but not sure where to start? If so, follow the guidelines below to start trading Ethereum on this regulated platform. Step 1: Open an account and upload ID Unlike the majority of platforms on the market \u2013 eToro is highly regulated and therefore requires you to open an account. The good news is that unlike old school brokerage firms, the account opening and verification process at eToro usually takes less than 10 minutes. All you need to do is visit the eToro website, click on \u2018Join Now\u2019, and fill out the application form. This will require details like your name, nationality, address, date of birth, and email address. You will then be asked to upload a copy of your passport or driver\u2019s license. Step 2: Deposit funds Once you have registered, you can then make a deposit. As noted earlier, eToro requires a minimum deposit of $50 if you\u2019re US-based, and $200 elsewhere. Step 3: Search for an Ethereum trading market Once you have funded your eToro account, you then need to search for the Ethereum market you are interested in. eToro supports heaps of crypto-to-fiat and crypto-cross pairs, so you are bound to find a market that interests you. In our example, we are looking to trade the most liquid Ethereum market, ETH/USD. Once you have chosen a market, click on the \u2018Trade\u2019 button. Step 4: Place an Ethereum Trade You will now need to place a buy or sell order \u2013 depending on whether you think the Ethereum pair will rise or fall. By default, this is set as a buy order on eToro, so you\u2019ll need to change this to a sell order if you want to go short. Then, you simply need to enter your stake \u2013 ensuring you meet a $25 minimum. If you\u2019re looking to enter and exit the trade at a specific price, you might also consider setting up a limit, stop-loss, and take-profit order. Finally, to complete your Ethereum trade on eToro, click on the \u2018Open Trade\u2019 button. Create Account Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile most cryptocurrency traders will focus on Bitcoin, more and more investors are turning to its nearest rival \u2013 Ethereum. If you do want to trade or buy Ethereum from the comfort of your home \u2013 the most important thing is that you choose a suitable trading platform for your needs. As we have discussed tin this article, you should focus on metrics like fees, supported markets, regulation, payments, and trading tools.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to start buying and selling ETH right now, we would argue that the best Ethereum trading platform for this purpose is eToro. You can trade this innovative digital currency without paying any commission and the minimum stake is just $25. Most importantly, eToro is regulated by three financial bodies and registered with FINRA in the US.\n\nYour capital is at risk. Other fees apply.
