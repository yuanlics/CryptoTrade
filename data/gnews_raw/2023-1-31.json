Only 16 partial withdrawal requests can be put into a slot (which happens every 12 seconds), and there is a single queue for both full and partial withdrawals on the blockchain. But the likelihood of all validators choosing to exit the blockchain is slim, given that staking will enable a new chapter for Ethereum and those that trade on top of it."

        "title": "\"Mergers in Winter\": Ethereum as eco-friendly blockchain - Lexology",
        "content": "2022 was a difficult year for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, with markets generally performing poorly, the collapse of terra luna, job cuts at almost all major exchanges, the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and lending platform Celsius Network, and the stupendous collapse of FTX. On the positive side, the major blockchain Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-state consensus mechanism, officially reducing the energy consumption of the blockchain by ~99.95 %.\n\nWhat was the Merge?\n\nTechnically, the Merge was the joining of the original layer of Ethereum with a new layer, called the Beacon Chain. This merger introduced the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to the blockchain, depreciating the initial proof-of-work consensus mechanism.\n\n\u00a9 Stiftung Ethereum; https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/\n\nWhat is proof-of-stake?\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database and requires a consensus mechanism to determine entries into it. Proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) are two mechanisms used in various blockchains. Until the Merge, PoW was used by the most important blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum. PoW requires participants (\"miners\") to solve an arithmetic riddle by performing billions of arithmetic operations. These operations require an enormous and increasing amount of computing power. Bitcoin, for instance, is estimated to use 0.16 % of global energy production and emits 0.10 % of the world's carbon emissions as of Q3 2022. Despite improvements, the energy consumption is increasing.\n\nPoS, in turn, is a mechanism based on the idea that those members on the blockchain who own the most tokens have an interest in keeping the network maintained. The decisive factor is therefore the stake of a user, i.e. the proportion of the total amount of tokens they own. The larger the stake, the more likely it is that this user will be selected to mine the next block. Broadly speaking, compared to proof-of-work, the proof-of-stake mechanism is more like a joint-stock corporation. Whoever owns a larger share in the company normally receives more voting rights entitling them to make decisions. PoS does not use energy to secure the network.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, transitioning to PoS meant that the blockchain's energy consumption was reduced to ~0-0026 TWh/year. Estimates show that YouTube, for instance, used over 175 times more energy streaming the \"Gangam Style\" video in 2019 compared to what Ethereum uses per year. The following chart from the Ethereum website shows the estimated annual energy consumption in TWh/year for various industries (retrieved in June 2022; Ethereum is on the right end of the chart titled \"ETH PoS\"):\n\n\u00a9 Stiftung Ethereum; https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/\n\nHow does PoS work?\n\nParticipants (node operators) must deposit 32 Ether (ETH) as collateral (via a smart contract \u2013 this is called \"staking\") to become network validators and receive rewards. One node is then chosen randomly as the recipient of the rewards. Via a staking pool, holders of Ether may pool their Ether holdings to participate in the PoS consensus process; the reward is then split between the pool participants. Many cryptocurrency exchanges (such as our client Bitpanda) offer staking solutions.\n\n\u2026and what happened then?\n\nThe Merge was a global event. It was successfully completed on 15 September 2022. Besides the effects on energy consumption, transactions are also expected to get faster, because PoS requires significantly fewer validations to be performed on the blockchain at the same time. This should also reduce transaction fees. It remains to be seen whether this thesis will uphold.\n\nDespite the technical success of the Merge, the blockchain's cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), like almost all other cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, is still under pressure. At the time of writing (10 November 2022) it was trading at around EUR 1,000 per ETH, down from around EUR 3,300 at the beginning of the year. It remains to be seen if and when this crypto winter will melt into a crypto spring, and whether the Merge will be a commercial success for the network and its users."

        "title": "Ethereum's Shanghai fork is coming, but it doesn't mean investors should dump ETH - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s next big upgrade, Shanghai, is on the horizon for March. The Shanghai hard fork will implement further improvement proposals for the Ethereum network as well as enable Ether (ETH) stakers and validators to withdraw their assets from the Beacon Chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, staked ETH represents approximately 14% of the total supply, or 16 million coins. It equates to over $25 billion at ETH\u2019s current price, a substantial sum that will gradually become liquid following the fork.\n\nSome ETH stakers have waited over three years to withdraw their rewards. Does that mean most of them will line up to withdraw and sell their ETH as quickly as possible? This scenario is improbable. There are numerous reasons why investors shouldn\u2019t be concerned about the impending update, and even more why most Ethereum stakeholders will increase their investment into staking following Shanghai.\n\nEthereum will remain the leading PoS network\n\nAlthough ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum is the leading proof-of-stake (PoS) network. At the time of writing, it accounts for approximately 65% of the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, sitting at around $48.7 billion.\n\nTotal value locked on all blockchains. Source: DeFi Llama\n\nDespite the current market, the amount of ETH deposited over time has continued to increase at a steady, stable rate, reaching over 500,000 validators in January 2023.\n\nStaking yield remains strong\n\nThe staking yield remains stable and currently sits at about 5.45% annual percentage rate (APR). Therefore, new entrants should familiarize themselves with the overall yield compensation structure consisting of staking rewards, tips and maximal extractable value (MEV).\n\nWith MEV-Boost, stakers can increase their rewards 2x\u20133.5x over vanilla blocks. However, when demand for ETH is on the rise, it is tips and MEV that ultimately improve ETH staking yields. Since moving to proof-of-stake, MEV relayers have relayed approximately 85,000 ETH and facilitated an increase of 32,500 ETH in additional rewards.\n\nLiquidity attracts stakers\n\nAs with any market, liquidity is king. Most investors were originally reluctant to stake ETH when it became available because doing so required locking up their funds for an undetermined period of time. Staking ETH required a minimum of 32 ETH, meaning that when Eth2 launched in December 2020, the price of entry was around $19,000. At its peak in November 2021, the price was nearly $150,000.\n\nRelated: Post-Merge ETH has become obsolete\n\nThat cost to stake gave validators pause, and many held off on securing the network. The Shanghai update, however, will remove this uncertainty, and tokenholders will be allowed to withdraw their staked assets. The obvious reaction is to assume that people will simply withdraw their funds and \u201ccash out,\u201d but we are likely going to see the exact opposite. Because such a large percentage of investors were initially reluctant to stake ETH \u2014 remember, only 14% of the supply is currently staked \u2014 the percentage of ETH staked is likely going to rise with the risk of withdrawal uncertainty gone.\n\nAdditionally, many ETH stakers bought the token during the bull run when prices hit a top of $4,500. But with the current price hovering around $1,600, it is unlikely that current stakers will sell at a loss. With MEV-boosted rewards sitting close to 7% and a positive outlook on a market price increase due to deflationary tokenomics, we expect to see a significant inflow into ETH staking.\n\nThe rise of liquid staking\n\nStakers can stake ETH directly with Ethereum, which requires a hefty sum of 32 ETH, or via liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is a concept that democratizes Ethereum staking for investors who can stake as little as 0.01 ETH. Staking small amounts of Ether is possible when investors exchange their ETH for derivative tokens, which are backed one-to-one and represent the amount of Ether staked in the pool.\n\nThe capital efficiency of liquid staking is one of its main advantages for investors. Sometimes referred to as liquid staking derivatives (LSD), it gives you the freedom to enter and exit the market at will. Because it\u2019s a derivative, it gives investors access to additional markets, and the LSD industry is just beginning to get off the ground.\n\nImprovement proposals and their impact\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai upgrade (EIP-4895) will focus on enabling withdrawals on the execution layer \u2014 Shanghai \u2014 and the consensus layer, referred to as the Capella upgrade. The Capella upgrade is especially beneficial for ETH stakers interested in understanding how withdrawals will work, as interactions are necessary to complete a full withdrawal on the consensus layer.\n\nRelated: Tax on income you never earned? It\u2019s possible after Ethereum\u2019s Merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap has several updates coming after Shanghai \u2014 sometimes referred to as the \u201cSurge,\u201d \u201cVerge,\u201d \u201cPurge\u201d and \u201cSplurge\u201d \u2014 demonstrating the community\u2019s dedication and long-term vision, which is essential for the protocol\u2019s future evolution. In the immediate future, EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) can scale Ethereum with new transaction roll-ups reducing gas fees, and EIP-3540 will aim to reduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine\u2019s resource requirements.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum saw a 178% increase in developer activity for programming libraries, reaching 1.5 million downloads. Despite the market being down, developers have ramped up real-world solutions and continue to build smart contracts on Ethereum at a blistering pace, hitting 4.6 million deployments for Q4 2022.\n\nEthereum mainnet smart contracts deployed per quarter. Source: Dune\n\nThe success of switching Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake should not be understated as an incredible achievement. Now that this move has been a resounding success, upgrades will be released faster, thanks to a community that is unmatched in terms of creativity, values and long-term vision. The foundation of cryptocurrency and proof-of-stake has been built on Ethereum, and it has a highly promising future.\n\nInvestors and stakers would be wise to keep their ETH staked, allowing it to continue to secure and decentralize the network. And generating some additional passive income from staking rewards doesn\u2019t hurt the decision to remain, either.\n\nKonstantin Boyko-Romanovsky is the CEO of Allnodes.

        "content": "The Ethereum Shanghai hard fork is less than two months away, and liquid staking derivatives (LSD) are gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFollowing Shanghai, users can withdraw ether locked up on the Beacon chain \u2014 opening up an exit for long-time Ethereum stakers.\n\nBlockworks Research analysts note in a report that this upgrade is likely to encourage more ETH holders to lock up their assets over the long term, increasing pressure on stake rate \u2014 but it is possible that there could also be a dip in staking demands as withdrawals become available.\n\nAlluvial co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Mike Taormina told Blockworks that the rise in popularity of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum should come as no surprise, as it\u2019s about more than the debut of withdrawals.\n\n\u201cLiquid staking also solves a real problem: When you lock tokens to participate in the security of the network, those tokens are illiquid,\u201d he said.\n\nNot so, with ether receipt tokens.\n\nLiquid staking in proof-of-stake ecosystems\n\nThe ordinary staking process involves locking up cryptocurrency in a proof-of-stake network to support blockchain operations and enable transactions, while simultaneously allowing users to accrue staking rewards.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, an individual user must deposit 32 ETH ($50,900) to the blockchain and activate the validator software to participate in staking.\n\nAs ETH holders often do not have enough funds or technical expertise to run their own validator node \u2014 now exceeding 510,000 worldwide \u2014 liquid staking protocols, including Lido, Rocket Pool and Frax, remove the barrier to entry by allowing ether holders to participate in staking without having to lock in any tokens.\n\nThis is often referred to as pooled staking, and users who participate are given ERC-20-compliant liquidity tokens that represent their staked ether, which they can hold in their wallets and use in other DeFi applications. But using decentralized exchanges, they can also sell back into normal unstaked ether at any time.\n\nOf course, liquid staking is not only limited to the Ethereum blockchain. The Solana network has been actively looking at ways to grow its total value locked (TVL) \u2014 particularly following events related to FTX, which hit Solana hard \u2014 and liquid staking derivatives may address some of these challenges.\n\nMarinade Finance, a non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on the Solana blockchain, is hoping to increase DeFi activity on its network by launching a program that will distribute its governance token MNDE to individuals and protocols in hopes of growing mSOL TVL.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much locked SOL that\u2019s staking. It\u2019s helping decentralization and validation, but it\u2019s not helping liquidity, so what we want to see is some of that stake turn into liquidity \u2014 and help DeFi protocols \u2014 and liquid staking tokens is really the mechanism for that,\u201d Brandon Tucker, a growth lead at the DAO, told Blockworks.\n\nSetting a new liquid staking standard\n\nFollowing the Shanghai upgrade, Taormina believes that liquid staking tokens may become even more popular \u2014 driving increased confidence in the Ethereum blockchain and welcoming a new cohort of mainstream adopters.\n\nEthereum has a much lower percentage of its token staked \u2014 less than 14% per Blockworks Research \u2014 compared to other blockchains, Taormina said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something holding Ethereum holders back from participating in staking, this is why the upgrade is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Shanghai upgrade will finally enable withdrawals and remove uncertainty\u2026we think that more people will end up participating [in staking].\u201d\n\nIn anticipation of a growth in staking participants, Taormina and his team at Alluvial are partnering with a handful of Web3 teams to design a new liquid staking standard.\n\nThis new standard, dubbed \u2018Liquid Collective,\u2019 will be an enterprise-grade liquid standard built to attract enterprise-grade users to Web3.\n\n\u201cThis is important because it helps onboard a cohort of users that are on the sidelines that would be interested in staking but need experience to meet some minimum thresholds that aren\u2019t currently met today,\u201d Taormina said.\n\nIf you want to read more about the current state of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum and their yield market share, you can subscribe to Blockworks Research and read their latest report at no charge for the next 24 hours.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Whales Are Buying These 3 Cryptocurrencies Hand Over Fist - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Individuals who have a lot of money invested in Ethereum don't always limit themselves to just one cryptocurrency. They often spread their wealth around.\n\nThat's exactly what has been happening recently, according to crypto tracking website WhaleStats. Ethereum whales are especially buying these three cryptocurrencies hand over fist.\n\n1. USD Coin\n\nUSD Coin (USDC -0.00%) ranks as the favorite cryptocurrency for the top 100 Ethereum whales these days. And it's not even a close contest based on the average volume amount.\n\nOf course, USD Coin hasn't delivered an appreciable gain for these investors. That's to be expected for a stablecoin. USD Coin is pegged on a 1-for-1 basis to the U.S. dollar. Its price typically doesn't fluctuate very much.\n\nHowever, USD Coin's market cap can change somewhat based on its adoption. Over the last year, its market cap has fallen a little. This small decline is largely due to the broader market factors that caused interest in cryptocurrencies to decrease.\n\nBut Ethereum whales and many other cryptocurrency traders continue to view USD Coin as a safe haven. The adoption of the stablecoin has been good news for Coinbase Global, which helped create USD Coin with fintech company Circle.\n\n2. Tether\n\nEthereum whales are also buying the world's most widely traded stablecoin -- Tether (USDT 0.00%). With a market cap of nearly $67.8 billion, Tether trails behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum among the biggest cryptocurrencies.\n\nLike USD Coin, Tether's price doesn't move very much. This stability is one of the main attractions for investors.\n\nIn addition, owners of the stablecoin can stake their tokens and earn interest. For example, crypto trading platform YouHodler currently pays an annualized interest rate of 8.32% for staking Tether.\n\nHowever, Tether isn't quite as popular as it once was. Its market cap topped $83 billion in the early part of May 2022. Today, the stablecoin's market cap is below $68 billion.\n\n3. Chiliz\n\nChiliz (CHZ -0.59%) might be the most surprising cryptocurrency that Ethereum whales are buying hand over fist. The digital token trails only USD Coin and Tether based on average trading volume among the top 100 Ethereum whales. However, Chiliz's market cap of around $906 million puts it only in 53rd place among all cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nLike several other cryptocurrencies, Chiliz is off to a great start in 2023. Its price has skyrocketed close to 40% year to date.\n\nWhy do Ethereum whales like Chiliz so much? It's probably because Chiliz is the exclusive cryptocurrency used on the Socios.com sports platform. Sports fans can engage with many of their favorite sports teams across the world (including the Boston Celtics, FC Barcelona, and Juventus).\n\nFans on Socios.com can use Chiliz to buy tokens that allow them to have a stake in their favorite team. They can even influence things such as what team captains wear on their armbands.\n\nAre these cryptocurrencies good picks for non-whales?\n\nJust because Ethereum whales are buying these three cryptocurrencies the most doesn't mean they're automatically good picks for investors who aren't whales. Stablecoins such as USD Coin and Tether aren't as risky as most cryptocurrencies. However, they don't offer as much upside potential, either. Chiliz might be more attractive to some sports fans, but not as much to other individuals."

        "content": "A testnet that will demonstrate Ethereum staking withdrawals is set to go live on Wednesday, according to statements from developers on Jan. 30.\n\nEthereum Foundation members Parithosh Jayanthi and Barnabas Busa said the Zhejiang testnet will go live on Feb. 1 at 15:00 UTC. The Shanghai and Capella upgrade will be triggered on the testnet six days later (at epoch 1350 on the blockchain).\n\nOnce the process is complete, validators can try out staking withdrawals in a practice environment without real funds. Validators can convert between credentials, test partial and full withdrawals, and fully exit their validator node.\n\nEthereum currently supports most other staking-related features. Users can now stake 32 ETH ($55,200) to operate a validator node. That feature has been available since developers launched Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain in December 2020. Users have also been able to earn staking rewards since September 2022\u2019s Merge upgrade.\n\nDespite those capabilities, Ethereum does not allow validators to withdraw staked ETH. This limitation was introduced to ensure the strength of the staking network.\n\nThe absence of staking withdrawals is one reason liquid staking services, such as those offered by Lido and Coinbase, have become prominent. While users of these platforms may be prevented from withdrawing their staked ETH, they also issue a corresponding \u201cliquid\u201d token that can be invested freely elsewhere. Some liquid tokens have seen price movement due to the upcoming staking withdrawal upgrade.\n\nThe Zhejiang testnet is the next step toward introducing proper staking withdrawals on Ethereum. Recent developer calls suggest that the feature will be introduced on the mainnet in March. However, there is still no definite date for the upgrade.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMore individual NFTs were sold on Polygon than Ethereum via leading overall marketplace OpenSea for the second consecutive month, according to public blockchain data curated via a Dune dashboard.\n\nIn January, OpenSea handled over 1.5 million NFTs sales on Ethereum sidechain Polygon, while Ethereum\u2019s own mainnet tallied a little over 1.1 million sales via the same marketplace. That continues the trend from December, when 1.3 million NFTs were sold on Polygon through OpenSea compared to just under 1 million Ethereum NFTs.\n\nEthereum has long been considered the premier blockchain for NFTs, and it hosts most of the high-value projects\u2014despite its sometimes-high gas fees. But as Polygon continues to forge large brand deals with big names like Meta, Starbucks, and Reddit, and as additional game projects tap the scaling network, more and more assets are being traded on the sidechain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the Ethereum merge\u2014which was finalized back in September\u2014reduced the mainnet\u2019s energy consumption by 99.998%, it didn\u2019t resolve the problem of the network\u2019s gas fees, which can sometimes exceed the base price of the asset itself. A gas fee is a cost that the Ethereum network charges users to complete a transaction.\n\nBy contrast, Polygon and layer-1 Ethereum rivals like Solana and Avalanche offer exponentially lower fees for user transactions, and have in turn become increasingly known for hosting more affordable NFT collections.\n\nAccording to OpenSea, the top Polygon NFT collection in January overall was the controversial Donald Trump digital trading cards, which saw nearly 5,500 sales across all Polygon marketplaces, tallying 1,743 ETH (nearly $2.8 million) in trading volume.\n\nBut when it comes to Polygon collections with the highest number of sales across all marketplaces beyond just OpenSea, Planet IX notched roughly 5 million sales over the last 30 days, while Sunflower Land tallied 1 million sales, Mocaverse saw 42,000 sales, and Lympo Athletes accumulated about 37,000 sales in the past month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that most of these sales are for low-cost assets to be used in metaverse worlds or Web3 games. In some cases, such as with Sunflower Land and Planet IX, NFT assets are selling for pennies\u2019 worth of ETH, significantly bringing down the average sale price for Polygon-based NFTs over that span.\n\nWhile Polygon surpassed Ethereum in the total number of sales, Ethereum is still seeing substantially more value traded overall. On OpenSea, Ethereum saw roughly $446 million in total volume in January traded while Polygon NFT sales comprised just $15.4 million worth. With about 1.5 million NFT sales on Polygon, that puts the average sale price around $10.\n\nNotably, this isn't the first time that the total number of monthly Polygon NFT sales has topped Ethereum. Dune shows a similar spike in late 2021 and early 2022, but then the number of Polygon sales fell sharply until the recent rebound.\n\nThe priciest and most desirable NFTs (such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club) still live on Ethereum, which is driving significantly more trading volume than Polygon. But the sidechain network is seeing traction as a destination for gaming NFTs and low-cost collectibles\u2014which could aid broader NFT adoption by reaching a much larger audience."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, Ethereum (ETH) has established itself as the leading blockchain in the cryptocurrency market due to its ability to facilitate the use of smart contracts. This feature allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), tokens and other applications without the need for intermediaries.\n\nHowever, as the network has grown in popularity, it has also experienced issues with scalability and high transaction fees. In response to these challenges, several competitors such as Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have emerged to address the scalability issues faced by Ethereum.\n\nDespite the emergence of rival blockchain platforms that boast advanced technology, Ethereum remains the most secure option due to its proven track record over time. In order to address its scalability and cost issues, solutions such as Layer 2 protocols have emerged as a means to enhance the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTwo notable examples of Layer 2 solutions are Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP). Both protocols aim to increase scalability on the Ethereum network, but they have distinct differences in their approach.\n\nPolygon vs. Optimism\n\nPolygon, also known as Matic Network, is a Layer 2 scaling solution that aims to improve Ethereum's scalability by using a layered architecture. This architecture allows for the faster and more efficient execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nOptimism is another Layer 2 scaling solution that aims to improve Ethereum's scalability by enabling faster and lower-cost transfers on the network by transaction aggregation. Additionally, Optimism's Layer 2 supports more advanced smart contract functionality.\n\nDespite both Polygon and Optimism aiming to improve Ethereum's scalability, they achieve this through different methods.\n\nPolygon uses ZK-Rollups, which makes use of zk-SNARKs, a zero-knowledge proof technology, to validate transactions without revealing the details of the transactions. This allows for a large number of transactions to be grouped into a single block, thereby increasing the processing capacity of the blockchain.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism uses a mechanism called Optimistic Rollups, which uses a leader mechanism to ensure security. Transactions are processed outside of the main blockchain but are still considered secure as long as they are confirmed in an honest manner by the leader.\n\nBut which one is best for Ethereum?\n\nOne of the leading authorities on this topic is Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. According to Buterin, second-layer Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) are likely to ultimately surpass Optimistic Rollups as the preferred scalability solution for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Buterin acknowledges that the Optimistic solution is currently more advanced, he believes that the underlying technology of ZK-Rollups will ultimately prove to be superior in the long run. Furthermore, Buterin notes that ZK-Rollups are faster at facilitating transactions on and off the main network, which could lead to increased adoption of this technology."

        "content": "Ether is bound for another volatile year in 2023, according to Finder.com\u2019s latest Ethereum Price Predictions Report.\n\nFinder\u2019s panel of 56 fintech and cryptocurrency specialists think ETH will go as high as US$2,474 and as low as $984 in 2023 before ending the year at $2,184. Ethereum is currently priced at $1,588.\n\nDigital Capital Management managing director Ben Ritchie thinks Ether will be worth $2,500 by the end of 2023 but says it could go as low as $900 throughout the year.\n\n\u201cEthereum continues to dominate the market as the leading smart contract platform, driving a range of innovative projects within its ecosystem. However, recent market challenges have sparked investor concern and may limit the price of Ethereum to reach $2,500 this year. Despite this, Ethereum\u2019s low annual inflation rate is expected to keep the price stable and above $900, even if future market disruptions occur.\u201d\n\nSeasonal Tokens creator and founder Ruadhan O gave a bullish forecast of $3,000 by the end of 2023 and says Ethereum\u2019s price will recover alongside Bitcoin and the rest of the market.\n\n\u201cWhen economic activity starts to pick up, the transaction costs on the Ethereum network will rise. This will force Ethereum users to buy more ETH, providing additional upward pressure on the price.\u201d\n\nWith ETH\u2019s price still well below its price from April last year, the majority of Finder\u2019s panel (60%) think it is currently underpriced. 28% think ETH is priced fairly, while just 12% think it\u2019s overpriced. A similar number of panelists think now is a good time to buy ETH (56%) with 28% suggesting investors hold and 16% sell.\n\nNearly half of Finder\u2019s panel (48%) think Ether will eventually \u2018flip\u2019 Bitcoin as the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, with nearly a quarter, including technologist and futurist Joseph Raczynski, expecting it to happen as soon as 2024.\n\n\u201cWhen you examine all blockchains based on security, decentralization, and scalability no other has its fundamental balance and judicious leadership, coupled with the critical mass of Ethereum. It\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t be toppled, but with each passing month it\u2019s less likely.\u201d\n\nEther is set to be worth $6,033 by 2025 and $14,316 by 2030, according to the panel average.\n\nOrigin Protocol co-founder Josh Fraser thinks ETH could crack $14,000 by 2025 given Ethereum is the base layer of innovation for the majority of DeFi and NFTs.\n\n\u201cAs these spaces develop, Ether will accrue in value. As scaling solutions gain mass adoption, Ethereum will be used for less-financially driven data, such as identity and social coordination. It\u2019s at this point we could see Ether become a 6-figure asset.\u201d\n\nHowever Associate Professor of Decentralised Finance at Nottingham Trent University Jeremy Cheah thinks Ether will be worth just $1,000 by the end of 2023 and $2,000 by 2025 given the lack of consumer rights safeguards which will suppress the price of crypto.\n\nYou can read the full report here: https://www.finder.com/ ethereum-price-prediction-2023"

While the partnership was officially announced on January 30, a Sorare spokesperson said discussions between the league and the company had been ongoing for a lengthy period.\n\nPremier League player cards are available on Sorare\u2019s platform, with some \u201csuper rare\u201d cards already valued at over $100 or more.\n\nSorare began to make moves within the Premier League network in 2019, signing West Ham United as its first English club as a partner of its platform. Cointelegraph has learned that the League and Sorare have agreed to a four-year deal, with the value of the partnership undisclosed for contractual reasons.\n\nRelated: Web3 projects aim to create engagement between fans and sports leagues\n\nThe company spokesperson also broke down the deal\u2019s structure, with Sorare making an upfront downpayment to the league for licensing rights. From there, digital card sales result in a percentage split between Sorare and the Premier League.\n\nSorare mints digital cards of players from the Premier League on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform has long used ERC-721 token standard for its NFT player cards, which fans can collect and trade and use to play on the platform\u2019s free-to-play fantasy sports league.\n\nThe Premier League digital cards will be available for initial purchase on Sorare before being available for trading on compatible marketplaces like OpenSea. The fantasy sports platform continues to be a proponent for connecting fans, players and organizations with blockchain technology:\n\n\u201cFor Sorare, this underlying technology is the means, not the ends, to connecting users with their favourite clubs, and we welcome it powering the next generation of sports fandom and entertainment.\u201d\n\nNFTs, including digital trading cards and highlights from various sporting codes, have become popular collectibles in recent years. NBA Top Shots exploded in popularity in 2021, while the football world has continued to see synergies with blockchain-based platforms."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe official account @BoneShibaSwap (BONE) has made an announcement that they have created an ETH domain name Shytoshi.eth \u2014 named after the lead Shiba Inu developer, the pseudonymous Shytoshi Kusama.\n\nShytoshi.eth for sale for 500 ETH\n\nBoneShibaSwap has already twice hinted that it would like Kusama to buy it. Now, it is for sale on OpenSea for 500 ETH \u2014 around $790,000 in fiat. The seller promises to use this money to buy BONE tokens.\n\nThe sale of the ETH domain will last until April 30, according to the screenshot. The BoneShibaSwap account said that they hope Shytoshi would buy it before some Ethereum whale does it quicker. They referred to Kusama as \"one of the most important people in the crypto world.\"\n\n#Bone #shytoshi #EnsNames #Vip\n\nI put the real name of one of the most important people in crypto world up for sale\n\nI hope whales don't buy his original name before @ShytoshiKusama Shytoshi.eth Now available opensea\n\nfinal decision is yours\n\nI will use 500 Ethereum to buy $bone pic.twitter.com/up7CwH6b1d \u2014 BoneShibaSwap (@BoneShiba) January 31, 2023\n\nOn Jan. 30, @BoneShibaSwap also made this offer to Kusama. In the comment thread, they specified that this may make his name more recognizable in the crypto space, similar to Vitalik Buterin, who has an ETH domain name on his Twitter handle: vitalik.eth.\n\nYour words are like saying, Vitalik, you don't need this because everyone knows you :) pic.twitter.com/BeolxWGcy1 \u2014 BoneShibaSwap (@BoneShiba) January 29, 2023\n\nShytoshi Kusama has not responded to either of these tweets yet.\n\nNew Shibarium announcement could be around corner\n\nAs reported by U.Today earlier, the above-mentioned Shytoshi Kusama changed his location status on his Twitter handle to the \"Situation room.\" Shib enthusiast \"Kuro Shibarmy Japan\" shared this in a tweet, sparking comments from the SHIB army that the lead Shiba Inu developer might be preparing an announcement related to the Shibarium launch or is about to make an important decision on this topic.\n\nThe term \"Situation room\" refers to a place for making crucial decisions by top people in authority, such as at a military base or police station. There is also the situation room in the White House, where the U.S. president and his top officials make important decisions. It was this association that initially caused \"Kuro Shibarmy Japan\" to jokingly assume that Kusama was in the White House.\n\nThe upcoming beta launch of Layer 2 solution Shibarium was announced in the middle of January in a press release, where the basic concepts of Shibarium were shared by the dev team. The community around the SHIB token is looking forward to the release as the developers promise that the Layer 2 solution would ensure seamless transactions at a tiny gas price and tremendous burns of Shiba Inu via the BONE token, which will be used to pay transaction fees.\n\nOver the weekend, Shytoshi Kusama told the Shiba community on Telegram to \"keep popcorn on the ready.\" Many took this as a hint that Shibarium is about to launch soon."

        "content": "Decentraland is an immersive, browser-based platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to experience a 3D, shared virtual world.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Decentraland began as a proof of concept \u201cfor allocating ownership of digital real estate to users on a blockchain.\u201d Per the public ledger tech, users who purchase land parcels permanently own them in the form of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Landowners create and monetize their own environments, marketplaces and applications.\n\nWhat Is Decentraland? Decentraland is a 3D, user-owned virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to buy digital real estate and meet up in the metaverse.\n\nIn practice, Decentraland functions as a marketplace and a virtual community center. While users buy and sell digital real estate, they\u2019re also exploring that same world as it is being built. They socialize, play games, exchange collectibles or even catch music artists in concert.\n\n\u201cUsers can build whatever they want, from virtual stores and art galleries to game arenas,\u201d said Fraser Matthews, president at crypto exchange Netcoins. \u201cThey can also earn money from activities, such as renting out their properties, providing services and creating virtual goods.\u201d\n\nDecentraland uses a three-layer protocol that allows it to run its native token economy and DAO governance system. | Image: Decentraland\n\nHow Does Decentraland Work?\n\nDecentraland launched as the public\u2019s introduction to a monetized metaverse, and its ever-developing ecosystem relies on several factors to deliver a decentralized, digital world. Here we highlight its protocol, which keeps underlying codes running behind the scenes, as well as the project\u2019s user-interfacing management systems \u2014 its token economy and governance.\n\nProtocol\n\nDecentraland uses a three-layered protocol. The consensus layer tracks the ownership of land parcels via smart contracts. The content layer renders the necessary files required from parcel to parcel. Lastly, the real-time layer enables peer-to-peer communication between users\u2019 avatars.\n\nAll content featured within Decentraland is hosted and served via a global network of community or user-owned content servers, or nodes.\n\nToken Economy\n\nDecentraland\u2019s in-world cryptocurrency and native token is known as MANA. This ERC-20 token is used to purchase everything within Decentraland, from wearables for your avatar to parcels of land, or LAND.\n\nUnlike MANA, LAND tokens are not interchangeable. They are one-of-a-kind NFTs that can provide proof of ownership of virtual real estate. If a user were to collect multiple parcels of land adjacent to one another, they can be merged to create the third token, called Estates.\n\nEvery time users buy and register LAND, MANA tokens are \u201cburnt.\u201d This process permanently removes coins from circulation, cutting the supply in order to increase market value.\n\nUpon Decentraland\u2019s debut, LAND sold for about $20 with MANA tokens at $0.02. As of June 2023, the floor price for a plot of LAND is approximately $1,880, and MANA tokens are priced at about $0.4.\n\nGovernance\n\nUnlike other platforms, Decentraland is entirely owned by its users through a decentralized autonomous organization. The Decentraland DAO is a decision-making body made up of Decentraland token holders. Through voting, the collective can issue grants and modify lists of banned names, points (or locations) of interest, personal-use servers called catalyst nodes as well as LAND and Estate smart contracts. Voting power is allocated respective to a user\u2019s crypto wallet size.\n\nTo vote on proposed changes to the protocol, a user must hold wrapped MANA (MANA tokens that have been locked within the DAO, forfeiting spending or transferring abilities), LAND or Estate tokens. Wrapped MANA is equal to one vote. LAND and Estate tokens grant 2000 votes per parcel.\n\nMore on NFT Marketplaces Where to Buy NFTs: 20 Marketplaces and What They Sell\n\nWhat Is Decentraland Built On?\n\nDecentraland is built on the Ethereum blockchain. With Ethereum as the foundational layer of the project, Decentraland\u2019s native coin, MANA, is set on the ERC-20 token standard, a benchmark for all Ethereum-based, fungible tokens. As one of the most widely used protocols, this allows for easy exchange with tokens from other decentralized finance, or DeFi, projects.\n\n\u201cBy relying on the Ethereum network, Decentraland eliminates many of the hurdles faced by traditional virtual worlds while allowing it to remain secure and tamper-proof,\u201d said Mina Tadrus, CEO of Tadrus Capital, a quant investment management firm. \u201cAdditionally, users can use Ether cryptocurrency to purchase and trade digital goods in Decentraland, creating a completely new digital economy.\u201d\n\nAn error occurred.

Visit Decentraland.org\n\nTo check out Decentraland, use a desktop or laptop computer to visit the Decentraland website.\n\n2. Download Decentraland Application or Use Browser Version\n\nOn the front page, users can download the Decentraland application or use the web browser. The application offers the fastest and smoothest user experience, while the web browser offers a limited experience but with no download needed.\n\n3. Create Decentraland Account\n\nUsers must create an account to enter Decentraland, and may sign up as a guest or by connecting an existing crypto wallet. As a guest, users can explore Decentraland and buy items from its marketplace using fiat money, but won\u2019t be able to interact with cryptocurrencies or NFTs while playing. By connecting a crypto wallet, users get the full ability to buy items with cryptocurrency, as well as use MANA and LAND.\n\n4. Customize Decentraland Avatar\n\nUsers are prompted to customize their own avatar, which will be used to represent them on Decentraland. Preset options are available for new users, so they can customize visual features like their avatar\u2019s face, hairstyle and outfit to their liking.\n\n5. Start Exploring\n\nOnce all set up, users go through an optional tutorial which gets them oriented with controls and the environment. After completing this tutorial, or leaving it at any time, users get dropped into Decentraland\u2019s starting location, Genesis Plaza. From here, users can move around and explore Decentraland.\n\nMore on the Metaverse A Guide to the Metaverse and VR Tech: What You Need to Know\n\nDecentraland can be thought of as a single planet in the ever-expanding metaverse. | Image: Decentraland\n\nDecentraland vs. Metaverse\n\nSimply put, Decentraland is one planet floating in the metaverse, while the metaverse itself expands beyond just one platform.\n\n\u201cThe metaverse is a more general term that refers to the concept of a virtual world that is accessible to everyone, while Decentraland is a specific implementation of this concept,\u201d said Eldad Postan-Koren, co-founder and CEO at WINN.AI, a tech startup developing an artificially intelligent sales assistant, and member of the Forbes Technology Council.\n\n\u201cThe metaverse is often used to refer to virtual worlds that are fully immersive and that can be accessed through virtual reality, while Decentraland is focused on creating a decentralized virtual reality platform,\u201d Postan-Koren added.\n\nDecentraland vs. Sandbox\n\nDecentraland and The Sandbox are both decentralized, digital worlds existing in the metaverse, but have their own separate uses and assets.\n\nFor similarities, you can buy and monetize virtual real estate in either world (known as LAND in both), connect crypto wallets as well as utilize avatars and digital items. They also both reside on the Ethereum network, and operate using DAO governance.\n\nAs for differences, Decentraland focuses on providing a general, open-source virtual world with multiple uses, including digital event hosting and varied content creation (for art, apps, personal spaces and games). Sandbox on the other hand focuses on play-to-earn capabilities, letting users create games, animations and 3D content to flesh out gaming on the Ethereum blockchain. Decentraland has 19,601 total land plots available, while Sandbox has 166,464 total plots available. Also, Decentraland\u2019s native cryptocurrency is MANA, whereas Sandbox\u2019s is SAND."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a decentralized naming system for Ethereum addresses, is voting to execute the swap of 10,000 ETH into stablecoin USDC.\n\nThe ENS DAO, which oversees the ENS protocol and its treasury, currently holds an estimated $1.2 billion in funds, with $227 million in liquid assets, according to DeepDAO.\n\n10,000 ETH, about $16 million, is equivalent to 25% of the total ether held in its treasury and register controller, the DAO said in a proposal.\n\nWhen the proposal was written, it was expected that the sale of its ETH holdings would generate more than $13 million USDC, which will cover ENS DAO\u2019s operational expenses over the next 18 to 24 months. At current prices, $10,000 ETH is worth $15.8 million.\n\nAs DAO operations are often quite expensive \u2014 with a majority of its expenses funneled into salaries \u2014 it would be necessary for organizations to have a steady source of income.\n\nIf the proposal were to be approved, the trade would occur on CoW Swap, decentralized exchange aggregator that leverages Batch Auctions as its price-finding mechanism.\n\nSince entering the bear market, ether prices have been fluctuating. At the time of writing, ether is trading around $1,600, down 44% over the past year. Exchanging a portion of ENS\u2019 ether for a dollar-pegged asset like USDC would go a long way if the bear market extends much further.\n\nToken Terminal, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, estimates annual salaries for DAO members for MakerDAO, Lido, and SushiSwap cost $205,000, $132,000, and $256,000, respectively.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEthereum Name Service DAO members worry about USDC\n\nIn the case of ENS, pseudonymous community member futurealisha noted the majority of USDC expenses at the DAO come from ENS Labs, the Singapore-based non-profit powering ENS development.\n\n\u201cENS Labs receives a daily stream of $11,500 USDC, which amounts to [around $4.2 million per year. Over two years, that is [roughly $8.4 million],\u201d futurealisha wrote in a discussion forum.\n\nAnother source of USDC spending would be working groups, \u201cThis budget would allow working groups to claim up to [about $1.5 million] in USDC per term between them. This amounts to [around $3 million per year and $6 million over two years],\u201d she said.\n\nNot all community members are thrilled about the swap. Another user posted that USDC is a centralized token which could be blacklisted by the US government, echoing concerns raised by MakerDAO members last year.\n\n\u201cThe DAO will have little recourse to recover the funds in this instance as the ENS token will be considered an illegal security if things get to this point,\u201d they said.\n\nThe on-chain proposal vote is currently live on Tally, with 98% of voters currently in favor of the proposal. A quorum of 1 million has also passed \u2014 though voting will continue until Feb. 7.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "BTC vs ETH: Better Buy Between Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2023 - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum prices crashed hard in 2022 as the crypto industry faced a mountain of challenges. Some of the main headwinds were the soaring interest rates, rising inflation, and the collapse of Terra, Voyager Digital and FTX. In all, Bitcoin price dropped by 65% while ETH crashed by 68%. In this BTC vs ETH comparison, we will assess the better buy between the two.\n\nBTC and ETH faces challenges in 2023\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies plunged in 2022 as concerns about the industry rose. First, investors were concerned about the health of the global economy as inflation rose. Consumer prices jumped to the highest level in more than four decades in most countries. This rebound was mostly driven by higher energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nSecond, central banks like the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and European Central Bank (ECB) delivered multiple rate hikes during the year. The Fed hiked by 450 basis points, making it the most hawkish it has been in decades. Historically, cryptocurrencies and other risky assets tend to underperform in a period of high rates. Indeed, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index fell by over 30%.\n\nThird, Bitcoin prices plunged after the collapse of Terra and its ecosystem. This collapse played a role into the collapse of other companies like FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius, and BlockFi. As such, the fear and greed index dropped while outflows from exchanges rose.\n\nFind out how to buy Ethereum.\n\nOutlook for 2023\n\nEthereum went through a major change in 2022 as the developers activated the merge. This merge helped Ethereum transition from a proof-of-work into a proof-of-stake network. PoS networks are usually more climate-friendlier than PoS platforms.\n\nThe merge sets the stage for more upgrades in Ethereum. For example, the Shanghai upgrade will happen in Q1 of 2023. It will make it possible for people to withdraw their staked funds. It will then be followed by another upgrade that will introduce sharding mechanism.\n\nAll these upgrades will be positive for Ethereum and its ecosystem. For example, sharding will turbocharge its network speed and reduce its costs. It will also help more adoption by dApp developers. Bitcoin, on the other hand, will not see any change in 2023.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum\n\nSo, which is a better buy between Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2023? Historically, the two assets tend to move in sync with each other. In the past five years, Ethereum price has done better than BTC. In 2022, BTC did better despite the merge hype.\n\nEthereum faces a tulmoutous performance in 2023 because of regulatory risks. By introducing staking, it effectively became a security. As such, it could be limited in the United States now that regulators are increasing their focus on the sector.\n\nAnalysts believe that the scrutiny will likely depend on the outcome of the SEC vs Ripple case in the US. If the SEC wins, it could increase its focus on other assets like ETH. Therefore, because of these risks, I believe that BTC price will do better than Ethereum in 2023."

        "content": "Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest recently released its Big Ideas report.\n\nThe report delved into various aspects of public blockchains and digital wallets, among other things.\n\nThe asset manager believes that Bitcoin could be worth more than $1 million by 2030.\n\nPublic blockchains were presented as the future of money and contracts.\n\nArk Invest, the American asset management firm launched by Cathie Wood, presented its take on the future of finance and blockchain technology in its Big Ideas 2023 report. Aside from crypto, the report discussed various exciting technologies, including Molecular Diagnostics, Artificial Intelligence, and the technological convergence of Public Blockchains with other fields that could put the platforms on the road to a $200 trillion valuation by the end of the decade.\n\nBitcoin Is Likely To Scale Into A Multi-Trillion Dollar Market\n\nCathie Wood has been vocal in her support for Bitcoin. The recent downturn in the crypto market failed to deter her confidence in the flagship cryptocurrency. The report by her firm stated that the crypto winter elevated Bitcoin\u2019s value propositions as a decentralized alternative, by shedding a light on the role of centralized counterparties in the crypto contagion.\n\nWe believe Bitcoin\u2019s long-term opportunity is strengthening. Despite a turbulent year, Bitcoin has not skipped a beat. Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the current fundamentals of BTC are stronger than they were during the past drawdowns. Data gathered by Ark Invest indicated that BTC holders are more long-term focused today than at any point in history. The firm\u2019s research estimated that the price of one bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030. The bear case puts 2030\u2019s price target at $258,500 for 1 BTC. The base case presented a target of $682,800. The most optimistic estimation, i.e. the bull case, valued BTC at $1.48 million by the end of the decade.\n\nThe report also took a closer look at the role of public blockchains in the future of finance and related technologies. Ark Invest believes that large-scale adoption of blockchain tech will eventually prompt all money and contracts to migrate onto public blockchains that enable and verify digital scarcity and proof of ownership."

        "content": "It is no secret that the cryptocurrency market is vastly complex and ever-changing. In this article, we explore the recent events involving Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Snowfall Protocol (SNW), to get a better sense of the latest updates in the crypto market. We compare these digital coins and discuss why Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has been gaining so much attention recently as its price continues to surge.\n\nPolygon\u2019s (MATIC) surge may be met with a sharp decline\n\nWhile the rest of the cryptocurrency market is down today, Polygon\u2019s MATIC token is surging. The cryptocurrency has now moved into the top ten, passing Solana (SOL) in the process. With a market cap worth $9.7 billion, Polygon (MATIC) is a leading cryptocurrency. Since the start of 2023, Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling network, has flourished. Since January, Polygon (MATIC) DeFi has seen an increase in its total value locked.\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, the Polygon (MATIC) network\u2019s TVL is $1.28 billion at press time. Since January 1st, Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) value has risen by about 20%. However, when tokens like Polygon (MATIC) rise dramatically and instantly, they could meet with major price declines. Currently, Polygon (MATIC) is trading at $1.1357. Furthermore, experts believe that Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) price would fall by 8.28% in one month. The corrected price of Polygon (MATIC) will be $1.0417.\n\nSolana (SOL) could decline by 26% post Friktion\u2019s shutdown\n\nFriktion, a Solana (SOL) DeFi yield platform, states that its front end website is going down, and users should withdraw their funds from the platform. Though Solana\u2019s (SOL) platform\u2019s underlying protocol is still available on the blockchain, the front-end website will no longer offer the same services. The closure of Friktion, according to industry experts, may represent a setback for Solana\u2019s (SOL) DeFi plans.\n\nOver $3 billion was traded on Solana\u2019s (SOL) Friktion, and the platform\u2019s Total Value Locked amounted to $150 million last year. Solana\u2019s (SOL) price and performance may continue to suffer in the wake of the shutdown of its DeFi platform. Currently, the cost of Solana (SOL) is roughly $24. Additionally, if the crypto market has a bearish outlook in the coming month, the price of Solana (SOL) will also struggle, especially if it trades below its price of $22.77. If this price point is reached by Solana (SOL), it will result in the value of the altcoin further falling to the level at $17.89, signifying a 26% decline, as per experts.\n\nSnowfall Protocol (SNW) price skyrockets to $0.20\n\nSince its presale, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency industry. The goal of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is to make it simple and inexpensive to move cryptocurrency holdings from one blockchain to another, without the need for a lot of technical knowledge. This is possible with Snowfall Protocol\u2019s (SNW) ability to facilitate multi-chain communication, which enables the transfer of digital assets without any interruptions or third-party interference.\n\nOwing to the enormous buzz surrounding the project, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has successfully completed two rounds of presale, and generated over $4 million. The value of the native SNW token of Snowfall Protocol has skyrocketed from $0.005, in the first phase of the presale, to the current value of $0.20. Snowfall Protocol\u2019s (SNW) presale period ends in February, and its price is expected to increase by as much as 5,000% once it is made available to the public.\n\nget in while you can and invest in Snowfall Protocol (SNW) today!!!\n\nPresale: https://presale.snowfallprotocol.io\n\nWebsite: https://snowfallprotocol.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/snowfallcoin\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/snowfallcoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "After months of rollercoaster rides with the $1,500 price range, Ethereum has finally managed to break the $1,600 resistance and is doing a good job stabilizing it at the moment.\n\nAlongside Bitcoin and most other leading altcoins, Ethereum has recorded some solid returns so far in January, with a value increase of around 30%.\n\nIf the market continues this recovery and other puzzles fall into place as well, Ethereum could have one hell of a comeback year in 2023.\n\nHowever, experts believe that it won\u2019t bring nearly as much profit as Meta Masters Guild (MEMAG), FightOut (FGHT), RobotEra (TARO), and C+Charge (CCHG).\n\nLet\u2019s go through the details.\n\n>>>Buy the Best Presale Crypto Now<<<\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 What Can We Expect from Bullish Rallies?\n\nEven despite the amazing progress Ethereum has made in 2022 such as the September 15h Merge, the price was \u201cheld captive\u201d by the severe bear market.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen ETH reach the $2,000 target since May 2022, with $1,500 being a huge struggle point for Q3 and Q4 of 2022. Ever since the ATH of $4,878 in 2021, the price has been through numerous drops.\n\nHowever, with the market finally beginning to stabilize, we could be on the brink of new major bullish runs this year that will drive the price of Ethereum once again across the $2,500-$3,000 mark.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing some solid 30% returns in January, but the real test will be the $2,000 point and whether ETH will surpass it until summer.\n\nAnd with the Shanghai upgrade anticipated for March 2023, many experts believe that 2k will just be the starting point and that ETH has a real chance of ending 2023 somewhere around $5,000.\n\nThis is an impressive ROI if the predictions come true, but if you want 30x-50x returns this year, you should focus on the following projects.\n\n>>>Buy the Best Presale Crypto Now<<<\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nMeta Masters Guild is a robust and innovative gaming guild that leverages P2E, Metaverse, and blockchain elements in one immersive ecosystem.\n\nIt addresses one of the most common problems in the crypto gaming space \u2013 boredom. Nowadays, there are a ton of players that take up a new P2E game and then quickly get bored due to the lack of innovation.\n\nThat\u2019s why Meta Masters incorporates several P2E games with different storylines and concepts, providing users with the ultimate fun gaming experience.\n\nThe presale for MEMAG tokens started just a few weeks ago and it\u2019s already going incredibly well, so don\u2019t miss your chance of joining before the sell-out.\n\n>>>Buy MEMAG Now<<<\n\nFightOut (FGHT)\n\nFightOut is an M2E project that\u2019s looking to dethrone some of the biggest players in this niche and establish itself as the new leader.\n\nIt utilizes NFTs, Web3, and blockchain tech to offer users a unique Move-to-Earn experience and motivate them to achieve their fitness goals.\n\nFor this purpose, users can access personalized diet regimes and training that have been tailored to their needs by professional coaches and nutritionists.\n\nThere are also NFT avatars that mirror your progress and you\u2019ll be able to show them off in some of the real-world gyms that will be launched later this year.\n\nInvestors believe that this gym chain will have a huge influence on the price and that it will prompt some huge bullish rallies.\n\n>>>Buy FGHT Now<<<\n\nRobotEra (TARO)\n\nRobotEra is a new crypto gaming platform launched in an immersive Metaverse and it combines several P2E games and countless monetization opportunities.\n\nYou need an NFT robot avatar to cruise the different continents and explore the world, and these tokens will rise in value as the game continues to develop.\n\nThere are a few different ways to make money \u2013 using robot companions to complete tasks, trading land, selling your interesting creations, and more.\n\nRobotEra is currently in its presale phase in which you can buy TARO tokens for a huge discount.\n\n>>>Buy TARO Now<<<\n\nC+Charge (CCHG)\n\nC+Charge is a green cryptocurrency that functions as a P2P payment app and provides EV drivers with carbon credits for their contribution to the environment.\n\nBecause it aims to democratize the carbon credit market (that\u2019s currently ruled by big corporations), experts are calling it the \u201cbest eco-friendly crypto of 2023\u201d.\n\nThe main center point is the mobile app that shows EV drivers where the nearest charging stations are and rewards them with carbon credits if they charge the vehicles at CCHG-specified stations.\n\nWe might be looking at the lowest CCHG price ever, which is why experts suggest that now is the best time to join the ongoing presale.\n\n>>>Buy CCHG Now<<<\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s trial with SEC has been closely followed by the entire crypto market and the verdict will have a huge impact on the rest of the industry.\n\nWhile XRP is still hanging tightly onto its position as one of the leading altcoins, the future of the token pretty much depends on the outcome of the trial.\n\nThis is why so many speculative traders have put huge sums of money into it \u2013 if the verdict is in Ripple\u2019s favor, we could see some incredible returns.\n\n>>>Buy the Best Presale Crypto Now<<<\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade and market recovery, Ethereum is currently in a great position to continue the bullish rally and bring some hefty profits.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s possible to end 2023 somewhere around the $10,000 mark if everything goes as planned in the following months.\n\nBut, the 30x-50x return potential that MEMAG, FGHT, TARO, and CCHG promise is much more attractive.\n\nAccording to numerous media outlets and industry experts, these tokens are ticking \u201cprofit bombs\u201d and they will explode as soon as they go viral.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "New Bitcoin protocol may shake up the NFT market - Forkast News",
        "content": "A new protocol released on Bitcoin is bringing wider NFT capabilities to the world\u2019s largest blockchain, with the potential to reshape the NFT market and the dynamic between some of the biggest blockchains, industry officials tell Forkast.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, which was released after a Jan. 21 post by developer Casey Rodarmor, allows users to insert relatively large amounts of data into transactions, which can be used for creating collectible images on the network, similar to many popular NFT projects.\n\nThis capability was previously available on Bitcoin, but on a scale too small for workable NFTs. However, Bitcoin upgrades like 2021\u2019s Taproot and 2017\u2019s SegWit allows the Ordinals protocol to expand this functionality.\n\nJonathon Miller, Australia managing director of U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said Ordinals is a positive development for the network, but it has also generated controversy.\n\n\u201cThere are purists who say [Bitcoin] should always just be peer-to-peer cash, but I think that\u2019s possibly not the story when it comes to the reality, which is that people experiment with Bitcoin all the time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt really is exciting to see people build things on top of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWithout this experimentation, the network would not have Layer 2 solutions such as the lightning network, which greatly increases transaction speeds on Bitcoin, he added.\n\nNew killer?\n\nNFTs are regarded as a crucial component of the reimagined internet of Web3 \u2014 in which gaming, social media and financial services are run through decentralized blockchain applications controlled by users\u2019 wallets. And NFTs have long been the domain of the Ethereum blockchain that hosts roughly 70% of all NFT sales value.\n\nMany blockchain networks \u2014 from Cardano to Solana \u2014 have been labelled \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in recent years, or networks hoping to eat into Ethereum\u2019s dominance in Web3 or NFTs, but so far none have made much headway.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT relations strategist for blockchain data aggregator CryptoSlam, said one reason for that is Ethereum has a multi-year head start. But that is not a factor that hinders Bitcoin as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] been around longer than any others \u2014 ten years now, plus \u2014 they have a huge, huge base of users. So, I almost think there\u2019s potential it could compete with Ethereum more quickly than the others could, simply because of adoption.\u201d\n\nMiller had a different view, saying Ethereum has excellent tools for creating NFTs, whereas Ordinals is just the protocol for creating tools on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cPerhaps [Ordinal\u2019s] not going to be something that competes directly with those networks,\u201d he said. And it may well act as a reminder that Ethereum is a really strong and well-tooled network for creating NFTs.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nPetscher said the real change from Ordinals may not be about creating new types of collectibles, but proving that developers can build upon an old blockchain and change the market dynamics in the process. That could prove to be the real innovation in the project, he added.\n\n\u201c[Ordinals] certainly gives Bitcoin as a currency itself more utility,\u201d he said, \u201cit strictly was almost a financial asset and people were very happy with that. It now has another and one that I expect like on Ethereum and these other blockchains will grow exponentially now you can transact collectibles.\u201d\n\nSome of Ordinal\u2019s critics argue that it will increase the demand on the network, driving up fees for regular transactions. Petscher agrees this is a risk, but said the added utility of being able to purchase the NFTs with Bitcoin could also serve to increase the price, helping many miners and long-term holders within the community.\n\nOthers argue that these are frivolous ways to use the network, however, and detract from the intention Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, had in mind when releasing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt can be all of these things at the same time,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cIt certainly can be frivolous and it can be silly and it could be pointless and it can still be awesome at the same time and important to building a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd especially in a decentralized world, not only does it not matter but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d"

        "title": "Is There a Long-Term Case for Crypto? With These 3 Coins, the Answer Is a Resounding Yes - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In 2023, crypto seems to be on the cusp of finally being recognized as a viable long-term investment option for patient, buy-and-hold investors. Big institutional investors are grudgingly acknowledging that crypto is an asset class worth investing in, albeit a very high-risk and volatile asset class. At the same time, there is growing discussion among some of the biggest names in the industry about crypto as a way to plan for retirement.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a closer look at three cryptos -- Bitcoin (BTC 0.71%), Ethereum (ETH 0.34%), and Polygon (MATIC -1.28%) -- that might be suitable for anyone taking a long-term view of the market.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nThe obvious starting point for anyone constructing a long-term crypto portfolio is Bitcoin, which now accounts for close to 45% of the entire capitalization of the crypto market. While crypto is hardly a \"safe\" buy-and-hold investment, Bitcoin has proven surprisingly resilient to the ups and downs of the crypto market. Over its 14-year history, Bitcoin has weathered several major crashes, including one back in 2011 that saw its price plummet to $0.01 in a matter of days. But each time, Bitcoin has bounced back better than before.\n\nOne long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin is that it is \"the future of money.\" Over time, Bitcoin will become increasingly important as an online payment option. According to some Bitcoin bulls, such as Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, Bitcoin will one day be used for all online transactions. When Draper recently suggested that Bitcoin might skyrocket to $250,000, this is what he had in mind.\n\nTaking a very long-term view of things, Bitcoin could eventually start to supplant sovereign currencies. That was the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. The famous Bitcoin white paper has been used to suggest that a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency like Bitcoin could be superior to fiat currencies when it comes to managing macroeconomic factors such as inflation. After all, Bitcoin has a fixed total coin supply of 21 million, so there is no risk of hyperinflation from a government or central bank producing too much money.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nAnother coin with remarkable long-term staying power is Ethereum, which accounts for another 20% of the entire capitalization of the crypto market. While Bitcoin's primary function is as a store of value and an online payment option, Ethereum promises much more in terms of utility and real-world use cases. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, and since then, has been an innovation leader when it comes to decentralized finance, gaming, the metaverse, and digital assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe best way to think about Ethereum is that it is a foundation, or base, for everything that developers can think to build in the blockchain and crypto world. And this is what gives Ethereum so much long-term appeal. When you invest in Ethereum, you are not just investing in a single cryptocurrency, you are also investing in an entire blockchain ecosystem. Some analysts once referred to Ethereum as \"digital oil\" for its ability to power the modern blockchain economy.\n\nNow that Ethereum has transformed into a faster, energy-efficient blockchain as a result of The Merge, it is better positioned than ever to be the leading Layer 1 blockchain in the world. Already, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has laid out a fantastic long-term roadmap for the blockchain, in which it will eventually be able to process 1 million transactions per second. When that happens, Ethereum will become faster and more powerful than today's credit card networks, which can process only 24,000 transactions per second.\n\n3. Polygon\n\nFinally, there's Polygon, which has vaulted into the list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization largely based on its ability to generate innovative use cases for blockchain technology. For example, Polygon has already partnered with Walt Disney, with a long-term aim of developing new use cases within the entertainment sector. It has partnered with Starbucks on a new Web3 customer loyalty program. And it has partnered with Meta Platforms with the goal of making NFTs mainstream for billions of social media users around the world.\n\nPart of Polygon's appeal is that it is a scaling solution for Ethereum. Polygon leverages the security and stability of Ethereum, and then uses its own cutting-edge technology to bundle transactions and deliver world-class performance for end users. In 2022, Buterin praised Polygon for its \"truly amazing\" new scaling technology. Thus, as fast as Ethereum can grow, Polygon might be able to grow even faster.\n\nBuy and hold for the long term\n\nWhile crypto is often associated with short-term speculation and market timing, there is an increasingly robust case for crypto as a long-term investment option. Forget about the silly meme coins and focus on the coins and utility tokens that are developing the future of money and growing the modern blockchain economy. For that reason, I'm long-term bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon."

        "content": "Interest in ENS domain names remains at a minimum.\n\nThe rally in ENS\u2019 price since the year began has put many of its holders in profit.\n\nAccording to data from Dune Analytics, the interest in .eth domain registrations has remained low, with only 53,359 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) registrations recorded thus far in the current year.\n\nThroughout 2022, monthly domain name purchases on Ethereum Name Service embarked on a steady decline to close the tumultuous trading year with just 52,835 registrations in December.\n\nAfter rallying to a high of 437,365 .eth name registrations in September, it plummeted by 88% within three months.\n\nRead ENS\u2019 Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAs capital flight intensified amid the significant decline in the market last year, interest in ENS domain names dropped to an all-time low.\n\nGoogle Trends, though not the most sophisticated of data tools, provided a rough insight into the global internet users\u2019 interest level in ENS domain and .eth names.\n\nInterestingly, primary ENS name registrations saw a spike in the last month. A primary ENS name is a unique, human-readable name that is used to identify and locate a specific Ethereum address.\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, primary ENS name registrations hit a two-month record of 17,027 in the last 30 days, yet this marks a 45% decrease from the peak of 31,000 primary names registered in May 2022.\n\nAs for revenue made from name registrations on the platform so far this month, the protocol saw a 49% jump in revenue for .eth name renewals but logged an 11% decline in revenue for new name registrations.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ENS\u2019 market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nProfit-taking is the order of the day\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, ENS\u2019s price has grown by 46%. At press time, the altcoin traded at $15.77, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nLeveraging the unexpected price rally, ENS holders began distributing their holdings to realize profits on their various investments. Data from on-chain data provider Santiment revealed that the ENS\u2019 supply on exchanges has grown steadily since the year began. At press time, 8.13 million ENS tokens sat within cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAs its price grew, ENS\u2019s MVRV ratio rallied alongside. At press time, the altcoin\u2019s MVRV ratio was 74%. This meant that the asset\u2019s current market value was 74% higher than its realized value.\n\nAs a result, if all holders sell their tokens at the current price, they will receive an average return of 2x their initial investment.\n\nHowever, ENS was overvalued at that level and might be due for a price correction. Generally, experts consider an MVRV ratio above 20% for altcoins to be high-risk. Therefore, they advise waiting for the MVRV to fall below 10% before making a purchase for better risk management."

        "content": "Crypto bridge Wormhole has won the governance vote to become Uniswap\u2019s designated bridge to BNB Chain.\n\nWormhole beat fellow bridges Layerzero and deBridge to become the DEX\u2019s bridge provider.\n\nCommunity members aim to use BNB Chain\u2019s strong governance model and active community to develop Uniswap V3.\n\nWormhole will have to pass a final governance vote to become the DEX\u2019s official bridge to BNB Chain.\n\nUniswapDAO has chosen the popular cross-chain bridge Wormhole as its official bridge to BNB Chain. Wormhole will be used by Uniswap V3 for cross-chain governance messaging between Ethereum and BNB Chain. The crypto bridge, which notably suffered a $325 million attack in February 2022, came out as the top choice for the decentralized exchange (DEX) after it won the governance vote.\n\nWormhole beat LayerZero and deBridge to become Uniswap\u2019s official bridge\n\nAccording to the proposal posted on UniswapDAO\u2019s governance forum last month, there were five initial contenders for the cross-chain to the BNB Chain. These were HyperLoop (0xPlasma), LayerZero, Celer, and Stargate. Wormhole and deBridge were added later when they expressed interest in becoming the provider for the BNB deployment.\n\nFor cross-chain deployment proposals, we believe it is most important to optimize for protocol security \u2014 specifically, for community members to be able to make informed decisions based on all available information on risks to bridge security.\u201d\n\nThe voting snapshot shows that Wormhole received more than 62% of the votes. LayerZero was the second most popular choice with over 37% of the votes. The rest of the contenders including deBridge and Celer accumulated negligible votes. Wormhole will now have to pass a final vote to secure its status as the official bridge to BNB Chain.\n\nThe DEX aims to deploy on other chains before its BUSL license expires in April this year. Community members highlighted several other reasons to make the case for Uniswap V3\u2019s deployment on BNB Chain. Among these were BNB Chain\u2019s large and growing user base, an untapped market for the DEX to acquire new users. According to one member, \u201cBNB Chain\u2019s strong governance model and active community could provide valuable support and feedback for the development of Uniswap v3.\u201d"

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 41.91 suggests that bears are attempting to establish market dominance. Additionally, the Average True Range (ATR) of Bitcoin is displayed at 158.23, further emphasizing market volatility.\n\nBitcoin/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source: TradingView)\n\nFurthermore, after an extended period of consolidation, the digital asset appears to have finally breached its 200-day Moving Average to the downside. Nevertheless, numerous crypto analysts are anticipating a retest of the previous resistance level at $25,000 for Bitcoin. Should this price level be retested, it is speculated that a significant sell-off could ensue.\n\nEthereum/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source: TradingView)\n\nThe chart above depicts an evaluation of Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading near its 1-hour support level at a price point of $1,540. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is exhibiting a bearish slope with a reading of 42.89. However, the Bull Bear Power Indicator displays a positive value of 8.76, indicating that bulls are currently exerting control over the market.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has violated its 200-day Moving Average and is now trading beneath it, suggesting that sellers are attempting to break the current support level.

Solana is also following the patterns of the major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power indicator is shown at a reading of -0.25, meaning that the bears are taking the throne as of now.\n\nBut however, if Bitcoin, the dominant cryptocurrency, manages to trigger a bullish trend, it is likely that other cryptocurrencies such as Solana will mirror its movement.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCool Cats was one of the hottest profile picture projects to come out of the late 2021 NFT market boom, but prices declined sharply last year as collectors\u2019 gripes piled up. Today the founders behind the project unveiled a new path forward with refreshed branding\u2014and future expansion beyond Ethereum with customizable, full-body avatars.\n\n\u201cWith our new strategic direction and rebrand, we want to convey to the community and the broader Web3 space that Cool Cats is here to stay,\u201d Cool Cats Group CEO Stephen Teglas told Decrypt. \u201cWe\u2019re not just building for the next year, or the next five years\u2014we\u2019re planning for the long term.\u201d\n\nCool Cats and Cool Pets NFT holders will soon be airdropped a free Fracture NFT, which co-founder and Head of Content Robert Mehew described as \u201cdynamic NFTs that enable a new storytelling experience via digital collectibles.\u201d The Fracture NFTs will evolve as holders complete missions (or \"Journeys\") within the project's \"World of Cooltopia\" narrative, and eventually unveil potential rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew PFP. New Chapter. Same Blue Cat. See you at our Town Hall streaming LIVE on YouTube tomorrow Feb 1 at 3PM ET: https://t.co/EDXbg2QrFU pic.twitter.com/m4AmFhSD9i \u2014 Cool Cats (@coolcats) January 31, 2023\n\nBut the upcoming Explorers NFTs will represent a larger expansion of the Cool Cats project later this year, including customizable full-body avatars that can be used across multiple blockchain networks and brought into various supported apps and platforms.\n\nDetails are still scarce on the full extent of the Explorers functionality, but it sounds similar to what fellow Ethereum NFT project Doodles just did with Doodles 2. That project not only bridges over to a different blockchain, Flow, but turns the familiar profile pictures into fully featured avatars that can be tweaked and outfitted with virtual apparel.\n\nA Cool Cats representative told Decrypt that the Explorers NFTs will work across multiple layer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling networks, including some that are not Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. Those platforms will be revealed in the coming months. Cool Cats has previously used Ethereum sidechain network Polygon for special edition NFT drops and a mobile game.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to remove as much friction as possible,\u201d a rep said regarding the movement of Cool Cats avatars across blockchains. The team also plans to work with community members to develop assets to be used with the Explorers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday\u2019s announcements were paired with a rebranding of the Cool Cats project across social media and marketing materials, which will correspond with new narrative content centered on Blue Cat, the project\u2019s main character.\n\n\u201cOur new logo features a forward-facing cat, a nod to our focus on building for the future,\u201d Cool Cats co-founder and Creative Director Colin \u201cClon\u201d Egan told Decrypt.\n\nAn example of the refreshed Cool Cats branding. Image: Cool Cats\n\nCool Cats prices surged in late 2021 as the wider NFT market surged, pushing the floor price\u2014or the price of the cheapest-listed NFT on a secondary marketplace\u2014jumping to nearly 14 ETH (over $48,000) that October. The project signed with major Hollywood agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in March 2022 to explore media and licensing deals.\n\nBut Cool Cats prices crashed last year amid leadership departures, mixed reactions to Cooltopia, and gripes that the founders weren\u2019t doing enough to support the project. As of this morning, ahead of the announcements, the floor price sat at just 2 ETH according to data from NFT Price Floor. That\u2019s less than $3,200 worth, given the depressed price of Ethereum.\n\nTo date, Cool Cats has generated about $377 million worth of secondary market trading volume, per data from CryptoSlam, while the Cool Pets spinoff collection has added over $105 million to that tally. Cool Cats collaborated with Time magazine in 2021 for limited-edition NFTs, as well, and today announced a marketing deal with hardware wallet maker Ledger.\n\nWill a refreshed look, gamified reward NFTs for current owners, and a larger-scale avatar push across multiple chains help Cool Cats reaffirm its \u201cblue chip\u201d status after an up-and-down year? Teglas believes that going bigger and broader is key to growing Cool Cats into an entertainment brand that can reach beyond the Web3 faithful.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately believe that scaling Cool Cats\u2019 brand awareness and onboarding more members into the brand is one of the most effective ways for us to deliver on the expectations of our community,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct timing of the NFT airdrop and its functionality.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "As the crypto market begins to show signs of a bull run approaching and your favourite coins are on the rise after a prolonged crypto winter, there is only one wise thing to do\u2026 That is cop and HODL\u2026 In other words, buy now and hold on for dear life (HODL).\n\nMost people jump in when prices are at an all-time high and then regret it later. But this is your chance to get ahead of the crowd when the entire crypto market is on discount and undervalued.\n\nIn this article, we will be diving into our top 5 cryptocurrencies for 2023: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum \u2013 The Kings Of Crypto\n\nOkay, you may know of these already, but anyone without these top two crypto essentials on their top 5 list is bananas\u2026\n\nIn 2009, a mysterious computer nerd going under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto would create the most revolutionary financial asset known as Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin was launched as a digital payment method that works through peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain, eliminating the need for centralised authorities. Although Bitcoin is currently seen as non-eco-friendly, due to the amount of energy BTC transactions take, it is now widely seen as a store of value due to it being the first cryptocurrency and the rare limited supply that it has.\n\nEthereum (ETH), was created as a much faster alternative to Bitcoin and although it\u2019s a decentralised currency, it mainly acts as a platform for people to create decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. What makes Ethereum more versatile than Bitcoin is that it operates on its own blockchain and has its own programming language. Since the inception of Ethereum in 2015, it has revolutionised cryptocurrency as it has acted as an incredibly useful platform for thousands of other crypto projects and it has become the most popular currency for NFTs. As the use case of ETH develops further, its price will follow!\n\nAxie Infinity & Decentraland \u2013 Metaverse Essentials\n\nDecentraland (MANA) is an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralised virtual world platform where users can build, evaluate, and monetise content. In essence, users use MANA tokens to purchase virtual land known as NFTs on the Decentraland platform. Only the players\u2019 own actions, endeavours, and creativity may advance the game.\n\nAxie Infinity (AXS) is a commerce and combat game powered by blockchain that is run and owned in part by its users. Players can combat and trade token-based Axies, in which each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with a unique set of skills. The winning team gains more experience points, which may be applied to improving an Axie\u2019s stats or evolving its bodily parts.\n\nWith the metaverse expanding to become a popular household term and games becoming more immersive as we head towards the future, it\u2019s essential to look at some of the hottest cryptocurrencies in that space, such as Axie Infinity and Decentraland.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 To Become Biggest Meme Coin\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new meme token that is turning heads as it soars past a stunning $20.5 million in presale! This is just a foreshadowing of how successful the coin could be when it actually launches.\n\nSet to be one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies, Big Eyes Coin aims to shift wealth into the DeFi space, whilst also focusing on saving the oceans of the world by donating 5% of BIG transactions into a visible charity wallet.\n\nDOGE and SHIB best watch their tails, as Big Eyes Coin is an incredibly cut cat that could certainly snatch the crypto meme crown \u2013 now that would be purr-found.\n\nYou can now use their promo code LAUNCHBIGEYES200, for a fat 200% increase on your spend \u2013 but act fast as this code will be expiring soon!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn our top 5 for this article, we have highlighted the most innovative crypto projects which touch a range of aspects, including DeFi, gameworld, metaverse, NFT-related, meme territory and crypto classics. With this diverse crypto portfolio, you can rest assured that you are putting your eggs in different baskets, and therefore likely to see your portfolio skyrocket to the moon!\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Follow us on Image Source : UNSPLASH Bitcoin holds steady near $23,700, while Solana and Binance Coin see increases of up to 6%.\n\nCrypto News: As of January 30, 2023, the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at around $23,402.75with a decline of 1.40%. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at around $1,604.10 having a decrease of 1.59%.\n\nBUDGET 2023: FULL COVERAGE\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen a significant decrease in recent months, with many alternative coins also experiencing a drop in value. It is important to remember that the prices of cryptocurrencies can be extremely unstable, and sudden price changes in both directions are not uncommon.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing stability, with Bitcoin holding its value near $23,700. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a bullish run since the beginning of 2021 and has seen its price more than triple in value. Despite recent price corrections, it remains one of the most popular investments among retail and institutional investors.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies are also performing well. Solana and Binance Coin (BNB) have seen increases of up to 6% in value, indicating a strong demand for alternative cryptocurrencies. Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform, has been attracting attention due to its ability to handle high transaction volumes and its fast processing times. Binance Coin, on the other hand, is the native token of the Binance exchange, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nInvestors who are looking for alternative investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market will likely be keeping an eye on Solana and Binance Coin, as these cryptocurrencies are showing potential for future growth. However, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and that prices can change rapidly.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are trading as follows as on 9 am IST, 31 January 2023 :\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin :\n\n$23,157.54\n\n-2.99%\n\n\u2022 Ethereum : $1,586.03 USD\n\n-3.54%\n\n\u2022 Tether : $1.02 USD\n\n+0.59%\n\n\u2022 USD Coin : $1.00 USD\n\n-0.10%\n\n\u2022 BNB: $315.00 USD\n\n-1.28%\n\n\u2022 XRP : $0.3989 USD\n\n-4.87%\n\n\u2022 Dogecoin : $0.09418 USD\n\n+4.71%\n\n\u2022 Cardano : $0.3778 USD\n\n-4.79%\n\n\u2022 Polygon : $1.11 USD\n\n-5.32%\n\n\u2022 Polkadot : $6.35 USD\n\n-5.02%\n\n\u2022 Tron : $0.06263 USD\n\n-1.26%\n\n\u2022 Litecoin : $97.14 USD\n\n+0.87%\n\n\u2022 Shibu Inu : $0.00001205 USD\n\n-1.45%\n\n\u2022 Solana : $24.77 USD\n\n-5.40%"

        "content": "share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to\n\nclipboard\n\nAnd that, was January in crypto. Twas a surprisingly good one at that, given all the doom and gloom in November/December (thanks again for that, SBF).\n\nBefore we delve into altcoin specifics, let\u2019s just take a moment to acknowledge how well Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto market-mover in chief, fared across the first month of 2023.\n\nBecause, as you can see from this Coinglass BTC monthly returns chart, it smashed it.\n\nThat\u2019s a near 40% monthly gain for the OG crypto, and its best January performance since 2013. If things were to play out the way the rest of that year did, then it wouldn\u2019t be too shabby, would it?\n\nSuddenly remembers macroeconomic turmoil and recession-related concerns and, ahem, tempers expectations somewhat. That said, if reduced inflation in the US continues to play out, the jobs sector behaves, regulations don\u2019t stifle and the crypto industry fails to shoot itself in the foot again, then who knows.\n\nThere are still crypto-contagion-related worries floating around, for instance potential Digital Currency Group/Genesis implosion, but perhaps any fallout there will be limited, given it\u2019s almost expected now.\n\nJanuary\u2019s 10 leading gainers in the top 100 (and some losers)\n\nThe fact that there weren\u2019t many losers to show this month (courtesy of CoinGecko\u2019s data) and that most of them were, in fact, dollar-pegged stablecoins just fluctuating slightly under a percentage point, also tells you it was a pretty decent month for crypto.\n\nNew layer 1 protocol Aptos leads monthly gainers\n\nWe\u2019ve covered some of the reasons Aptos (APT) was pumping mid-way through January, but since then it\u2019s largely kept up a strong showing.\n\nThe project didn\u2019t launch at the greatest of times in the market late last year \u2013 in October, right before everything crapped the bed due to the FTX implosion and subsequent fallout.\n\nThe thing about it, though, is that it\u2019s a much-vaunted layer 1 Ethereum competitor. And like Solana and Polkadot and Avalanche and Cardano before it, we know how high that particular crypto narrative can ride on waves of hype.\n\nSaid hype stems largely from the fact Aptos is a proof-of-stake blockchain that\u2019s borne from the tech belonging to Facebook/Meta\u2019s abandoned blockchain project, Diem. Aptos\u2019 team comprises former Meta engineers and its CEO and co-founder Mohammad Shaikh worked on Meta\u2019s Novi wallet and has a strong background in financial services and the blockchain industry.\n\nThe protocol seems to be doing its best to keep the hype ball rolling, too, announcing a string of developer and Aptos community events for this year, which it\u2019s dubbed the Aptos World Tour. Get your T-shirts with the dates on the back now.\n\nAnother reason for the surge might be an increasing interest in NFT usage for the blockchain. NFTs \u2013 they don\u2019t created much froth, do they?\n\nYou're about to see a bunch of Aptos NFTs flood the market over the next few days/weeks imo. Where there's a massive pump, there's [sudden] massive interest and innovation. It's all genuine and we're all here for the uhhh tech. \u2014 Loma (@LomahCrypto) January 22, 2023\n\nAlso kicking up in January, we saw metaverse/3D modelling project Render (RNDR) on the back of no major news we could discern.\n\nDecentralised perpetual options exchange dYdX (DYDX), however, we know that\u2019s pumped partly because of this (from this morning\u2019s Mooners and Shakers column):\n\n\u201cDecentralized derivatives exchange dYdX has been surging on the news the protocol has delayed the unlock of its DYDX token for investors until the fourth quarter this year. The exchange announced it in a blog post overnight (AEDT).\u201d\n\nFantom (FTM), another Ethereum competitor, meanwhile, has been pushing its interoperability capabilities thanks to a collaboration with Axelar. More on that, here.\n\nAlso of note on that list is fellow layer 1 protocol Solana (SOL), which has had a particularly wretched time amid the FTX drama, seeing value seep and certain projects depart its blockchain (e.g. top NFT projects DeGods and y00ts).\n\nBut, thanks to a short-squeeze or two, and perhaps some settling down of negative sentiment, it\u2019s managed to claw back some price positivity.\n\nAnd we\u2019d best mention Frax Share (FXS) here, too, as it\u2019s one of a few liquid staking derivative protocols that have had particularly fine months. (Others include Lido DAO and Rocket Pool, for instance, and you can learn a bit more about this sector and why it\u2019s frothy right now, from reading our recent chat with Aussie fundies Apollo Crypto.)\n\nTop 10 gainers and losers in the top 300\n\nZooming out a tad, here then, were the top 10 winners and losers from the top 300 cryptos by market cap, with thanks again to CoinGecko\u2026\n\nThere are a few things on this list that stand out to us\u2026\n\nGala (GALA), is one, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the leading Web3 gaming protocols in the space \u2013 a narrative that many a crypto head has latched on as a potential boomer for the next bullish cycle.\n\nAnd then there are a couple of AI-related projects (SingularityNET and Artificial Liquid Intelligence) with highly impressive monthly gainage, too. AI is another particularly buzzy narrative that\u2019s seeped its way, like some sort of advanced Terminator, into the crypto realm.\n\nWe didn\u2019t cover those particular two projects in this related article, but that\u2019s because it purely focused on the top AI Google searched AI and big-data cryptos, which was led by The Graph (GRT).\n\nRead More Cryptocurrency"

Source: TradingView\n\nBullish factors for Ethereum\n\nAs always, the price of any digital asset is largely influenced by the developments surrounding its ecosystem, as well as the atmosphere of the wider crypto market and macroeconomic landscape around the world, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nFor instance, one of the developments that could help Ethereum start a new bullish rally in the near future is the launch of the long-awaited Shanghai mainnet shadow fork in March, which would test the readiness of ETH staking withdrawal capability.\n\nIn preparation for the formal launch of the shadow fork, the Zheijang public testnet is set to go live on February 1, followed by the Shanghai and Capella testnets six days later, triggered at epoch 1350, as confirmed by Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi.\n\nThe Shanghai+Capella upgrade is going full steam ahead!

        "title": "Crypto Token standards explained: ERC20, BEP20, BEP2, ERC721, ERC1155, ERC4626, ERC777, Wrapped tokens - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that exist on the blockchain. While there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies available in the market, most of them share similar underlying token standards.\n\nToken standards define some of the key functionalities and properties of blockchain tokens \u2013 such as token name, token symbol, token supply, token price, transferability between accounts, and more. Popular token standards include ERC-20, BEP-20, BEP 2 , ERC-721 , ERC777 , ERC-1155 , ERC4626 , and wrapped tokens. This article provides an overview of these token standards to help you understand their differences and similarities.\n\nWhy are crypto token standards important?\n\nCrypto token standards are important as they serve as protocols and guidelines to allow the stable functioning of cryptocurrency tokens. They play an essential role in organizing data and governing the interactions between smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other digital assets.\n\nToken standards are synonymous with similar concepts such as token transfer protocol, meaning they provide a blueprint for allowing different blockchain technologies and tokens to communicate with each other seamlessly.\n\nAs more types of tokens and protocols emerge, further discipline is required to ensure the success of blockchain technology \u2013 making crypto token standards all the more important for facilitating this congruence.\n\nCommon Token Standards in Crypto and DeFi\n\nWith the rise of blockchain technology, developers have created common token standards to facilitate interoperability and enable transparency. In the crypto and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space, Ethereum\u2018s ERC20 has become an established leader in token standardization. Currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin also have token standards for transferring value on their networks.\n\nOther popular standards include ERC721, a non-fungible token meant for digital collectibles and assets; ERC1155, a multi-token standard; ERC1337, a stablecoin standard; and ERC1400, a security token standard. These common token standards offer developers flexibility and added compatibility when creating new projects and applications. By operating within agreed-upon rulesets, all network participants can safely interact with them with greater security as compared to custom tokens built from scratch.\n\nERC20\n\nERC20 is the most popular standard for Ethereum tokens and relates to the ability to send and receive tokens within the Ethereum system. It is named an ERC for a reason \u2013 it stands for \u201cEthereum Request for Comment\u201d and defines a set of rules that all ERC20 tokens must follow to be compatible with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes functions such as total supply, the balance of an address, transfer from one address to another, and approval of allowances from one address to another. Since its inception in 2015, this standard has encouraged token creation, decentralized trading platforms, and projects with complex token economies such as non-fungible assets.\n\nExamples of ERC20 tokens are Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE).\n\nBEP20\n\nBEP20 is the Binance Chain version of ERC20 token transfers, with some distinct differences that benefit both developers and users alike. The main difference between BEP20 and its predecessor is the speed of the transactions due to Binance\u2019s expertise in blockchain technology. Transactions are almost instantaneous, providing an extra layer of convenience and security for users. Additionally, it has given developers more flexibility when creating DeFi protocols as they can now use one unified protocol across various blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and more without having to learn a new platform. With its innovative features such as improved security, accelerated time-to-market development, and enhanced usability, it is clear why more developers have been adopting BEP20 over ERC20.\n\nExamples of BEP20 tokens are Binance Coin (BNB), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and PancakeSwap (CAKE).\n\nBEP2\n\nBEP2 is a technical standard introduced to make the issuance and implementation of tokens on the BNB Beacon Chain simpler and more efficient. It contributes to developing an ecosystem in which tokens can be circulated freely while assuring maximum efficiency, reliability, and fairness. This standard defines a set of universal rules that all tokens must adhere to, allowing them to adapt seamlessly into the existing BNB Beacon Chain network with minimal effort. With this technology, token holders now have greater control over their tokens, allowing them to transfer them easily in the BNB ecosystem.\n\nExamples of BEP2 tokens are STEPN (GMT), Trust wallet token (TWT), and BEP2 PancskakeSwap (CAKE).\n\nERC721\n\nERC721 is an innovative smart contract standard that provides a foundation for the representation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike standard ERC20 tokens, each ERC721 token is unique and can hold its own set of data which can vary in terms of type and quantity from other tokens. By splitting the ERC721 standard into numerous contracts, users can create more complex and secure NFTs as well as implement certain optional features, if required. That said, this foundation has allowed developers to seek further integration possibilities with new and existing applications using blockchain technology.\n\nExamples of ERC 721 tokens are CryptoKitties, NBA Top Shot, and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).\n\nERC1155\n\nERC1155 is a much-applauded multi-token standard for Ethereum smart contracts. Unlike other standards, it can be used to create both fungible and non-fungible tokens with ease. It offers flexibility by targeting several asset types and brings development efficiency as its code base is standardized for different transactions with one set of rules.\n\nERC1155 has been growing rapidly in popularity due to the way it simplifies token creation and management; not to mention, the increased security that comes from having a unified, secure code base at the foundation. All in all, this new standard promises to revolutionize the way blockchain technology can be used across industries thanks to its all-in-one approach.\n\nExamples of ERC 1155 tokens are Enjin Coin (ENJ) and Aavegotchi (GHST).\n\nERC777\n\nERC 777 is a significant development in token trading technology. It facilitates interactions between tokens and Ether by creating a common platform, which allows users to view the value of other tokens held in their wallets. This standard revolutionizes existing fungible token models and provides a more secure and efficient way to implement the token exchange. This could lead to an increase in the number of exchanges taking place, and thereby potentially give more control over data management and storage services on the blockchain. Overall, ERC 777 has made transactions over Ethereum faster, easier, and more reliable.\n\nExamples of ERC777 tokens are Bancor (BNT), Loopring (LRC), and MakerDAO (MKR).\n\nERC4626\n\nERC4626 is a revolutionary new standard for blockchain domain names that offer improved compatibility with Ethereum Name Service (ENS). It has been developed as a step forward from existing ENS specifications and builds on existing Ethereum-based technologies to create a unique solution that increases the scalability, interoperability, and usability of domains and wallets. With this new standard, developers can more easily build projects that rely on the power of ENS, and users will benefit from enhanced functionality when creating their own blockchain identities. As the usage of blockchain technology continues to become more widespread within our society, ERC4626 provides an exciting opportunity to make this process even easier.\n\nExamples of ERC4626 tokens are Unstoppable Domains (UD), ENSMaketplace (ENSM), and FTA tokens.\n\nWrapped tokens\n\nWrapped tokens provide an interesting solution to the dilemma of how to transfer assets between different blockchains. This process, known as token wrapping, involves the smart contract issuance of a token equivalent to the original asset, allowing it to be used on a non-native blockchain. Token washing is in essence the exchange of one token for another token at a fixed rate \u2013 accomplished by creating a smart contract that allows the sender\u2019s tokens to be exchanged for an equal amount of the new tokens. Wrapping tokens provides flexibility when transferring digital assets from one platform to another without having to worry about compatibility and complexity issues.\n\nExamples of wrapped tokens are Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Wrapped Ether (WETH), and Wrapped Stellar Lumens (WSL).\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many standards for tokens in the cryptocurrency world, each with its purpose. The most popular standard is ERC20, which defines a set of rules that all ERC20 tokens must follow. BEP20 is the Binance Chain version of ERC20, with some minor differences. Another common standard is ERC721, which allows each token to be unique. These are just a few of the many crypto token standards out there. With so many options available, it\u2019s important to choose the right one for your needs."

Of course, there is so much expectation on the shoulders of the young Portuguese to rescue an underperforming Chelsea side.\n\nJust like Jao Felix, there are other players who arrived at Chelsea with similarly high expectations\u2026but FAILED.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss three players who could have done better during their time at Chelsea.\n\nAlvaro Morata\n\nWhen the Spaniard arrived from Real Madrid to Chelsea, he was flaming with confidence.\n\nMorata had previously played the role of a super substitute for Real Madrid, where he Kareem Benzema a run for the first striker position.s\n\nAcquired for 58 million pounds, many expected him to slot into Antonio Conte\u2019s team and steadily pull of the goals.\n\nHis calm demeanor was also expected to introduce some calm forward, particularly after the unpredictably aggressive Diego Costa fought with almost every Premier League defender.\n\nIndeed, Morata\u2019s first season was not as miserable.\n\nHe managed to score 15 goals in 30 starts. But after a bright start, his performances nosedived dramatically. By the second season, Morata was severely short on confidence, haunted by his extensive portfolio of big chances missed.\n\nNotably, in the second season, Morata only had five goals and was already a laughingstock at Stamford Bridge. Injuries didn\u2019t help his cause either, as the Spaniard struggled with reoccurring back issues.\n\nUltimately, Chelsea would cut their losses by shipping him on loan to Atletico Madrid.\n\nKhalid Boulahrouz\n\nKhalid Boulahrouz played a defensive position for Chelsea from 2006 \u2013 2008. Even in this short time (2 years) at Chelsea, he was loaned out to Sevilla for a year, where he made six appearances and scored no goals.\n\nDue to several issues, Khalid Boulahrouz\u2019s performance in the English Premier League was subpar.\n\nFirst of all, he struggled to adapt to the toughness and pace of the English Premier League. Secondly, he had trouble adjusting to the Chelsea team\u2019s tactical demands, which represented a significant improvement above the league he had previously played in.\n\nUltimately, he could not perform to the greatest standards because of his lack of experience playing at the highest level of European football, which revealed his flaws. Additionally, he was frequently played out of position, which prevented him from using his skill.\n\nIn all, Khalid Boulahrouz made a total of 13 appearances, scored no goals, and gave no assist. You can clearly see that Khalid Boulahrouz terribly flopped at Chelsea when put on par with his defensive counterpart, Ashley Cole, who gave several goal assists, scored 7 goals, and made 229 appearances in his stay at Chelsea.\n\nAfter his loan tenor was over in 2008, Khalid Boulahrouz was later sold off to VfB Stuttgart, where he made more appearances and scored two goals.\n\nWinston Bogarde\n\nWinston Bogarde\u2019s performance at Chelsea was a total flop because, despite his considerable talent and experience, he was unable to have an impact on the team. He struggled to make the first team and was frequently criticized for his lack of effort and dedication to the club.\n\nHis ability to get along with the other players was also lacking, and his attitude toward teamwork and training was frequently questioned.\n\nWinston Bogarde\u2019s performance at Chelsea was more like the display of a dying star. Although Winston Bogarde had played full-back for several popular clubs, which includes SVV, Sparta Rotterdam, Ajax, Milan, and Barcelona, he failed to replicate his successes at Chelsea.\n\nWinston Bogarde made a total of 9 appearances, scored no goals, and gave no goal assists in his stay at Chelsea (2000 \u2013 2004). Given his experience playing at popular clubs, the French center-back player, William Gallas, seems to be beating Winston Bogarde at his game with 12 goals in 159 appearances whilst having no prior high-grade experience at any popular clubs.\n\nIn the end, when Winston Bogarde\u2019s contract ended in 2004, he refused to accept a wage cut, which led to his eventual dismissal from the team in 2006 and his retirement from football. Now he is pursuing a managerial career at Ajax.\n\nPatrick van Aanholt\n\nDue to a lack of opportunity and playing time, Patrick van Aanholt\u2019s performance at Chelsea was a flop compared to other clubs he had played for.\n\nVan Aanholt spent five years with Chelsea but only made two appearances and had no goals or assists before being eventually loaned out four times to different clubs.\n\nDue to the presence of more seasoned players like Ashley Cole and Branislav Ivanovic, who had made over 200 appearances and had scored more than six goals, he also had trouble making an impression.\n\nVan Aanholt ultimately failed to join Chelsea\u2019s first team and left the club for Sunderland in 2014, where he made 82 appearances and scored 7 goals. After Sunderland, he furthered his career at Crystal Palace and is now in Galatasaray, where he is making significant progress.\n\nThese mentioned players clearly had potential. But somehow, we never saw enough of it at Chelsea."
