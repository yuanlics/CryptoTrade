        "content": "Ethereum has reached another milestone as the number of validators on its network now exceeds 500,000, data from BeaconScan shows.\n\nValidators are essential in guaranteeing the integrity and security of the Ethereum network. They operate by consensus to process transactions on the blockchain by verifying that the conditions specified in each transaction\u2019s smart contract code have been met.\n\nA validator must deposit 32 ETH (roughly $45,000) to run a dedicated staking node on the proof-of-stake blockchain. Today, staked funds are locked in the network, and while they accrue staking rewards from Ethereum\u2019s inflation, validators are unable to access the funds until after the Shanghai upgrade, expected to happen in March, which will allow withdrawals of staked ether for the first time.\n\nThe increase in number of active validators is a positive sign for the Ethereum ecosystem, John Jefferies, chief marketing officer at Blocknative, a real-time Web3 infrastructure company, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThe network is on the verge of reaching 500,000 active validators, pointing to increasing confidence, positive market sentiment, and conviction in the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole,\u201d Jefferies said.\n\nJefferies predicted that once the Shanghai upgrade is completed and staked ETH becomes accessible, it is likely that there will be a more liquid and free-flowing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see even more people spin up validators after Shanghai as they gain the peace of mind knowing they can unstake their ETH more fluidly,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: BeaconScan\n\nEthereum recently saw its total value stake reach 16 million ETH (over $22 billion), implying that it would be extremely difficult and costly to attack the network\u2019s consensus, Ben Edgington, a lead product owner at ConsenSys, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWe can consider the security of the Ethereum network on two axes. One is the total value staked,\u201d Edgington said. \u201cThe other is the degree of decentralization.\u201d\n\nAlthough decentralization is a little more difficult to analyze, as many validators are run by the same entities, reports show that they are spread across at least 11,400 physical nodes in 80 countries.\n\n\u201c[This] is a considerable degree of decentralization, and much more distributed than we had under proof-of-work,\u201d prior to the Merge, Edgington said. \u201cMany of these nodes are run by home stakers such as myself, underpinning the protocol with a huge degree of resilience and diversity.\u201d\n\nUpdated Jan. 12, 2022 at 7:43 pm ET: Headline and first paragraph changed to reflect that Ethereum now has more than 500,000 validators.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum unlock in March worth tens of billions of dollars - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nA massive tranche of ether (ETH) is unlocking soon. During a meeting on December 8, Ethereum developers decided to make staked ETH on Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain available for withdrawal with the Shanghai update as early as March 2023. The meeting was ratified last week.\n\nThe Beacon Chain holds $21 billion (over 15.9 million ETH) staked within Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Additional ETH is voluntarily staked into the Beacon Chain daily and cannot be withdrawn until Shanghai activates. So, by the time March arrives, the Beacon Chain will far exceed 16 million ETH.\n\nThe Shanghai update will include five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs): EIP 3540, EIP 3670, EIP 4200, EIP 4570, and EIP 5450. These proposals describe updates to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that will enable withdrawals of staked ether.\n\nEthereum 2 stakes to unlock after Shanghai allows withdrawals\n\nThe PoS Beacon Chain activated on the Ethereum mainnet with the Merge on September 15, 2022. It originally ran on a parallel blockchain and had no role in securing Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain that operated since 2015. Activating the Beacon Chain switched Ethereum to a purely PoS algorithm giving stakers a direct role in confirming transactions.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin claimed that Ethereum\u2019s switch to PoS reduced worldwide energy consumption by 0.2%. (Nic Carter contested that figure, arguing that the switch saved a de minimus amount at least lower than 0.07%.)\n\nThe enormity of this Ethereum unlock can\u2019t be overstated with only five crypto assets among thousands having a larger market cap than this tranche.\n\nCurrently, no ETH in the Beacon Chain can be sold but, subject to any withdrawal queues, Beacon Chain funds could become unrestricted for trading shortly after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s why Ethereum 2 staking is risky and increases centralization\n\nThe Merge didn\u2019t include any protocols for withdrawing staked ether from the Beacon Chain. Investors interested in staking had to choose between accepting proxy staking tokens like stETH or cbETH for depositing their ETH into a liquid staking pool. Or they could simply wait for their staked ETH to be unlocked via Shanghai.\n\nEven if a user was wealthy enough to stake the 32 ETH required to activate a solo set of validator keys, that user still wouldn\u2019t have the ability to withdraw ETH from the Beacon Chain. Since its inception, the Beacon Chain has been deposit-only.\n\nLiquid staking pools like Lido theoretically keep their \u2018staked ETH\u2019 liquid tokens pegged to ETH. Lido\u2019s Staked ETH token, stETH, typically does a fair job of staying within a few dollars of ETH\u2019s value.\n\nSharding and Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format delayed\n\nDuring their December meeting, Ethereum developers also discussed the possibility of activating EIP-3540, which would have introduced Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF). The EIP describes EOF as \u201can extensible and versioned container format for EVM bytecode.\u201d\n\nThey agreed to push it back; it seemed too complicated to be ready by March. During their January 5, 2023 meeting, Ethereum core developers agreed to remove EIP-3540 from the Shanghai update and save it for a later upgrade.\n\nProposed post-Shanghai upgrades also include sharding which will increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability by dividing up the blockchain into more manageable pieces. Ethereum developers say sharding will improve the performance of some data-extensive operations like Layer 2 rollups. One proposal, EIP-4844, will introduce proto-danksharding as a way to handle more efficient data \u2018blobs.\u2019\n\nIn summary, the Shanghai update will activate as early as March 2023. It will enable withdrawals of tens of billions of dollars worth of staked ETH from the Beacon Chain, something that Ethereum stakers have long anticipated. Time will tell how much of this Ethereum unlock will actually be withdrawn by users and offered for sale on the order books of the world\u2019s exchanges.\n\nFor more informed news, follow us on Twitter and Google News or listen to our investigative podcast Innovated: Blockchain City."

The Shanghai upgrade will introduce a code that will allow Ethereum Network validators to withdraw this staked ether.\n\nThe upgrade was originally scheduled for launch in September 2023 at the latest. It will also allow withdrawals of staked ether in the Beacon Chain since December 2020.\n\nTwitter profile CroissantEth said on 2 January: \u201cMost recently liquid staking derivatives have had a nice uptrend.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent tweet published by on-chain data vendor Santiment has offered one of the main reasons for the second largest crypto, Ethereum, to surge above the $1,400 level.\n\nHere's what has made a large contribution to Ethereum's price rise.\n\nUptick in number of ETH shark addresses\n\nOn Jan. 11, the second most popular token followed Bitcoin's bullish streak and briefly rose above the $1,400 level. Santiment team of analysts has shared that one of the major reasons behind this growth was a sharp increase in shark addresses over the past two and a half months.\n\nEthereum has reached that price level for the first time since early November.\n\nTheir tweet has it that, in the past 10 weeks, 3,000 new shark wallets emerged on the ETH network, storing from 100 to 10,000 Ethers each. Overall, the analysts have observed the highest peak of 48,556 wallets that heavy with Ether since February 2021.\n\n\ud83e\udd88 #Ethereum has jumped above $1,400 for the first time since November 7th. Over the past 10 weeks, ~3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network. 48,556 shark addresses is the highest level recorded since Feb, 2021. https://t.co/yJfTP3QhKI pic.twitter.com/4tzS0nsph9 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2023\n\nThe second reason is that Ethereum followed Bitcoin in its rise. On Jan. 11, the flagship cryptocurrency surged above the $18,000 level for the first time in a month.\n\nAs a reminder, at the start of November, Bitcoin was trading above the $21,000 level. However, a sudden crash of the FTX crypto giant and its pocket trading firm Alameda Research sent waves of shock through the crypto market. Bitcoin plunged to $15,883 and has been trading mainly in the $16,800 range since then.\n\nDOGE co-founder sells bunch of ETH\n\nAs covered by U.Today earlier, one of the two co-founders of DOGE meme token announced that he had sold \"a bunch of ETH\" at the $1,190 price mark. Billy Markus, the co-founder, also known on Twitter as Shibetoshi Nakamoto in honor of the mysterious Bitcoin creator, explained this sale, saying that he had to pay taxes for 2022.\n\nAlas, he sold the ETH just a day before the price went up above the $1,220 level.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum is sitting at $1,398 per coin, showing a nearly 5% rise in the past 24 hours."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin on eating sushi in Ukraine, how crypto can help in a crisis, and what\u2019s next for Ethereum - Fortune",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is one of the most influential people in crypto. Nine years ago, he dreamed up Ethereum as a way to leverage the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin for all sorts of uses beyond currency. Since then, it\u2019s emerged as the bedrock layer of what advocates say will be a new, open-source, decentralized internet.\n\nMeanwhile, even as the technology he invented is changing the world, Buterin has defied the stereotype of a crypto bro, focusing more on learning and ideas than on wealth and status. He recently visited Ukraine and spoke with Fortune contributor Anna Tutova, sharing his thoughts on everything from global politics to crypto\u2019s potential to help people trapped in crisis situations and war. This includes Ukraine itself, which has reportedly received over $184 million in crypto donations\u2014including $5 million from Buterin, who\u2019s denounced Russia\u2019s brutal and lawless invasion.\n\nReminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 24, 2022\n\nButerin also discussed the latest developments in the world of Ethereum, including plans to make the platform more scaleable. Here is an edited version of their conversation.\n\nAnna Tutova: Can you tell more about your trip to Kyiv? How did you like it? How was the conference?\n\nVitalik Buterin: The trip to Kyiv itself was fascinating because I normally go to places by airplane and it\u2019s just fairly fast and convenient. The airplanes are not landing in Ukraine while the war is going on. I came in by train from Warsaw, and that was this big, long 18-hour train ride, though it was also the most comfortable 18-hour train ride I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nWe stayed at a hotel in the middle of town. I got a chance to see different parts of the city that day and the morning of the next day as well. Then I had a meeting with the vice prime minister of Ukraine and attended the Kyiv Tech Summit. I think one of the reasons I wanted to go was just I really wanted to see what kinds of things people would actually be working on in a tech summit in the middle of the war, what people would say, what kind of things people would be up to.\n\nI got a chance to talk to some of the hackers. It was a small group, but it was definitely a very dedicated and devout group, there were people who were working on blockchain-based projects trying to do identity for refugees or cryptocurrency-based applications, etc. On a panel with government officials, we held some interesting discussions on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and how all of these different ideas could be valuable to Ukraine. It was not a large event, but it still felt like a very high-quality event. I thought it was a great community.\n\nVitalik Buterin in Ukraine. Vitalik Buterin/Anna Tutova\n\nAT: Can you tell more which projects you liked there? What type of projects do you think are needed during this time of the war?\n\nVB: People told me that cryptocurrency was very valuable as a way for the governments to get resources and supplies that they very urgently needed in the first couple of weeks when the war started, when none of the other financial systems was working and the foreign governments had not started bringing in supplies yet. And cryptocurrency continues to be important to a lot of the different groups, just as a form of fundraising and as a way of moving money to people.\n\nAside from cryptocurrency as money, I think digital identity applications are interesting. Because there are a lot of refugees who obviously left quickly without a lot of things, and they need some kind of a way to interact with the economy to prove that they are trustworthy, to prove something about themselves, so that people would be willing to work with them and to be able to give aid and goods and services to them. And it was interesting to see that people were starting to use pretty advanced ideas around zero-knowledge (ZK) stuff that I had been talking about for the last one to two years. There was also an interesting project to integrate the Ukrainian digital ID. And there was one group that was trying to create an integration between all of that into a Gitcoin passport.\n\nAT: How did you like Kyiv?\n\nVB: Kyiv was surprisingly easy as it looked like a normal European city. The government\u2019s areas were definitely very militarized\u2014there were some soldiers. And there were a lot of posters such as, \u201cBe brave like Ukraine.\u201d But aside from that it just seemed like people were going about their lives and going for groceries, going to restaurants, doing all the normal things. And one of the ways that people described it to me, it was almost just the act of continuing to live a normal life in the middle of invasion.\n\nThe food was great. One of the best sushi restaurants I\u2019ve ever been to was the one in Kyiv. It was called Ikigai. And aside from that, we just had all kinds of food, some Ukrainian, some vegan-friendly, Georgian places. I was impressed. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to coming back next time for longer.\n\nAT: It sounds like you had a great trip. Was it scary for you when you were in Ukraine because of the war?\n\nVB: I definitely did not know what to expect. I\u2019m obviously following things on the Internet and on Twitter. I do theoretically know that Kyiv is about 450 kilometers away from the front line at this point. But at the same time, I did not know what to expect. So, are there going to be some kind of missile attacks? Like what would Ukrainian security itself look like? And just all kinds of very unknown, unknown things. But, in general, it ended up just being more normal in a lot of ways than I expected.\n\nAT: How do you generally see the development of the crypto industry in Ukraine? You travel quite a lot, you see different countries, different jurisdictions. On which level is crypto in Ukraine?\n\nVB: So, the Ukrainian crypto community in general is definitely strong. Even a lot of these projects that are known internationally to us, some of their founders are Ukrainian. I think NEAR Protocol is obviously a good example there.\n\nThe Ethereum foundation has a couple of Ukrainians. And a lot of just very good and very smart developers. And the other thing, which is interesting and unique, is the extent to which the government is very willing to participate in this space and try to be very active and forward-thinking.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of a trip to Estonia that I had about five years ago. Talking to the governments felt like talking to a startup. And Ukraine really gave me a very similar feeling. Also, I\u2019ve been to Montenegro recently, even the governments there are trying to pass the blockchain law and try to be as blockchain friendly as possible. It seems like Eastern Europe is definitely a place where people really want to do things and the very active involvement of people in institutions and the government is interesting.\n\nOne contrast might be Latin America. I\u2019ve also been very impressed by the crypto community, especially Argentina and Brazil. I was just on the east of Mexico about a month ago. And in that case, you definitely don\u2019t see as much government attention.\n\nAT: Let\u2019s talk about Ethereum stuff. You recently achieved a big milestone, the Ethereum Merge, the transition from energy consuming proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, but let\u2019s start with a more general question: How did you get into crypto?\n\nVB: I first got into crypto back in 2011. I heard about Bitcoin on the internet. I heard about Bitcoin again from my dad, and I thought this is interesting. I went on the Bitcoin Forum and I started looking for people that would be willing to give me jobs that pay Bitcoin, and I found someone who was willing to pay five Bitcoins\u2014which back then was $4\u2014for every article that I would write for his blog. I started writing articles, and so I started my Bitcoin career as a writer. I did the Bitcoin magazine for two years.\n\nIn 2013, I dropped out of university and became a Bitcoin person full time. I also started my nomad adventure then\u2014what I thought would just be a six-month trip around the world to explore all of the different Bitcoin communities. But then around the end of the trip I came up with the idea for Ethereum, and from then the trip just kept on getting more and more extended. And so, I\u2019ve been sort of on the go about nine years now. But, I came up with the idea for theory after seeing some of the other ideas that other people had.\n\nPeople in Israel, for example, would try to use the Bitcoin blockchain to do things other than just a Bitcoin currency. And I felt the idea was very interesting. I wanted to make an even-more-powerful and more-general-purpose version that people could build any applications on. So, I started Ethereum, and then the project just kept on growing.\n\nAT: So what are your next steps to improve Ethereum scalability, and what are your next milestones?\n\nVB: So Ethereum\u2019s roadmap for scaling is this approach that we call a rollup-centric roadmap. It\u2019s like a hybrid between the Bitcoin-like roadmap, where they basically say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change Layer-1. Layer-1 is what it is going to be. But we are going to build second-layer things on top.\u201d So, with Bitcoin there is the Lightning network, and we\u2019re basically trying to scale entirely through these Layer-2 things that plug into Layer-1, but that work differently, so they have more scalability. This is versus a more EOS or Solana kind of approach to scale, which is basically focused on keeping everyone on Layer-1, but making the Layer-1 itself as powerful as possible.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want the network to become centralized, but people also understand the need for functionality. So, this rollup-centric roadmap makes some improvements to Layer-1 to make it possible to build these Layer-2 protocols that can support many more transactions. And then it\u2019s up to the Layer-2 protocols to actually build the thing that supports those transactions. There are already a lot of these platforms: Optimism, Arbitrum, Scroll, Starkware, zkSync. As well Polygon, which started as a kind of more trusted and a little bit more centralized sidechain thing, but they hired these very good zero-knowledge teams and they\u2019re on their way to becoming more like a rollup themselves.\n\nAT: So, you mentioned a lot of zkEVM rollups and different Layer-2 solutions. What are your thoughts on zero-knowledge proofs and zkEVMS?\n\nVB: ZK proofs as a technology are going to be as important as blockchains. I think, obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are really powerful in their ability to add privacy and add scalability to our blockchain applications. And the two technologies are very complementary. Because blockchains give you things like censorship resistance and a guarantee that rules are being followed, something like a smart contract. But in order to get those guarantees, blockchains sacrifice scalability, and they really sacrifice privacy. By default, you have basically no privacy on a blockchain. But then zero-knowledge proofs let you keep the censorship resistance and keep the guarantee that rules are being followed, but you get back scalability and you get back privacy. At some point, we are going to get to a world where we can just start adding ZK proofs to everything.\n\nAT: I noticed that you support Scroll quite a lot.\n\nVB: Yeah, they have a great team, great people, they\u2019ve been working hard at making zkEVM possible. I think other teams are great too\u2014the Starkware team has been working at this longer than everyone else, and I also have to thank them for just teaching me a lot of the math behind how zk-SNARKS work. They contributed a lot to the development of the whole space, and they\u2019re also working on Cairo, which is their own programming language for Starks.\n\nAnd there are projects, which are on top of Cairo, that are also making zkEVMs\u2014ImmutableX and some of the products they\u2019re building. In a lot of cases, there are very good compromises between decentralization and a kind of centralization that might be needed to make applications more efficient for the short term. I basically think that the Starkware idea of validiums would obviously be probably a better thing for institutions to be using than the private blockchains that everyone was excited about five years ago. So they\u2019re doing lots of great stuff. The Polygon team contributed a lot and their zkEVM development is great as well. The Loopring team as well had zkEVM rollups running years ago, when no one else did. I\u2019m very happy with the kind of community that we\u2019ve built.\n\nAnna Tutova is the CEO of Coinstelegram, a crypto media and public relations firm."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), gained 10.2% from Jan. 4 to Jan. 10, breaching the $1,300 resistance without much effort. But has the Ether price move cast a light on whether the altcoin is ready to begin a new uptrend?\n\nWill Ether\u2019s former resistance level turn to support?\n\nAfter testing the $1,200 support on Jan. 1, the eight-week ascending channel has displayed strength, but Ether bulls fear that negative newsflow might break the pattern to the downside.\n\nEETH/USD price index, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite the positive price trend, the sentiment around Ether and other cryptocurrencies hasn\u2019t been very enticing. For example, Xiao Yi, the former Chinese Communist Party secretary of Fuzhou, confessed on Jan. 8 to \u201cacting recklessly\u201d in support of crypto mining. Xiao spoke from what appeared to be a prison, apologizing for causing \u201cgrave losses\u201d to the Fuzhou region.\n\nOn Jan. 10, South Korean tax agents reportedly raided crypto exchange Bithumb\u2019s offices to explore a potential tax evasion case. On Dec. 30, Park Mo \u2014 an executive at Bithumb\u2019s parent company \u2014 was found dead, though he was under investigation for embezzlement and stock price manipulation.\n\nAlso on Jan. 10, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini exchange, issued an open letter to Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group. In the letter, Winklevoss makes some serious fraud accusations and requests that the Grayscale fund management holding company dismiss Silbert to provide a resolution for Gemini\u2019s Earn users.\n\nThe ongoing crypto winter left another scar on Jan. 10 as the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, announced a second round of layoffs, impacting 20% of the workforce.\n\nHowever, the exchange\u2019s CEO, Brian Armstrong, tried to minimize the damage by stating that Coinbase remains \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and tranquilize investors with business-as-usual messages.\n\nConsequently, some investors believe Ether could revisit prices below $600 as fear remains the prevalent sentiment. For instance, trader Crypto Tony expects the current triangle formation to cause another \u201cleg down later this year.\u201d\n\n$ETH / $USD - Update\n\n\n\nUnless we take out $2,200 on the macro level I am treating this as consolidation for a B or X wave, before we get one more leg down later this year\n\n\n\nVolume is contracting and I also expect this to dwindle down lower. Pay attention pic.twitter.com/LTik7GXEYa \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 10, 2023\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the bearish newsflow has caused traders to avoid leverage longs and neutral-to-bullish option strategies.\n\nLeveraged bulls lagged the recent rally\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe two-month futures annualized premium should trade between +4% and +8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. When the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers, which is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart above shows that derivatives traders using futures contracts exited the negative premium on Jan. 1, meaning the extreme bearish sentiment is gone. However, the current 1.5% premium remains below the 4% threshold for a neutral market. Still, the absence of leverage buyers\u2019 demand does not mean traders expect a sudden market downturn.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand whether investors are effectively pricing in odds of a $600 retest.\n\nOptions traders have stopped overcharging for downside protection\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew currently sits at 11% after flirting with the neutral range on Jan. 9, meaning that whales and market makers no longer charge excessive premiums for protective put options. That is a stark contrast from late 2022 when those trades were running up to 19% more costly than equivalent bullish strategies using options.\n\nRelated: Navigating the crypto crash can be challenging, but there are tools to help you in 2023\n\nOverall, both options and futures markets point to pro traders becoming more confident and increasing the odds of $1,300 becoming a support level. So, even if the newsflow doesn\u2019t seem appealing, traders are unwilling to add bearish bets, which might fuel further positive momentum for Ether.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Bullish Targets for Bitcoin and One Ethereum Competitor \u2013 But There\u2019s a Catch - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is setting bullish price targets on Bitcoin (BTC) and the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Aptos (APT) but warns prices may dip first.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 188,400 Twitter followers that Bitcoin will soon hit the $19,000 price range.\n\nThe king crypto is rallying in recent days. At time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $18,182.\n\n\u201cBTC: Eventually I think that $19,000 is the area that price will go to, just don\u2019t know if we dip first or not. I think we fill this gap out a bit and there\u2019s more liquidity higher than current price.\u201d\n\nNext, he says Aptos could surge by more than 31% if Bitcoin continues to rally.\n\n\u201cAPT: Targeting $7 to fill this gap overall as long as BTC plays nice.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Aptos is changing hands at $5.33.\n\nHe also warns that while the crypto market has been rallying in recent days the bottom is likely not in. However, he says there are opportunities to turn profits with the price action.\n\n\u201c[In my opinion] it\u2019s unlikely this is the bottom, there\u2019s still probably more pain to come. With that said, there are still opportunities like the ones we have had the last few weeks \u2013 enjoy these times because it could be a while before we get another mini alt run like this one.\n\nIn other words, make the absolute most of these short altcoin runs where they go 25%-2x+. Hop on the narrative quickly, cross the spread, be aggressive. The next time this happens could be months away and we could just be back within that small trading range.\n\n2018 and 2019 were both years for altcoin trading (alt/BTC pairs, which was primary back then). Lots of chop happened and I expect a lot of the same for 2023 \u2013 lots of chop to come. With that said, we\u2019re still going to see a lot of these mini alt runs here and there.\u201d\n\nSherpa also analyzes the liquidity network platform WOO Network (WOO), saying it could drop down to $0.14 if Bitcoin starts to fall.\n\n\u201cLots of talk about this one lately on CT [crypto Twitter], it\u2019s one of my long-term holds. Was in this one since the beginning and just hold it at this point. 200-day EMA [exponential moving average] acting as resistance initially (normal), if looking to bid this, would aim for $0.15 and $0.14 if BTC dips.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, WOO is valued at $0.165.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum: Over 16 million ETH Staked as Shanghai Update nears - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto project by market cap, has achieved another milestone. The project has crossed 16 million staked ETH, four months after its historic transition to a PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism.\n\nAccording to Etherscan.io, more than 16 million ether (ETH) has been put into the Beacon Chain staking contract on Ethereum. The 16 million ETH is worth around $22.38 billion at the current rates. Moreover, it represents more than 13.28% of the whole ether supply. The latest milestone is almost two years after Ethereum\u2019s staking contract went live in 2020.\n\nValidators stake their Ether (ETH) for a chance to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. Validators cannot takeout their staked ETH until the upcoming Shanghai update. The Shanghai update will likely take place in late February.\n\nThe increasing number of staked ETH is a sign that the network\u2019s security is robust, and adoption is strong.\n\nTheoretically, it should be more difficult for a single player to sabotage the Ethereum chain with a higher amount of staked ETH. However, a handful of significant actors presently own most of Ethereum\u2019s stake, raising worries that the chain\u2019s management is becoming overly centralized.\n\nData from Nansen suggests that there are around 92,500 distinct staking depositors, while BeaconScan shows that there are approximately 498,000 active validators.\n\nThere is a growing concern among many investors that there might be a sell-off of ETH after the Shanghai update. The update will allow the now over 16 million ETH to be withdrawn. This could lead to many wanting to sell their holdings.\n\nHowever, there are other things to consider. Firstly, a majority of the staked ETH is currently at a loss. According to Dune, 71.7% of the staked ETH is underwater, and only 28.3% is in the money.\n\nSource: Dune\n\nUnder such circumstances, an investor is unlikely to sell their holdings. Instead, they might prefer to continue staking their ETH and earning rewards.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,401.25, up by 5.3% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Ethereum is a platform that provides comprehensive trading mechanisms, oracles, and smart contracts. Websites like the Ethereum Code app cater their UI and strategies for experienced and new bitcoin traders. The platform has paid extraordinary attention to detail while designing its user interface. The below-mentioned portion will focus on how it works and the power of its blockchain to redefine value chains and transform the global finance industry.\n\nBlockchain technology has progressed exponentially at an unbelievable rate over the past few years, with Bitcoin being the first application of blockchain usage. Ethereum came into play in response to bitcoin\u2019s inability to process transactions without fees.\n\nWhen running on Ethereum, the dApps developers are not limited to functions that a conventional blockchain such as bitcoin can offer. For example, rather than being limited to only processing payments, Ethereum allows developers to create intelligent contracts supporting applications such as supply chain tracking.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply chain management\n\nSupply chains are a core part of the global economy, and their growth and expansion require networks that ensure fast information flow in real time for all involved parties. Supply chains can be found in almost every industry, from manufacturing to logistics and everything in between. Blockchain technology can completely revolutionize supply chains by making them more efficient while reducing costs and increasing trust between stakeholders.\n\nBuilding decentralized apps\n\nDecentralized apps (DAPPs) are the most successful use case of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike conventional apps, which depend on an app store, a mobile app store, or another centralized service, they can be created and hosted in the blockchain. Many of these applications have resulted in increased cooperation between people, contract automation, and trust among parties involved in a transaction.\n\nThe value chain is just a transfer chain\n\nThe single-asset blockchain (also known as the supply chain blockchain) can track any transaction without ever having to trust any third-party intermediary. This direct flow of data within the blockchain is known as a \u201ctransaction chain, and if one entity within the chain would be able to become corrupted, then malicious actors could potentially steal or manipulate the chain also. As a result, it can lead to a loss of trust and reliability in an organization.\n\nBehind Ethereum\u2019s blockchain\n\nEthereum offers an open, general, public blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications with various scripting languages, databases, and utilities. In addition, the customized blockchains can run complex, intelligent contracts, and formal verification techniques.\n\nDecentralized world\n\nAlthough Ethereum has limited bandwidth compared to the general mass market, people can use blockchain-powered platforms for big-scale web hosting services. Companies can achieve it by adding more nodes into the network, which helps improve the efficiency at which transactions are processed. However, it will also require infrastructures of transaction processing nodes that provide power and storage of blockchain data.\n\nProof of stakes\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that uses the resources of validators in the system. Validators are smart contracts that enable stakeholders to enforce the system\u2019s integrity through delegation. Therefore, unlike other proof methods such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), PoS allows for micropayments, which can be generated by validators and delegated to any pre-configured user.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s most significant advantage is that it has a very active community that assists in improving the dApps they compile. Another benefit is the ease with which brands can build decentralized apps on top of its platform. Ethereum\u2019s architecture allows for constant growth and development of its blockchain to improve functionality and create a safer platform.\n\nIn the future, it will continue to inspire innovation through its applications and other platforms built on top of its open-source codebase. For example, Microsoft Azure has built on the ethereum blockchain to provide alternative authentication factors for user access.\n\nBut despite all of these benefits, there are some things to be aware of before utilizing dApps that Ethereum powers. For example, it\u2019s easy for a developer to make a mistake in the coding or for a malicious actor to exploit it to own those intelligent contracts.\n\nPossible threats & vulnerabilities\n\nThe biggest problem with any blockchain is that it is public and has no central points of vulnerability. However, it is essential to note that the algorithms that run on top of the blockchain are vulnerable.\n\nIn this case, the code must be flawless, and there should be no holes in it that could allow hackers to steal users\u2019 private information or other assets. Unfortunately, Ethereum is not immune to these problems, and there have been instances where malicious actors exploited vulnerabilities, resulting in losses for users who transacted with such dApps."

        "title": "Digital Currency Group in spotlight over fishy transfers - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nDCG: End of empire? Lido DAO: Energized by Ethereum Hong Kong: Crypto mojo\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, It\u2019s often said that good things come in threes. Developments in the cryptocurrency industry in the past few days suggest that the reverse may also be true. The murky goings-on around Barry Silbert-led crypto empire Digital Currency Group (DCG) may not have attained FTX- or Terra-like levels of gut-wrenching awfulness \u2014 at least not at the time of writing. But the news that U.S. federal prosecutors are digging into transfers between DCG and one of its subsidiaries may presage a third nausea-inducing twist in the shakeout that has convulsed the crypto industry in recent times. If there\u2019s a bright spot amid the potential for another big crypto collapse, it\u2019s that authorities appear to have been paying attention to possible problems at DCG for at least two months \u2014 crucially, before the implosion of FTX. One can only hope that justice, should its application be required, be served swiftly and that crypto investors are spared yet more undue suffering. Meanwhile, proof of the endurance of the digital asset industry continues to emerge, even amid its numerous recent woes \u2014 this time in the form of another eagerly-awaited Ethereum upgrade. The Shanghai hard fork, as it\u2019s known, promises to address concerns among investors staking ETH over whether they can withdraw their assets, and it has prompted a spike in interest in ETH-linked products and services as well as sharp price upticks for a number of tokens. And in good news for a city that has needed some for a while, financial authorities in Hong Kong have reiterated their determination to reclaim ground lost to other jurisdictions \u2014 chiefly Singapore \u2014 in the crypto hub rankings. Hong Kong has a long history of picking winners, despite the privations inflicted on the city and its people in recent years, and its bet on digital assets is not on a whim. We welcome more of that confidence as the industry works through its issues. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Here we go again?\n\nDigital Currency Group has been on the radar of U.S. authorities since the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital last year. Image: DCG website/Canva\n\nBy the numbers: DCG \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nCrypto-focused conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG) is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over questionable transfers between DCG and a subsidiary, according to a Bloomberg report that cited unnamed sources.\n\nAlthough authorities haven\u2019t made any accusations of wrongdoing, the investigations come a week after DCG reportedly shut down a wealth management subsidiary named HQ.\n\nDCG, among the largest companies in the cryptocurrency space, owns crypto lender Genesis Global Trading, digital currency asset management giant Grayscale, crypto news outlet CoinDesk, and Foundry, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nDCG has been in the spotlight over debt issues stemming from the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital last year.\n\nDCG chief executive Barry Silbert got into a Twitter spat with crypto exchange Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss last week over claims that DCG had borrowed US$1.675 billion from Genesis that it hadn\u2019t repaid, which Winklevoss said had led to Gemini users having hundreds of millions of dollars in assets frozen at Genesis.\n\nIn an open letter posted on Twitter last Monday, Winklevoss wrote that Genesis owed Gemini users US$900 million and claimed that the funds had been frozen by Genesis because it lacked liquidity due to DCG\u2019s failure to repay the loan.\n\nSilbert responded: \u201cDCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis\u201d and added that \u201cDCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to shareholders in November, DCG said it had taken out a US$575 million loan from Genesis and that it owed Genesis a US$1.1 billion promissory note to cover a liquidity crunch due to exposure to Three Arrows Capital.\n\nGenesis paused withdrawals on Nov. 16 due to \u201cabnormal withdrawal requests\u201d while revealing that it had US$175 million locked up in the bankrupt exchange FTX.\n\nGemini also halted withdrawals of its interest-bearing Earn program, which used Genesis as a trading partner. Last month, investors filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for alleged fraud and violations of securities laws.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The crypto contagion is still spreading. Although much of the focus of the DCG story has been the very public spat between two of the crypto industry\u2019s most Wall Street-friendly companies \u2014 and leaders \u2014 one key development is that authorities have stepped in quickly. According to Bloomberg, U.S. authorities have been looking into the practices of DCG since before the collapse of FTX. And even though no formal accusations of wrongdoing have (yet) been made, it\u2019s heartening to know that regulators are becoming more active in the crypto industry and holding participants that break the law to account. But perhaps the biggest takeaway from the saga is how one of crypto\u2019s founding ideals appears to be faltering. \u201cWAGMI,\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re all going to make it,\u201d has been a maxim and rallying cry among crypto believers for years. It also became a slogan for a group of crypto enthusiasts that bought the English Football League club Crawley Town. More recently, the FTX collapse has led some companies in the sector to turn against one another for advantage and survival. For instance, Binance\u2019s decision to call out FTX and dump the assets it held in FTX \u2014 a company it had previously nurtured \u2014 played a critical role in the now-defunct exchange\u2019s implosion. As the Crypto Winter stubbornly refuses to thaw, expect the nastiness to continue.\n\n2. Upgrade uptick\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai hard fork is lifting the fortunes of Lido DAO. Image: Lido/Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Lido DAO \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nLiquidity staking protocol Lido DAO (LDO) has surged over 50% over the past week ahead of an Ethereum upgrade that is expected to enable Ether stakers to withdraw their assets and resolve other risks related to ETH. The upgrade, named the Shanghai hard fork, is expected to be implemented by March.\n\nLido DAO provides rewards to ETH stakers by pegging Lido Staked ETH (stETH) to the value of the assets they locked into smart contracts. Lido is currently the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, with US$6.6 billion in total value locked, according to DefiLlama.\n\nBlockchain platform BitDAO (BIT) has rallied 13.7% during the same period following a proposal approved by the BitDAO community last week that approved a buyback of US$100 million worth of BIT in USDT for supply maintenance. The 50-day, US$2 million per day buyback started on Jan. 1.\n\nBitDAO is an Ethereum-based DAO that enables BIT holders to vote on proposals related to investment decisions in the DeFi space. It is backed by crypto exchange Bybit and billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.\n\nThe Shanghai hard fork will enable Ether stakers to withdraw their assets from the Beacon Chain, an ability they currently lack.\n\n\u201cThe risk of not knowing when they can withdraw their [staked] assets is a factor of price discount,\u201d Paik Hoon-jong, the chief operating officer of South Korea-based blockchain fintech firm DA:Ground, told Forkast in a video interview. \u201cThe announcement resolved a lot of anxiety about ETH 2.0.\u201d He added that the sense of relief had prompted many investors to look into ETH-related products and services, such as Lido.\n\nDAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, are a new form of organization that allows communities of like-minded people to work together toward a common goal and make decisions without central leadership. There are now more than 2,300 DAOs, but the vast majority are small with less than US$1 million in assets under management.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? As centralized exchanges and companies appear to be falling out of favor, DeFi has found itself once again in the ascendent. According to recent data, the total value locked in DeFi protocols has been slowly ticking up since it hit year-lows last December. Although the increase is small and just a fraction of where the DeFi market was in its heyday in November 2021, it\u2019s a welcome sign of life in a market segment that\u2019s still in the grip of the Crypto Winter. But DeFi is still a long way from replacing the role of centralized exchanges as the main conduit through which new crypto users enter the space. The user experience is cumbersome, and the lack of centralized entities to vet new tokens has made it a haven for funny business. Uniswap, one of the largest decentralized exchanges, was a hotbed of fraud, according to a recent study, with nearly 98% of all tokens listed on the platform being nothing more than scams designed to defraud investors. Poorly run centralized companies are bad, but decentralized ones with no oversight or accountability aren\u2019t any better. Developers and proponents of DeFi should take the crisis of confidence that has engulfed centralized crypto businesses as an opportunity to prove they represent a viable alternative.\n\n3. Hong Kong adds oil\n\nHong Kong\u2019s plan to grow its cryptocurrency industry stands in stark contrast to how China has tried to stamp it out. Image: Canva\n\nHong Kong is pushing ahead with the development of its Web3 industry as part of a plan to re-establish itself as a global cryptocurrency hub, despite recent high-profile crypto exchange collapses, Paul Chan, the city\u2019s financial secretary, told a forum in the city this week.\n\nHong Kong is maintaining its Web3 ambitions as rival crypto hub Singapore, spooked by the fallout created by the collapse of FTX, is backtracking on its efforts.\n\n\u201cAs certain crypto exchanges collapsed one after another, Hong Kong became a quality standing point for digital asset corporates,\u201d Chan told attendees at the POW\u2019ER Hong Kong Web3 Innovator Summit, adding that the city had a robust regulatory framework that \u201cmatches international norms and standards.\u201d\n\nChan added that in the past two months, many top technology firms had contacted city authorities to discuss setting up international headquarters or expanding their businesses to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe have recently completed the legislative work for licensing virtual asset service providers and the new measure will come into effect in June,\u201d Chan said, adding that under the new arrangements, the requirements for crypto exchanges to combat money laundering and implement investor protections would be aligned with standards for traditional financial institutions.\n\nChan said Hong Kong was also preparing to issue more licenses for crypto trading firms and planning a consultation on how retail traders could participate in digital asset trading.\n\nThe city is hosting numerous pilot projects, including some that examine cross-border uses of the e-HKD, Hong Kong\u2019s central bank digital currency, and the tokenization of government-issued green bonds, Chan added.\n\nChan\u2019s remarks come a month after Hong Kong\u2019s legislature amended a bill to include a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers that will come into effect on June 1.\n\nTwo of Asia\u2019s first exchange-traded funds tracking crypto futures debuted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last month.\n\nHong Kong authorities last October announced a plan to reposition the city as a global crypto hub and released a series of policy documents touting the benefits of blockchain."

        "content": "Ethereum, the world's most commercialised blockchain, is set to see the completion of another historic update, called the Shanghai update. As of now, people who staked Ether tokens to validate the blockchain had no way to withdraw their tokens. It is estimated that $22.38 billion (roughly Rs. 1,82,520 crore) worth of Ether tokens are currently staked on the blockchain. Around March, when the upgrade is slated to be complete, it will change the situation.\n\nThe amount of staked ETH spiked when Ethereum was preparing to switch from its power-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) module to a green alternative. That eco-friendly module is called the \u2018Proof-of-Stake' (PoS).\n\nIn PoS, blockchain validators stake their personal Ether tokens to create new blocks and verify transactions. In return, stakers get interest on their tokens.\n\nCalled the Merge, Ethereum's upgrade to PoS successfully completed in September last year.\n\nSome people will be able to withdraw ETH that have been staked since 2020, in a first opportunity to do so.\n\nAs per Blockonomi, over 15 million Ether tokens are currently staked at the network.\n\nAfter March, PoS Ethereum validators would get a choice to either keep their tokens staked or withdraw them.\n\nWhen staked ETH tokens are open to be withdrawn, it could encourage more people to become part of the network.\n\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade is due in March 2023, enabling withdrawals from the beacon chain.\n\n\n\nThis allows ETH currently staked in ETH2.0 validators to be unstaked and withdrawn.\n\n\n\nHere's Arkham's primer on Liquid Staking Derivatives, and what we can see happening on-chain :point_down: pic.twitter.com/moQG9Jjtbb \u2014 Arkham | Crypto Intelligence (@ArkhamIntel) January 10, 2023\n\nWhen the update completes, it could shake Ether's value point, which at the time of writing stands at $1,398 (roughly Rs. 1.10 lakh).\n\nEthereum developers are reportedly looking to launch a public testnet for the Shanghai update in February.\n\nThe blockchain upgrade will also bring fixes and small improvements to its infrastructure.\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

Now, Ethereum, in addition to the capabilities that Bitcoin already has, supports a smart contracts feature which enables developers to write applications on top of it just like a Google Play Store. It reached $1 in 2016 and rocketed to $1,440 in another two years. Though it retracted back to $80 during the 2018 bear market, it catapulted itself to new all-time high of $4,868 in November 2021. In terms of price per coin, Bitcoin is far ahead and while Ethereum is still being correlated to Bitcoin\u2019s price actions. However, Ethereum dominance (as a share of crypto market capitalization) is growing steadily and is currently a strong #2 at 18.3% compared to 42.5% dominance of Bitcoin."

        "content": "The Bybit crypto exchange has started a new web3 staking pool, enabling users to leverage its ethereum (ETH) staking options in time for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nIn a March 31 statement, shared with crypto.news, Bybit said it had developed a new staking product that simplifies interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nPreviously, users needed to complete eleven steps to add liquidity to Curve Finance. Per Bybit, the new product will reduce the process to three steps.\n\nThe crypto exchange also claimed that the new product could improve the annual percentage rate (APR) of ETH staking by as much as 6.5%.\n\nMoreover, Bybit says that its customers will not have to buy ETH to access the web3 staking pool as they can use BTC, USD Coin (USDC), and Tether (USDT).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Bybit_Official/status/1641289144688148482\n\nAccording to Bybit\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Ben Zhou, the company plans to roll out the new ETH staking option to coincide with Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe highly liquid and trading-integrated ETH staking pool will be rolling out around the time of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade [and] will open up many new opportunities for our users.\u201d Ben Zhou, Bybit co-founder and CEO.\n\nYou might also like: Bybit trading volumes surge amid USDC volatility\n\nShanghai upgrade to improve staked ETH usability\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a planned hard fork slated to occur by April 12, 2023. It will implement EIP-4895, allowing validators to withdraw ETH staked on the Beacon Chain from December 2020.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer that was launched in parallel to the original proof-of-work (PoW) execution layer of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade comes only months after the Merge, which combined the two layers, making Ethereum fully proof-of-stake and reducing its energy consumption by at least 99.5%.\n\nEthereum developers also expect the upgrade to improve the liquidity and usability of staked ETH (stETH), which accounts for about 14% of all ETH or 16 million tokens.\n\nIn addition to the ETH staking pool, Bybit said it would host two Shanghai upgrade-themed trading events in April. The first event, dubbed \u201cShanghai Upgrade Trading Bash,\u201d will be for Bybit\u2019s derivatives traders, and they\u2019ll have the opportunity to win part of a 450,000 USDC prize pool.\n\nThe second event, known as the \u201cSupreme Scorer 2023,\u201d will be open to all Bybit users, and they will have a chance to share in an 80,000 USDC bonus pool.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "A widely-followed crypto analyst says that the price movement of small-cap tokens suggests that the altcoin season could be underway.\n\nIn a new video, the host of the YouTube channel InvestAnswers tells his 441,000 subscribers that while small-cap altcoins are still trading 5% below their price on December 12th, the trajectory indicates potential for a big rally.\n\n\u201cHere according to this chart from Blockchaincenter.net, it looks like close to it [altcoin season]. To be in Bitcoin season, you need to be under 25. To be in altcoins, you need to be 75, but the point is it\u2019s bouncing up. Altcoin season, this chart says no, but it looks at 90 days. If you look at the last month, you could argue it could be altcoin season.\u201d\n\nThe analyst says that wallets holding the leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) are now raking in profits.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum addresses in profit [is] now at 52%, not as high as Bitcoin but still creeping up there pretty well with the rebound in the Ethereum price breaking $1,300, which is a positive for many.\u201d\n\nETH is trading for $1,402 at time of writing.\n\nThe analyst also says data from crypto insights firm Santiment indicates a surging optimism for altcoins.\n\n\u201cThe altcoin rally has rung in a very welcome new year for crypto and whether prices continue surging depends on whether traders are content with their FOMO [fear of missing out] as you saw with Bitcoin, there was some profit taking. Again alt season, who knows? A lot of people are very, very excited in the Twitterverse right now and we\u2019ll see where it goes, but we saw crazy, crazy action for many, many big names out there as well.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The mass adoption of crypto can only come if cryptocurrencies have real world use cases. Although Shiba Inu, a memecoin, may seem to be the antipathy of this, the decentralized Shiba Inu community keeps adding exciting new ways to use Shiba Inu. Chainlink\u2019s blockchain can be seen as a backbone of crypto projects that rely on oracles to keep everything accurate, safe and secure.\n\nOrbeon Protocol is disrupting traditional finance (TradFi) by offering a new way to invest in early stage businesses, and is in the final stage of presale. These diverse but important use cases are what makes me bullish on Shiba Inu, ChainLink and Orbeon Protocol for 2023.\n\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is widening access to decentralized finance\n\nHave you ever wished you could invest in businesses way before they go public on the stock market? Or have you heard of presales or IDOs in crypto but don\u2019t know how to invest? This is the problem that Orbeon Protocol is here to solve. Orbeon Protocol will carefully vet web2 and web3 startups, and then offer them to their community to invest in.\n\nThe method is unique as they allow these startups to offer equity or reward based NFTs. These NFTs are available from as low as $1 and provide access to the venture capital industry for everyday investors. This is an exciting new paradigm for DeFi (decentralized finance) that takes us one step closer to the mass adoption of crypto.\n\nThe projects native ORBN token fuels this ecosystem and grants holders various benefits from staking bonuses to governance rights and more.\n\nOrbeon Protocol finishes its final round of presale mid January, after which the price of ORBN will rise by up to 6000% according to analysts. So for the best gains, now is the time to get in on ORBN.\n\nYou can now pay for subscription services like Netflix using Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu is in many ways, a very decentralized coin and ecosystem, one of the important things in maintaining network safety, but also a boon in terms of the team spirit. The Shibarmy (aka supporters of the Shiba Inu crypto), are relentless in their development of the ecosystem. The latest bullish news is that SHIB can now be accepted as payment for Netflix, Spotify and other subscription services, using the payment gateway NOWPayments.\n\nShiba Inu can also be used to buy cars like Aston Martin and Bentley. As impressive as luxury cars may sound, the number of paying subscribers of Netflix and Spotify add up to an impressive 360 million users. This is a huge market, and if SHIB can capture some of it then this is a bullish sign for Shiba Inu and crypto in 2023.\n\nChainLink\u2019s (LINK) Decentralized Oracles Explained\n\nTo understand Chainlink, we must understand smart contracts. The Ethereum blockchain really made its mark on the world by creating smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that automatically execute the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met. Ultimately they power all Ethereum and EVM compatible chains, as well as non EVM chains like Solana.\n\nHowever, smart contracts are limited by the code inside, meaning that they cannot pull from outside sources. This becomes an issue, when for instance, someone wants a smart contract to execute at the moment a coin reaches a certain price. This is where oracles and Chainlink come in.\n\nOracles provide the outside data to the smart contracts, but what happens if an oracle is incorrect? It leads to exploits and security issues. Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles, meaning that the smart contracts do not have to rely on just one oracle but instead can use Chainlink to ensure that the data received is accurate and reliable.\n\nAs crypto continues to grow, I predict that Chainlink will become more and more vital to the world of cryptocurrency, making Chainlink, in many investors opinion, a good buy for 2023.\n\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\n\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\n\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/OrbeonProtocol\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Given its ambitions to make crypto more accessible, it is not surprising that the Function X ecosystem is more than just a blockchain. It consists of nine key components, which all focus on one goal: To decentralize all services, apps, websites, communications, and most importantly, data. The nine components are:\n\nthe public blockchain f(x)Core the transmission protocol f(x) FXTP the file storage protocol f(x) IPFS the f(x) operating system (OS) f(x)Bridge\n\nf(x)Wallet\n\nthe trading platform MarginX\n\nCryptoBnk\n\nthe f(x) token $FX\n\n\n\n1. The public blockchain f(x)Core\n\nThe f(x)Core is the core network of the entire Function X ecosystem. It provides inter-blockchain communication to connect multiple blockchains, such as BNB and Ethereum. The underlying consensus model and algorithm of f(x)Core is Proof of Stake (PoS). Its native coin is named $FX. It is also working as a hub (serving as the point of connection for all devices on a local area network) and is the first core to be launched on the Function X Network. The role of a core is to facilitate transfers between blockchains. If a blockchain connects to a core via Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC), it automatically gains access to all other blockchains that are connected to that core.\n\n2. FXTP as a replacement for HTTP\n\nFXTP is the Function X transmission protocol. It is a decentralized transmission protocol, similar to HTTP. In HTTP, the server (which is controlled by an entity) decides how (and if) the data is sent or even monitored. It can easily be hacked or blocked. With FXTP, the data is sent out and propagated to the destination based on consensus (blockchain technology) and will allow decentralization and P2P transmission of data in a distributed network.\n\n3. The file storage protocol f(x) IPFS\n\nf(x) IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) is a protocol and network designed to store data in a distributed system. A person wanting to retrieve data, such as a file, will call an identifier (hash) of the file, and IPFS combs through the other nodes and supplies it to the person.\n\n4. The f(x) Operating System (OS)\n\nThe Function X Operating System is a modified version of Android. The Android OS benefits from being open and having plenty of users. This gives room for f(X) OS to spread faster across the globe. The f(x) OS has two modes:\n\nThe common Android mode that, of course, supports all Android features; and The Blockchain mode that offers full decentralization. Even calls, browsers, apps, and messages are totally decentralized.\n\nUsers can switch easily between these two modes and third-party devices that run on the f(x) OS can connect automatically to the Function X Blockchain. The purpose of Function X OS is to allow smart hardware and IoT (Internet of Things) devices to harness the upside and potential utility of the decentralization approach. Every smart device in the Function X ecosystem can be a node and each will have its own address and private key, uniquely linked to its node name.\n\n5. The f(x)Bridge\n\nThe f(x)Bridge is a cross-chain bridging service that supports cross-chains internally (between f(x)Core and other Function X chains) as well as between other chains (e.g., between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain). Through decentralized validators, assets can be moved safely between f(x)Core and different chains. Even if two chains have different rules, governance models, and protocols, a cross-chain bridge allows the two disparate chains to be connected. This comes with high transaction speed, low transaction cost, the ability to trade assets, and other useful features.\n\n6. The f(x)Wallet\n\nThe f(x)Wallet is a non-custodial, private key-supported wallet for ERC-20, Function X tokens, and more. Digital assets can be managed, transferred, and grown with different dApps, including DeFi protocols. This wallet enables staking $FX, $PUNDIX, and other tokens. It can be downloaded here for iOS and here for Android.\n\n7. The trading platform MarginX\n\nMarginX is the first community-based on-chain DEX built on the Function X network to facilitate the trading of stock-based perpetual contracts. It runs via a multi-chain and on-chain infrastructure. By providing a platform where investors can buy, sell, and create derivative products of any financial asset, it aims to bridge the traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency world. Currently, it is only available on testnet.\n\n8. The DeFi service CryptoBnk\n\nCryptoBnk is a DeFi service that mirrors a standard savings account. The primary difference is that there are no bankers that need to be paid. This results in a higher APY. In order to earn yield on tokens, users can store them via the CryptoBnk dApp for a set amount of time in a smart contract of their choice. Rewards are earned based on how many tokens are staked.\n\n9) The f(x) Token\n\nThe $FX token is the governance token for the Function X project. It can be used to vote, as collateral, generate synthetic assets, delegate, and secure the core network. Its main use case is as a means of payment for services such as staking, vote eligibility for network upgrades, smart contract creation, and data storage as well as paying transaction fees.\n\nThe $FX coin has been available on Ethereum since 2019 and on Function X since 2021. They are fully interoperable, and users can transfer $FX in and out of both blockchains while maintaining a fixed total supply and liquidity. The governance mechanism available with Function X provides users with the opportunity to vote for token burns and additional methods of reducing the total coin supply, which reduces the risk of $FX becoming a high inflationary coin due to its staking ratio."

        "title": "What is liquid staking and how does it work? - OKX",
        "content": "Liquid staking, also known as soft staking, is a more advanced form of traditional staking that's available on many new-generation smart contract protocols. With liquid staking, users can access their locked funds for other crypto-based activities while still earning rewards from their original deposit.\n\nLiquid staking experienced massive adoption in 2022 following the boom of decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. This article will explore the concept of liquid staking, its merits and drawbacks, and the best liquid staking providers in the market.\n\nEthereum's switch to PoS\n\nThe Ethereum network is crucial to our discussion, as it ushered in a new era of financial applications. Launched in 2015 by a team of eight developers, Ethereum is an advanced version of the Bitcoin network. According to principal founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum aims to expand the use of blockchain technology beyond value transfer.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum was created to be a more open and fluid crypto project, enabling the development of other applications on its principal software. This was possible due to its integration of smart contracts \u2014 bits of computer code that can self-execute based on predefined rules. Following its success, Ethereum became the hotbed for decentralized applications (DApps) and DeFi.\n\nHowever, Ethereum was built using the same consensus mechanism as the Bitcoin network: the Proof of Work (PoW) system. The PoW mechanism promotes competition among mining nodes spread across the globe, making it highly secure and decentralized. But this resulted in slow transaction speeds and high network fees.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum's role as the facilitator of more value-added services resulted in high gas fees, slow throughput, and high energy demands.\n\nThe team officially began transitioning from a Proof of Work protocol to a Proof of Stake (PoS) in December 2020, when they launched the Beacon Chain (Ethereum 2.0). The transition process was completed two years later, in September 2022, when the Ethereum network joined the ranks of Proof of Stake blockchains. Commenting on the migration, Buterin noted that the network now consumes 99.9% less energy than its previous consensus mechanism.\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nStaking borrows from the traditional concept of a yield-bearing savings account. In a bank, customers deposit their funds into an account and earn a certain percentage for keeping it there. Meanwhile, the bank loans this money to businesses as debts through the fractional reserve system. In return, the bank earns high interest and pays the customer a little token in interest rates.\n\nHowever, staking differs from what is obtained in the traditional sense in a few ways. Crypto assets \u2014 digital assets \u2014 are used to stake instead of fiat money.\n\nAnother major difference is that users earn higher staking rewards due to the principles that bind this practice. All blockchain systems are transparent and lack a central authority, so staking protocols operate without a go-between. This way, users earn the rewards that would have been used to settle intermediaries.\n\nIn its most basic form, staking requires users to lock up their crypto assets for a particular period to secure a network. Users are rewarded with newly minted coins of the underlying network for pledging their digital currencies. Staking is fast becoming an independent industry, with over $18 billion recorded in the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum staking options\n\nThere are now several staking offerings. Each option caters to a particular preference and is geared towards optimizing their potential growth. Below, we explore the different forms of staking and their potential limitations:\n\n1) Self-staking\n\nThis involves an individual becoming a validator on the Ethereum PoS blockchain. Validators are users who stake a large amount of the network\u2019s underlying asset to verify transactions on the platform. Instead of competing, validators take turns confirming transactions, thereby reducing the network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nSelf-staking on the Ethereum network comes with a high threshold. To become a validator and be accepted into the Ethereum ecosystem, one must stake a minimum of 32 ETH. This makes self-staking a capital-intensive exercise.\n\nAnother issue with this system is that a validator\u2019s staked ETH could be grossly impacted if there is a network issue or the validator makes a mistake when working. The Ethereum network will automatically slash the validator\u2019s staked ETH by half, forcing them to buy more ETH to continue operating.\n\nAdditionally, when a validator locks in their ETH, they can only unstake or access them once the lock time frame is completed. This can significantly impact them in the short term, as they can\u2019t move their assets to another platform if needed.\n\n2) Exchange staking\n\nA less capital-intensive staking option is exchange staking. Typically, this option involves a centralized crypto exchange creating a pool where customers can deposit their assets for staking. The exchange then takes these crypto assets and deposits them in a network to become a validator.\n\nThe upside to exchange staking is that users or pool contributors can easily unstake anytime they want. This doesn't affect the exchange pool due to the large amount of staked tokens.\n\nAnother benefit is that users can stake any amount of the crypto asset they have. They don\u2019t have to meet the 32 ETH threshold imposed on self-stakers or validators. In return, these exchanges reward pool contributors daily or monthly for trusting them with their crypto assets.\n\nBut this option isn't entirely rosy. Given the centralized nature of this system, stakers are often left in the dark as to how the exchange utilizes its funds. They also trust a centralized party with their funds. Another issue is that the platform could easily be breached or folded due to insolvency, making it impossible for users to recover their assets.\n\nThe last limitation of using an exchange staking medium is that most charge a withdrawal fee when users want to remove their funds.\n\n3) Locked staking\n\nAlthough not an outright staking system, locked staking comes with many limitations. Staked assets in this system will be largely inaccessible until the staking time frame elapses. This is ideal for users who want to build up their financial discipline and don't intend to access their funds for a long period.\n\nLocked staking usually ranges between one and three months on most exchanges. Validators who staked directly on the Ethereum protocol have a longer withdrawal window than most.\n\nWhat is liquid staking?\n\nLiquid staking is the newest staking service. This staking option requires users to pledge their funds to secure the network, but it's liquid or fluid in the sense that users can still access their funds.\n\nUnlike the traditional PoS system, liquid staking involves the storage of funds in DeFi escrow accounts. This allows users to access their tokens whenever they want, as the funds are highly liquid.\n\nWith liquid staking, users can generate multiple revenue streams from their crypto assets because they can lock their assets and still access them. They can use the liquid versions of their assets on other DeFi protocols and earn more on their initial deposits.\n\nHow does liquid staking work?\n\nWhile liquid staking shares similarities with other staking options, the methods used for execution are quite different. A new generation of protocols, known as liquid staking protocols, has been developed to provide the potential for traders to grow their crypto holdings.\n\nThese protocols allow users to stake any amount of an asset and unstake them without impacting the initial deposit. This way, deposits are locked on liquid staking platforms, and users are issued a tokenized version of their crypto assets. This derivative form carries the same value and operates one-to-one with the original asset. However, they're usually pegged with a different emblem to identify them.\n\nFor instance, if a staker deposits 1 ETH into one of such liquid staking services and requests a derivative, the user will receive one stETH, with the \"st\" representing staked ETH.\n\nThese new tokens can then be transferred out of the protocol, stored elsewhere, traded, or even spent without disrupting the initial deposit. The fluidity that liquid staking services offer isn't the only thing that makes them unique. Users will earn staking rewards on their initial deposits and generate more funds from their derivative tokens simultaneously, making it a win-win situation.\n\nIf a staker wants to withdraw their initial deposit, they must return an equivalent deposit valuation to access their funds. Some liquid staking protocols charge a fee for using their platform, but the fees vary.\n\nAdvantages of liquid staking\n\nStaking introduced a new experience for coin holders, allowing anyone to put their assets to work and potentially see them grow. However, liquid staking has taken the system even further. One of the benefits of liquid staking is its mobility.\n\nLocking funds for a long period can become a bad financial decision due to the volatile nature of crypto assets. When digital currencies are locked, their valuation also changes based on the underlying asset\u2019s performance. If a bear market is in full swing, staking, in the traditional sense, could result in a loss for a user. However, with liquid staking, users can easily withdraw a tokenized version and deposit it in more income-generating systems to cover such losses.\n\nAnother benefit is the multiple income streams liquid staking affords. Stakers can easily lock their funds on one platform and use a tokenized version as collateral to get crypto-backed loans. These loans can then be deposited on higher growth accounts, thereby providing more turnover. This makes liquid staking a huge favorite among DeFi-facing users.\n\nDisadvantages of liquid staking\n\nMuch like every financial-based system, liquid staking has its downsides and risks.\n\nOne such risk is that the tokenized asset could depeg from the original staked token. This happened with the Ethereum network, where stETH traded lower than ETH. This was due to extensive use of the tokenized version, resulting in an elastic supply.\n\nAnother risk of liquid staking is that if a user loses their tokenized asset in a trade, they also lose access to their deposited funds. The only way to retrieve the earlier deposit is to make another deposit equivalent to it.\n\nWhile liquid staking is innovative, it's powered by smart contracts. Smart contracts are highly efficient; however, they can be riddled with bugs, creating a pathway for hackers to drain users\u2019 funds. If this happens, users could lose all their funds with no means of retrieving them.\n\nTop liquid staking providers\n\nLiquid staking is an advanced crypto staking service, exclusively provided by a few platforms. Below, we list some top liquid staking protocols and the assets users can stake on them.\n\n1) Lido \u2014 overall best platform for liquid staking\n\nLido Finance, Lido for short, is the most well-known liquid staking provider. The platform, launched in 2020, allows users to stake their Ether tokens without locking them up. Lido launched by providing liquid staking services for the Ethereum network but has since expanded its offerings to Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama.\n\nOn Lido, users can stake across the PoS blockchains and deploy their crypto assets in other activities. This includes accessing lending platforms, like Aave, and participating in other high-growth opportunities. Once users stake their funds, Lido presents them with a tokenized variant depicted as \"st+the asset ticker.\" Stakers can then withdraw these derivatives and use them in 27+ DeFi applications and crypto wallets.\n\nStaking rewards on Lido range from 4.8% to 15.5%. Besides offering a liquid staking service, Lido also runs a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered by its network token LDO. With the digital token, users can vote on network proposals and potentially see growth in their assets through staking.\n\nFor its liquid staking services, Lido charges a 10% fee.\n\n2) Rocket Pool \u2014 Ethereum liquid staking protocol\n\nAn alternative liquid staking service is Rocket Pool. This protocol, launched in 2016, provides a user-friendly process for users to stake their ETH tokens on its platform. Rocket Pool operates as a base layer for trustless and decentralized ETH2 staking. The platform only caters to the Ether crypto asset.\n\nNonetheless, it offers dual services for its customers. Users can either stake their ETH directly on Rocket Pool and get a tokenized version of their asset pegged as rETH or directly run a node on the Rocket Pool ecosystem.\n\nGiven its dual-service offerings, Rocket Pool rewards users separately. For those who only stake ETH in return for rETH, the Rocket Pool service rewards them with a 4.16% annualized potential reward. On the other hand, those who stake ETH while simultaneously running a node earn a fixed 6.96% annualized potential reward plus a variable RPL reward issued by the platform for securing the Ethereum network.\n\nWith Rocket Pool, node operators don't need to submit the entire 32 ETH needed to run a node before operating on the Rocket Pool space. Instead, Rocket Pool lets validators start with half, which is 16 ETH. This makes it a more cost-effective option for node operators in the Ethereum PoS protocol.\n\n3) Tempus Finance \u2014 fixed income for tokens\n\nThe next top liquid staking protocol for DeFi users is Tempus. This new generation DeFi tool makes it possible for users to earn a fixed income on their tokens. This way, users can earn a fixed amount of passive revenue from their digital assets across all the protocols they deploy them on.\n\nAccording to the Tempus team, their multi-chain solution can be deployed in three different use cases.\n\nUsers can fix their future growth on their crypto assets. They can also speculate on the rate of their future growth. They can deploy their tokenized assets into liquidity pools and earn trading fees.\n\nTempus supports most reward-giving tokens on the Ethereum and Fantom blockchains, including stETH, yvDAI, xSUSHI, and aUSDC. Meanwhile, the protocol also operates an automated market maker (AMM), making it easier to provide liquidity on tokens that provide earnings.\n\nThe protocol doesn't charge any fees for staking. However, users need to pay swap fees to provide liquidity in the AMM pools.\n\n4) Hubble Protocol \u2014 borrow against staked crypto\n\nThe hubble protocol gained traction after participating in a Solana hackathon. Since then, the new liquid staking platform has gained massive popularity.\n\nHubble protocol has become popular because of its borrowing services. Users can borrow against their crypto and use the borrowed tokens as collateral on other DeFi platforms. This way, users can multiply their staking exposure as they earn from both their initial deposits and the loans they can access. The USDH stablecoin plays a crucial role in the hubble protocol as it is used in crypto loan services.\n\nHubble supports multiple assets and enables users to deposit from different networks. The platform then provides up to 11x leverage on the collateral, which users can use to trade. This exponentially increases their potential growth from their deposits.\n\nHubble charges a 0.5% fee on loans.\n\n5) Meta Pool \u2014 liquid staking for near protocol\n\nMeta Pool caters to the Near smart contract network. The liquid staking service allows users to stake their Near assets and get stNEAR in return. stNEAR can then be used for DeFi activities in the larger Near ecosystem and its growth-aggregating system, Aurora.\n\nMeta Pool delegates users\u2019 deposits to 65+ validators who monitor the performance of the deposited assets. In return for locking up funds in the DeFi protocol, Meta Pool rewards users with a 9.76% annualized potential reward, exclusive of the staking rewards from other growth activities. If the tokenized asset is deployed on the Aurora protocol, users can also gain 9.76% in rewards.\n\nMuch like all protocols reviewed in this article, Meta Pool provides immediate unstaking for assets. However, this comes with a 0.3% charge.\n\n6) OKTC liquid staking \u2014 stake and earn OKT with ease\n\nOKTC liquid staking is a cutting-edge liquid staking solution on OKT Chain (OKTC). Provided by OKX it allows users to stake and earn OKT tokens while maintaining liquidity.\n\nIn return for staking OKT, users will receive staked OKT (stOKT), a versatile KIP-20 token that can be freely traded and utilized within the OKTC ecosystem. Additionally, users can earn swap fees by providing liquidity to OKTC Swap.\n\nReady to get started? Explore our comprehensive tutorial for detailed guidance.\n\nWhether you're an existing OKX trader or new to the platform, join us and start earning rewards with OKTC liquid staking.\n\nUsing liquid staked ETH for DeFi\n\nOne of the most viable ways users tap into the potential of liquid staking is its use in DeFi. This is largely executed through yield farming, as the pegged assets can be used in growth-generating protocols.\n\nYield farming allows users to lock up their funds and use a wrapped version of their assets elsewhere. As a result, they can use their wrapped assets as collateral to obtain crypto loans and execute trades, earning revenue both actively and passively.\n\nFinal verdict on liquid staking: an advanced staking strategy\n\nLiquid staking is a new generation system that enables users to put their assets to work and potentially see them grow. Instead of locking their funds with no access to them, liquid staking provides users with a liquid version of their assets to be used on other platforms. This makes the staking service a favorite among users, as they can easily redeem their assets anytime they want.\n\nWhile the process can bring gains, liquid staking is an advanced strategy and should only be used by advanced stakers.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs liquid staking risky?\n\nYes, liquid staking comes with risks. The tokenized version could easily depeg from the original asset or lose its value. Another issue is that users can only redeem their assets if they return the equivalent value of their initial deposit. Meanwhile, these liquid staking platforms can easily be hacked if poor security measures are in place.\n\nWhat's the difference between liquid staking and staking?\n\nThe major difference between liquid staking and staking is that the former is more liquid. Liquid stakers receive a tokenized version of deposited crypto assets, which they can use on other platforms. However, staking doesn't offer this privilege.\n\nWhat are liquid staking tokens?\n\nLiquid staking tokens are tokenized versions of users\u2019 deposits. With the initial deposits locked, users are issued liquid staking tokens, which can be transferred, traded, and used on other platforms.\n\nIs liquid staking good?\n\nLiquid staking can be a viable method of generating growth from digital assets. This staking method allows users to access their tokens while securing the network with them. However, it's better suited to advanced stakers due to its inherent complexities.\n\nIs liquidity better than staking?\n\nThis largely depends on a user\u2019s needs. Liquid staking can be a better option for experienced DeFi users. In contrast, staking is better for retail traders interested in making their idle crypto assets work for them in the long term."

        "content": "What is Ethereum what are the Benefits of using Ethereum in Blockchain Technology?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain technology platform that creates a peer-to-peer network for securely executing and verifying application code known as smart contracts. Smart contracts help participants to negotiate with one another without the need for a trusted central authority.\n\nTransaction records are immutable, verifiable, and securely distributed across the network, providing participants with complete ownership and visibility over transaction data. User-created Ethereum accounts send and receive transactions. As a cost of processing transactions on the network, a sender must sign transactions and spend Ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Merge\n\nThe Merge was completed on September 15th, 2022 06:42:42 UTC at block 15537393, transitioning Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) (PoS). The Ethereum PoS network is used by Amazon Managed Blockchain\u2019s Ethereum Mainnet nodes.\n\nThe Merge transforms Ethereum\u2019s consensus from PoW to PoS by combining the Ethereum Mainnet and the Beacon Chain Proof of Stake system. This upgrade improved Ethereum\u2019s sustainability by reducing energy consumption. And it was part of the Ethereum foundation\u2019s ongoing upgrades to improve security, scalability, and sustainability, as described here.\n\nThe Advantages of Building on Ethereum\n\nUsing the native Solidity scripting language and Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum provide an extremely flexible platform for developing decentralised applications. Decentralized application developers who use Ethereum to deploy smart contracts benefit from the rich ecosystem of developer tooling and established best practices that have come with the protocol\u2019s maturity.\n\nThis maturity extends to the quality of user experience for the average user of Ethereum applications, with wallets such as MetaMask, Argent, Rainbow, and others providing simple interfaces for interacting with the help of the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts deployed there.\n\nThe large user base of Ethereum encourages developers to deploy their applications on the network, further cementing Ethereum as the primary home for decentralised applications such as Defi and NFTs.\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 protocol, which is currently in development, will provide a more scalable network on which to build decentralised applications that require higher transaction throughput in the future.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Stader, a multi-chain, non-custodial liquid staking protocol with ~100mn $+ in TVL, will soon launch its liquid staking token, ETHx. Stader released its Litepaper for ETHx highlighting how ETHx will boost home stakers, with the lowest bonding requirement in the ecosystem of just 4 ETH and also deliver best-in-class staking yield and DeFi for users.\n\nThe Ethereum staking ecosystem is mature with multiple protocols and entities providing services, however, an evaluation of the current state of Ethereum staking highlights some key challenges:\n\nHigh concentration of ETH staked with few entities:\n\nTop 3 entities having over 50% of ETH staked through them. A top liquid staking protocol that has nearly 90% market share and works exclusively with permissioned node operators.\n\nLiquid Staking Deposit (LSD) protocols that work with permissionless node operations have struggled to keep up with user demand.\n\nBeyond the top protocol, LSDs have yet to achieve meaningful acceptance in the DeFi space.\n\nStader\u2019s ETHx has been thoughtfully designed to address these challenges:\n\nHome stakers will be the backbone of ETHx with only 4 ETH required for bonding: Stader did an extensive data analysis in collaboration with SSV on the bond requirement and concluded 4 ETH is sufficient to cover key tail risks that impact staked funds.\n\nScalability and Resilience: ETHx will have a multi-pool architecture that includes permissionless and permissioned pools solving for decentralization and scalability at the same time. In the future, ETHx will also support a dedicated Distributed validator technology (DVT) pool that will improve node operator resilience.\n\nBest-in-class staking yield to users with exposure to staking rewards, MEV and tips at a competitive commission of 10% (to be shared equally between node operators and Stader).\n\nFull fledged DeFi, leveraging Stader\u2019s expertise from building DeFi ecosystems for its liquid tokens across 6 chains.

        "content": "BTC/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source \u2013 TradingView)\n\nLooking at the Bitcoin 1-Hour chart, the analysis shows that Bitcoin has been trading above the 200-day MA and the 50-day MA. It means that we are now experiencing an introduction to the bull reign. And the 50-day MA is over the 200-day and the distance between the two moving averages is wide, which are good signs for a bull run.\n\nThe resistance of BTC lies at $17550.46 and $17597.18, while the support is at the previous strong low, $16889.01. Moreover, there is an order block placed around $17222.60 and $17139.74, whereas buyers are waiting for a reversal miracle to happen. The RSI of Bitcoin is positioned at 62 which is a strong area, so we can expect a price reversal at an RSI level of 70.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source \u2013 TradingView)\n\nAnother major cryptocurrency in the market, Ethereum has been positively fluctuating since the start of 2023. Moreover, the RSI of Ethereum is at 57.24. Seeing the price trading closely above the 50-day MA indicates that we can expect a sideways market for a while. It is more advisable to wait for a certain breakout to one side of the channel and take the trade to achieve a better risk-to-reward ratio.\n\nThe price is also above 200-day MA since the bulls can reverse the price from the downtrend. The bearish scenario is likely to happen if Ethereum breaks the lower trendline of the rising wedge. If so, we can expect Ethereum\u2019s bearish price will be $1,270. Another possible scenario is that Ethereum\u2019s price can reach $1,380.\n\nHowever, investors need to look out for the Consumer Price Index data which will be released tomorrow, January 12, 2023, for more liquidity pull and rugs.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Circle's Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) has grown in popularity on Ethereum since the collapse of FTX. USDC's ERC-20 variant now frequently reaches daily transfer volumes four to five times that recorded by major competitor Tether (USDT) on the network according to data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the total market cap of USDT being $23 billion greater than USDC. As of Jan. 10, the difference was in USDC\u2019s favor by a margin of four and a half times.\n\nBoth stablecoins recorded surges in transfer volumes following an infamous tweet from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on Nov. 6 announcing Binance would liquidate its entire FTX Token (FTT) holdings. FTX went into bankruptcy soon after.\n\nSince then, USDC has been the preferred choice for crypto users, averaging over $12.5 billion more in transfer volume per day than USDT on Ethereum, according to Glassnode data.\n\nTotal transfer volumes for USDC (In blue) and USDT (In green) from Oct. 8, 2022, to Jan. 10, 2023. Source: Glassnode.\n\nIt is worth noting however, most of USDT's total trading volume seems to be hosted on other networks, as the asset's total 24-hour trading volume hovered around $25 billion on Jan. 10, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhile each stablecoin is designed to trade as close to one U.S. dollar as possible and is backed by reserves held by its issuers, USDC is regarded by some in the crypto community as a potentially safer option.\n\nSupporters point to USDC\u2019s assets, which are backed by cash or short-term United States treasuries and its monthly audits by global accounting firm Grant Thornton.\n\nTether has faced criticism over several years for not providing a proper audit and being less transparent about its reserves.\n\nThe company behind USDT was fined $41 million in October 2021 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which accused it of only holding sufficient reserves 27.6% of the time between 2016 and 2018 despite claiming its tokens were fully backed by fiat currencies.\n\nTether has been reducing the commercial paper backing its issued tokens in favor of safer alternatives, with the latest asset breakdown on Nov. 10 shows that nearly $46 billion of its reserves consist of cash, bank deposits and U.S. treasuries.\n\nRelated: Crypto.com delists USDT for Canadian users following OSC ban\n\nUSDT briefly lost its peg to the U.S. dollar following the FTX collapse amid fears of exposure to Alameda Research and FTX, which Tether denied.\n\nOn-chain evidence suggests the two firms were attempting to short the stablecoin.\n\nUSDT had been recording transfer volumes much higher than USDCs up until May 2021, after Tether had increased the supply of the token from $8.79 billion to $61.82 billion in the previous year, representing an increase of 603%.\n\nMarket cap of USDT from May 2018 to January 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite the subsequent change in consumer preferences, Tether had referred to the growth in market capitalization as an indication of \u201cthe market\u2019s continued trust and confidence in Tether.\u201d It noted every token could be redeemed for U.S. dollars on a 1:1 basis.\n\nUpdate Jan. 12, 9:30 am UTC: Amended the article to clarify that the data only reflected ERC-20 transaction volumes and not those on other chains"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAfter an epic battle for control at the beginning of January, Bitcoin bulls managed to topple bears this week, with the price soaring past $18,000 on Dec 12 for the first time since mid-December.\n\nAt press time, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by traded volume was exchanging hands at $18,687 after a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Earlier in the day, the price rose as high as $18,780, marking the sixth consecutive day for the asset to print a bullish candle.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nFor most of the day, the crypto market remained green, with Ethereum adding roughly 6% to tap a two-month high of $1,400. On the other hand, Cardano, Solana and XRP traded mostly sideways, adding about 5% each.\n\nAvalanche was the biggest gainer among the top 20 coins by market capitalization, adding 21.11% in the past day. On Wednesday, the network partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale blockchain services for businesses and governments. Overall, the global crypto market cap rose by 4.78% to tap $900 Billion, marking the largest single-day push this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s impressive ascent over the past seven days has been attributed to a return of big social dominance spikes as the asset\u2019s plunge offers extremely discounted prices. After being kept at bay by poor market liquidity towards the end of 2022, onchain data shows that whales with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC added around 20,000 BTC to their holdings between Jan 5 and Jan 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Glassnode noted that over 13% of the circulating supply had returned to profit, making it a significant milestone since mid-2022.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin rallies to $18.2k, over 13% of the Circulating Supply has returned to profit. The observed sharp move upwards in this metric helps to confirm that a large volume of BTC was acquired between $16.5k and $18.2k,\u201d wrote Glassnode sharing the chart below.\n\nOn the other hand, observers have attributed Ethereum\u2019s recovery to the impending Shanghai upgrade. The upgrade, due in March, will allow users to unstake and withdraw their Ether which has been locked into the Beacon chain since December 2020. Furthermore, the upgrade is expected to reduce centralization on Ethereum, allowing more projects to onboard and, as a result, liquidity to flow into the ecosystem.\n\nThat said, the markets seem to be pricing that in advance. 3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network over the past week bringing the total number of shark addresses since Feb 2021 to 48,556.\n\nAt the same time, onchain data showed that shark and whale addresses holding different cryptocurrencies have been accumulating Tether, the top stablecoin by market cap, as they prepare for the next bull run. According to Santiment, \u201cThere are now 21,459 addresses that hold $100k or more USDT, just 1% from a new all-time high.\u201d"

        "content": "GALA\u2019s price has gone up by over 100% since 30 December\n\nProfit-taking has, however, commenced, so a price drawback is imminent\n\nGALA, an Ethereum [ETH]-based asset, has seen a significant price increase of 194% since 30 December. The king of altcoins reached a new high of $0.048 since mid-September, joining the ranks of other altcoins experiencing growth in 2023, data from Santiment revealed.\n\n? Amongst the many surging #altcoins in 2023, $GALA has been making a tremendous run. The price of the #Ethereum-based asset is up +194% since December 30th, and has exceed $0.048 for the first time since mid-September, backed by big whale transactions. https://t.co/Oe7XYd88gq pic.twitter.com/sFnvvPhkOv \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 9, 2023\n\nRead GALA\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe significant surge in GALA\u2019s price can be attributed to the rise in whale transactions involving the token. According to the on-chain analytics platform, since the year began, the count of whale transactions involving GALA that exceeded $100,000 went by over 10,000%.\n\nSimilarly, for whale transactions that exceeded $1 million, the count went up by over 500%. For cryptocurrency assets, a strong correlation exists between increased whale activity and positive price action.\n\nLikewise, growth in network activity can positively impact an asset\u2019s price, as the former typically initiates a rally in the latter. Since the close of the 2022 trading year, GALA witnessed increased network activity.\n\nAs a result, the count of unique addresses trading GALA tokens daily witnessed a surge. Similarly, new demand for the altcoin rallied together with the number of GALA transactions completed.\n\nPer Santiment, the count of daily active addresses trading GALA has since increased by 500%. As of 9 January, 7655 unique addresses traded GALA tokens.\n\nAlso, GALA saw an influx of new demand as the number of new addresses created daily on the network to trade the altcoin jumped by 672%. Moreover, the number of completed transactions involving GALA tokens since the end of 2022 rallied by 646%.\n\nGALA set to be guillotined\n\nAn assessment of GALA\u2019s price movement on the daily chart revealed that its current price hovered in the overbought region.\n\nAt press time, key momentum indicators Relative Strength Indicators (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were spotted at overbought highs, which was often difficult for buyers to sustain. The RSI rested at 88.75, while the MFI laid at 97.13.\n\nHow many GALAs can you get for $1?\n\nOverbought conditions are often considered a warning sign that the asset\u2019s price may be due for a correction, as the high prices may not be sustainable in the long term. In addition, it can be a signal that market sentiment is too optimistic and can\u2019t maintain the current levels.\n\nFurther, an analysis of GALA\u2019s exchange activity on the blockchain revealed that profit-taking was underway at press time as investors have closed their trading positions. In the last four days, GALA\u2019s supply on exchanges has rallied by 5%.\n\nConversely, the number of GALA tokens held outside exchanges dropped by 0.38%. This indicated that GALA holders were sending their holdings to exchanges for sale.\n\nInterestingly, despite the surge in price in the past few weeks, many holders still incurred losses. GALA\u2019s MArket Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio showed that the alt was undervalued for August 2022."

        "title": "Best Decentralized Exchanges of 2023- Top DEXs for Trading Cryptos - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has seen massive growth in the last few years, with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) becoming increasingly popular among users for their superior security and decentralization. The recent meltdown of FTX, one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, left investors scrambling to find a secure and advanced way to trade digital assets. With no single point of control or control in the hands of third parties, the Best decentralized exchanges of 2023 will allow users to trade freely and securely with no interference from external parties.\n\nThe Best Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) in 2023 with Highest Users:\n\nCovo \u2013 Best DEX for trading cryptocurrencies with upto 50X leverage\n\n\u2013 Best DEX for trading cryptocurrencies with upto 50X leverage Uniswap \u2013 DEX with the Highest number of trading pairs\n\n\u2013 DEX with the Highest number of trading pairs Curve Finance \u2013 Best Exchange for swapping and trading stablecoins\n\n\u2013 Best Exchange for swapping and trading stablecoins Pancake Swap \u2013 Best DEX on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\n\n\u2013 Best DEX on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) DYDX\n\nKyber Swap\n\n1) Covo Finance\n\nCovo Finance is a 100% decentralized spot and perpetual swap exchange where users can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets with no custodial risk. What sets Covo apart from its competitors is its commitment to safeguarding users\u2019 funds while providing trading solutions with low-fee swaps and leveraged trading up to 50x.\n\nCovo Finance has launched a COVO Token reward system, which acts as a governance utility token. Stakers are rewarded in the form of 30 percent of the platform\u2019s generated protocol fees in Matic tokens, esCOVO tokens, which can be staked or vested to earn COVO Tokens, and Multiplier Points, which boost yield without contributing to token inflation. Multiplier Points increase yield as if a user was staking the same COVO tokens, thus increasing long-term holders\u2019 returns and reward without contributing to token inflation.\n\nWith its 50X leverage features on trading BTC, ETH, etc., Covo Finance is slowly emerging as the number one choice for traders looking for the best decentralized exchanges in 2023.\n\nCovo Finance could become the default decentralized hub of DeFi activities, making it easier for users to swap tokens, leverage trades, manage liquidity, and mint new tokens.\n\nCovo Finance has also set up multiple pools for liquidity providers. Here, 70 percent of the platform\u2019s revenue, generated from leverage trading and trading fees, is distributed among the liquidity pools, which consist of 50% stablecoins like USDC and the rest in BTC, ETH, etc. In the pool, participants can mint COVOLP tokens with any currently underweight asset, thus counterparty-ing trades and mitigating risk to traders. Redeeming COVOLP tokens also comes with rewards, as users can choose to receive current overweight tokens in the pool with fee discounts.\n\nTo facilitate a low-friction experience, Covo has put users\u2019 security at the forefront, emphasizing that all funds are fully protected, so users don\u2019t have to worry about their crypto being exposed.\n\n2) Uniswap\n\nSince 2018, Uniswap has been the market\u2019s most widely used decentralized exchange platform. Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, Uniswap provides a platform for developers, traders, and liquidity providers to create, build and swap tokens. Compared to traditional centralized exchanges, Uniswap is completely decentralized, eliminating the risk of hacking and preventing users from having to give up control of their private keys. In addition, Uniswap also allows users to list tokens on their exchange for free.\n\nUniswap is also available as an open-source prototyping protocol, which makes it easier to create decentralized exchanges. Uniswap is driven by two main smart contracts: an \u201cExchange\u201d contract and a \u201cFactory\u201d contract. It does not require an oracle problem as it is integrated with TWAP price oracles. This proof-of-stake oracle creates gas usage and price delivery efficiencies. The latest version, V3, is widely adopted as it has consumed 15.5 million transactions and 2.8 million gas. It is also the most popular Ethereum contract, ranking first amongst all Ethereum decentralized applications.\n\nOverall, Uniswap is one of the best-decentralized exchanges platforms out there, with a wide range of features. One of the unique features of Uniswap V3 is the newly introduced Permit2, which allows users to swap any ERC20 or NFT-type token. This feature eliminates the smart contracts mismatch and thus removes the oracle problem. In addition, the Uniswap platform provides liquidity mining access, allowing users to earn rewards for providing liquidity.\n\n3) DyDx\n\nDyDx is a non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows users to trade various cryptocurrencies without giving up control of their private keys. With the help of its layer-2 solution, DyDx has become a well-known platform for fast and efficient trading with up to 20x leverage. The low trading fees, minimum trade size, and decentralized governance structure make it an attractive choice for users.\n\nDue to its layer-2 solution, the DyDx protocol offers high transaction speed with minimal gas costs. It also allows users to trade with perpetual instruments in which two parties agree to exchange one financial asset for another at a specific time. On the DyDx exchange, users have access to BTC-USD, ETH-USD, LINK-USD, and more trading pairs. In addition, the platform also offers low trading fees and slippage.\n\nIn August 2020, the Curve protocol introduced a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to manage changes to the protocol. Through its native token CRV, holders can vote on protocol changes. Finally, on DyDx, users can stake their tokens in liquidity pools and get rewarded for adding liquidity to the platform.\n\n4) Curve Finance\n\nCurve Finance is a decentralized exchange for a trading cryptocurrency focused on stablecoins. The Curve platform leverages automated market maker (AMM) technology to maintain low fees and slippage costs to users. It offers a variety of stablecoins, including DAI, USDT, USDC, BUSD, and TUSD.\n\nIn addition, users have access to the Curve token, known as CRV. This token is used to incentivize liquidity providers on the platform and encourage users to participate in the protocol\u2019s governance. Curve also offers crypto pools which allow users to pool their assets together and trade them at current prices. These pools also allow variable fees, ranging from 0.04% to 0.4%.\n\nFinally, Curve is integrated with the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), allowing users to earn interest on DAI deposited in the protocol. It is an attractive feature for users looking to earn passive income from their crypto investments.\n\n5) Pancake Swap\n\nPancake Swap (CAKE) is the leading decentralized exchange operating on the Binance Smart Chain. On the PancakeSwap platform, users can swap tokens, stake CAKE in Syrup Pools, partake in Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs), engage in perpetual trading, and buy/sell NFTs via the NFT Marketplace. The platform is open-source and has been audited by top blockchain security firms, such as Certik and Slowmist.\n\nPancakeSwap is powered by the native token CAKE, which rewards users who provide liquidity. The platform has gained considerable popularity due to the low transaction costs and high liquidity in the tradable assets. In terms of user experience, PancakeSwap is simple and easy to use and provides an intuitive UI.\n\n6) Kyber Swap\n\nKyberSwap is a decentralized exchange aggregator that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos, Arbitrum, Velas, and Aurora. On KyberSwap, users can swap tokens and earn rewards from liquidity mining. KyberSwap provides an intuitive UI and a highly secure platform for users to trade tokens with just a few clicks.\n\nKyberSwap is also integrated with the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), allowing users to earn interest on DAI deposited in the protocol. Users can also liquidate their tokens in the most capital-efficient manner via the liquidity pools, earning them fees.

        "content": "Crypto adoption in India is being driven primarily by the GenZ and millennial population. An overwhelming majority of crypto investors in the country fall in the 18-25 (45 per cent) and 26-35 (34 per cent) age groups, found a 2022 analysis by homegrown crypto exchange CoinSwitch.\n\nCrypto, truly, is a young person\u2019s asset class, with just 8 per cent of retail investors above 45 years of age.\n\nIn 2022, which brought about a bloodbath for the global crypto industry, Indian investors shied away from panic selling, and instead, held on to their investments. New investors too started building their crypto portfolio in the bear market to complement their equity investments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most valuable crypto, continues to be the most popular token in India, with 12.12 per cent of investments going towards it. This is followed by investments in DOGE (11.54 per cent), Ethereum (9.43 per cent), Shiba Inu (6.92 per cent), and Polygon (4.3 per cent). Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are meme coins, which are inspired by internet memes, and are more volatile than the rest.\n\n\u201cIndia set aside 40 per cent of its crypto investments on top dollar CRE8 coins and DeFi utility tokens in 2022, and only about 6 per cent in metaverse tokens. In fact, a greater share of investments (~8 per cent) was made on Ethereum alternatives (Layer1 networks that rival the blue-chip smart-contract chain) than metaverse tokens,\u201d CoinSwitch revealed in its report.\n\nDelhi ranked on top in terms of crypto investments (by value) in the country. This was followed by the IT hubs of Bangalore and Hyderabad. \u201cJaipur has the highest crypto adoption among tier-2 and tier-3 cities, followed by Lucknow and Pune,\u201d CoinSwitch stated.\n\nCrypto, meanwhile, continues to be a male-dominated sector, with only 8 per cent of CoinSwitch\u2019s 19 million users being women in 2022. A prior analysis by global crypto exchange KuCoin had pegged India\u2019s overall crypto population at 115 million, with 52 per cent of them investing in the asset class to generate a passive income.\n\nAlso Read: Budget 2023: CoinSwitch expects govt to incentivise crypto users and 'reduce the burden of taxes'"

        "content": "Transaction Per Second is a metric used to asses the number of maximum transactions that can be execucted on a blockchain network.\n\nTransactions Per Second (TPS) is a metric that records how many transactions a blockchain network can process in a second. This measurement helps to assess the transaction speed of a network. TPS also measures transaction speed for other traditional networks.\n\nTransactions Per Seconds In Crypto\n\nTPS in crypto is the speed at which a blockchain network processes transactions. The higher the number, the more advanced a network is. A higher TPS is an indicator of the network\u2019s speed and scalability. Usually, decentralized networks have a lower TPS rate than traditional centralized networks.\n\nThe famous crypto payments system PayPal\u2019s TPS is around 193 TPS and VISA can process up to 1,700 TPS.\n\nWhich network has the highest TPS?\n\nAs of now, among all the blockchain networks, Solana network has the maximum TPS done in the world of crypto \u2013 50,000 TPS. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, only has the TPS rate of 7. One of the main criticisms of the OG cryptocurrency Bitcoin is that it is not scalable and its TPS is low. Bitcoin\u2019s low TPS is also cited as why it can never achieve mass adoption.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has a TPS rate of 27, while Polygon can process 7,000 TPS. However, Ethereum\u2019s TPS is will scale significantly to around 100,000 after it completes its much-anticipated sharding upgrade. Known for enabling easy cross-border transactions, Ripple network handles over 1,500 TPS.\n\nWhat constitutes a network\u2019s TPS?\n\nBlock Time \u2013 Average time needed to mine a new block is Block Time of a network. Different blockchain networks have different block times. The leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes. Compared to bitcoin, Ethereum has significantly less average block time of 10-20 seconds.\n\n\u2013 Average time needed to mine a new block is Block Time of a network. Different blockchain networks have different block times. The leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes. Compared to bitcoin, Ethereum has significantly less average block time of 10-20 seconds. Transaction Size \u2013 Data transmitted with each transaction varies on which blockchain network the transaction is done. A transaction in bitcoin can be as small as under 300 bytes or as large as 500 bytes. The higher the transaction size is, the more time it will take to execute a transaction.\n\n\u2013 Data transmitted with each transaction varies on which blockchain network the transaction is done. A transaction in bitcoin can be as small as under 300 bytes or as large as 500 bytes. The higher the transaction size is, the more time it will take to execute a transaction. Block Size \u2013 Block size is the amount of data about transactions a block carries in a blockchain. Higher the block size means more people are needed to run a full node. It\u2019 block size is limited to mere 1 MB, but this small amount of data is enough to store over 2000 transactions.\n\nHow Transaction Per Second is calculated?\n\nTo calculate the TPS on a blockchain, your require information of its block size, transaction size, and block time.\n\nTPS = (block size/ transaction size) / block time.\n\nIs TPS alone enough to scale a network?\n\nBlockchain networks having a higher TPS rate is not enough to make a network successful or even compete with the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin. To truly make a network stand out, it needs to focus on security and other important aspects and not just its TPS rate. Bitcoin uses hash rate to measure the security and health of its network.\n\nAlthough, the importance of a network\u2019s TPS can not be denied as it measures the blockchain\u2019s capacity to process transactions. Furthermore, it is also an indicator of a network\u2019s potential to scale to accommodate new and better use cases in future. If a blockchain network has a high TPS rate, it usually lacks in other aspects \u2013 decentralization and security. For a blockchain network to achieve all three \u2013 high TPS, security, decentralization- is not easy and that is why blockchain networks are in competition to beat each other in all three aspects and not just TPS."

        "content": "Ethereum price has risen above the crucial $1400 mark, the highest in more than two months. This comes amidst an accumulation spree by sharks [holding 100 to 10k ETH] where roughly 3000 new addresses have been added in the last couple of weeks.\n\nData from Santiment further showed that as of Feb 2021, these cohorts of investors have reached 48,556 which is the highest level recorded to date.\n\nAmong the millions of crypto assets available worldwide, the market share of the world\u2019s second-largest crypto coin has climbed by more than 3% since Dec. 31, 2022, and it was worth over $856 billion on Jan. 11, 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market domination in the cryptocurrency space increased from 18.4% to 19%, according to coinmarketcap.com, a leading website that aggregates coin market capitalization data.\n\nThe ETH network underwent a major transformation after the successful shift to a proof-of-stake network. Almost four months after the event, the second-biggest blockchain by market cap has passed another major milestone.\n\nData from Etherscan showed that more than 16 million ether have been deposited into Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain staking contract.\n\nThe 16 million ETH figure accounts for over 13% of the total ether supply and represents nearly $22.38 billion at current prices. It occurs almost two years to the day after Ethereum\u2019s staking contract went live in 2020, marking the debut of the network\u2019s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain.\n\n$22B Of Staked Ethereum Cannot Be Withdrawn Until March 2023\n\nThe Eth network\u2019s \u201cvalidators\u201d \u201cstake\u201d ETH in exchange for the opportunity to add authenticated transactions to the blockchain\u2019s ledger.\n\nThe staked funds are locked up in the network and earn interest, but until the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which is not anticipated until approximately March 2023, they cannot be withdrawn.\n\nAlthough the increasing amount of ETH staked can be seen as a positive indication of Ethereum acceptance and security, it will undoubtedly put more pressure on the network\u2019s core developers to complete work on withdrawal support as soon as possible.\n\nOn the other hand, L2 transactions have boosted Ethereum\u2019s appeal when included in the mix.\n\nAs reported by TronWeekly, Eth layer-2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism have recently recorded a surge in transaction volume in the span of just three months, flipping even that of the mainnet Ethereum.\n\nData from Dune Analytics showed that Arbitrum and Optimism combined processed over 1.12 million transactions while Ethereum processed over 1.06 million transactions on Jan. 10."

        "content": "The bullish momentum in Ethereum price is facing resistance at the $1350 resistance.\n\nThe buyers have immediate support at $1300.\n\nThe trading volume saw a decrease of 18% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum has produced a bullish price structure this month. So far, the crypto market is influenced by positive vibes as the capitalization remains above $850 billion, as the largest crypto BTC cleared the key short-term resistance this week.\n\nBuyers are back in the game after a massive consolidation phase. While the buyers pushed through the crypto valuations above the short-term resistance, the next bullish hurdle hindered the upward momentum.\n\nEthereum Price Hit $1350 Resistance\n\nEthereum price struggled against the $1350 resistance in the intraday session against USDT. The buyers should break this hurdle as soon as possible to gain the $1660 level before the end of this month. The rising trading volume suggests further continuation of the uptrend. Meanwhile, the price action on the hourly time frame is making higher lows.\n\nAt that time Ethereum price (ETH) was trading at $1333 with neutral changes. Notably, the crypto price is nearing its December high with an 11.5% monthly gain. Thus, the price of Ethereum relative to bitcoin is down 0.67% to 0.7646 satoshis. Market capitalization rose 0.68% to $163.2 billion as of paper overnight data.\n\nAfter the breakout, the $1300 area is looking good for immediate support but trading volume has decreased by 18% in the last 24-hours, indicating a lack of sellers from the market. At the current price point, there could be a price correction if trading volumes increase.\n\nOn the daily chart, Ethereum investors accumulate the coin towards the 200-day exponential moving average. Conversely, ETH price stability above 100 EMA is influencing the bulls to dominate the trend of the crypto.\n\nThe daily RSI peak is approaching the entrance of the overbought zone. According to the RSI, Ethereum price is trading in the demand zone. Similarly, ADX remains near the 25 mark, favoring buyers for more accumulation.\n\nSummary\n\nEthereum close story looks good for swing trading up to the $1500 resistance area. Technical indicators are turning bullish on ETH and the RSI indicator is about to enter the overbought zone. The bulls must hold the $1300 support to protect themselves from the second phase of the price correction.\n\nSupport level \u2013 $1300 and $1000\n\nResistance level \u2013 $1500 and $1800\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational ideas only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

But, has suffered stagnancy in terms of total value locked [TVL].\n\nIn comparison to that, Arbitrum has reportedly outpaced the other top Layer 2 blockchains, such as Optimism and Polygon, when it comes to TVL. The former, however, is unaffected as it continues to increase in tempo and rule the L2 region.\n\nNonetheless, L2 transactions boost Ethereum\u2019s appeal when they are included in the mix.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer-2 And Staking Fuels Usage\n\nL2beat data showed that towards the middle of October, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed that of Eth layer 1 transactions, and it remained higher for the vast majority of the time afterward.\n\nThe term \u201cLayer 2\u201d is used to describe an additional framework or protocol that is implemented on top of an existing blockchain system.\n\nOverall, 2022 was a mixed bag for the leading smart contract platform Ethereum [ETH] as the network eventually shifted from proof-of-work [PoW] to proof-of-stake [PoS].\n\nThis includes its first-ever price slide below the high of the previous cycle.\n\nAnother factor driving up ETH usage is the upcoming Shanghai hard fork of the most popular altcoin, which is anticipated to occur in March. Staking risk will be reduced with this upgrade by withdrawing staked Ether [stETH] from the Ethereum Beacon chain.\n\nIn preparation for the upgrade, the prices of the Lido DAO [LDO] and Stakewise [SWISE] tokens, two systems that permit Ether staking, have increased by double digits over the previous week.\n\nWith $23.06 billion in value locked on the multiple dApps running on the network, Ethereum remains to be the most valuable protocol in terms of total value locked (TVL), according to data from Defi Llama."

They\u2019ve a primary target to the downside of the 0 fibonacci level.

        "title": "Which Blockchain is the Best for Developers in 2023? (Solana vs Ethereum vs Cardano) - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "One of the first steps for building any Web3 project is to choose a blockchain you\u2019re going to work with. This stage is essential since this choice would greatly impact your future product. In this article, we\u2019re going to compare the three most popular blockchains from a developer\u2019s point of view: Solana, Ethereum, Cardano.\n\nSolana\n\nSolana is the most popular Ethereum alternative for running smart contracts and decentralized applications, which stands out for its incredibly low transaction costs, huge bandwidth, and high scalability. It is worth noting that the first DeFi bond market on Solana, SuperStable, had its smart contract audited for security by ULAM LABS.\n\nEase of development and deployment\n\nTo create smart contracts and dApps on Solana, you\u2019d have to utilize Rust, one of the world\u2019s most often used programming languages.\n\nIn addition, it is also worth noting that the project team has developed a protocol called LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) for compiling smart contracts and applications written in other languages for WASM:\n\nC;\n\nC++;\n\nC#;\n\nGo;\n\nothers.\n\nUsing LLVM, you can easily and quickly migrate your smart contracts and applications from WASM networks (Dfinity, EOS, Polkadot, and Eth2) to the Solana environment.\n\nNo problems with the mempool\n\nA mempool is a kind of \u201cwaiting zone\u201d where all initiated but not yet confirmed transactions are waiting for their confirmation. Solana outperforms other networks (including Ethereum, Bitcoin, BSC, Avalanche, and Tron) in a way that it doesn\u2019t have such a zone.\n\nIn Solana, operations are processed so quickly (400 ms) that they simply do not have time to cause any queue. Whereas in Ethereum and Bitcoin, such queues are considered to be the norm. Because of these queues, users must compete with each other to confirm their transactions and ultimately increase their costs.\n\nLow resource consumption\n\nSolana solved the resource consumption problem with a Turbine protocol, which acts like a torrent network. It breaks each block into many small pieces, after which each node downloads one of the pieces and distributes it to other participants.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is a community-driven technology that powers the Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency and thousands of decentralized applications. There are two accounts available through Ethereum, one is an external account, and the other is a contract account. Also, the network allows developers to use all kinds of decentralized applications.\n\nSimple\n\nBlockchain code recipes for developing Ethereum applications are simple and easy to deploy, reducing the overall development cost.\n\nModular\n\nEthereum contracts can be developed as small modules that can be combined to provide the desired functionality. It is convenient to make changes to a module rather than to the entire protocol, so the modular structure keeps the development faster and more robust.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine is built to handle the runtime environment for compiling and implementing smart contracts based on Ethereum. This type of engine is run on Solidity, the language of smart contracts for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum virtual machines run in an environment known as a sandbox. Therefore, you can test smart contracts and see if they work for your specific case. If you are satisfied with the performance, you can implement your code on the main Ethereum network.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is the most developed one in the industry. Thus there is the highest number of developers and resources here. All this makes development smooth and streamlined. For any question you might have, there will be an answer out there.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is a next-generation blockchain platform for smart contracts and dApps that claims to be a faster and more scalable counterpart to Ethereum.\n\nTwo-layer network architecture\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of using Cardano to develop your web3 applications is that the blockchain is divided into two related but entirely independent layers:\n\nThe first one is the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). Responsible for running Cardano wallets and processing transactions. In the future, it is planned to add an exchange of ADA for coins of custom side chains and other cryptocurrencies. The second one is the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL). Responsible for the operation and calculation of smart contracts and dApps. It uses the Haskell programming language, which is considered one of the most advanced and secure.\n\nThis separation allows significant changes to be made to the blockchain without unnecessary forks. In addition, this also means that errors and failures in the operation of dApps or smart contracts will not affect the processing of transactions in any way and vice versa.\n\nOuroboros consensus mechanism\n\nAccording to the Cardano team, the main advantage of their project is the Ouroboros consensus algorithm. This is a proven safe variation of Proof-of-stake, where transactions are not verified by every node (as in Proof-of-work) but by a selected group of network participants \u2014 slot leaders.\n\nScalability\n\nThanks to the Ouroboros consensus mechanism and sidechain technology, Cardano has the potential to process a trillion transactions per second.\n\nWith this scaling potential, Cardano can become the basis for developing applications and websites of any level, from small web3 blogs to blockchain-based versions of Amazon or Alibaba.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThis is a property of the Cardano network, which implies the possibility of several heterogeneous shards and blockchains working together. Thanks to it, you can create smart contracts and applications that are very closely related to each other but at the same time remain independent.\n\nOverall comparison chart\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you choose to work on a public blockchain, you will spare yourself a huge amount of expensive blockchain development and maintenance work. Which means that you can focus only on business logic and processes of your business.\n\nIf you decide to develop your own blockchain or fork an existing one, you should be well aware that it is expensive and quite difficult. The fork in the future will have to be maintained, bug fixes applied, related software forks, and their code updated as well.\n\nAll three described blockchains are extremely specific and have many internal nuances. We recommend that you carefully consider how your project will use the blockchain. Consulting professionals can help you make the best decision for your project https://www.ulam.io/software-services/crypto-software-development . Blockchain software development is challenging but much easier and safe with dedicated blockchain company."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Shark Addresses Accumulate despite Bearish Cues - CoinChapter",
        "content": "YEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2013 Ethereum token Ether (ETH) traded at just below $1,400 on Jan 12, after a near-20% upside move month-to-date. Moreover, data from the crypto analytical platform Santiment testified to the growing accumulation among ETH shark addresses, despite the abundance of bearish cues.\n\nEther (ETH) sharks are on the move\n\nIn detail, sharks are wallets holding approximately 100 to 10,000 ETH. According to the Santiment report, over 3,000 new shark addresses appeared in the previous ten weeks, bringing the total number to over 48,500 addresses, the highest since early 2021.\n\nMoreover, Santiment asserted that the shark addresses are a particularly important driving force behind the price increases and declines. Could the accumulation drive the price even higher?\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Hesitates, But Further Gains Seem Likely.\n\nLong-term predictions favor the bulls.\n\nRyan Selkis, the founder and CEO of the market intelligence platform Messari, predicted a profitable year for Ethereum. In his latest report, the analyst asserted that the Merge to proof-of-stake was \u201cspectacular,\u201d albeit it took six years and was \u201cboring\u201d to watch.\n\nThe fact that [the Merge] went off without any major hitches bordered on miraculous, and I will be the first to admit that it was completed much sooner and with less drama than I thought it would be. Vitalik and the Ethereum Core team deserve major kudos. said Selkis.\n\nAlso read: Could Bitcoin Price Drop to $13K in Q1/2023?\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that events influencing short-term prices might contradict long-term predictions. Ethereum uptrend also took cues from Bitcoin, which highly depends on the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes and the possible recession.\n\nNotably, along with the macro market conditions, several on-chain metrics tell the bulls to pace themselves.\n\nBearish factors could hinder the ETH price appreciation\n\nFor example, another analytical platform, Glassnode, pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) signal reached a 4-month high.\n\nNVT signal bearish for Ethereum\n\nIn short, Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio describes the relationship between market cap and transfer volume. Per analyst Willy Woo, its creator, NVT can be considered analogous to the PE (price to earnings) Ratio used in equity markets.\n\nA growing NVT indicates that investors are pricing Bitcoin at a premium. Per Glassnode\u2019s definition, NVT grows when \u201cMarket Cap growth outpaces utilization of on-chain transaction volume and value settlement.\u201d High NVT Ratio values have historically coincided with market tops and periods of overvaluation.\n\nGiven the upward trajectory of the current NVT reading, a leg down might be in the books soon enough.\n\nEthereum exchange inflow on the rise\n\nAnother bearish factor is the growing exchange inflow, which stood at a one-month high of 2,460 ETH on Jan 12.\n\nGenerally, exchange inflow is a bearish factor, as it testifies to the traders\u2019 reluctance to store their ETH. More funds on exchanges mean more investors consider liquidating. In the current bearish market, the traders\u2019 caution is understandable. Moreover, the charts paint a gloomy picture as well.\n\nEther technicals spell doom.\n\nEthereum, much like Bitcoin, has been trading in a bearish \u2018descending channel\u2019 pattern since mid-May. The pattern features a down-sloping resistance and flat support that form a triangle, connecting the swing highs and lows.\n\nEthereum (ETH) daily price action. Source: TradingView.com\n\nThe bearish pattern expects a plunge equal to the setup\u2019s maximal height once ETH confirms the triangle by dropping below the support. Notably, that has not happened yet. However, the ETH/USD price action retested the triangle\u2019s resistance on Jan 12, suggesting an upcoming downward correction.\n\nIn case of a confirmation, the triangle threatens to take the ETH price below $100. Furthermore, the token\u2019s decreasing trading volumes and the \u2018overbought\u2019 relative strength index intensify the fears, albeit not necessarily expecting ETH to drop to its 2018 lows.\n\nAlso read: FOMC meeting minutes confirm interest rate hikes in 2023 \u2013 more pain for stocks ahead\n\nDespite Shark address accumulation, on-chain metrics, technicals, and macro factors are still against the largest altcoin. However, the crypto market can be unpredictable. Thus, investors should carefully weigh all pros and cons before placing their bets.\n\nClick here to keep up with the ever-changing crypto market and never miss the scoop!"
