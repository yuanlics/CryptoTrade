For example, if you buy a particular token, an MEV searcher could order transactions to buy it before you and also sell after you. MEV isn\u2019t always so sinister, however, and can often look like a typical arbitrage play, taking advantage of momentary differences in price between platforms.

This was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas-guzzling events such as XEN minting.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes \u2014 Bitinfocharts\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics said he was \u201cskeptical about people saying that a flippening could happen someday,\u201d adding that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nThe charts also do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric. According to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since.\n\nRelated: Why the battle for low or no transaction fees really matters\n\nHowever, while Ethereum may be ahead in transaction and activity terms, Bitcoin remains the most-searched cryptocurrency online.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a newsletter from \u201cIn Bitcoin We Trust\u201d revealed that BTC attracted the most attention on the Google search engine in 2022, with 28.4 million monthly Google searches across the world.\n\nThe report concurred with Cointelegraph, which reported on Dec. 23 that Ethereum did not make second or even third place for search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) respectively.\n\nEthereum, in fourth place, had 3.8 million global monthly searches, according to the data."

        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $2,500 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ether (ETH -0.41%), the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, hit an all-time high of more than $4,800 in November 2021. That represented a whopping gain of more than 550% from the beginning of the year. At the time, many analysts believed it could go even higher. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone predicted Ether's price could reach $4,000 to $4,500 by the end of 2022. The crypto news outlet Coinpedia predicted its price could hit $6,500 to $7,500.\n\nHowever, Ether actually ended 2022 at about $1,200. Rising interest rates drove investors away from cryptocurrencies and other riskier investments, while the failures of several high-profile tokens and exchanges tarnished the industry's reputation. Many analysts have reined in their near-term forecasts for Ether, but the bulls still believe it could bounce back in 2023.\n\nFor example, CoinLedger CEO David Kemmerer recently predicted Ether could still rise to $2,500 in the first half of 2023 even as the crypto winter freezes other cryptocurrencies. Let's see if that target is realistic, and if investors who buy Ether right now can potentially double their gains within a year.\n\nWhy should investors pay attention to Ether?\n\nEther differs from Bitcoin (BTC -0.25%) in three major ways. First, miners can only mine for Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. But on Ethereum, miners can mine Ether as well as other tokens. That open-source flexibility has facilitated the creation of many smaller altcoins. Ether can also still be effectively mined with high-end gaming GPUs, but Bitcoin now requires the usage of high-end ASIC miners.\n\nSecond, developers can create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized apps (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. That makes Ethereum a central pillar of the Web3 (also known as Web 3.0) movement -- which believes dApps will eventually disrupt centralized app ecosystems like Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play -- and support the expansion of a decentralized metaverse of applications and services. As the largest token on the Ethereum blockchain, Ether is the default currency of that universe, and its price could stabilize as the token is used to purchase more goods and services.\n\nLastly, Ether is a more environmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin. Ethereum previously used the same energy-intensive proof-of-work mining method as Bitcoin, but it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake method last September. That transition, known as The Merge, reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by about 99.95%. This could make it easier to scale up the Ethereum blockchain and support the development of more tokens, apps, and services. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's carbon output already rose 126 times between 2016 and 2021, according to Scientific Reports, as it became increasingly difficult to mine new coins. In 2020 alone, Bitcoin mining consumed more electricity than all of Austria.\n\nWhat's the bullish case for Ether?\n\nAt the end of 2021, the bulls believed The Merge would drive Ether's price to new highs. Instead, its price has actually dropped nearly 30%. The bulls believe that pullback is unjustified, and that Ether is merely being dragged down with the broader crypto market as interest rates continue to rise. They believe that Ether's current price doesn't reflect the benefits of The Merge or the long-term growth potential of the Web3 industry yet.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Ether and Bitcoin will remain the only two cryptocurrencies left standing when the crypto winter finally ends. If that happens, their prices could finally stabilize and become viable assets for institutional investors. Those tailwinds suggest that $2,500 might be a realistic year-end target.\n\nHowever, the crypto winter could also easily turn into an ice age. The failures of the Terra blockchain, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, and other smaller altcoins are driving regulators to quickly tighten their grip on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA global recession could also finish off the entire cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin and Ether, as investors completely lose their appetite for speculative investments. If that happens, Ether's price could easily stumble below $1,000 again. Unlike stocks, there's no clear way to fundamentally value Ether (beyond its last trade) to set a floor under its price.\n\nCan Ether double by the end of 2023?\n\nEther's price might stabilize this year as some investors cautiously return to the crypto market. But I also don't expect its price to more than double to $2,500. The macro headwinds should remain intense and cause investors to broadly shun the crypto, Web3, and metaverse markets while stashing their cash in government bonds and safe haven blue chip stocks. Ether's technological advances are impressive, but I don't expect investors to get excited about NFTs or dApps again until the macroeconomic situation improves and a new bull market begins."

Although investors in funds can sell their shares at any point, they don\u2019t have access to the underlying cryptocurrency they are investing in.\n\nGrayscale has been battling the SEC since June for the right to convert its cryptocurrency funds into Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), enabling them to be traded on public stock markets\u2014which could improve their liquidity significantly.\n\nThe news comes amid speculation over the financial health of Grayscale and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn December, Dutch cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo claimed in a blog post that DCG is \u201cexperiencing liquidity problems due to the current turbulence in the crypto market\u201d and that DCG \u201chas suspended repayments until this liquidity issue has been resolved.\u201d\n\nDCG claims that these liquidity issues are confined to Genesis.\n\nThis hefty discount is an issue that Grayscale\u2019s upper management has been trying to address; Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein wrote in a year-end letter to investors that it will \u201cexplore other options to return a portion of GBTC\u2019s capital to shareholders\u201d if it fails in its struggle to offer such funds as ETFs."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst says layer-2 projects built on Ethereum (ETH) will likely dominate the crypto payments space in 2023.\n\nIn a new YouTube strategy session, pseudonymous Coin Bureau host Guy tells his 2.19 million subscribers that using crypto for payments will become more popular this year.\n\n\u201cMy fifth crypto prediction for 2023\u2026 that\u2019s that crypto payments will become more common. This will again be due to a combination of better frontends, regulatory clarity increasing liquidity and, most importantly, an increase in scalability that finally makes crypto payments feasible.\u201d\n\nGuy says layer-2s will play a critical role in the increasing adoption of crypto payments. Layer-2s are crypto projects designed to increase the number of transactions per second (TPS) that a smart contract platform can process.\n\n\u201cThis prediction comes from a series of headlines I saw over the summer about Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin saying how layer-2s on Ethereum will power crypto payments. This makes sense given that Ethereum is the most secure base layer to have for a payment system besides Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe says the rise of layer-2 dominance with crypto payments is more likely with an upcoming upgrade to the smart contract platform Ethereum. The planned Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP 4844) is meant to improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability using \u201cshard blob transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, developers will be implementing Ethereum improvement proposal, or EIP-4844 sometime next summer. For those unfamiliar, EIP 4844 will increase the scalability of Layer-2s on Ethereum by between 10x and 100x. Given that most Layer-2s already processed thousands of TPS, such an increase will put them on a par with Visa.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,212.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The funds collected under ETHE are used to purchase Ethereum (ETH) to expose institutional investors to ETH passively.\n\nThere is currently $3.6 billion worth of assets under the ETHE pool collected from 31 million shares. The ETH per share is around 0.0097 ETH, and the market price per share is $4.77.\n\nCommunity concerns about Grayscale\n\nAccording to the data, ETHE is not the only Grayscale fund that is struggling. On Dec. 8, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reached a record-low discount of 49,20%. The GBTC has healed only slightly since then, with a discount rate of 45.\n\nRecently, Grayscale has been facing speculations regarding its financial stability. On Nov. 16, Grayscale\u2019s sister company Genesis halted withdrawals, raising questions regarding insolvency. Soon after, reports revealed that both companies\u2019 parent institutions had a debt of around $2 billion to Genesis.\n\nEven though Grayscale\u2019s partner Coinbase assured the community that Grayscale held enough Bitcoin (BTC) to remain liquid, Grayscale refused to provide proof of its BTC reserves, which didn\u2019t help soothe the community concerns.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "ETH Price Analysis: Ethereum Bulls Gathering Confidence at the Start of 2023, What\u2019s Next? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been oscillating in a very tight range over the past couple of weeks as the markets were heading into the new year\u2019s holidays. However, a decisive move may be on the horizon, as the cryptocurrency now resides in a critical area.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been testing a significant resistance level recently, where the $1250 zone and the 50-day moving average have a confluence.\n\nWhile the market is yet to break this fundamental level to the upside, a potential bullish breakout would pave the way for a rise toward the 200-day moving average, around a psychologically significant price the $1400. A valid breakout from the mentioned 200-day MA would likely lead to a short-term rally which can drive ETH\u2019s price toward $1800.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price gets rejected to the downside from the $1250 level and the 50-day moving average, a rapid decline toward the bulls\u2019 last resort, which is the $1000 support level, would be more likely.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, the recent consolidation pattern has become more evident, as the price has bounced inside a symmetrical triangle forming below the $1250 mark. A valid breakout from either side of the pattern could lead to a further continuation in the direction of the initial breakout.\n\nThe $1350 resistance zone would be the likely target for a bullish breakout, while a break below the pattern could potentially lead to a drop toward the $1100 support level.\n\nThe RSI indicator can also provide helpful insight, as the momentum is approaching the overbought area, and a potential bearish divergence could form soon, signaling a high probability for a bearish reversal. All in all, the market\u2019s short-term future is still hanging in the balance, yet a breakout or rejection from the $1250 level could shape the short-term to mid-term price trend, as liquidity will soon return to the markets after the holidays.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is still reluctant to decline further and create a new lower low, and the futures market sentiment is highlighting one of the reasons for this relative strength.\n\nThis chart displays the 100-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric predominantly used for assessing the futures market sentiment, as it indicates whether the bulls or bears are engaging more aggressively with their orders. Values above 1 show bullish sentiment, and conversely, values below 1 indicate the bears\u2019 dominance. Moves above or below this threshold are also significant, as the metrics\u2019 decline below 1 usually signals a crash in the short term.\n\nThis metric has been holding above 1 over the last few months, pointing to the bulls\u2019 resilience in the futures market, as their orders create sufficient demand to prevent the price from dropping below the $1000 mark. If this behavior continues, even higher prices could be expected in the short term, as the price is seemingly forming a base however, if the metric drops below 1, a further continuation of the bear market would be highly probable."

        "content": "ERC 721 vs. ERC 1155\n\nAs an artist, you may be considering using blockchain technology to sell your digital art or other creative works. One aspect to consider is the type of smart contract you will use to facilitate the sale of your art. The Ethereum blockchain offers several types of smart contracts, each with their own unique features and use cases. In this article, we will explore the differences between four of the most commonly used smart contracts for selling digital art: ERC-721, ERC-721A, ERC-1155, and ERC-20.\n\nERC-721\n\nERC-721 is a smart contract standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that cannot be replaced or exchanged for other assets on a one-to-one basis. Each ERC-721 token represents a unique digital item, such as a piece of art or a collectible.\n\nOne of the key features of ERC-721 is that it allows for the ownership and transfer of unique digital assets. This makes it well-suited for selling digital art, as each piece can be represented by a unique ERC-721 token. Additionally, ERC-721 allows for the creation of marketplaces and exchanges for buying and selling unique digital assets.\n\nERC-721A\n\nERC-721A is an enhanced version of the ERC-721 smart contract standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It was developed by the Azuki team and used for their own NFT collection. One advantage of ERC-721A is that it is more gas-efficient, meaning it requires less processing power to execute certain actions. This can be especially beneficial when minting multiple NFTs at once, as it allows developers to do so at a lower cost in terms of gas fees. Gas fees refer to the fees paid to process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, which have been subject to fluctuation and can sometimes become quite expensive. Overall, ERC-721A offers improved efficiency and cost-saving potential compared to the original ERC-721 standard.\n\nERC-1155\n\nERC-1155 is a smart contract standard that allows for the creation of both fungible (interchangeable) and non-fungible (unique) tokens in a single contract. This means that ERC-1155 can be used to represent both types of digital assets, making it a more flexible option than ERC-721.\n\nOne potential use case for ERC-1155 is the creation of games or other interactive digital experiences that involve both unique and interchangeable assets. For example, a game might use ERC-1155 to represent both unique collectibles and in-game currency that can be traded or exchanged.\n\nERC-20\n\nERC-20 is a smart contract standard for fungible tokens, which are interchangeable digital assets that can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. ERC-20 tokens are commonly used as a form of digital currency or as a way to represent a stake in a particular project or asset.\n\nUnlike ERC-721, ERC-721A, and ERC-1155, ERC-20 is not specifically designed for the ownership and transfer of unique digital assets. However, it can still be used to facilitate the sale of digital art, as long as the art is represented by a fungible token rather than a unique NFT."

        "content": "The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire impacted several divisions of the crypto ecosystem. The retrospective liquidity crunch faced by firms made them halt operations. Crypto lender Genesis was one such victim that paused withdrawals due to the \u201cunprecedented\u201d market turmoil.\n\nPost the announcement, Digital Currency Group\u2014the lender\u2019s parent company\u2014clarified that it had no impact on its own operations. However, it is worth noting that Genesis Global served as the liquidity provider for the $6 billion market-capped Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nOn its part, the state of the trust\u2019s share price has considerably deteriorated over the past year. Post shrinking by almost 76% in value, GBTC shares closed at $8.29 on 30 December 2022.\n\nFor context, DCG was established in 2015 by billionaire Barry Silbert. Like Grayscale, even Genesis is one of its subsidiaries. In an open letter on Twitter to Silbert, Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss recently alleged that Genesis owed the exchange\u2019s clients $900 million.\n\nAdditionally, Gemini users have filed a request for a class action against Genesis and DCG. This was done in response to the exchange suspending its Earn redemption program because of Genesis freezing its withdrawals.\n\nUntangling The Genesis-Grayscale Strand\n\nSo at the moment, users expect Gemini to force Genesis into bankruptcy.\n\nVia its various investment vehicles, Grayscale\u2019s balance sheet comprises a host of assets like Bitcoin [$10.5 billion], Ethereum [$3.69 billion], Ethereum Classic [$190.81 million], Litecoin [$114.13 million], Bitcoin Cash [$30.6 million], etc.\n\nThere have been a few claims doing the rounds that if Grayscale is forced to sell its assets to cover Genesis\u2019 creditors, these tokens and their investors would be the most impacted. Even though it seems tangled at the moment, the odds of such a scenario unfolding are quite low.\n\nIn mid-November, Grayscale explicitly assured investors that the safety and security of the holdings underlying Grayscale digital asset products remained unaffected.\n\nFurthermore, several from the space have given word that the trust assets are not in danger. Messari founder Ryan Selkis recently assured the same by tweeting,\n\n\u201cTrust assets will not be at risk.\u201c"

        "content": "2022 proved to be a fruitful year for Ethereum Name Service, with the platform recording 2.2 million registered domains despite unfavorable market conditions for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAccording to the service, over 80% of the total ENS domains created since the project\u2019s inception were registered in 2022. Data from Dune Analytics shows that ENS has around 2.82 million names registered as of Jan. 2, with 630,340 owners of ENS domains.\n\nHappy New Year everyone!\n\n\n\n2022 was an incredible year for ENS!\n\n\n\nOver 2.2m ENS names were registered in 2022 (that's 80% of ALL names created)\n\n\n\nIf you're ready for 2023, drop your ENS below \u2728 \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) January 1, 2023\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously explored in an exclusive interview with founder Nick Johnson, ENS allows users to map human-readable names like \u201cnick.eth\u201d to machine-readable information like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs.\n\nThe service has been driven by users adopting ENS names for decentralized profiles that work across decentralized applications and platforms. ENS domains serve as Ethereum wallet addresses, cryptographic hashes or website URLs and are effectively nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nRelated: Ethereum co-founder\u2019s poll shows people want $100 lifetime .eth domains\n\nThe growing popularity of the service saw a number of partnerships with major exchange operators like Coinbase come to the fore. The American exchange announced the integration of ENS in September 2022, giving users the ability to replace traditional Coinbase cryptocurrency wallet addresses with language-based usernames.\n\nWhile default ENS domains end with .eth, Coinbase\u2019s integration of the service allows users to claim \u201cname.cb.id\u201d usernames using the Coinbase Wallet browser extension. Coinbase\u2019s adoption of the ENS service was driven by the utility of human-readable names in making Web3 more user-friendly.\n\nData shows that September saw the largest number of ENS registrations created in 2022, with 437,000 domains registered. The data suggests that the exchange\u2019s ENS integration significantly impacted new sign-ups in 2022. May 2022 was also a bumper month for the service, with low gas fees on the Ethereum network playing a role in a surge of .eth domain registrations."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a distributed domain name service based on the Ethereum blockchain, announced that it saw over 2.2 million new registrations in 2022.\n\nThe service celebrated its most successful year yet as it became the most widely integrated blockchain naming standard on the market.\n\nThe 2.2 million new ENS names registered in 2022 also represent around 80% of all of the domains ever created. Data from Dune Analytics showed that the fastest registration rate was recorded in September 2022, with over 400,000 new names registered. As the year came to an end, the registration pace slowed down and December closed with only around 50,000 new names added.\n\nThis brings the total number of ENS names created so far to 2.8 million according to Dune Analytics. Data from the platform itself puts this number at around 2.76 million.\n\nThe 2.8 million names belong to around 600,000 unique participants in the ENS naming service, showing that owning multiple names has become a standard in the community.\n\nThe fast registration rate recorded in September could have been a result of Coinbase\u2019s ENS integration. The exchange enabled users to change their wallet usernames to an ENS subdomain of Coinbase IDs in late August. Coinbase said that the ENS address can be used to send, receive, and trade coins and that it will be available both to regular and pro users.\n\nAt the time, the platform\u2019s native token ENS also reached its all-time high of $20.05. The token dropped significantly since its September peak, bottoming during the FTX collapse, and has now consolidated at around $11.10.\n\nGraph showing the price of ENS from July 2022 to December 2022 (Source: CryptoSlate)\n\nAlmost a year ago, ENS announced that it was working on adopting Ethereum Layer-2 support. At the end of January 2022, the service had the first version of its off-chain resolution implemented and was ready to be tested by developers. While it\u2019s still unclear when Layer-2 support will be launched, the implementation could result in a new wave of name registrations for ENS.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A closely followed crypto trader is flipping bullish on one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) competitors as markets enter a new year.\n\nThe pseudonymous trader known as Credible tells his 335,000 Twitter followers that he\u2019s looking to dollar cost average (DCA) into Hedera (HBAR), which is currently over 93% down from all-time highs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve retraced back to the origin of the last move from which we ran 12x after a near 12 month consolidation. If you\u2019re bullish on HBAR it\u2019s a great time to be DCA\u2019ing in my opinion.\u201d\n\nHBAR is the native token of the Hedera Hashgraph system, which aims to be a faster, more efficient and more secure version of standard blockchain technology. It uses what\u2019s known as its Gossip protocol and incorporates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as the backbone of its system.\n\nHBAR currently has a market cap of just under $1 billion and a max supply of 50 billion tokens, with 25 billion currently in circulation.\n\nWhile Hedera has a large max supply compared to circulating supply, Credible says it won\u2019t be an issue once a bull market comes around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really an issue IMO [in my opinion]. People just want to rationalize the bearish PA [price action] and because they can\u2019t argue against its fundamentals \u2018bad tokenomics\u2019 is an easy alternative to shift the blame to. When we begin pumping again that argument won\u2019t stand either.\u201d\n\nLooking at Ethereum, Credible has a short-term price target near the $1,400 level, about a 16% rally away from current prices.\n\n\u201cWe got that last push down and took our local lows, now looking for continuation up to the 1st target. Note the two sets of equal lows we have left behind- I expect we come back down for those later.

Upgrades are allowed at this stage but must have a delay of more than 30 days.\n\nRelated: Vitalik reveals a new section in the Ethereum roadmap: The Scourge\n\nIn a separate Twitter post one day earlier on Dec. 30, Buterin also made some comments on what he believes a \u201cGood Crypto Future\u201d might look like.\n\nButerin outlined several areas of crypto that would need to be fixed, including scaling, privacy, user experience and making user accounts more secure for average users than centralized services.\n\nHe also sees payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) being part of this future, and new organizational paradigms powered by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)."

        "content": "First-time NFT creators and collectors often start their journey with a simple Google search.\n\nBut the hunt to find the best place to buy an NFT \u2014 which hinges heavily upon unique digital collectible needs \u2014 now, more than ever, needs the right context and due diligence. Many holders who snapped up their NFTs via FTX were hit with a rude awakening by the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy. Their elaborate and creative expressions of digital art are now, at least for the moment, worth not much more than a 404 error.\n\nNo guide can eliminate entirely the downsides of investing in NFTs, or any other cryptoasset, but this one is designed to break down how and why each exchange can or cannot meet your own NFT wants and needs.\n\nRead more: NFT Investing Explained\n\nBreaking down NFT auctions\n\nDifferent NFT marketplaces come with different standards for the auctions that govern their transactions.\n\nA Dutch auction, for one, uses a declining price format \u2014 unlike the more familiar English model. The seller kicks things off with a relatively high ask price and gradually lowers it until a bidder decides to lock it in. The first bidder to accept the current price wins. Dutch auctions are intended to sell NFTs with enough demand quickly.\n\nAn English NFT auction employs the crypto version of the eBay model. The seller sets a low floor, and bidders compete by placing increasingly higher offers until the auction ends at a pre-determined time \u2014 when the highest roller wins out. English auctions help lesser-known artists sell NFTs at a fair price. But sellers can also use the format to bid and manipulate the price anonymously.\n\nBest NFT Marketplaces\n\nOpenSea\n\nBlockchains Arbitrum, Ethereum, Klatyn, Optimism, Polygon, Solana Focus Art, collectibles, domain names, music, photography, sport, trading cards, utility, virtual worlds Fees 2.5% per sale Auction English, Dutch Royalties 10% maximum per sale Best for Art collectors, NFT flippers Pros Easy onboarding, support for multiple wallets\n\nHigh liquidity\n\nWide variety of listed NFTs, collections\n\nAdvanced tools for creators\n\nEducational guides for beginners\n\nMulti-chain support\n\nAndroid, iOS apps Cons Marketplace can be somewhat cluttered\n\nRecord of security breaches resulting in losses\n\nPast allegations of insider trading Launched in December 2017, OpenSea became the first Ethereum-based NFT trading platform. The marketplace rose in prominence as the industry grew and now handles more than 50% of all NFT trading volume \u2014 good for the largest marketplace, with more than a million registered users.\n\nBut, since OpenSea is the most popular, sellers are especially forced to compete to get their NFTs noticed by buyers. The setup makes it difficult for new sellers to stand out and may result in lower sales.\n\nOpenSea provides a wide suite of tools for creators to mint and list new collections. It also comes with a minimalistic interface to browse and purchase NFTs \u2014 using a range of payment options. From the platform\u2019s Ethereum roots, OpenSea has recently expanded to support NFTs on five additional chains, notably Solana and Polygon.\n\nExample of an OpenSea NFT\n\nSpace Daddie #001\n\nOwned by CASHRULEZ\n\nRead more: As OpenSea Flexes Marketplace Influence, Some Users Are Worried\n\nMagic Eden\n\nBlockchains Ethereum, Solana Focus Collectibles, art, gaming Fees 2% per sale Auction Timed auction Royalties Defined by creator Best for NFT collectors, flippers Pros User-friendly interface\n\nDecent volumes\n\nSlightly lower fees compared to OpenSea, in parts thanks to Solana-nativity\n\nDrop calendar to track upcoming mints\n\nSupports multiple wallets across listed networks\n\niOS app Cons Supports only Ethereum, Solana\n\nLimited options compared to OpenSea\n\nOnly supports verified creators and collections, limiting opportunities for up-and-coming artists\n\nDespite launching in September 2021, Magic Eden is already the most popular NFT marketplace on the Solana (native token, SOL) network. It has the highest number of users among SOL NFT markets, and is the second-largest NFT platform in terms of trading volume, trailing only OpenSea.\n\nMagic Eden is especially sought-after by collectors hunting for fresh, up-and-coming items. The Magic Eden Launchpad hosts regular NFT mints to connect creators with collectors. While the platform started off as Solana-native, it has expanded to enable support for Ethereum-based NFTs \u2014 and has additional networks in the pipeline.\n\nExample of a Magic Eden NFT\n\nRead More: Solana Marketplace Magic Eden To Offer Ethereum NFTs\n\nRarible\n\nBlockchains Ethereum, Flow, ImmutableX, Polygon, Solana, Tezos Focus Collectibles, art, gaming, virtual worlds Fees 1% fee from buyer, 1% fee from seller Auction English auction Royalties 10% maximum per sale Best for Collectors, gamers Pros Multi-chain support\n\nNFT aggregator for seamless purchases across supported marketplaces\n\nEnables creators to launch individual marketplaces\n\nAndroid and iOS apps available\n\nTrading fees distributed between buyer and seller Cons Limited NFT options compared to competitors\n\nRelatively difficult for new creators to break through (platform dominated by influencers)\n\nRarible launched in early 2020 and grabbed a significant portion of overall market share as the NFT industry saw increased adoption later that year. Rarible is one of few NFT marketplaces with a native token, releasing its RARI token roughly one year after launch. The token allows users to influence platform upgrades and access certain unique features.\n\nRARI token holders can submit or vote on proposals regarding trading fees, new features and related governance proposals. Such votes are advisory, not binding, so the Rarible team still has the final call.\n\nToken holders also decide which NFTs to showcase and feature. NFTs listed first are more likely to attract sales than those buried at the bottom of a long list.\n\nRarible has a unique appeal for creators. It provides a filter for buyers to explore top influencers and artists. This feature allows creators to build a closer relationship with their respective collector communities. The platform also offers an aggregator, allowing users to buy NFTs listed on competitors.\n\nExample of a Rarible NFT\n\nRead more: Web3 Watch: Rarible Revamps Marketplace, ApeCoin DAO Adds Bug Bounty\n\nNifty Gateway\n\nBlockchain Ethereum Marketplace focus Art, collectibles, gaming, music, social, style Fees 15% Auction style English auction Royalties Defined by creator \u2014 Nifty Gateway takes 5% royalty fee, plus 30 cents per transaction Best suited for Power NFT collectors Pros Exclusive appeal, rigorous vetting approach attract high-profile buyers\n\nMajority of listed items are top collectibles\n\nSupports fiat payments\n\nAndroid, iOS apps\n\nLive customer service via chat Cons Only supports Ethereum network, Metamask wallet\n\nSupports few NFT categories compared to competitors\n\nNifty Gateway ranks high on the NFT marketplace list for influencers, celebrities and brands to create limited-edition items.

The best NFTs to invest in, however, are generally those with a strong community or artwork that personally appeals to you. It could also be the work of an upcoming artist that has the potential to increase in value as the artist rises in prominence. As a rule of thumb, buying an NFT simply because an influencer promotes it may turn out to be a poor investment.\n\nBuy it\n\nOnce you have your mind made up, the next step is to make the purchase. The steps on how to buy an NFT differ from one platform to the next. It typically involves setting up a Web3 wallet, or registering on the NFT marketplace website and completing their KYC process. Next, fund your wallet with the purchase amount, or make the purchase using your credit card if it\u2019s supported by the platform.\n\nStore your NFT in a wallet\n\nLike cryptocurrencies, you can store NFTs in a self-custodied wallet. While it is common practice to use mobile or browser-native wallets for NFT storage, a hardware wallet offers the most secure experience. These devices typically store your assets offline and remove a common attack vector for hackers. Ideally, a hardware wallet is a compulsory option for investors putting huge sums into the NFT market.\n\nSell NFTs later to book profit\n\nWhile most NFTs offer an art appeal, they are also investment assets. If you\u2019re inclined to sell your NFT, we recommend reading a guide on how to sell an NFT on your chosen NFT trading platform. That way, you can avoid potential losses often associated with listing NFTs for the wrong prices or other potential mishaps. It also allows you to use the best withdrawal method to save on fees and get full value for each sale.\n\nThe NFT marketplace as a whole\n\nThis article provides an exhaustive NFT marketplace list, reviewing the likes of features and pros and cons, as well as fees. OpenSea and Magic Eden are the most popular to buy from, with a wide range of collections and support for a number of blockchains.\n\nRarible, SuperRare, MakersPlace and Nifty Gateway specialize in artwork and exclusive drops from influencers and popular artists. Binance and Coinbase\u2019s NFT platforms, meanwhile, have grown in prominence \u2014 providing centralized trading venues for investors.\n\nThe best NFT marketplace is ultimately the one that meets your profile and specific needs as a creator or collector. Each platform has its own pluses and minuses and could come in handy at different stages of your digital collectibles journey."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts, the Ethereum network had a higher total transaction volume compared to Bitcoin in 2022. Specifically, there were 338 percent more transactions on the Ethereum network (408.5 million) than on the Bitcoin network (93.1 million). The average daily number of transactions on Ethereum was around 1.1 million, while the average daily number of transactions on Bitcoin was 255,000. Despite this, Bitcoin has remained more popular in terms of online search interest.Transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were more consistent and regular compared to those on the Ethereum network, which saw more fluctuations. This was attributed to times of increased demand, such as during the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other activities that required a lot of gas (a measure of the amount of computing power needed to perform a certain action on the Ethereum network), such as the minting of XEN.Ethereum has continued to have higher transaction volumes in 2023, with the number of transactions on the Ethereum network on January 2 reaching 924,614, which is a 300 percent increase compared to the Bitcoin network on the same day (229,191).The person who shared the data on Reddit expressed scepticism about the idea that the Ethereum network could surpass the Bitcoin network in terms of transaction volume and activity, a phenomenon known as a \"flippening.\" However, they noted that those who advocate for a flippening now have more reason to do so, given the current transaction volumes. A flippening occurs when one blockchain surpasses another in a particular metric, such as transaction volume or activity.Although Ethereum may currently have higher transaction and activity levels, Bitcoin remains the most searched crypto online. On January 1, data from \"In Bitcoin We Trust\" showed that Bitcoin had the highest number of monthly Google searches globally in 2022, with 28.4 million searches. Ethereum did not even come in second or third place in terms of search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, respectively. According to the data, Ethereum was in fourth place with 3.8 million global monthly searches."

The New Year price bump has seen the cryptocurrency reclaim $11 after several days trading below double-digits.\n\nThe news follows a show of support from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who tweeted last week that \u201csmart people\u201d have told him there is an \u201cearnest smart developer community in Solana,\u201d and that the chain has \u201ca bright future\u201d now that \u201cthe awful opportunistic money people have been washed out.\u201d Buterin added that he hopes the Solana community \u201cgets its fair chance to thrive.\u201d\n\nHowever, Solana\u2019s New Year pump hasn\u2019t canceled out the battering the would-be \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has taken over recent months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future.

        "content": "Liquid staking protocol Lido Finance appears to have benefited most from the Ethereum merge in September, with its total value locked (TVL) now sitting at the top position among other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Lido\u2019s liquid staking protocol now commands $5.9 billion in TVL, overtaking MakerDAO\u2019s $5.89 billion and AAVE\u2019s $3.7 billion.\n\nHowever, these rankings have since been disputed by MakerGrowth, which claims that DefiLlama \"does not include a number of different collateral options that account for more than $1 billion of TVL.\"\n\nIn a statement to Cointelegraph on Jan. 4, MakerGrowth explained the missing figures include its GUNI USDC/DAI LP tokens which account for $446 million in TVL, Monetalis Clydesdale short-term bond ETFs which make up $500 million in TVL as well as the participation in loans originated by Huntingdon Valley Bank, which accounts for another $100 million in TVL.\n\n\"MakerDAO is in contact with DeFiLlama to update this information,\" it added.\n\nLido now has the highest TVL of any DeFi protocol. pic.twitter.com/2xsM3lVGVl \u2014 Patrick | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) January 1, 2023\n\nAccording to Lido Finance\u2019s website, as of Jan. 2, had $5.8 billion Ether (ETH) staked. Meanwhile, there was around $23.2 million staked in Solana (SOL), $43.9 million in Polygon (MATIC), $11 million in Polkadot (DOT) and $2.2 million in Kusama (KSM).\n\nLido\u2019s model allows users access to liquid Ether staking without committing to the traditional 32 ETH minimum.\n\nBlockchain data analytics from Nansen in December noted that staking solutions such as these had been in high demand since Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nIt\u2019s report highlighted the impact of the Merge in introducing staked ETH as an out-and-out cryptocurrency-native yield-bearing instrument that has quickly outstripped other collateralized yield-bearing services.\n\nLido appears to have benefitted from this, as its fee revenue has been directly proportional to Ethereum PoS earnings since Lido sends received Ether to the staking protocol.\n\nIn Nov. 2022 that Lido said it has been collecting $1 million in fees every day since Oct. 2022.\n\nRelated: 5 altcoin projects that made a real difference in 2022\n\nMeanwhile, the governing body of the Maker protocol MakerDAO saw its revenue decline to just over $4 million in Q3, an 86% plunge from the previous quarter, according to a Messari statement in Sept. 2022, citing few liquidations and weak loan demand as the reasons for the decline.\n\nIn that same month, Lido held the most amount of staked ETH among DeFi, with 31% according to Nansen in September, which is a significant amount compared to major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, holding 15% and 8.5%, respectively.\n\nUpdate Jan. 5, 8:25 am UTC: Added a statement from MakerGrowth sent to Cointelegraph regarding DefiLlama's TVL data."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf 2022 made one thing clear about crypto, it\u2019s that there\u2019s absolutely no point in predicting anything.\n\nOvernight collapses of multi-billion dollar companies, historic technological achievements, industry-wide crashes, blockbuster confrontations with world governments, shocking revelations of corporate malfeasance, billionaires on the run, surprise arrests: 2022 had it all\u2014if not too much.\n\nWhere does crypto go from here? While the future may not be certain, it's too tempting not to make some educated guesses. A number of 2022\u2019s seismic events will certainly reverberate well into the new year; some new trends, too, are poised to play a major role in shaping what already looks to be another critical year for crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are some potential answers to a few questions likely to have major implications for the industry in 2023.\n\nWhen will winter end?\n\nBy late fall, the crypto market looked poised for a recovery after months of relentless battering: the stock market was coming up for air, inflation was slowing, and prognostications for 2023 were cautiously optimistic.\n\nThen, one of crypto\u2019s most prominent institutions exploded in real time.\n\nThe stunning collapse last month of crypto exchange FTX cratered crypto prices, sending Bitcoin to its worst low in two years. Ethereum plunged to almost $1,100 in late November, due to a combination of market-wide panic and the dumping of millions of dollars worth of ETH by an attacker who purportedly drained FTX wallets in the midst of the company\u2019s unraveling.\n\nCrypto prices have since marginally recovered, but the contagion sparked by FTX\u2019s collapse only continues to spread. Digital asset lender BlockFi, which took a $250 million line of credit from FTX over the summer, declared bankruptcy late last month, weeks after freezing all withdrawals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company joined the ranks of a litany of crypto firms impacted by FTX\u2019s demise. Cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global, acquired by FTX earlier in the year, froze all fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals just days after its parent company collapsed; Sino Global, a blockchain-focused venture firm, confirmed \u201cmid-seven figure\u201d exposure to FTX; crypto investment and trading group CoinShares confirmed a $30.3 million exposure; crypto prime broker Genesis suffered a whopping $175 million exposure to FTX, and suspended client withdrawals for its lending arm as a result; crypto lender SALT also paused withdrawals.\n\nAs 2023 unfolds, it's all-but-certain that even more firms will be forced to disclose potentially devastating relationships with once-dominant FTX, which seemed to have spread its tendrils across every corner of the crypto industry.\n\nUntil the full impact of FTX\u2019s $32 billion collapse is accounted for, and its myriad connections are divulged and processed, it\u2019s unlikely a crypto spring will be able to take hold. With crypto contagion looking unlikely to let up any time soon, color us surprised if the proverbial line goes up before actual spring.\n\nCrypto laws, finally?\n\nDespite the crypto-related cacophony and controversy that emanated from Washington this year, there remains a jarring lack of clarity from the American government about the regulatory fate of crypto assets, protocols, and exchanges. Will 2023 finally bring some solid guidelines and guardrails?\n\n\u201cI am less bullish on regulatory clarity,\u201d Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director of crypto lobbying group DeFi Education Fund, told Decrypt about 2023\u2019s prospects.\n\nWith control of Congress set to be narrowly split between Democrats and Republicans in 2023, Whitehouse-Levine is skeptical that warring political factions will be able to put aside their differences to pass sweeping crypto regulatory legislation.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to be difficult for those two constituencies\u2014each with completely different views on crypto policy\u2014to come to a consensus that can pass Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nOne bipartisan crypto bill that looked poised to go the distance now appears all-but doomed. The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), also known as the Stabenow-Boozman bill, would have granted crypto regulatory powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and was by late 2022 gaining traction on the Hill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s most prominent supporters, though, was now-disgraced FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who favored the bill\u2019s mainstreaming of centralized crypto exchanges like FTX. Weeks after FTX\u2019s historic collapse, the bill was put on hold. It appears seismic changes in political calculus may have permanently sealed its fate.\n\nThere is, however, one area of crypto legislation with potential for movement in 2023: stablecoin regulation.\n\n\u201cIf anything moves, stablecoin regulation seems to be the area where action is most likely to occur legislatively,\u201d Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201cSeemingly everyone agrees that something needs to be done, and everyone wants a deal.\u201d\n\nOutgoing House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) and incoming Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) have been working towards a stablecoin bill for years, ever since Facebook stirred panic with its since-thwarted attempt to create its own stablecoin, Libra.\n\nIn the absence of any comprehensive legislation, stablecoins have continued to make headlines: in May, so-called algorithmic stablecoin UST depegged from the US dollar, collapsing its maker, Terra, wiping out some $40 billion in value, and kickstarting crypto\u2019s current winter.\n\nSEC vs crypto\n\nAnother key character in crypto\u2019s ongoing, unfolding battle with Washington is the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and headline-grabbing head honcho Gary Gensler.\n\nGensler made waves in 2022 for escalating enforcement actions against crypto companies without providing baseline rules or guidelines for the emergent industry. Gensler\u2019s own colleague, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, previously labeled such policies of education by enforcement \u201cjust not a good way of regulating,\u201d in an interview with Decrypt.\n\nWill 2023 bring any clarity, good or bad for crypto, from the SEC?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne major crypto development on deck at the SEC is a suite of pending updates to the agency\u2019s rules on security exchanges. The SEC has released a proposed draft of its revised rules, which defines security exchanges in extremely broad terms that appear poised to ensnare decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nThe rule is currently in the comments stage, and has not yet been adopted. If adopted next year in its current form, the rule could have devastating consequences for DeFi, essentially requiring the sector to be regulated as a securities marketplace.\n\n\u201cIf a DeFi protocol is required to be regulated like the New York Stock Exchange, obviously that is totally impossible,\u201d DeFi Education Fund\u2019s Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201cIt would effectively make smart contracts illegal in the US.\u201d\n\nWhitehouse-Levine is confident, however, that if such a rule were adopted, it would be challenged and potentially overturned in federal court.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the SEC may soon be embroiled in political problems of its own.\n\nRepublican lawmakers\u2014and some Democrats\u2014have recently ramped up criticism of Gensler and the SEC\u2019s inability or unwillingness to produce concrete rules on crypto assets. In the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse in November, Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) demanded that Gensler testify before Congress, linking 2022\u2019s slew of crypto company collapses to the SEC\u2019s enduring failure to create a crypto regulatory framework.\n\nWhitehouse-Levine believes that, with Republicans soon to take charge of the House, stern words could soon evolve into real consequences for the federal regulator.\n\n\u201cEvery regulatory agency reports back to Congress, so there's a lot they [Republicans] can do,\u201d Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201cFor example, they could say, until the SEC issues rulemaking on digital assets, they can't spend any of this money on enforcement. It could be quite impactful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWill Ripple\u2019s battle offer answers in crypto\u2019s war?\n\nOne of 2022\u2019s highest-profile\u2014and still ongoing\u2014crypto lawsuits saw blockchain payments company Ripple battle the SEC in federal court. The government asserts that the company\u2019s XRP token was illegally sold as an unregistered security.\n\nThe lawsuit has pitted a dominant crypto company with deep pockets against a federal agency with much to prove\u2014see above\u2014in one of finance\u2019s key arenas: the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. That court, colloquially referred to as the \u201cMother Court\u201d by legal professionals, oversees all Wall Street activity and holds a particularly influential sway over federal finance law.\n\nWill the case, ongoing for almost two years, finally see resolution in 2023? And if it does, what will that verdict mean for crypto as a whole?\n\nSome experts believe that the SEC is angling to use its case against Ripple not just to prevent the unregistered sale of tokens like XRP, but to set the stage for the agency to finally go after centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.US\u2014the beating hearts of America\u2019s crypto trade.\n\nThe SEC, in its recent victory against blockchain-based publishing platform LBRY, successfully got a federal court to take the unprecedented step of labeling certain crypto tokens as securities in themselves, not just their sale as an illegal securities offering.\n\nIf the SEC can get its Manhattan-based judge to make a similar ruling on Ripple, the repercussions for crypto could be profound.\n\n\u201cThey want to go all the way and say the XRP tokens are the security,\u201d Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in crypto and securities regulation, previously told Decrypt. \u201cIf they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell \u2018crypto securities\u2019 without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption.\u201d\n\nSuch an outcome would unquestionably upend the place of crypto exchanges in American finance, bringing stock exchange-caliber regulation to any entity trying to sell crypto assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2023 will likely see either the realization of such a verdict, or an equally-consequential victory for Ripple, which would signify the dodging of a major bullet for the beleaguered industry.\n\nWhat next for Ethereum?\n\nFinally, some good news.\n\nSeptember\u2019s historic Ethereum merge transitioned crypto\u2019s dominant network to a proof of stake consensus mechanism that instantly cut its energy consumption by a whopping 99.99%, according to reports.\n\nAfter that technical triumph, what\u2019s in store for Ethereum as it moves into 2023?\n\nFirst up will be the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, expected to launch in March.\n\nShanghai will, first and foremost, enable withdrawals of staked ETH. Since the merge went live in September, users have been able to deposit existing ETH with the Ethereum network to help validate Ethereum transactions and create new ETH for themselves in the process. All staked ETH and newly generated ETH, however, have not yet been made available for withdrawal.\n\nCome March that will change, and some $20 billion worth of staked ETH will finally be made available to Ethereum users following the network\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nEthereum\u2019s core developers are so committed to rolling out staked ETH withdrawals that they\u2019re trying to keep Shanghai as light as possible, eliminating other much-anticipated network upgrades from the update in the name of expeditiousness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne such improvement that many hoped would be included in Shanghai is proto-danksharding, a preliminary version of a process by which huge amounts of data on Ethereum rollups\u2014a tool used to combine many Ethereum transactions and treat them as one speedy, cheap transaction\u2014will one day be verified by only sampling small pieces of data.\n\nDanksharding will take a process that already makes Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster, and make them far cheaper and faster. The update will dramatically increase the speed and ease with which huge amounts of data could be verified on Ethereum layer-2 networks like Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nMany see danksharding as the key to Ethereum\u2019s future proliferation and dominance as a reliable, secure network that\u2019s also incredibly fast and inexpensive to use.\n\nWhile proto-danksharding may not come as soon as March, Ethereum\u2019s developers hope it will still arrive by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that it will be shipped in 2023,\u201d Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. He expects the proto-danksharding tool to be included in Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade after Shanghai, which has been tentatively labeled Cancun."

        "content": "Tron is currently the second largest blockchain in terms of total value locked, behind only ethereum, according to DefiLlama data, and is thriving in its DeFi ecosystem.\n\nTRON TVL exceeds BSC\n\nTron now has more TVL than BSC, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche TRON recently incorporated BUSD, Binance\u2019s stablecoin into its network.\n\nTron now has a TVL of $4.15 billion (10.7%) slightly ahead of BNB\u2019s $4.08 billion (10.52%). Although negligible, the margin is noticeable. Tron has kept its TVL level while BNB Chain\u2019s slight decline has helped it advance. For virtually all of 2022, BNB Chain remained stable behind ethereum.\n\nEthereum is still the largest blockchain by TVL, at $23.07B or 59.53% of the entire market. In fourth place, is Arbitrum at $1.02 B (2.64%) followed by Polygon network at about $995M (2.57%).\n\nStronger demand for the network may have led to Tron\u2019s higher TVL ranking. Additionally, it might result in a long-term increase in TRX demand and a favourable attitude towards the network.\n\nDeFi TVL has been decreasing\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has decreased along with the harsh crypto winter, according to data supplied by DeFi Llama. Since December 2021, the total DeFi TVL has decreased by 78.1%, from an all-time high (ATH) of $181.2 billion to about $39.4 billion at the time of writing.\n\nReflectively, Binance Smart Chain\u2019s (BSC) TVL has sharply declined and hit 19-month lows.\n\nAccording to the tracker\u2019s data, BSC\u2019s total market value has decreased by 0.15% over the previous 24 hours and 19% in a month as of the time of writing. PancakeSwap is the major shareholder in BSC\u2019s TVL with ownership of almost 53% of shares and a value of $2.16 billion, down 14.3% in the last 30 days.\n\nWhat\u2019s TVL?\n\nToday, like in 2022 the total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector is still dominated by Tron, BSC, and ethereum. The TVL of a protocol helps us comprehend the value of each DeFi protocol. The DeFi industry\u2019s TVL statistic comes the closest to the total market size. The transaction volume of NFT for different segments reflects the erratic character of advances in this nascent market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Loopring suffered a decline in TVL in 2022.\n\nLRC continues to record increased token sell-offs.\n\nAs the ongoing crypto winter lingers in the new year, LRC, the native token that powers leading layer 2 zkRollup protocol Loopring, was among the top ten cryptocurrency assets by trading volume among the top 500 Ethereum whales in the last 24 hours.\n\nDubbed the first zkRollup Layer 2 network, Loopring is a protocol for building non-custodial, orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAre your LRC holdings flashing greens? Check the Profit Calculator\n\nIn 2022, more people started using layer 2s on Ethereum as distinct communities and ecosystems formed around them. In addition, these layer 2s also offered significantly lower transaction fees than the Ethereum main chain, which further contributed to their adoption.\n\nIncreased inflation and the surge in liquidity exit from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols led to a decline in DeFi total value locked (TVL) in 2022. Primarily built to house DEXes, Loopring did not escape the decline as its TVL fell by 86% during the year, per data from DefiLlama.\n\nWith a 1.89% market share of the L2 ecosystem, Looopring was spotted at number five on L2Beat\u2019s list of L2 protocols, with the largest TVL.\n\nNot an impressive start\n\nDespite being on the list of the top ten cryptocurrency assets by trading volume among the top 500 Ethereum whales in the last 24 hours, LRC\u2019s performance was woeful within the same period.\n\nAt press time, the altcoin exchanged hands at $0.1878, per data from CoinMarketCap. However, indications from an assessment of its performance on the daily chart showed that LRC was severely oversold at press time.\n\nStruggling to wade off the bears, the buyers cowered, thereby leaving coin distributors in control of the LRC market.\n\nRead Loopring\u2019s [LRC] Price Prediction 2022-2023\n\nThis was confirmed by the position of LRC\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI). At press time, the sellers\u2019 strength (red) at 34.33 lay solidly above the buyers\u2019 (green) at 10.39. Moreso, the Average Directional Index (yellow) was spotted in an uptrend indicating that the token distribution trend intensified.\n\nDepicting clearly the oversold nature of LRC at press time, key momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned far from their neutral spots. For example, the RSI was spotted in a downtrend at 24.64. Likewise, the MFI was 31.30, at press time."

Bitcoin is currently being traded at the $16,584 level, with $16,500 serving as a support level. The price is attempting to move above the resistance level at $16,600. If buyers are able to sustain their efforts, it is possible that the price of Bitcoin will rise above $16,700 by this week.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cSolana saw a rebound from its recent low value of $8.19 and returned to the $9.50 price range. However, having experienced a drop of 96 percent, in order to recover, SOL may need to distance itself from Bankman-Fried, who invested significantly in the cryptocurrency and provided support to Solana projects through venture deals with FTX and market-making from Alameda Research. Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading around $16,500$ & $1,200, respectively, with no major change.\u201d\n\nweTrade founder Prashant Kumar offered his take on the market scenario as well, \"The global cryptocurrency market started the new year largely flat with the global market cap under $800 billion. The two key currencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 have seen some gains in the past day and are in the green. Cardano, Polkadot saw gains of approximately 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, XRP saw a decline of 3.3 percent over the last 24 hours. 2022 saw lots of downward movement in cryptocurrency prices, investors are hoping for good news from the market this year.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin entered 2023 on a positive note as it witnessed a jump of 0.39 percent in its value. The largest altcoin Ether also registered a jump of 0.29 percent to start the new year in green. It will be interesting to see the moves of the central banks around the globe to tackle inflation which will chart the course for financial markets.
