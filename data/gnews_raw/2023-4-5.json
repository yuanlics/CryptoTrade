        "title": "Ethereum, Arbitrum, and why L2 solutions are such a mess - Fortune",
        "content": "A hot topic in crypto circles these days is how to process more transactions on a blockchain, leading many pundits to say it can\u2019t be done in a decentralized fashion. This opinion is a popular one but also belies a superficial understanding of the problem with Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions in particular\u2014a problem that stems from the financing models driving these solutions.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the debate, Ethereum and Bitcoin have for years struggled with congestion and high fees arising from their failure to keep up with demand on their blockchains. This has in turn created opportunities for projects offering \u201con-top\u201d solutions as a means to handle that extra demand. The result is a plethora of so-called layer-2, or L2, sidechains\u2014Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon among them\u2014that are intended to increase transaction capacity while keeping the chain orderly.\n\nIn the Bitcoin network, these efforts have largely focused around Lightning, a system of secured peer-to-peer channels that allow for quick and cheap transactions. In the case of Ethereum, developers have taken a more baroque approach that typically looks like this: A technical team claims to have a novel solution to scale Ethereum by capturing transactions on their network, and that idea is pitched to venture capitalists. But instead of integrating this software directly into the main protocol, so Ethereum as a network can scale, a new token\u2014an L2 token\u2014is issued to transact using this new software.\n\nDoes this have to happen? Well, no. Strictly speaking, there is nothing stopping Ethereum leadership from incorporating scaling solutions at the protocol level to lower its costs and make the network more efficient. But instead of working to make the scaling happen directly, the Ethereum crowd has instead relied on the L2 route. (It\u2019s worth noting that Tezos, the blockchain I cofounded, recently deployed an L2 solution without introducing a token.)\n\nWhile L2 solutions on Ethereum have succeeded in offering faster and cheaper transactions, their insistence on adding their own proprietary tokens add friction. To make matters worse, the L2 projects often rush to market with underdeveloped solutions, creating a reliance upon Ethereum contracts under their control and centralized oversight to address security issues later. While this tokenized approach funds development and generates hype, it quickly leads to disillusionment as inflated token market capitalizations fail to meet expectations.\n\nSo why does Ethereum continue to embrace these half-baked L2 solutions? Look no further than Sand Hill Road.\n\nTraditionally, venture capitalists offer financing for new businesses\u2014the word \u201cventure\u201d connoting newer, riskier investments, unlike those perhaps preferred by other private equity firms. VCs typically look to exit their positions through IPOs or acquisitions, often on five- or seven-year time horizons.\n\nIf VCs had a chance speed up their exits\u2014the big moment everyone gets paid\u2014to an order of months, you can bet they would leap on it. And so enter a new model facilitated by crypto.\n\nIn Crypto VC speak, exit strategies don\u2019t come from the creation of a useful, flourishing business. Since 2018 or so, VCs have acted as providers of bridge capital to teams until a token is created and sold. It\u2019s about short-term storytelling because, ultimately, the value of the token isn\u2019t defensible. Often, it\u2019s a solution in search of a problem or, in the case of scaling, a source of additional friction. The last two months have served as testament to the instability of L2 tokens for a variety of business reasons.\n\n\n\nLast month, Coinbase announced it was launching an L2 solution based on Optimism. This was poetic: Optimism already has an unnecessary token and a staking mechanism for its distribution. Unfortunately, it lacks fraud proofs, or the basic security ingredient that makes a scaling solution more secure than a hope and a prayer. What we have here is a token in search of its own technology.\n\nMore recently, Arbitrum, an L2 on Ethereum that\u2019s raised over $100 million from VCs such as Lightspeed, issued a governance token called ARB to justify its place outside the base Ethereum protocol. As part of its first \u201cgoverning\u201d act, the community was asked to vote on a proposal that would send 750 million of its tokens, worth around $1 billion, to its nonprofit foundation. When rank-and-file community members balked at this plan, the Arbitrum Foundation clarified that these funds were already being allocated\u2014and, indeed, had been spent. It was a lucky day for those folks who gave them money last year in a private transaction, and virtually nobody else who bought into the gold-plated resumes of its founding team and the characterizations of their project.\n\nQuite the arbitrage, indeed.\n\nScaling solutions that create more costs and hoops to jump through for users by issuing pernicious tokens aren\u2019t solutions at all. Ethereum will evolve once it weens off venture capitalists and embraces a model that seeks to disintermediate, rather than subsidize, the well-heeled financiers of Web2.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "title": "Ether is rallying ahead of major upgrade that will let holders more easily access their tokens - CNBC",
        "content": "Ethereum underwent a huge network upgrade called the merge which proponents say will make transactions much more energy efficient. Following the merge, ether prices have dropped following a huge run up ahead of the event. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nEther has spiked this week to a nine-month high, ahead of a major network upgrade that some crypto enthusiasts say will make the digital currency a more profitable long-term investment. The world's second-biggest cryptocurrency is up about 6% over the past three days, surpassing $1,900, while bitcoin is roughly flat over that stretch. Beginning next Wednesday, an upgrade to the blockchain, dubbed \"Shapella,\" will allow owners of ether to withdraw their assets. Up to this point, investors would have to use centralized exchanges like Coinbase or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like Lido, to essentially exchange their locked-up ether for a token of equivalent value. The recent rally has followed a similar pattern to past bouts of enthusiasm surrounding network upgrades. In September, ethereum ran up ahead of a historic transition to a more energy-efficient way of securing the network, called proof-of-stake. Ethereum previously had a vast network of miners all over the planet running highly specialized computers that crunched math equations in order to validate transactions. After the so-called \"Merge\" upgrade in September, ethereum migrated to a proof-of-stake system, swapping out miners for validators. Instead of running large banks of computers, validators leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Ether itself becomes a productive asset,\" said Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, regarding the September upgrade. \"It's not something you might just speculate on, but it's something that can earn returns.\" In the post-merge era, ether has taken on some characteristics of a traditional financial asset, paying interest to holders. \"It's probably the lowest-risk return inside of the ethereum ecosystem,\" said Ryan, adding that yield in other corners of DeFi involve smart contracts and other types of counter-party risk. So far this year, ether has underperformed bitcoin , but recent gains have helped to close the gap. Ether is up nearly 59% this year, versus bitcoin's gain of 70% in 2023. Currently, over 18 million ether tokens worth about $32.5 billion are staked, meaning that 15% of ether's total supply are considered locked assets. While the coming upgrade will unlock much of that value, giving holders more control over their assets, there's some concern that the release of so many tokens will have a flooding effect of sorts on the market. Even with capped withdrawals, some $2.4 billion worth of ether could hit the open market, K33 Research said in a note on Tuesday. \"A plunge is likely to happen shortly after the completion of the upgrade, as a huge amount of ETH will be unlocked, and many people will also be selling their ETH,\" said Ilya Volkov, who runs a blockchain-based fintech platform. Volkov said he's bullish over the long term.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe ratio between the open interest of ether put and call options reached its highest level since May on Tuesday, according to data presented by crypto data analytics and news firm The Block. That could signal a buildup of bearish bets leading up to the network upgrade. According to research from Bernstein, of the 18 million ether tokens locked on the blockchain, almost 70% are staked through protocols like Lido, creating a measure of liquidity for investors. \"Liquidity for 70% of staked ETH is not new, they could do it anyways,\" Bernstein wrote. The firm described the remaining 30% of holders as \"original believers,\" who are unlikely exit their positions at this price. Having the ability to deposit and withdraw tokens might encourage more investors to stake ether, and some analysts said they expect a significant influx of capital onto the network once it proves that money that's been staked can be taken out with relative ease.

        "content": "In brief Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork that took place in April 2023.\n\nThe Shanghai fork implemented EIP-4895, which allows validators to withdraw ETH that have been staked since as long ago as December 2020.\n\nAbout 14% of all ETH are currently staked, accounting for 16 million tokens and a current value of over $26 billion.\n\nThe Shanghai fork also has several other EIPs, mostly designed to reduce gas costs for Ethereum developers.\n\nThe fork notably does not include EIP-4844, which facilitates the \u201csharding\u201d of the Ethereum blockchain into multiple chains in order to facilitate scalability.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, also known as the Shapella upgrade, is a hard fork that took place on April 12, 2023. One of the biggest developments associated with the fork is that it enables stakers and validators to withdraw assets from the Beacon Chain\u2014a blockchain launched in 2020 to transition to the \"Merge.\" Shapella is a portmanteau word for \"Shanghai\" and \"Capella,\" two of the proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nBecause staked Ether accounts for about a seventh of the total supply of the token, or roughly 16 million coins, this has massive implications. The current value of all staked Ether is over $26 billion.\n\nEIP-4895\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most important development of the Shapella upgrade\u2014allowing validators to withdraw staked tokens\u2014is in line as Ethereum Improvement Proposal-4895, or EIP-4895. Validators have staked around 16 million ETH as a way of helping to secure the mechanism. Validators have been especially crucial to the Ethereum blockchain since September 2022, when the Merge began the process of shifting Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. According to the new rules post-Merge, validators that stake 32 ETH in the chain can then participate in validating blocks, and each staked ETH ups the likelihood of a validator receiving block rewards.\n\nThe Merge required that validators lock up their ETH as well as any rewards they earned until a later chain update. Even though the Merge took place in 2022, validators have actually been staking ETH since December 2020. It was at this time that the Beacon Chain, relying on proof-of-stake as a mechanism, was released.\n\nWhat it Means for Validators\n\nThe most notable development of the Shapella hard fork for validators is that they can finally unlock all of their staked ETH. So validators could theoretically get in line to recover their staked tokens and pull them from the system. Some analysts view this outcome as unlikely, however, given Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the DeFi space and the strong staking yield. Further, after the Shapella upgrade validators will be able to withdraw staked assets freely, so they won\u2019t have to worry about locking up a significant sum of money (32 ETH has been valued at as much as $150,000 or so at its peak) for an indeterminate amount of time.\n\nValidators that do wish to unstake ETH after the Shapella fork can do so in a couple of ways. One is to create a \u201cwithdrawal credential\u201d to unstake any rewards accrued in the last several years. The second and more consequential option is to exit the Beacon Chain completely by unstaking all 32 ETH.\n\nOther Improvements\n\nEIP-4895 is the key development for the Shapella fork, but there are several other smaller EIPs included as well. These other proposed improvements aim to reduce gas fees during periods of high activity to benefit Ethereum developers. They include EIP-3651, which proposes lowering gas costs related to Maximal Extractable Value payments when accessing the COINBASE address (COINBASE in this case is not related to the crypto exchange of the same name, but to software which allows developers to receive new tokens), EIP-3855, which aims to lower gas costs generally for developers, EIP-3860, which caps developer gas costs in certain cases, and EIP-6049, which addresses a similar concern.\n\nShapella remains a relatively small upgrade, particularly compared to the Merge. But it will have the potential for significant impact for those with staked ETH on the chain. And other upgrades to the Ethereum protocol are likely to come later in 2023, including some aiming to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine and another hoping to split the Ethereum blockchain into several different \u201cshards\u201d in order to enhance scalability. This last proposed improvement, known as EIP-4844, had at one point been considered for inclusion in the Shapella upgrade, though it was later pushed back.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has given another major breakout just a week before the Shanghai upgrade. As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading up by 5.68% at a price of $1,911 and a market cap of $230 billion.\n\nOn the weekly chart, ETH has outperformed the rest of the altcoins as well as Bitcoin with 7.3% gains. It is for the first time since August 2022 that the ETH price has surged past the $1,870 level.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment explains that this 8-month high comes due to the steady accumulation of ETH sharks over the past few months. It reported:\n\n\u201cEthereum jumped back over $1,870 today for the first time since August 17, 2022. This near 8-month high comes as sharks have been accumulating steadily since last summer. Addresses holding 100-10k $ETH have accumulated $4.24B in the past 9 months\u201d.\n\nWith today\u2019s price surge above $1,900, Ethereum (ETH) extends its 2023 gains to more than 60% closing the gap with Bitcoin. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted:\n\nOn-chain data reveals that the next critical resistance area is between $2,100 and $2,150, where over 200K addresses had previously purchased over 18M $ETH.\n\nEthereum Liquidity on the Downtrend\n\nAlthough the crypto market has registered a strong recovery this year in 2023, liquidity remains one of the major concerns for the top two digital assets \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain analytics firm Kaiko reported that ever since the FTX exchange collapse, the Ethereum market depth has been on a downtrend. The report notes:\n\nWhen charting the quantity of bids and asks within 2% of the mid price on USD/USDT order books, we can observe an unsurprisingly similar downwards trend. In mid-March, ETH market depth hits its lowest level since last May.\n\nWhen compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s drop in market depth is less extreme. While BTC\u2019s drop in market depth is at 50%, ETH\u2019s is at 41%. Kaiko adds: \u201cOverall, both assets have suffered in the aftermath of the FTX collapse and banking crisis, with fewer market makers supplying liquidity to order books\u201d."

        "title": "Ethereum rises against Bitcoin as shappella upgrade nears - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) rose by around 5% during the past week against Bitcoin (BTC) as the community awaits the highly anticipated Shappella upgrade.\n\nDuring the last 24 hours, ETH increased 2.11% against BTC, rising to as high as 0.067965 on Binance before retracing to 0.067965 at the time of writing.\n\nThe improved performance has seen ETH\u2019s dominance rise to 19.84% for the first time since March 12, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nETH\u2019s USD value rises to an 8-month high\n\nWhen ETH\u2019s value is denominated in U.S. Dollars, it rose above $1900 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nHowever, the asset has retraced to $1894 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nThe price movement continues its positive performance for 2023. ETH spiked 7.1% in the last seven days and has risen 22% over the past month. On the year-to-date metric, ETH is up roughly 60%.\n\nMarket sentiments surrounding the Shappella upgrade\n\nWith the Shappella upgrade confirmed for April 12, market sentiment surrounding ETH has turned largely positive, while some analysts believe that the move would increase the selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Shappella upgrade would allow Ethereum stakers to withdraw their staked tokens from the blockchain network.\n\nBlockchain analytical firm Nansen reported that the selling pressure on ETH from unstaking could be between $1.9 billion \u2013 $4.6 billion. According to the firm, this could hurt the asset because of the relatively thin liquidity of its spot markets.\n\nHowever, Nansen added that the positive effects of the Shanghai upgrade on ETH would likely counteract the initial selling pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, another blockchain analytical firm Santiment pointed out that ETH\u2019s supply on exchange is currently at its lowest \u2014 10.31%. The firm pointed out that investors are favoring self-custodial services for their assets.\n\nMarket analysts on Twitter have interpreted this to mean that holders strongly believe in ETH\u2019s potential as a store of value. Since ETH completed the merge event in 2022, the asset has turned deflationary, and the volume held by long-term investors has risen.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "ETH is trading above $1,900 for the first time since August 2022.\n\nEther is pumping despite ETH staking withdrawals being enabled next week.\n\nLSD tokens like LDO and RPL have also seen a significant increase in value in the past few days.\n\nThe crypto industry has been in one of the roughest bear markets ever. The majority of alternative tokens have plummeted more than 90% from their highs. Blue chip coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also dropped over 70%.\n\nHowever, the market has been improving lately. For example, ether has just broken $1,900 despite the Shapella upgrade happening next week.\n\nEthereum Breaks $1,900 Ahead of Shapella Upgrade\n\nEthereum\u2019s native currency has enjoyed a steady upside in the past few weeks. On Wednesday, ETH broke $1,900 for the first time since August 2022.\n\nETH is currently trading at $1,915, up 2.8% on the day and 7.6% on the week, according to data from CoinGecko. Ether\u2019s market cap has climbed over $230 billion and currently stands at $230.7 billion.\n\nETH price action. Source: CoinGecko.\n\nEther pumping is exciting to see, given the upcoming Shapella upgrade. Shapella is a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two Ethereum upgrades that are going to enable staked ETH withdrawals on April 12.\n\nSome believe that the enabling of ETH withdrawals will lead to a significant dump in ether\u2019s price. That\u2019s because there are currently 18 million ETH staked worth around $34.5 billion that will become available for withdrawing and, potentially, selling.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH staking withdrawals are bullish for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs), which offer a more convenient way of staking ETH. Many believe that at least some portion of the current locked ETH will be instead staked with LSDs.\n\nLSD Tokens Boom\n\nLSD governance tokens have also significantly increased in value in the past week.\n\nFor example, the most popular LSD protocol Lido\u2019s governance token, LDO, is up 6.5% on the day and 15.2% on the week. It\u2019s currently trading at $2.69 and is the 31st most valuable token.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s RPL is also trading at 6.5% higher than yesterday. One RPL is currently worth $48.26.\n\nThe increase in LSD token value aligns with the belief that the current stakers that have ETH locked will move it to LSDs. That\u2019s because LSDs offer a liquid token in exchange for ETH that can be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe rise in ETH\u2019s price can be a bull trap as weakening economic data points to a potential recession in the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nETH is one of the most desired assets in the crypto market. However, users should always do their own research before deciding where to invest and what asset to choose, especially in these uncertain economic times.\n\nRead more about Shapella\u2019s potential impact on the price of ETH:\n\nETH Staking Withdrawals Confirmed: Ethereum Devs Reveal Date\n\nRead more about a huge NFT sale on Polygon:\n\nPolygon Sees Biggest 24-Hour NFT Sale with y00ts Fetching 75 ETH"

        "content": "27 Ethereum projects have launched MEV Blocker, a solution to reduce maximally extractable value (MEV), or Ethereum's invisible tax. MEV Blocker is a free tool developed to counter MEV bots that hijack transactions and inflate prices for users. It sends at least 90% of profits back to users and can protect them from frontrunning and sandwiching when using any Ethereum DApp.\n\nOver 27 prominent Ethereum projects have come together to launch MEV Blocker, a solution that aims to tackle and minimize the amount of value extracted from their users. MEV, or maximally extractable value, is a tax imposed on decentralized finance (DeFi) users on transactions. MEV bots can hijack transactions midway, such as Ether (ETH) trades, nonfungible token (NFT) purchases, and ENS registrations, and inflate prices for the users.\n\nMEV Blocker was jointly developed by CoW Swap, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build as a free and censorship-resistant tool to counter this \"$1.3 billion dollar problem\" persistent across the Ethereum ecosystem. In total, 27 Ethereum projects joined the initiative as launch partners, including Balancer, Gnosis DAO, Shapeshift, and StakeDAO, to name a few.\n\nExplaining the intention behind launching MEV Blocker, Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, CEO of Gnosis stated: \"With the launch of MEV Blocker, users can profit from the backrunning opportunities they create. Today all of that money is taken by the searcher, but why shouldn't it be split with the people who create the value?\"\n\nMEV Blocker can be added as a custom RPC endpoint to a crypto wallet, which, in turn, can protect users from frontrunning and sandwiching when using any Ethereum DApp. According to the official announcement, MEV Blocker sends at least 90% of the profits from winning bids back to users and 10% to validators as a reward \u2014 thus giving \"power back to Ethereum users.\"\n\nThis initiative comes at a time when entrepreneurs are attempting to reduce the taxation on users. Despite this, the excitement around the upcoming Shanghai and Capella upgrades resulted in a bull sprint for ETH. On April 5, Ether breached $1,900 for the first time in over seven months.\n\nWhile MEV Blocker is a step towards mitigating the impact of MEV on DeFi users, it is important to note that the price of ETH dropped sharply following the execution of the Merge on Sept. 15, 2022. This highlights the complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem and the need for ongoing solutions to address the challenges it faces.\n\nIn conclusion, the launch of MEV Blocker by 27 Ethereum projects is a welcome development for DeFi users. It has the potential to significantly reduce the impact of MEV and give power back to Ethereum users. However, it is important to continue developing solutions that address the complexities of the Ethereum ecosystem and ensure its continued growth and success."

        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) price had been battling the $1,850 resistance level, but it broke through on April 4 when Ether rallied to a seven-month high above $1,900. Recently there has been a lot of speculation on Ether price catalysts. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s possible to identify any fundamental factors behind the price movement.\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai hard fork could be one factor in Ether\u2019s recent bullish momentum. On April 12, the ability for validators to withdraw their deposits opens, giving staking participants freedom of movement but also creating a sell-off risk for Ether.\n\nThere are now 17.81 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, though some safeguards have been put in place to prevent a flood of Ether from disrupting the market. For example, because there is a daily limit of 2,200 withdrawals, the maximum daily unlocks are 70,000 ETH.\n\nScalability and selfish validator risks are still present\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai fork, however, does not address some of the most pressing issues currently plaguing the Ethereum network. Scalability continues to be a major issue for most users, as the average transaction fee has hovered around $5 in recent weeks, driving users away from decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nFurthermore, the current consensus mechanism favors rogue miners who outperform other network participants, a phenomenon known as miner extractable value (MEV). They can quickly duplicate all winning deals from the mempool and execute their transactions ahead of others by ultimately deciding which transactions are completed in the block.\n\nA recent example, highlighted on April 3 by security firm CertiK, resulted in $25 million in losses to arbitrage bots that were attempting to purchase and flip tokens in a short period of time for a profit as a selfish validator replaced the transactions.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the top 10 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw an 18% drop in active addresses, possibly reflecting investor dissatisfaction with the ongoing issues with miners front-running and high transaction costs.\n\n30-day Dapp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,850 level can effectively become a support according to ETH investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH derivatives show no improvement despite the price rally\n\nThe annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (backwardation) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nDespite ETH\u2019s 35% rally in 25 days, the Ether futures premium has been unable to break above the 5% neutral threshold. However, the absence of leverage longs demand does not always imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. For instance, in bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nRelated: Ethereum projects unite to protect users from MEV-induced high prices\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nSince April 1, the delta skew has been close to zero, indicating a similar demand for protective put options and neutral-to-bearish call instruments. Since March 22, when Ether options last showed extreme optimism, this has been the norm.\n\nEven after adjusting for the additional negative pressure from the Shanghai hard fork token unlock, Ether faces serious problems due to scalability and transaction front-runs. As a result, derivatives and on-chain DApp metrics increase the likelihood of ETH falling below $1,850.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is one of the most popular and widely-used blockchain protocols. While its native coin ether (ETH) can be used to make payments like cryptocurrencies such as litecoin (LTC) or bitcoin cash (BCH), Ethereum was designed to be a far more flexible and feature-rich blockchain protocol. Ethereum allows for the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It also allows for tokens to be built on top of its core protocol.\n\nOne of the most innovative ERC standards to date is the ERC-4337 standard. Like earlier token standard releases, it was designed to enable additional features and options that weren\u2019t possible using the previously available token options.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s tokens are one reason it has garnered such a sizeable share of the crypto market. These Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) tokens create concrete rules and frameworks that allow ERC tokens to be sent and received on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the most popular token standards is ERC-20, which allows you to issue new fungible tokens on the Ethereum protocol. Another popular option is the ERC-721 token standard, which allows for the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This is one reason why many of the most popular NFT collections and fungible tokens are found on Ethereum.\n\nThere are a number of ERC token standards (ERC-777, ERC-2222, and more) on Ethereum, with new suggestions called Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) continually being proposed and discussed. Some EIPs are ultimately rejected, while others end up being released on Ethereum. Once an EIP is improved and implemented, it becomes an ERC (ERC-4337 was previously EIP-4337).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFunded through Ethereum Foundation grants, the launch of ERC-4337 was announced at WalletCon 2023. Let\u2019s discover what ERC-4337 enables on the Ethereum protocol \u2014 and why the community decided it needed to be approved.\n\nERC-4337 Brings New Features to Ethereum\n\nERC-4337 makes enhanced crypto transaction options possible. To differentiate it from standard crypto transactions, these ERC-4337 transactions are referred to as UserOperations. This sort of blockchain enhancement would typically be done through a blockchain update and not through a new ERC standard release (more on that later).\n\n\n\nA core new feature is that it allows for account abstraction on Ethereum in a decentralized manner (more on that below). Additionally, it allows for dApp developers to partially or fully subsidize transaction fees for users; on many dApps the user must pay these fees. ERC-4337 also allows users to pay fees with ERC-20 tokens (as opposed to ETH). This should create a decentralized fee market for smart contract operations. On top of that, it enables some privacy-preserving features and supports the use of aggregated signatures. ERC-4337 is also available on networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) such as Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and several others.\n\nFor sending transactions, ERC-4337 enables you to bundle (combine) multiple transactions to save time and lower transaction fee costs. You will also be able to pre-approve transactions in an automated way. Most current wallets require you to manually approve every transaction. Now, you can create review processes that require additional manual approval only for certain transactions \u2014 such as transactions that send over a specified amount of crypto (more than $1,000 USD equivalent, for example).\n\nERC-4337\u2019s User-Friendly Wallet Features\n\nThrough a process known as account abstraction, ERC-4337 allows for the use of smart accounts that are expected to be more user friendly for beginners. This update is expected to catalyze crypto adoption as technical barriers to entry are continually being lowered \u2014 or removed. While somewhat technical, in essence, account abstraction turns a user\u2019s crypto wallet into a smart contract-enabled account. For this reason, many don\u2019t call ERC-4337 a \u201ctoken standard\u201d and simply call it an ERC standard; it doesn't really fit categorically with the previous ERC token standards.\n\nOne core benefit is how account abstraction simplifies both the use and creation of wallets. Prior to ERC-4337, users generally had to memorize a seed phrase (or store this phrase offline) to create a backup of their crypto wallet. Through abstraction, a crypto wallet\u2019s private keys can be stored on a smartphone\u2019s standard security module. This would create what some would consider a hardware wallet within their phone \u2014 although some express concerns about a smartphone\u2019s vulnerabilities through the touchscreen or some other avenue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nERC-4337 allows for the use of smart accounts that are expected to be more user friendly for beginners.\n\nERC-4337 allows you to sign transactions biometrically through a fingerprint or face scan as an additional safety measure. Should you lose your phone, you could regain access to your account through the use of time-locked social recovery. This requires multiple users to sign a recovery transaction through a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet. You could give a group of trusted friends or family the ability to regenerate your account. If that doesn\u2019t suit you, you could pay a commercial third-party service to recover your account should the need arise.\n\nLosing their wallet and the associated crypto \u2014 and being unable to recover it \u2014 is one fear people have when it comes to using non-custodial crypto wallets. There are horror stories of people losing large sums of crypto in this way. This safeguard is designed to give you some of the features and peace of mind you may have when using a bank \u2014 without having to trust a bank \u2014 thus preserving the core crypto ethos of trustlessness and permissionlessness.\n\n\n\nIn general, the implementation of account abstraction is intended to provide two benefits for wallets:\n\nMake crypto wallets more user friendly. Prevent the loss of crypto or crypto wallet access.\n\nWhy Not Update the Underlying Ethereum Protocol?\n\nFor many blockchain protocols, changes require a code update to the blockchain that is called a fork. Oftentimes, there is heated debate about whether to implement changes to a blockchain. These updates sometimes lead to a blockchain splitting into two separate networks. Called a hard fork, this has led to the 2017 Bitcoin fork that created Bitcoin Cash and even a previous splitting of Ethereum (which created Ethereum Classic). The other fork option is a soft fork. Soft forks are backwards compatible \u2014 giving users and validators the option to implement an update or not.\n\nWith the time and work that has gone into transitioning Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network (known as The Merge), the proposal for ERC-4337 noted that it may be some time before Ethereum goes through another significant update. For that reason, ERC-4337 was implemented as a way to enable updates that don\u2019t change the core Ethereum protocol. Taking this innovative approach has ostensibly saved a lot of time and effort. In addition, ERC-4337 will not create compatibility issues in the way some blockchain forks have.\n\nBy taking these changes to a higher-abstraction layer (the ERC-4337 standard itself), it negates the need to implement changes to the core Ethereum protocol (the Ethereum blockchain). While this has sped up the implementation of account abstraction on Ethereum, the goal is to eventually implement this feature into the primary Ethereum protocol.\n\nWhat ERC-4337 Means for Ethereum Adoption\n\nWith its notable medley of ERC-20 tokens, the popularity of ERC-721 NFTs, and the outsized presence of Ethereum within decentralized finance (DeFi), ERC-4337 will likely help Ethereum remain one of the premier blockchains as the enhanced functionality will benefit all of these disparate \u2014 but connected \u2014 niches within the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith crypto wallet security and user friendliness at the forefront of the ERC-4337 update, we may end up seeing newcomers to the crypto space choose to start with Ethereum (and EVM-compatible blockchains) as opposed to other blockchain ecosystems. Enticed by the core benefits and ease of use enabled by ERC-4337, this may allow Ethereum to keep \u2014 or grow \u2014 the already sizable market share that it occupies within the wider crypto market. For other blockchains to remain competitive and gain market share, they may need to incorporate their own versions of higher-level account abstraction. This will let them appeal to new crypto users that want to experience Web3 with the ease of use and simplicity more commonly found in the Web2 experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCheat Sheet:\n\nERC-4337 allows you to bundle and automate transactions on Ethereum.\n\nERC-4337 allows for social recovery of crypto wallets, biometric authentication of transactions, and the ability to store a wallet\u2019s private keys on a smartphone security module.\n\nThe features made possible by the ERC-4337 standard are also available on EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard adds new features to Ethereum without the need for a major Ethereum blockchain protocol update.\n\nThe goal is to eventually provide the features made possible through ERC-4337 through a major Ethereum protocol update."

Bram also has his own YouTube channel with over 30,000 subscribers.\n\nWe kick things off by getting Bram\u2019s opinion on the most exciting thing happening in decentralized finance (DeFi) right now and follow it up by discussing the most important thing happening in DeFi.\n\nWe then get into Ethereum layer-2 protocols like Arbitrum and whether Bram is bullish on them or whether he has his eye set on something else.\n\nWith the next big Ethereum upgrade just around the corner, we ask Bram what his perspective is on the Shanghai upgrade and the potential of liquid staking derivatives. Is ut going to be as big as everyone hopes and thinks it will be? Does the unlocking of Ether (ETH) represent the offering of some new innovation in the crypto and DeFi space?\n\nBy the end of the chat with Bram, we hope the audience will have gotten a better understanding of the most exciting and important developments in DeFi, the potential outcomes of the Ethereum Shanghai unlocks, and the longer-term impact of this on the liquid staking derivatives space, and also the development within the Ethereum layer-2 platform.\n\nWe cover all this and more, so make sure to stay tuned until the end. Market Talks airs every Thursday. Each week, it features interviews with some of the most influential and inspiring people from the crypto and blockchain industry.

        "content": "Free MEV Blocker RPC \u201cPays Users To Protect Themselves\u201d\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nMore than 30 teams representing the Ethereum ecosystem have joined forces to combat Maximal Extractable Value, on-chain arbitrage techniques that quietly siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from users\u2019 trades.\n\nOn Wednesday, the consortium launched MEV Blocker, software designed to redistribute 90% of the profits from MEV capture back to ordinary Ethereum users.\n\n\u201cWhen DeFi users make trades\u2026, their transactions are at risk of being hijacked by MEV bots \u2013 resulting in significantly worse prices for the users,\u201d MEV Blocker said.\n\nMEV Blocker submits transactions to a private network of searchers \u2013 network participants that monitor Ethereum\u2019s mempool for profitable MEV opportunities and run bots to execute them \u2013 who compete for MEV on the condition that they share profits with Ethereum users.\n\n\u201cMEV Blocker is a free RPC endpoint that *pays users* to protect themselves from MEV across a wide variety of use cases in DeFi, NFTs, and dApps,\u201d tweeted CoW Swap.\n\nThe software redistributes 90% of the profits generated back to users, with searchers claiming the remaining 10%. It was developed by CoW Swap in partnership with Agnostic Relay and Beaver Build. Other launch partners include Balancer, Gnosis, 1inch, and Shapeshift.\n\nThe Dark Forest of MEV\n\nMEV bot operators, or \u201csearchers,\u201d use arbitrage techniques such as transaction front-running, reordering, or sandwiching to extract profits when users submit transactions to Ethereum\u2019s public mempool.\n\nThe strategy is particularly lucrative when targeting DEX trades but results in on-chain traders paying the worst possible price for transactions.\n\nFlashbots, an MEV research team, estimates ordinary Ethereum users lost more than $617M to MEV since the start of 2021, with searchers raking in $5.1M over just the past month.\n\nEthereum Validator Slashed For Attacking MEV Bot\n\nThe launch comes just days after an Ethereum validator stole $25M in a malicious attack targeting an MEV searcher.\n\nThe validator funded their node using Aztec\u2019s confidential transfer feature roughly three weeks earlier. OtterSec, a blockchain security firm, concluded the validator\u2019s decision to hide the origin of their funds suggests they planned the attack prior to launching a node.\n\n\u201cNow, MEV extractors will have to wonder, \u2018is this validator malicious?\u2019\u201d tweeted Hudson Jameson, an Ethereum developer who previously worked for Flashbots. \u201cThere was an assumption, up to this point, that validators would not interfere with bundles.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum network slashed the malicious validator for proposing conflicting blocks the next day. However, Mudit Gupta, CISO at Polygon, slammed the initial slashing penalty imposed on the validator as being too lenient.\n\n\u201cThe initial slashing penalty is 1 ETH,\u201d Gupta tweeted. \u201c25,000,000 profit for 1,800 penalty? Sure, I\u2019ll take that trade. The economic incentives are broken here\u2026\u201d"

        "content": "After what seemed like an eternity, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, and Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of ethereum, have picked up where they left off in discussing bridge security.\n\nYakovenko Bridge claims to have pondered the issue for a year until he may have stumbled onto the answer.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1643838814564286465\n\nYou might also like: Understanding the Interoperability Principles of Blockchain Technology\n\nA social layer of the bridge could be the solution\n\nIn late May 2022, blockchain activists were in a dialogue on potentially detecting and preventing efforts to cheat a system that enables funds to move between multiple networks by illegally utilizing the same money multiple times. This system allows funds to move between networks to facilitate transactions.\n\nThe conversation between Yakovenko and Buterin came to a standstill at that time. Nonetheless, all parties concluded that, in principle, a social layer of bridge management could address any difficulties.\n\nOn the other hand, both individuals admitted that they did not know how safe such a system would be, particularly when subjected to a 51% assault.\n\nYakovenko proposed a trust-minimized bridge between independent layer 1 blockchains to solve this problem. The design of this bridge ensures that local users can pull their bridged assets back into the local chain, even if the small chain has an unfair majority, withholds data, or conducts a 51% attack. The community well received Yakovenko\u2019s solution.\n\nBecause what if 51% attack \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 31, 2022\n\nYou may get a comprehensive explanation of Yakovenko\u2019s bridge in a tweet that the co-founder of Solana posted. There should be an auction to choose who can address issues as issues develop. This is the core idea behind the proposed solution.\n\nAlso, system customers must hang tight until they get confirmation before accessing their funds. People can file a challenge to get access to their data if anything goes wrong. Vitalik Buterin still needs to respond to the proposition made by his colleague.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Experts Expect Ethereum (ETH) To Break $2,000 Shortly, Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a strong upswing, outperforming Bitcoin, which has been able to extend its dominance on the crypto market in recent weeks. Even Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing sideways phase does not seem to worry Ethereum investors, who managed a breakout above $1,900 today.\n\nThe psychologically important price target of $2,000 is thus within reach. Eight days before the highly anticipated Shapella update on April 12, the Ethereum chart looks extremely bullish.\n\nMoreover, the trading month of April is statistically one of the most bullish months of the year for the crypto market. Also, ETH is getting tailwinds from the continued weakness of the US Dollar Index (DXY).\n\nAnalysts Predict Ethereum To Break Above $2,000\n\nJonah Van Bourg, head of trading at the crypto asset trading firm Cumberland, published a very bullish analysis on Ethereum via Twitter. As the analyst explains, ETH (unlike Bitcoin) has just broken out of its trading range, which has been in place since mid-March.\n\nAnd the fact that this is happening against the backdrop of a generally bearish regulatory climate makes it even more special. Moreover, various metrics confirm the strong bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cDoge-themed redesign of Twitter notwithstanding, ETH gas spiked to 68 gwei yesterday \u2013 the highest we\u2019ve seen since the Luna crisis of 2Q22 and its associated flurry of DeFi activity,\u201d Van Bourg declared, pointing to the Shapella update as an actually bearish event.\n\nAfter more than two years, numerous holders will be able to access their staked ETH for the first time, theoretically making large amounts of out-of-the-money ETH units liquid and available for sale. \u201cThat said, the exit queue is empty,\u201d Van Bourg noted.\n\nAlso bullish is that leverage in the futures market is at a minimum and robust price action suggests that positioning is low and excess longs have already been flushed.\n\nAccording to the Cumberland analyst, Ethereum\u2019s strength could also be an early indicator for an altcoin rally if the recent past repeats itself. Most recently, it has been seen time and time again how the initial BTC strength spilled over to ETH and then to altcoins.\n\nThus, all eyes are on ETH at the moment \u2013 a solid retracement would represent an important leading indicator and potentially herald a lucrative trading environment.\n\nCup & Handle Pattern Signals Buying Opportunity\n\nAksel Kibar, a chartered market technician (CMT) has tweeted that ETH/USD could be two days ahead of the BTC/USD trading pair, according to the bullish flag chart pattern breakout that ETH has is forming, while Bitcoin is trailing.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum has also formed a Cup & Handle pattern over four months on the 1-day chart, as Kibar notes. As the name suggests, the chart pattern resembles a cup with a handle, with the cup shaped like a \u201cU\u201d and the handle drifting slightly downward.\n\nThe pattern is considered a bullish signal that extends an uptrend and is usually seen as a buying opportunity.\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $1,912, up 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCompared to Yuga Labs\u2019 primary Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the grimier, sometimes psychedelic siblings in the later and larger Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) set aren\u2019t considered nearly as valuable or prominent\u2014and their lower floor price has mirrored that sentiment.\n\nBut Novel Labs and Mutant Cartel founder Lior Messika\u2014who\u2019s also a Mutant Ape collector himself and a Yuga Labs investor through his VC firm Eden Block\u2014is leaning into that feeling of being an outcast among outcasts and turning it into Web3 gaming lore, with Serum City.\n\nNovel Labs is working with Faraway\u2014developer of the Solana-based game Mini Royale: Nations\u2014to create a city builder game called Serum City on Ethereum that will use ApeCoin as its primary in-game currency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real gap here for Mutants,\u201d Messika told Decrypt in an interview of his perception of the broader Yuga Labs ecosystem.\n\nA screenshot from Serum City. Image: Novel Labs\n\nIn Serum City, Mutant Apes are the main characters, and MAYC is among a few NFT collections that will provide owners access to the game. Bored Ape holders will, as well, along with owners of Novel Labs\u2019 own derivative Genesis Oath and Mutant Hound NFT collections that aren\u2019t official Yuga creations.\n\nOwning one of those NFTs is required to play the game at launch, although a Faraway representative confirmed to Decrypt that Serum City will gradually open up access with each new in-game season of content.\n\nBuilding Serum City\n\nSerum City will continue and expand upon Mutant Cartel\u2019s lore, which Messika has developed and published in the form of comic strips and short video clips over the past 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of nerds coming up with cool stories about our Mutants,\u201d Messika said. \u201cThe cool thing is that we\u2019re now incorporating a lot of our community members, and people who have been playing, into our canon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Mutant Cartel never sleeps !howl pic.twitter.com/9cbdY0bFEQ \u2014 Mutant Cartel (@mutant_cartel) February 28, 2023\n\nSerum City is set in a dystopian world where Bored Apes are the \u201cruling class\u201d and the Mutant Apes are the underlings, relegated to the fringes of society because they\u2019ve consumed the Serum. The main storyline explores the Mutant Cartel Expanded Universe and the characters Blaksoot and Darkfang, according to a statement.\n\nFaraway co-founder Alex Paley told Decrypt that Serum City will have an \u201cillustrated\u201d or comic book-inspired aesthetic, as seen in the first in-game screenshot embedded above.\n\n\u201cThis is more like a transmedia type of play,\u201d Paley added. \u201cIt\u2019s a game, but it\u2019s also a story.\u201d\n\nFaraway and Novel Labs haven't shared a lot of gameplay details, but Messika has joined other Web3 game devs in attempting to push back against the simplistic and superficial nature of early NFT-based games. He suggests that Serum City will be a richer and more appealing play experience.\n\n\u201cWe believe that, frankly, the reason why a lot of games have not reached the kind of adoption that we all have been hoping for is that many of them were just not that deep,\u201d Messika said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not that fun.\u201d\n\nApe expansion\n\nWhile Yuga Labs is wholly unaffiliated with Serum City, the $4 billion startup lets NFT holders use and commercialize their owned artwork. That open policy towards its IP has enabled countless Ape holders to build brands around everything from packaged goods to restaurants to video games like this one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in touch with them,\u201d Messika said of his relationship with Yuga Labs. But he added that Novel Labs \u201cdidn\u2019t need to check in\u201d with Yuga before building Serum City, given the license tied to Bored Ape and Mutant Ape NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA screenshot from Serum City. Image: Novel Labs\n\n\u201cWe are, in a sense, a great example of what permissionless innovation\u2014by Yuga\u2019s standards and vision\u2014really looks like,\u201d Messika said, \u201cand we\u2019re really proud of that.\u201d\n\nWhile Messika is determined to provide players with plenty of lore and narrative, Serum City players will also be able to create their own stories and game assets, and buy in-game (off-chain) currencies like gems using ApeCoin.\n\nSerum City\u2019s developers also see the game as a step towards interoperability\u2014a key selling point that Web3 gaming advocates frequently tout, but has faced skepticism due to few prominent working examples to date.\n\nIn this case, items crafted in Serum City will be NFTs that can be transferred and used in future Novel Labs games in the future. Furthermore, the Faraway Developer Platform potentially opens up expanded interoperability down the line, with a press release claiming plans for \u201ccross-game and cross-universe events\u201d once Serum City launches in August.\n\nA screenshot from Serum City. Image: Novel Labs\n\nThose interoperability plans are also the main reason why Serum City\u2019s assets will be on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. While some other games have opted for Ethereum scaling networks like Polygon or Immutable X to avoid fees, Faraway and Novel Labs see greater benefit to being on Ethereum proper.\n\n\u201cIt was important for us to make the game on the most interoperable blockchain, which is ETH. So, is it expensive in terms of the gas fees? Definitely,\u201d Paley said. \u201cBut is it worth it to have the ultimate interoperable asset, as a user or a player, [and] for me to say that your asset is interoperable everywhere? I think as a player, the answer is yes.\u201d"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is bullish on XRP and says one Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is about to surge.\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 194,400 Twitter followers that he is picking a support level for payments platform Ripple\u2019s utility token XRP using the Fibonacci retracement tool.\n\nThe trader is predicting an XRP retracement to the $0.46 level, the 0.5 Fibonacci level, and then a move to the upside.\n\n\u201cXRP: I\u2019m bidding $0.466 for the standard.\u201d\n\nXRP is trading for $0.50 at time of writing.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is the decentralized borrowing protocol Liquity (LQTY), which he says is forming a bottom and could soon break out.\n\n\u201cLQTY: Still think this is one of the better-looking swing trade charts out there IMO. Looks like accumulation / big compression with all EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) and lots of volume transacted here. Buy and hold for a bit and watch it go up. One downside is it could take a while though.\u201d\n\nLiquity is worth $2.46 at time of writing.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Ethereum, saying a bottom may have formed on the ETH/BTC chart. He says that based on historic patterns after a bottom ETH and other altcoins generally surge in the near term. However, he also predicts a dip for ETH/BTC in the long term.\n\n\u201cETH: Checking out the ETH/BTC chart here, if this one has short-term bottomed then we should see an altcoin run. I don\u2019t know if this is going to happen here because I ultimately believe Ethereum eventually goes to the .055 level or lower.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for $0.66 BTC, or $1,869.\n\nHe notes that if a bottom is forming, it could chop around at the current price level for a while longer before a surge.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while to form good strong bottoms. Days and weeks chopping is healthy and the longer the consolidation, the stronger the move. We\u2019ve chopped here for about two weeks now and let\u2019s see if this is a short term bottom or not.\u201d\n\nLastly, Sherpa weighs in on Dogecoin (DOGE) following the meme token\u2019s rally by more than 30% after its most famous supporter, tech billionaire Elon Musk, changed Twitter\u2019s icon to the DOGE logo. He predicts Dogecoin will soon give up its gains.\n\n\u201cDOGE: To be determined if this pump has any legs; typically we see some sort of illiquid move up followed by a swift retrace. First resistance area approaching; IMO this goes all the way down after the Twitter icon is changed.\u201d\n\nDOGE is swapping hands at $0.0952 at time of writing, down from Tuesday\u2019s high of $0.102.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies delivered huge gains for investors during the previous bull market. Yet, more than a few got wiped out as they plunged from their late-2021 peaks. But with 2023 looking like it could be the start of the thaw following crypto winter, let\u2019s look at the best cryptos for day trading.\n\nWhen it comes to ultra-short-term trading, nothing trumps liquidity. In that sense, the best cryptos for day trading are highly liquid and generally well-known. The smaller, low-volume cryptos can work during trending markets over a longer holding period. However, for in-and-out scalps, we need liquid cryptos.\n\nSo, you\u2019re likely to recognize all of the best cryptos for day trading below.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBTC Bitcoin $28,031.86 ETH Ethereum $1,871.62 DOGE Dogecoin $0.08\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nman in glasses holding a coin that has the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) logo\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn the sense of size and liquidity, how can we not kick off the list with Bitcoin (BTC-USD)? Bitcoin is the largest crypto in the world, with a market cap of around $540 billion. It\u2019s the most well-known cryptocurrency out there, garnering the bulk of the industry\u2019s attention. Over the past three months, its trading volume has averaged $25.8 billion a day.\n\nDay traders focused on cryptos must keep Bitcoin on their watchlist, even if they\u2019re not trading it. That\u2019s because the movement in Bitcoin impacts other cryptocurrencies, similar to the way the movement in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) can impact the rest of the tech sector.\n\nBitcoin had a stellar first quarter. According to Finbold, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s return on investment (ROI) was 170.32% more compared to the average of five major stock indexes. During the quarter, Bitcoin\u2019s returns stood at 69.4%, while average returns for the indexes stood at 5.5%.\u201d\n\nThe bulls are certainly in charge at the moment, buying the dips and sending the crypto soaring higher. The next important level to watch is $30,000, which is just 7% above where BTC currently trades.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nA concept image of mining an Ethereum (ETH) token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) also had a great Q1, rallying about 50% in the first three months of the year and more than doubling off of its 2022 low. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, with a market cap of about $224.5 billion.\n\nEthereum is also one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies, with an average daily trading volume of $8.6 billion. That makes the token one of the best cryptos for day trading.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Ethereum deserves every bit as much attention as Bitcoin gets given that it has such a wide range of applications. It\u2019s faster when it comes to transactions, and its smart contracts offer real-world solutions as technology continues to evolve.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDogecoin Cryptocurrency\n\nSource: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs silly as Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is, it\u2019s on the list of the best cryptos for day trading due to its large following and ample liquidity. After the tethered crypto holdings, Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is next on the list for daily trading volume.\n\nIt has traded an average of $604.6 million a day over the past three months and commands a market cap of $11.9 billion. It may have started off as a joke, but its large following isn\u2019t.\n\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Twitter CEO Elon Musk has a fascination with the cryptocurrency. In fact, he recently integrated the logo into the Twitter platform, adding a quick $4 billion to the token\u2019s market value.\n\nDay traders thrive on volatility and massive moves like this. While I don\u2019t personally believe in the long-term viability of Dogecoin, this one puts together enough moves for day traders to take advantage of.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum impressed the buyers as it recorded its latest 2023 high of $1,921 on April 05. Will the Shanghai upgrade, hype pump the market and take ETH above $2K.\n\nOverall cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 1.44% to $1.21 trillion today. The bullish momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum lead to this growth in the market. However, BTC already reached its new 2023 high of $29,184 on March 30 and ETH did the same today.\n\nEthereum today overcame its key seven-month resistance at $1,900 and headed for the next conceptual round level of $2,000. The Shanghai upgrade and rise in Bitcoin price are the two vital reasons behind the ETH surge.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade, the latest hard fork of Ethereum, scheduled for April 12, 2023, further implements the key Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4895 and several others. As a result of this EIP-4895 implementation, validators and stakeholders in Ethereum will be able to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade also known as the Shapella upgrade, a combination of words \u201cShanghai\u201d and Capella\u201d, two of the anticipated Ethereum growth proposals.\n\nThe rise in the price of bitcoin since last night could also be another reason for the rise in ETH. Thus at that time the price of the ETH/BTC pair increased by 1.76% to 0.6724 satoshis.\n\nThe Ethereum price is currently sitting at $1,912 against the USDT pair along with 2.41% overnight gain. Thus market capitalization reached $230.3 billion.\n\nAmidst the bullish momentum, ETH price climbed above the 400-day simple moving average on the daily price chart. Furthermore, ETH bulls attempt to propel the asset further up the ascending parallel channel (mentioned above the chart) to record another higher peak."

        "content": "Support for Ethereum (ETH) has been added to the beta version of SubQuery, the global Web3 data indexing toolkit. SubQuery has already shown that it is quicker than The Graph (GRT) and provides Ethereum developers with another decentralized option with the imminent launch of the SubQuery Network.\n\nInstead of developing indexing solutions, developers can concentrate on product development and user experience thanks to SubQuery\u2019s proprietary API, which abstracts the backend and frees users from the burden of designing their own indexing systems, as per information about its Web3 data indexing launch shared with Finbold on April 5.\n\nIn particular, the decentralized data indexing solution gives developers the tools they need to quickly organize and query on-chain data for their protocols and apps. Avalanche, Flare, Cosmos (Ethermint), and Polkadot (FrontierEVM) are among the networks that will benefit from this new integration, which expands on SubQuery\u2019s current support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for other networks.\n\nSubQuery is actively working on making the protocol decentralized and tokenized so they may launch the SubQuery Network. From the get-go, the SubQuery Network will be able to index Ethereum projects, as well as those from any other supported Layer-1, and provide services to the worldwide community based on this data.\n\nThe Founder and CEO of SubQuery, Sam Zou, said:\n\n\u201cEthereum has been on our radar since day one. Our experienced engineering team has put a lot of hard work into this integration, so that we can guarantee Ethereum developers will have a smooth and seamless experience indexing with SubQuery\u2019s open-source SDK, tools, and documentation. We can\u2019t wait to collaborate with teams building on Ethereum with the power of our fast, flexible, and universal indexer.\u201d\n\nSubQuery is 1.85 times faster than The Graph\n\nThird-party services like The Graph for Ethereum ecosystem developers had previously met data indexing needs. However, SubQuery is already 1.85 times quicker than The Graph for common projects like the default Ethereum Name Service project, with just beta support.\n\nSubQuery is 1.85x faster than The Graph. Source: SubQuery\n\nSubQuery can decrease the number of costly database writes by using multi-threading and optimizing the store. Developers may reduce the time between iterations and the release of new features by shortening the sync times.\n\nUnlike The Graph, SubQuery will not be sunsetted. It improves upon existing decentralized indexing solutions by giving developers more freedom to host their own projects and more control over those by supporting large-scale projects in its managed service, which hosts large-scale infrastructure and processes millions of daily requests."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in popularity in recent years, with the sector currently worth a little over $1.2 trillion. Unfortunately, network security has lagged behind the expanding industry, leading to an increase in malicious network attacks.\n\nRecently, the crypto community was left shocked after an Ethereum validator stole crypto worth millions from a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot \u2014 a software designed to churn profits by rearranging blocks. Furthermore, the culprit is yet to be apprehended and currently holds $20 million worth of stolen tokens.\n\nBut before addressing this issue, let\u2019s discuss what sandwich attacks are and how they are carried out.\n\nHow are sandwich attacks carried out?\n\nSandwich attacks are a form of malicious blockchain attack that takes advantage of smart contract vulnerabilities. A sandwich attack, simply put, traps a user\u2019s transaction between two transactions, which is then further manipulated to gain profits. Such assaults are frequently carried out with the assistance of MEV (maximum extractable value) bots operating in a network.\n\nBefore we take a look at an example, it\u2019s important to understand how MEV bots function since they are a crucial component of sandwich attacks. MEV bots are automated software designed to exploit a network by detecting profitable transactional opportunities. They can initiate \u201csandwich trades\u201d by spotting traders attempting to purchase tokens and slipping in between to make a profit. Such a method is often used by validators.\n\nFor example, if a trader places a transaction to buy $5,000 worth of ETH, the MEV bot detects it and places a transaction to buy ETH just before the trader can execute the transaction. These back-to-back buy transactions can inflate the price of ETH. The MEV bot then places a sell transaction after the trader\u2019s buy transaction to make a profit from the price jump.\n\nCertain inefficiencies with how blockchains function make it possible for such attacks to occur. For instance, on the blockchain, transactions with the highest gas fees are picked up first to be added to the block. Thus, MEV places the first transaction with higher gas fees than the victim and places the second transaction with lower gas fees to make sure the first malicious transaction is picked before the victim\u2019s, followed by the second malicious transaction.\n\nHow a rogue Ethereum validator pulled a $25 million theft?\n\nIn a recent sandwich attack, a bad player pretended to be an Ethereum validator by depositing 32 ETH just 18 days before the planned theft. The rogue validator then caused an MEV bot to launch a sandwich assault, replacing several automated trades and stealing $25 million.\n\nIt was later reported that eight addresses from the KuCoin exchange were involved in executing the said sandwich attacks on Uniswap liquidity pools. According to blockchain security firm PeckShieldAlert, the stolen amount is stored in three different addresses out of eight involved in the theft.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the hacker has about $13.4 million worth of wrapped Ethereum (WETH), $1.8 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), $3 million in USDT, $5 million in USDC and $1.6 million worth of DAI stablecoin.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile rug pulls and Sybil attacks are frequently discussed in the crypto space, sandwich attacks have often been overlooked. Data security firm, CertiK, told CoinTelegraph that about $27 million worth of exploits have occurred via MEV bots (bots that execute sandwich attacks) since September 2022, with the latest attack accounting for a great majority."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction - Will ETH Rally as Traders Back New Green Token Ecoterra? Wed, Apr 05, 2023 15:57 CET Report this content\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) surged to $1,873 on Tuesday, up 4% over the previous 24 hours, and up 9.2% on the week.\n\nIts weekly gains have outcompeted Bitcoin\u2019s, helping the #2 crypto asset regain some lost ground against the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. ETH/BTC has risen from 0.064 on April 3rd to 0.066 today \u2013 a 3.6% pump. This brings ETH market dominance up to 18.2%, versus Bitcoin\u2019s 44.2%.\n\nTuesday\u2019s pronounced rally applied to all risk assets, as stock market indices like the Nasdaq 100 and S&P500 continue to trade higher over the past week. In particular, futures contracts tied to the tech-focused Nasdaq index rose 0.35% to an eight month high.\n\nEthereum\u2019s own trajectory mimics this, having not reached the upper $1800 price level since mid-August, when hype for its upcoming Merge upgrade was abounding.\n\nWith the network on the brink of another major upgrade this month \u2013 the Shapella upgrade \u2013 Ethereum may be poised for another bullish breakout back above $2000.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of eco-friendly tokens like ecoterra may continue to attract attention to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem from environmentally conscious investors \u2013 especially amid continuing fervor surrounding Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEthereum Remains Rangebound (TA)\n\nSince mid-March, Ethereum\u2019s price has remain rangebound between the lower $1700 and mid $1800 price levels.\n\nThus far, the asset has shown a strong proclivity to sharply reverse trajectory whenever touching the lower end of that range, such as on March 22 and March 27. While there appears to be strong support at that price level, Ethereum\u2019s movement so far indicates no upside bias.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, there are a range of likely possibilities for Ethereum\u2019s next breakout. On one hand, if the market determines that it needs deeper support, it could retrace back to support found at the lower $1600 level.\n\nAlternatively, the asset may have experienced a shallow retracement to its established $1700 lows on Monday, before breaking out beyond its resitance.\n\n\u201cAs long as we\u2019re holding $1717, I\u2019m in favor of a breakout scenario,\u201d said price analyst More Crypto Online on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s likely, but it\u2019s not for sure.\u201d\n\nShapella On the Way\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade \u2013 the name for its joint \u201cShanghai\u201d and \u201cCopella\u201d upgrades \u2013 is scheduled to roll out at block 6209536 on April 12th \u2013 less than a week from today.\n\nThe long awaited hardfork will allow Ethereum users to withdraw their staked assets from the network for the first time since the Beacon Chain rolled out in November 2020. Each upgrade will make changes to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and consensus layer, respectively.\n\nThe change is a follow up to the Ethereum\u2019s \u201cMerge,\u201d which shifted the main network\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake. This reduced the network\u2019s energy consumption by 99.9%, a feat praised by environmentally conscious businesses and regulators as a step toward responsible innovation in crypto.\n\nPrior to the Merge\u2019s rollout, Ethereum appreciated significantly compared to rival cryptocurrencies, rising from $1000 in July to nearly $2000 in August. Ethereum could experience a smaller, albeit significant price runup similar to that as Shapella makes proof of stake on the network fully functional.\n\nIts successful rollout could also make Ethereum a more attractive asset to investors who no longer need worry about being unable to withdraw their stake.\n\nThat said, Shapella could also mimic the Merge in terms of being a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event, meaning its price plummets directly after the upgrade actually takes place. Some have even theorized that the upgrade willspark a market dump, as it will unlock billions of dollars in ETH that can now be potentially sold and drive Ethereum\u2019s price down.\n\nStill, a fully functional proof of stake Ethereum retains a strong value proposition to environmentalists who were once put off by the network\u2019s energy intensive mining industry. Furthermore, environmentalist projects built atop the Ethereum blockchain \u2013 such as ecoterra \u2013 only strengthen that value proposition.\n\nNew Token Ecoterra Backed for Big Gains as it Enters the Recycle2Earn Economy\n\nEcoterra is a new crypto project that many people are backing to be the next big green crypto, having raised over $50,000 shortly after launching its presale. This initiative leverages blockchain technology and tokenization to encourage recycling and efficient energy use.\n\nThrough the ecoterra app, companies can reward consumers in ecoterra tokens (ECOTERRA) for proving that they have engaged in a number of green initiatives, including puchasing PET plastic, glass, aluminum, and green energy packages.\n\nUsers will also be rewarded for scanning barcodes of recyclable products, and for recycling and uploading their RVM receipts to their accounts. They are also provided with a carbon-offset marketplace to help all parties reach their emissions targets, even if personal efforts are not enough.\n\nOnce earned, ECOTERRA may be donated to fund green initiatives around the globe, such as tree planting, cleaning projects, and climate change education. It can even be used to purchase eco friendly products for everyday use.\n\nECOTERRA features a max supply of 2,000,000,000 tokens, and trades as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. The token\u2019s presale process is still active, now being offered on its website for $0.004, purchasable via USD, USDT, or ETH.\n\nWhile low right now, ECOTERRA\u2019s price is being periodically increased as the presale continues, so new investors will need to enter early to get the best bargain.\n\nThe project is certified and audited by the blockchain security company Certik, including 90+% scores in code security and fundamental health.\n\nAmid continued public scrutiny and regulatory pressure against proof of work blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum will continue to benefit from its standout position as a low-energy network \u2013 and so may the tokens on its platform."

        "content": "Market View\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella (Shanghai+Capella) Fork will be a major focus next week as the upgrade is scheduled for activation on April 12 at 10:27pm UTC. The network upgrade will enable validators to withdraw their staked ETH, some of which has been dormant on the Beacon Chain since the consensus layer went live in December 2020. The big question is how much selling pressure could materialize once withdrawals are enabled, as there are numerous variables involved in estimating both the supply that could be unlocked as well as the amount that could reasonably be expected to be sold.\n\nWe previously laid out our thesis in a report published February 14 ( \u201cStaked ETH withdrawals: new math\u201d ) that a sell-off on the back of this event should be relatively limited. Our revised estimates are that ETH selling directly from this source could amount to only around 1-2% of total average daily ETH volumes, and we\u2019re biased towards the lower end of that range.\n\nChart 1. ETH/BTC cross has moved in ETH\u2019s favor ahead of Shanghai Fork\n\nNevertheless, in our view, ETH performance around the Shanghai Fork will be less strictly dependent on technicals and more contingent on what risk actually does at that time. That is, if the trading environment sees risk assets selling off, people may decide to unstake and sell ETH just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side. Mid-April holidays may also constrain liquidity, while a lower stablecoin dominance ratio (of 11.2% of the total crypto market cap) suggests a lot of conversion into other tokens already took place in March.\n\nThere are however some mitigating factors that could limit the amount of ETH that could be immediately unlocked after the upgrade takes place. First, only 44% of validators have set their withdrawal credential prefixes to 0x01, which is necessary for both partial and full withdrawals to be enabled and funds unlocked. (Note: some of these address changes can only occur once the Shanghai Fork is activated.) Second, full withdrawals are rate limited to 8 validators per epoch at the moment or 1800 validators per day, given that there are around 563k validators at the moment. This figure changes as the total number of validators increases or decreases by 65,536.\n\nThird, staking platform Lido, which represents almost 23% of all staked ETH, has said that their withdrawal functionality will be ready no sooner than early May as they are still preparing their v2 upgrade. Crypto exchange Binance has also set daily ETH redemption quotas for its users with withdrawals only supported one week after the Shanghai Fork takes place. All of this could drag out the timeline for when staked ETH balances could actually be withdrawn. (Incidentally, if users want to unstake their ETH on Coinbase, they will be able to do so soon after the upgrade is complete \u2013 waiting periods will be determined by the protocol.)\n\nThere\u2019s also the separate but related issue of why people may actually sell the staked ETH that\u2019s deposited into their accounts and how much could make its way onto the market. Pressure on this front could be alleviated by the fact that more than 67% of all staked ETH is currently staked through third-party entities, and a lot of those could use those released rewards to set up new validators. Moreover, around 51% of all staked ETH was locked up at prices higher than they are today, which diminishes the risk of ETH selling to meet tax liabilities.\n\nChart 2. Amount of ETH staked per price level (ETH/USD)\n\nFinally, we are only considering the withdrawal side of the equation here. But as people withdraw, the base rewards on staked ETH increases which over time should also encourage people to stake ETH. The current staking participation rate in Ethereum is currently only 15% of total ETH circulating supply compared to an average of 65% across the top alternative layer-1s by market cap. That suggests that there is a very big opportunity to grow here, even if the ultimate staking ratio is still under 65% because of the relative amount of organic Ethereum usage."

        "title": "Why are stock market whales selling off and buying Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ)? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The stock market has been experiencing a shift lately, as whales (big institutional investors) are selling off their stocks and buying into cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ).\n\nThis shift has caused many to wonder what is behind it and why institutional investors are choosing these particular cryptocurrencies. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons behind the whale migration to crypto and what this means for the future of both the stock market and the crypto market.\n\nThe Pandemic\u2019s Effect on the Stock Market:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the global economy, leading to widespread uncertainty and volatility in the stock market.\n\nMany institutional investors have been looking for ways to diversify their portfolios and mitigate their risks in this uncertain market. As a result, many of them have been selling off their stocks and looking for alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nOverview of RenQ Finance (RENQ) and Ethereum (ETH)\n\nRenQ Finance and Ethereum are two popular cryptocurrencies in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. While both are built on blockchain technology, they differ in their approach and offerings.\n\nRenQ Finance, launched in 2023, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers liquidity solutions for the crypto market. The platform\u2019s main focus is to provide a secure and reliable way for users to exchange and trade digital assets.\n\nRenQ Finance uses advanced AI technology to provide users with the best possible price for their assets and offers a variety of features such as staking, lending, and borrowing. With its recent success in its presale stages and innovative use of AI technology, RenQ Finance is a promising investment opportunity for those interested in decentralized finance.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it is known for its smart contract capabilities. The platform allows developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) on top of its blockchain, making it a popular choice for the DeFi space. Ethereum also offers its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used as a means of payment for transactions on the network.\n\nOne of the key differences between the two is their approach to scalability. Ethereum has been facing scalability issues due to its limited transaction processing capacity, leading to higher gas fees and slower transaction times. However, Ethereum has recently upgrade its network to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve its scalability and efficiency.\n\nRenQ Finance, on the other hand, uses a multi-chain approach, allowing users to access financial products across different blockchains. This approach enables RenQ Finance to provide more scalability and interoperability, making it easier for investors to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of opportunities in different markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Advancements and Potential\n\nEthereum has been a popular choice among institutional investors due to its recent advancements and potential for future growth. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade improves the scalability and efficiency of the network, making it more attractive to investors.\n\nAdditionally, the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Ethereum network has led to increased adoption and use cases, further driving up the price and demand for ETH.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s Unique Value Proposition\n\nRenQ Finance is another cryptocurrency that has caught the attention of institutional investors. RenQ Finance\u2019s unique value proposition lies in its use of advanced AI technology to provide users with the best possible price for their assets, offering features like staking, lending, and borrowing.\n\nAdditionally, its interoperability allows users to access various financial products across different blockchains, making it easier for investors to diversify their portfolios.\n\nThe Future of the Stock Market and Crypto Market:\n\nThe recent shift in institutional investors from stocks to cryptocurrencies like ETH and RENQ may signal a broader trend toward adopting crypto as a legitimate investment class.\n\nThe potential for higher returns and the diversification benefits that crypto provides are likely to attract more institutional investors in the future. This could lead to increased demand and higher prices for cryptocurrencies, which may cause a further shift away from traditional investments like stocks.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Blockchain/Bitcoin Incore Bank Signs Maerki Baumann as First Client For SDX Ethereum Staking by Fintechnews Switzerland April 5, 2023\n\nInCore Bank can now offer Ethereum staking capabilities that are fully compliant with Know-Your-Client (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) regulations to their clients.\n\nIn this collaboration, InCore Bank provides crypto brokerage, banking operations and custody services, while SDX Web3 provides crypto custody and non-custodial-staking services.\n\nThe Zurich-based private bank Maerki Baumann launched its crypto strategy in 2019. Apart from corporate accounts for companies focusing on blockchain technology and crypto applications, it offers services in crypto trading and custody in collaboration with InCore Bank. Maerki Baumann will continue to expand its crypto offering by making the new Ethereum staking services available to its private and corporate tech banking clients.\n\nMark Dambacher, CEO InCore Bank, stated,\n\n\u00abWe perceive an increasing interest in staking and ways to participate in the decentralized economy. InCore Bank\u2019s fully integrated and future-oriented staking services via segregated wallets, enable us to offer staking to our clients within a convenient, secure, regulated and tax compliant setting. We are proud to be part of this strategic alliance with SDX\u00bb.\n\nDavid Newns, Head of SDX, adds,\n\n\u00abThis collaboration between established digital asset institutions is the first of its kind in Switzerland. We are strengthening the Swiss digital asset ecosystem by enabling key market players to provide value adding capabilities like Ethereum custody and staking that their clients are asking for\u00bb.\n\nWhat is staking?\n\nBlockchain networks are based on the principle of decentralisation, there is no central entity that decides on the correct transaction history. Nevertheless, a consensus mechanism is needed to ensure in a decentralized pattern that transactions are validated in correct order and in a secure manner. Blockchains typically reach consensus in two ways, either by so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms.\n\nIn PoS blockchains like Ethereum, to guarantee consensus, no power-intensive computing power is used. Rather, capital needs to be expended in the form of the blockchain\u2019s own coin. These coins must be \u00abstaked\u00bb, i.e. made available to the network and bound by it for the staking period. For individuals who hold digital assets of proof-of-stake networks, staking is mandatory in order to avoid dilution of their own position. Due to this fact, it can be assumed that in the near future, there will be an increasing merger of custody and staking.\n\nStaking is an umbrella term used to denote the act of pledging crypto-assets to a cryptocurrency protocol to earn rewards in exchange. Staking allows users to participate in securing the network by locking up tokens. The \u00abstakers\u00bb become validators who add new transactions to the respective blockchain. At the same time, the validators follow the so-called consensus rules. These set the rules of the game according to which the various network participants have to comply. If, as a validator, you violate the network\u2019s consensus rules during this process, you put your own capital at risk in the form of the coins you have staked. This ensures validators have an incentive to abide by the rules.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from freepik"

        "content": "The most recent increase in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve has rippled a downward momentum in the cryptocurrency industry and simultaneously raised fears it could add to the current financial turmoil triggered by a series of bank failures in the US and Europe.\n\nThe 0.25% interest rate hike is the US Federal Reserve\u2019s ninth consecutive rate hike which lifts its key interest rate from 4.75% to 5%, up from near zero a year ago \u2013 the highest level since 2007.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is being driven by market sentiment as Bitcoin (BTC), the industry\u2019s largest digital asset, dipped in daily trading after surging by roughly 40% since early March following the collapse of multiple banks in the US and Europe, which prompted depositors to withdraw their funds from banks and switch to digital currencies and Swiss lenders.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the industry, also dipped in price prompted by a cloud of uncertainty over the global financial market, while in the meme coin space, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) was living up to its status of being the most exciting meme token in the market.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 March Madness Sends BTC Price on Roller Coaster Ride\n\nIn the aftermath of multiple banking failures in the US and Europe, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading back and forth as its price hit lows of $19,628.25 and a high of $28,803.34 during 30 days caused by swaying confidence among investors who the SEC\u2019s crackdown has at times impacted on digital assets and otherwise preferring virtual currency following the banking turmoil.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin had slumped by 2.86% in the past 24 hours to trade at $27,052.01, while its weekly rally was broken with a downward correction of 2.05%.\n\nEthereum \u2013 ETH Staring at Decline to $1,500?\n\nEthereum (ETH) dipped below the $1,750 mark and continues at an hourly rate of 0.33%. The second-largest cryptocurrency even briefly dipped below the $1,700 mark to post a 7-day low of $1,690.52.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum had dipped by 1.48% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,726.08, while experts suggest that a break below the $1,685 support could push the price to $1,600 and failure by bulls to the support $1,600, ETH is staring at a sharp decline towards $1,500.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 Cometh the Bulls, Cometh the BULLRUN250 Bonus Code\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is the latest ERC-20 meme token powered by the Ethereum blockchain. The project is currently having its Initial Coin Offer (ICO), and since its launch, the cat-based meme token has been recognized as the most successful presale in recent crypto history.\n\nThe project\u2019s primary objective is to shift its community\u2019s wealth into the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem while self-propagating using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which offer its holders access to more content and events.\n\nIn stage 12 of its presale, Big Eyes Coin has raised over $32.5 million in presale tokens and will launch live after reaching its $50 million presale target.\n\nAs the project\u2019s presale draws closer to its end as it plans to go live after stage 15, Big Eyes Coin wants to ensure that its community gets maximum returns during this period. Hence, Big Eyes Coin has launched the BULLRUN250 bonus code, which offers crypto users a massive 250% bonus when purchasing BIG tokens or Loot Boxes.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Loot Boxes is the project\u2019s ongoing video game feature parallel to the BULLRUN250 bonus code, which offers its community a maximum ROI of 5000%. It features the Saver Tin, Cute Box, Kitty Vault, Super Saiyan Box, and Excali-Paw Master Chest, and each loot box carries a maximum return of $500, $5000, $25,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000 worth of BIG tokens, respectively.\n\nSo if a user enters the BULLRUN250 bonus code when purchasing a Cute Box loot box, the user will get a potential return of $5,000 plus $250 in BIG tokens.\n\nWe can see that while the use of cryptocurrency has seen overwhelming growth and popularity over the years, investors remain uncertain as the regulatory landscape surrounding the industry remains rather blurry as the heavy crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission appears to take a heavy toll on digital currencies, creating challenges for investors and lenders alike.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Despite being a beta release, SubQuery has already proven to be faster than The Graph, offering Ethereum developers another decentralised alternative upon the impending launch of the SubQuery Network.\n\nSubQuery\u2019s decentralised data indexing solution provides developers with the tools needed to easily organise and query on-chain data for their protocol and applications. Abstracting the backend, SubQuery provides a custom API and lets developers focus on product development and user experience rather than building their own indexing solutions. The latest integration builds on SubQuery\u2019s existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support for other networks including Avalanche, Flare, Cosmos (Ethermint) and Polkadot (FrontierEVM).\n\nSam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, said: \u201cEthereum has been on our radar since day one. Our experienced engineering team has put a lot of hard work into this integration, so that we can guarantee Ethereum developers will have a smooth and seamless experience indexing with SubQuery\u2019s open-source SDK, tools and documentation . We can\u2019t wait to collaborate with teams building on Ethereum with the power of our fast, flexible and universal indexer.\u201d\n\nUntil now developers in the Ethereum ecosystem have had to rely on services such as The Graph for their data indexing requirements. However, with its existing beta support, SubQuery is already 1.85x faster than The Graph for common projects such as the standard Ethereum Name Service project. SubQuery achieves this by using multi-threading and optimisation of the store to reduce costly database writes. With faster sync times, developers can iterate faster and deliver features to market quicker.\n\nSubQuery also brings some major improvements to existing decentralised indexing solutions which include far more flexibility and better controls for developers to run projects in their own infrastructure, plus the ability to support enterprise level projects in its managed service which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles hundreds of millions of requests each day and unlike The Graph, will not be sunsetted.\n\nSince its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. The success in Polkadot spurred SubQuery to integrate with other Layer-1 blockchains to become a truly universal solution, which will also extend to other EVM chains and Layer-2 scaling solutions, like Polygon, BNB, and Arbitrum in future.\n\nSubQuery is currently focused on decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the SubQuery Network. The SubQuery Network will index and service data from projects to the global community in an incentivized and verifiable way and support indexing Ethereum projects, and those from any other supported Layer-1 from the outset.\n\nThe Ethereum integration is currently being tested with a small group of beta projects. If you would like to join SubQuery as an Ethereum launch partner or migrate from The Graph, please reach out to james.bayly@subquery.network.\n\nAbout SubQuery\n\nSubQuery is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Algorand, Cosmos, NEAR, Avalanche, and now Ethereum projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.\n\n\u200b\u200bLinktree | Website | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Matrix | LinkedIn | YouTube\n\nContact\n\nDan Edelstein\n\nPR@marketacross.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to watch in April 2023 if you want to make money - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Key Highlights\n\nThe cryptocurrency market posted a bullish performance in March, with Bitcoin leading the way with a 23.03% gain. The cryptocurrency market capitalization gained 10.19%, while the altcoin market gained 2.03%.\n\nFive cryptocurrencies to watch out for in April 2023 are Bitcoin, BNB Chain\u2019s BNB, Ethereum\u2019s Ether, XRP, and Conflux\u2019s CFX.\n\nThe article provides an overview of the performance of each of these cryptocurrencies in March, highlighting key events that impacted their prices and market trends.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space in March, saw it post a bullish performance pushing it into the fourth consecutive month of gain.\n\nDespite the gains seen, the market was crowded with a lot of regulatory and market FUD. However, despite these occurrences, the market still posted a massive bullish performance to end the first quarter of the year.\n\nFlagship cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin, posted a bullish performance, as the rest of the market followed in its trend. It began trading from $23,147.35 at the beginning of the month and ultimately ended the month at $28,478.48, representing a 23.03% gain.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market capitalization in March gained 10.19% for the month, from $1.08 trillion at the start of the month to the end of the month at $1.19 trillion. The cryptocurrency market capitalization traded as high as $1.20 trillion during the month.\n\nThe Altcoin market experienced similar bullishness, gaining 2.03% in March, from approximately $622.1 billion to currently standing at $634.7 billion at the end of the month. During the month, we saw the altcoin market capitalization trade as high as $646 billion.\n\nWith the current bullish trend seen in the market, here is a look at 5 cryptocurrencies investors should watch out for in April 2023:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s BTC\n\nFor Bitcoin, a key point of resistance from earlier in its current halving cycle indicates that the current trading zone represents a major hurdle for bulls to overcome. Should they manage it, price targets extend beyond the $30,000 mark. Matthew Hyland, a crypto analyst, summarized in his latest tweet on BTC that, \u201cBitcoin has been consolidating below the biggest resistance/support of the last 2+ years. A whole new ballgame if BTC breaks it. NASDAQ & S&P went strong into the weekly close. Still, major pessimism and disbelief while major milestones are close to being made for Stocks/BTC.\u201d\n\nPopular Twitter account Byzantine General predicted that a breakthrough of resistance immediately above the spot price would result in a sea of liquidations, leading to further upward momentum. The account tweeted, \u201cIt feels like some bear is very desperately trying to defend the 29k to 30k region. I think that when this level breaks massive liqs will come in. And it does feel like a matter of \u2018when\u2019 not \u2018if\u2019 because there\u2019s zero froth in the market, only some spot supply.\u201d\n\nTo add, according to data from Coinglass, the 23% gain seen in March almost matches its 2021 performance, with 2013 remaining its most volatile. This is relevant because Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory mimics both years, seeing at least three months \u201cin the green\u201d before significant consolidation began.\n\nBitcoin ended the month\u2019s trading at $28,478.48.\n\nBNB Chain\u2019s BNB\n\nOn March 27, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, alleging that the company illegally offered crypto derivatives services to Americans and facilitated illicit financial activity.\n\nBNB dropped by over 5.5% to $305 on the announcement day, logging its worst daily performance since Feb. 13, when its price dropped by over 5.8% due to another regulatory crackdown involving Binance-branded stablecoin Binance USD. BNB\u2019s price stabilized on March 28, wobbling between gains and losses as CZ refuted CFTC\u2019s allegations. However, the BNB/USD pair risked falling further if one considers its recent response to regulatory actions. For instance, the New York regulator\u2019s BUSD crackdown in February 2023 preceded a 15%-plus BNB price decline.\n\nBNB ended the month\u2019s trading at $317.04.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether\n\nIn the digital assets space, Ethereum remains the largest smart contract platform, hosting a plethora of financial products, innovation, and automation, with varying degrees of decentralization (generally referred to as DeFi).\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, Ether\u2019s short-term and long-term trends look skewed toward the bulls. Most Ethereum whale cohorts have increased their ETH accumulation in recent weeks, according to the latest data from Santiment. For instance, the supply of Ether held by addresses with a 1,000-10,000 ETH balance (blue in the chart below) has grown by 0.5% in March.\n\nSimilarly, the 1 million-10 million ETH and the 10 million-100 million ETH balance cohorts have witnessed 0.4% and 0.5% rises, respectively. The growth appeared amid what appears to be the absorption of selling pressure introduced by the 100,000-1 million ETH (pink) and 10,000-100,000 ETH address cohorts. At the same time, the growth could be attributed to the network\u2019s proof-of-stake contracts, directly or by using third-party stakers such as Lido DAO (LDO).\n\nThe net Ether deposited at the official Ethereum 2.0 address crossed above 18 million ETH after rising about 3.5% in March. The deposits have grown ahead of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai and Capella upgrades on April 12, which would enable stakers to withdraw ETH from the PoS smart contract. Currently, this is not possible.\n\nEther ended the month trading at $1,822.02.\n\nXRP\n\nRipple\u2019s chances of winning the court case against the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) improved on March 21 after the presiding judge, Analisa Torres, decided to exclude an expert\u2019s opinion explaining how could be a security. On March 27, another U.S. regulatory move was a blessing in disguise for XRP holders. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the U.S. charged Binance with improper compliance procedures and market manipulation.\n\nThe regulatory body classified Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin as commodities in the filing. Some believe that this classification will extend to XRP as well. Thus, effectively refuting the SEC\u2019s claim of XRP being a security. The market\u2019s expectation of Ripple winning the case against the SEC has pushed XRP\u2019s price to new yearly highs already this month and if Ripple goes on to win the case against SEC, the bullish momentum in XRP will likely continue in the medium to long term. To add, XRP was the fourth largest gainer for March 2023, as it hit a 10-month high.\n\nXRP ended the month\u2019s trading at $0.5385.\n\nConflux\u2019s CFX\n\nConflux (CFX) is a public layer-1 blockchain that was made to power decentralized applications (dApps), e-commerce, and Web 3.0 infrastructure by being more scalable, decentralized, and secure than existing protocols. The protocol makes it easier to transfer valuable assets by making the process quick, effective, free of network congestion, and with low transaction costs. The platform is based on the Tree-Graph consensus mechanism, and it combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithms to achieve consensus. The protocol uses Turing-complete smart contracts written in Solidity, just like those on Ethereum, and is compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).\n\nConflux Network continued its positive run from February, nearly doubling its price in March. The project\u2019s team continued to strengthen its partnerships in China by adding XCMD, the world\u2019s third-largest construction machinery manufacturer, and Zen Spark Technology. The Conflux team also supports the development of permissionless applications. It has established a grants program to promote its ecosystem development.\n\nOver the years, Conflux has earned the reputation of a Chinese enterprise blockchain with partners in Oreo China, McDonald\u2019s China, and Chinese Instagram equivalent Little Red Book. The blockchain also hosts a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese yuan with the approval of the Chinese government, which is highly encouraging given the strict influence of the authorities over state policies.\n\nThe Conflux Network deploys both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms to increase scalability and decentralization. The network processes between 3,000 to 6,000 transactions per second, which is considerably faster than Ethereum\u2019s speed of 15 tps.\n\nWhile Conflux has established partnerships with leading Chinese brands, the activity on the blockchain has yet to justify the 500% increase in CFX\u2019s price rally in the last two months. Data shows that the number of new Conflux addresses and NFTs minted on the platform has stayed at par with previous months with no evident spike.\n\nCFX ended the month\u2019s trading at $0.4134."

        "title": "Shiba Inu: Shibarium To Become More Decentralized Than ETH - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Shibarium, the layer-2 scaling solution of Shiba Inu could become more decentralized than Ethereum \u2013 the layer-1 technology on which the Meme Coin is built \u2013 in the future. This is the goal of development firm Unification, which is considered the main developer of Shibarium.\n\nRingoshi Toitsu, a well-known validator of the Unification (FUND) network shared this news on Twitter. In a tweet dated April 5, Toitsu posted a screenshot of an interaction with a community user and the Unification Foundation.\n\nIn the conversation, Unification is addressing the critical issue of the centralization of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) node operations. SHIB\u2019s layer-2 technology will therefore use Unification\u2019s upcoming tool UNODE for decentralized applications (dapps) in the Shibarium ecosystem.\n\nFUND, Unification\u2019s native token will also play a major role. Toitsu explained that FUND will be the only cryptocurrency that UNODE will use. He also declares that UNODE will play an important role for the entire SHIB ecosystem. On Twitter, he wrote:\n\nUnification is now tackling the next major point of centralization for Shibarium operations \u2013 EVM node operations. UNODE\u2019s launch in 2023 offers a more secure and decentralized infrastructure for developers & Dapps \u2013 using FUND as the gas!\u201d.\n\nWhy This Is Of Major Importance For Shiba Inu\n\nNodes are a critical part of the Ethereum infrastructure. For quite some time, there have been discussions about how centralized Ethereum is in terms of nodes. A Messari study found in fall 2022 that over 70% of leading Ethereum applications run on just four centralized node providers.\n\nUnification picks up on this in a blog post, writing that centralized industry incumbents Alchemy, Infura, Moralis, and Quicknode provide the bulk of ETH nodes, creating a vulnerability in the technology stack of decentralized applications.\n\nAlso many are permissioned and identifiable because they require card payments through dapps. Thus, tracking could potentially be turned on at any time, the article notes and further explains:\n\nUnification\u2019s UNODE addresses this Achilles\u2019 Heel, by democratizing, decentralizing, and incentivizing EVM node operations. In accordance with our ethos, this will be pure Web3.\n\nUNODE is scheduled to launch before the end of 2023. This will not only be beneficial for the SHIB ecosystem but will also bring exclusive utilities to the FUND token.\n\nIn addition, Shiba Inu will receive other critical infrastructure from Unification. As Toitsu explained in an interview, Unification\u2019s technology includes the Oracle of Oracles (OoO), a permission-free master oracle that combines data from centralized and decentralized exchanges to provide real-time asset prices.\n\nThe OoO service will be widely integrated into the SHIB ecosystem. This includes ShibaSwap, Shiboshi NFTs, and Shibarium.\n\nRegarding the current development status of the layer-2, Toitsu revealed:\n\nUnification is doing an excellent job with their technology for Shibarium, and no one else can match it. We\u2019re still in an early beta stage with a focus on delegating/staking. People know that BONE is gas, there will be REAL governance, and TRUE SHIB users will be able to earn rewards from using the blockchain.\n\nAt press time, the SHIB price stood at $0.00001092, down 3.5% within the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from ShibaSwap, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade / Shapella Hard Fork is here: Report - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "Ethereum to bring much-awaited Shanghai upgrade / Shapella Hard Fork on April 12.\n\nPeople are ambiguous about its effects on the market.\n\nEthereum is coming up with the Shanghai upgrade on April 12; investors and analysts are ambiguous about the results. Ethereum requires its validators to lock or stake their ETH for the blockchain\u2019s functioning, and they are rewarded with ETH over time. These staked ETHs cannot be un-staked. The Shanghai upgrade would allow un-staking while providing efficiency to the blockchain.\n\nWhat Will Shanghai Upgrade or Shapella Hard Fork Do?\n\nWhen the update goes live, approximately 15% of all Ethereum in circulation shall be available for un-staking. Masses have different thoughts about its possible effect; some feel this could bring a negative influx and drop the value considerably. In comparison, bulls think the Shanghai upgrade would encourage staking.\n\nAfter the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum is expected to reveal \u201csharding.\u201d This would break the larger blockchains into smaller parts; after that, the capacity to handle transactions per second would noticeably increase, with a considerable drop in gas fees.\n\nShapella Hard Fork / Shanghai Upgrade Could Invite Sell-off\n\nWith the Shanghai upgrade or Shapella hard fork around the corner, the market seems afraid of the scenario where ETHs deposited on the network have been unlocked in the name of boosting security, which could invite holders for the liquidation of their tokens. Observers feel that the supposed selling pressure could be in billions of dollars.\n\nAnalysts say approximately 1.1 million ETH would come for withdrawal, and Celsius might sell their 158k staked balance to help their bankruptcy process. These two alone amounts to nearly 1.3 million ETH, or around $2.4 billion. Dealing with such intense selling pressure would not be easy for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIs the Phobia Legit?\n\nAlthough people claim impending influx and drop in ETH, the study shed light on the brighter side. Not every staker is expected to un-stake their assets all at once, but still, a partial withdrawal is supposed to take 5 to 6 days, while a full withdrawal is supposed to take anywhere from three weeks to four months.\n\nIn simpler terms, the much-hyped selling pressure force will be distributed in multiple days, where buyers can also match the selling pressure. There is already a fair limit of 16.27 million ETH per day, which could distribute the selling pressure over a longer period. Researchers found that the majority of stakers are, in fact, long-term investors and are not likely to liquidate their holdings.\n\nEthereum Prices are Rising as Shapella Nears\n\nAs the Shapella hard fork is nearing, ETH is experiencing a wave of positive sentiments supported by upward-moving EMA. If the signals from MACD were also towards the north, then chances for a rally would have been great. The price is closer to the supply zone and might enter or consolidate between immediate support present at 1717.77.\n\nSource: ETH/USDT; TradingView\n\nAfter the launch of Shapella, the prices could go either way; if it drops below immediate support, it might enter the demand zone, but a clean breakdown is highly unlikely.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.

The daily trading volumes have been declining since mid-March, but several other factors point to a bullish scenario:\n\nETH/BTC chart prints consecutive green candles\n\nThe ETH/BTC chart showed a choppy performance year-to-date. However, the Ethereum coin gained a 7% weekly advantage against Bitcoin, the highest weekly achievement since January.\n\nIn retrospect, Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 rally was mainly due to a questionable narrative that projects it as a safe haven against the banking crisis. As a result, BTC outperformed not just Ether but almost all the top-ranking cryptocurrencies amid the collapse of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and others.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s recent success raised speculation that the altcoin season might be approaching.\n\nToo soon to ring Altseason bells\n\nGenerally, altcoin season arrives when 75% of all altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. On the other hand, if Bitcoin beats more than 25% of all altcoins, the market is witnessing a Bitcoin season.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCenter.net, a platform tracking crypto \u2018seasonality,\u2019 the digital asset market left the Bitcoin season, but it is still early to call for an altseason. The platform\u2019s altseason index stood at 27 out of the possible 100.\n\nAltcoin season index at 27.
