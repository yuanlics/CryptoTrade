        "content": "Ethereum is fast approaching a very particular flippening.\n\nNo, ether (ETH) isn\u2019t about to eclipse bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market cap (at least, not yet).\n\nInstead, the raw number of ETH staked inside the Ethereum blockchain is set to surpass the ether kept on crypto exchanges for the first time ever some time over the next few weeks.\n\nEarlier this week, there was 22.8 million ETH ($39.75 billion) completely staked compared to almost 24.3 million ETH ($42.38 billion) sitting on exchanges, per Nansen data analyzed by Blockworks. Each represents about 20% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nThat worked out to be only 6.12% more ETH on exchanges than staked.\n\nAt the end of May, that spread was almost 16%.\n\nAt the start of the year, it was more than 41%.\n\nIt\u2019s not the actual flippening, but it\u2019ll do\n\nOverall, there\u2019s 4.9 million fewer ETH ($8 billion) on crypto exchanges than at the start of the year \u2014 a 17% reduction. And there\u2019s 5.7 million more ETH ($9.4 billion) locked in the Ethereum blockchain over the same period, a jump of one-third.\n\nThe figures suggest the SEC\u2019s persistent mudslinging has spurred Ethereum users to stake their ether rather than keep it on exchanges.\n\nEther stakers lock their tokens in the network to take part in consensus and earn yield, either by running validator nodes themselves or via services such as Lido.\n\nSome crypto exchanges also offer staking-as-a-service products, however the SEC generally considers those to be unregistered securities. Ethereum staking yield is currently about 6% (paid in ETH).\n\nMore ETH staked now than during FTX scandal\n\nGranted, crypto investors by far pulled the most ether throughout the FTX reckoning last November than at any point over the past 30 months.\n\nBack then, net outflows from crypto exchanges averaged nearly 130,500 ETH ($227.1 million) per day, from when FTX went kaput to the end of that month.\n\nNet outflows did surpass 200,000 ETH ($348.3 million) on June 5 \u2014 the same day the SEC sued Binance. A similar number was hit as Coinbase received its own lawsuit the following day. But they\u2019ve since tapered off.\n\nNet ether staked hovered between 69,600 ETH ($121 million) and 112,100 ETH ($195 million) in the days directly around those suits \u2014 roughly two-and-a-half times the daily average throughout the FTX collapse.\n\nIt is unknown whether the exact same ETH that was ripped from crypto exchanges ended up staked in Ethereum. In any case, net ether outflows from exchanges certainly spiked as the recent lawsuits hit newswires. But equal amounts haven\u2019t flowed into the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor instance, interest in ETH staking peaked three days before the Binance case was revealed, with net staking inflows of around 397,700 ETH ($692.6 million) on June 2, the highest on record.\n\nNet outflows and net staked have picked up considerably amid the SEC crackdown\n\n\u2018Not your keys,\u2019 but make it yield\n\nStill, it appears general sentiment has shifted more toward decentralized blockchain architecture than centralized platforms susceptible to regulatory persecution.\n\nFor instance, net staking inflows were also really high throughout May after jumping considerably after the Shapella upgrade activated withdrawals in April.\n\nThe May surge also came after Kraken unwound its ether staking-as-a-service program due to SEC threats received in February, and after Coinbase\u2019s own Wells notice over similar services garnered in late March.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said his firm wouldn\u2019t unwind its Ethereum staking products in the same way as Kraken.\n\nThe number of ETH staked flipping crypto exchange balances is a reassuring sign that crypto users truly value the benefits of decentralized technology. \u201cNot your keys\u201d and all that.\n\nIt took less than two weeks for the spread between ETH on exchanges and ETH staked to drop from more than 16% to 6%.\n\nIf that trend continues, the staking-exchange flippening should hit by the end of this month.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Lastly, we see strong growth and a shift toward off-chain execution continuing for several reasons. First, the Ethereum protocol continues to move in this direction and will particularly do so with its next upgrade, including proto-danksharding, which expands Ethereum\u2019s data availability capabilities. Moreover, not only is the base layer itself improving, but so, too, are the layer 2s, with improved decentralization and new paradigms around interconnectivity and shared security ahead. And these base and secondary layer improvements will come together to enable new use cases and functionality, creating a virtuous cycle. Portended by rising ecosystem transaction counts, Ethereum is perhaps on its way to becoming the world\u2019s settlement layer."

        "title": "Just How Realistic Is a $50,000 Price Target for Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Through the first six months of 2023, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, up more than 45% year to date. It now trades around $1,745, after briefly breaking through the $2,000 level earlier this year. However, Ethereum is still down by nearly 65% from its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nGiven Ethereum's performance this year, some investors are now recalibrating and putting more aggressive price targets on the token. Most recently, New York-based investment firm VanEck put out a head-spinning $50,000 price target for Ethereum by 2030. Given Ethereum's current price, that implies a more than 25x return. But just how realistic is that?\n\nThe bullish scenario for Ethereum\n\nVanEck's valuation model is based on several key building blocks, so this is not the sort of pie-in-the-sky price target that is so commonly promoted by super-bullish crypto enthusiasts. The first building block is Ethereum's revenue model, which relies primarily on transaction fees. The second building block is Ethereum's coin supply, which is actually decreasing over time, helping to prop up the crypto's price. And the third building block is what VanEck calls the \"broad market capture strategy\" of Ethereum. Basically, this means that Ethereum is involved in just about everything blockchain-related these days.\n\nFor each of these building blocks, it is then possible to construct a base, bear, and bull case scenario. For the bullish scenarios to take place, Ethereum needs to remain the market leader in every niche of the blockchain sector, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), while also broadening the number of real-world applications in which it is used in areas such as finance, banking, and payments. This is what a broad market-capture strategy would look like for the next seven years.\n\nTransaction volume and growth forecasts\n\nWhen it was founded back in 2015, Ethereum had a clear first-mover advantage. At that time, it had no legitimate Layer 1 blockchain rivals. But now, Ethereum must contend with the likes of Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. And each of these Layer 1 blockchain rivals will continue to chip away at Ethereum's transaction volume. This makes it highly unlikely that Ethereum will hit the revenue targets in the bull case scenario. Right now, VanEck is projecting that transaction fees (i.e., revenue) will explode by more than 50x between now and 2030.\n\nThat doesn't seem likely, given that Ethereum continues to rely on a patchwork system of Layer 2 blockchains (which sit on top of its main blockchain) to process all of those transactions. VanEck views this Layer 2 ecosystem as a positive for Ethereum, and seems to suggest that the transaction fees generated on these blockchains should be factored into the overall revenue mix of Ethereum.\n\nBut I'm not so convinced that this Layer 2 blockchain activity should be seen as a sign of strength. From my perspective, they are just further proof that Ethereum is having a hard time going one-on-one with its rival Layer 1 blockchains, which are still much faster and much cheaper to use. Ethereum is most likely years away from reaching its peak transaction-processing capabilities.\n\nCan Ethereum reach $50,000?\n\nGiven all of the above, VanEck appears to be too aggressive in its growth assumptions for Ethereum. For example, VanEck currently projects revenue for the category \"metaverse, social, and gaming\" to balloon by 50x in its bull case scenario. Counting on massive growth in this category seems flawed given that the metaverse investment thesis has completely imploded over the past 18 months.\n\nAnd not taking into account all the potential for its Layer 1 rivals to chip away at its dominance seems short-sighted to me. Plus, it's important to keep in mind regulatory risk. If the Securities and Exchange Commission ever rules that Ethereum is a security, that would pose a huge risk to Ethereum's business model.\n\nSimply put, a $50,000 price forecast just seems too aggressive. Remember: the all-time high for Ethereum is under $5,000, and Ethereum has already shown real weakness this year when it comes to pushing past the $2,000 mark. That being said, I'm still bullish on Ethereum both in the short term and the long term. It is a highly diversified crypto with exposure to every sector of the blockchain world. But I am readjusting my own expectations about Ethereum to keep them as realistic as possible."

However, its focus on strict security and decentralization means that the blockchain can only process about 14 transactions per second. Because of this, Ethereum transaction costs are usually very high, and transactions can take a long time to process.\n\n\u201cLayer 2\u201d solutions are blockchains built on top of (or in parallel with) the Ethereum blockchain that is used to scale its capabilities. These chains usually process many more transactions per second for much less in fees. In return, however, Layer 2 blockchains are usually more centralized and not as well-secured as the main \u201cLayer 1\u201d Ethereum chain.\n\nAs an analogy, you can imagine the Ethereum network as the US Postal Service \u2014 or the main government-owned postal courier in a country. It is reliable, secure, and available to everyone, but it often suffers from congestion, delays, and relatively high costs due to its wide reach and demand.\n\nLayer 2\u2019s, on the other hand, are like private delivery services. There are many more of them, and they can transfer packages faster and cheaper. On the other hand, they don\u2019t have the credibility of the main postal service and may not be trusted by everyone to ship the most important packages.\n\nWhy Do We Need L2 Solutions?\n\nMany popular blockchain projects are building their services on Layer 2 blockchains in order to provide their users with more affordable trading, gaming, lending, and much more. Large tech companies such as Reddit and Meta are opting to use Layer 2 solutions to bring their web3 offerings to the masses for a low cost.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has upcoming upgrades which will scale the capacity of the network. However, there are already several tried-and-true Layer 2 projects, and the bridges need to use them, that will most likely continue to see wide adoption even as the main Ethereum chain improves.\n\nL1 Vs. L2\n\nLayer 1\n\nAverage transaction fees are $5+\n\nTransactions per second are limited to around 14\n\nSecurity is a top priority that hampers the speed of the blockchain\n\nFully decentralized \u2014 cannot be changed or halted without mass consensus\n\nLayer 2\n\nAverage transaction fees are less than $1\n\nCan process potentially hundreds of thousands of transactions per second\n\nSecurity is still very tight, but may sometimes be compromised in favor of speed\n\nSome Layer 2 chains are much more centralized than Layer 1\u2019s, leading to concerns about their reliability and independence\n\nWhat Are Ethereum Rollups?\n\nOptimism, Arbitrum, StarkEx, and zkSync are all examples of Ethereum \u201crollups.\u201d A rollup is a type of Layer 2 scaling technology that processes transactions off-chain and then submits them all together in a \u201crollup\u201d to the main Ethereum chain.\n\nThere are two types of rollups:\n\nOptimistic Rollups: Optimistic rollups assume that all transactions within the rollup are valid, and they are automatically submitted to the main Ethereum chain. If a transaction is not valid, there is a specific time window within which anyone can submit \u201cfraud proof\u201d that proves the transaction is incorrect. This allows the chain to process transactions quickly and only do extra work if a transaction is proven to be fraudulent. Arbitrum and Optimism are examples of Layer 2\u2019s utilizing optimistic rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups assume that all transactions within the rollup are valid, and they are automatically submitted to the main Ethereum chain. If a transaction is not valid, there is a specific time window within which anyone can submit \u201cfraud proof\u201d that proves the transaction is incorrect. This allows the chain to process transactions quickly and only do extra work if a transaction is proven to be fraudulent. Arbitrum and Optimism are examples of Layer 2\u2019s utilizing optimistic rollups. Zero-Knowledge Rollups: Zero-knowledge, or \u201cZK,\u201d rollups check every single transaction for validity before submitting it to the blockchain. These types of rollups use sophisticated cryptography and math known as \u201czero-knowledge proofs\u201d in order to verify that each transaction is legitimate. Among decentralization and security purists, ZK rollups are the preferred Ethereum scaling mechanism. However, they are much more complicated than optimistic rollups and have not yet enjoyed as wide of adoption. StarkEx and zkSync are examples of Layer 2\u2019s utilizing zero-knowledge rollups.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nEthereum sees tons of demand and Layer 2\u2019s are here to help scale the blockchain and make it accessible to everyone. While the technologies are still in their infancy, Layer 2\u2019s such as Polygon and Arbitrum are already seeing wide adoption, while ZK-based Layer 2\u2019s like StarkEx and zkSync promise cheaper transactions with no impact on security.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Are ETH L2 Tokens? L2 tokens are the platform tokens for Layer 2 blockchains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. L2 tokens trade just like any other cryptocurrency token, meaning they may go up or down in price. What Are The ETH L2 Fees? L2 fees are generally much lower than the fees on Ethereum Mainnet. For example, the average fee on Polygon is $0.018 per transaction, compared to $5+ on Ethereum. What Is The Best Ethereum L2? It\u2019s difficult to say that any single L2 is the best. It really depends on what you\u2019re looking for. For wide adoption and fast transactions, L2\u2019s like Polygon and Arbitrum are good choices. If security and decentralization is very important to you, then zero-knowledge rollups like StarkEx and zkSync may be good choices.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a casual, free-to-play mobile game that pays you cryptocurrency along the way, Ethereum Blast might do the trick.\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say I had a \u201cblast\u201d playing through the simplistic color-matching puzzle stages, it\u2019s a decently fun diversion that can put a little bit of Ethereum or Bitcoin into your wallet while you play.\n\nBling Financial\u2019s free iOS and Android game is a simple color-matching puzzle game with a vibe that\u2019s best described as \u201csci-fi meets Ethereum.\u201d All that really means is that you\u2019ll see the familiar Ethereum symbol floating around the menus and interface here and there, and people who aren\u2019t crypto die-hards shouldn\u2019t be turned off by that modest window dressing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum Blast is a straightforward puzzler, tasking you with tapping two or more connected, like-colored stones to clear them from the board. As you clear stones, new ones fall from above to fill the space and potentially sets up larger matches that can earn you power-ups in the process. Each level provides certain targets of stones or items to clear within a limited number of moves.\n\nScreenshots from Ethereum Blast on iOS. Image: Decrypt\n\nIt\u2019s all easy to grasp and control, with simple taps used to clear blocks or activate power-ups. But it\u2019s also largely unchallenging and mostly mindless, and you'll earn plenty of power-ups to get you out of any binds. I played through nearly 50 stages and only lost once along the way. But as a simple on-the-go distraction, it\u2019s pleasant enough\u2014much like Tetro Tiles, another mobile puzzler with crypto rewards.\n\nHow much can you reasonably earn by playing? Your mileage may vary, but I earned about $0.20 worth of crypto in about two hours of play. Bling\u2019s games reward you with Bling points that you can then convert into Ethereum or Bitcoin, and then cash out to a Coinbase or PayPal account. I cashed out in ETH, but it would\u2019ve been the same USD value in Bitcoin too.\n\nIt\u2019s not much\u2014but it\u2019s more than I earned playing Bling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire, which earned me about $0.09 worth of Bitcoin in a two-hour span. However, your earning potential in Ethereum Blast diminishes the more you play, as the amount of Bling points offered for playing each stage appears to dwindle over time. The game may not hold your interest for long anyway.\n\nAnd to be clear, the amount of ads you\u2019ll watch to earn even pennies\u2019 worth of crypto is pretty overwhelming. You\u2019ll face a full-screen video ad after nearly each completed level, and these typically last for a minute or more before you\u2019re able to tap your way out of them. Given how short the levels are, that means you\u2019ll spend about as much time playing as watching ads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs that worth it to make about $0.10 per hour? Honestly, I\u2019d rather spend my time playing a more engaging mobile puzzler without crypto rewards\u2014like Threes or Grindstone, or my on-and-off guilty pleasure, Candy Crush Saga. But if you\u2019re intent on \u201cstacking sats\u201d or eking out ETH while playing games, Ethereum Blast is a solid option."

ETH reacted to the downside below the $1,720 support after the Fed interest rate decision, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a clear move below the $1,700 and $1,640 support levels. The price declined over 5% and traded close to $1,630. A low is formed near $1,630 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,740 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $1,660 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,749 swing high to the $1,630 low.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $1,680 level. The first major resistance is near $1,700 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,749 swing high to the $1,630 low. A proper move above the $1,680 and $1,700 resistance levels might start a steady recovery wave.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance sits near $1,740 and the trend line, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $1,780 level. Any more gains above the $1,780 resistance zone might send the price toward the $1,850 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,630 level and the recent low.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,600 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,600 support, the price could accelerate lower toward the $1,550 support.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest crypto ecosystem, has been a major topic of debate over the past few years. The event is sometimes dubbed \u201cthe flippening.\u201d However, regardless of ETH becoming the number one crypto, a report by VanEck said that the token could reach $50,000 in 2030. In the first six months of 2023, ETH has risen by around 45%, which is quite impressive. BTC, on the other hand, has increased by as much as 57%.\n\nVanEck\u2019s valuation method is based on a number of fundamental components. The first part is Ethereum\u2019s business model, which mainly depends on transaction fees. The second part is the ETH coin supply, which falls over time and supports the crypto\u2019s price to increase. Additionally, the third part is what VanEck referred to as the \u201cbroad market capture strategy.\u201d In essence, it means that Ethereum is currently involved in almost everything blockchain-related.\n\nCan Ethereum realistically reach $50k?\n\nETH is one of the most development-heavy blockchain projects in the industry. This is a fundamental metric for future growth. Although rival networks have appeared, none are as significant as ETH. Moreover, the recent pressure from regulators has greatly affected rival networks like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). All three were named by the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in its suit against Coinbase. However, Ethereum (ETH) was said to not be a security. This keeps ETH at a fairly safe distance from the recent chaos.\n\nAdditionally, ETH has a lot of room to grow. The difference between the largest and second-largest crypto projects is massive, and the gap could be lessened in the future. Moreover, ETH has a lot more use cases than BTC. Therefore, it could see even greater adoption in the years to come. In fact, the \u201cflippening\u201d might very well happen within a few years. Therefore, VanEck\u2019s forecast of ETH reaching $50k by 2030, seems very possible. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,745.50, down 0.5% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder has floated a proposal to increase the maximum effective balance of Ethereum validators from the current 32 to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe change is expected to reduce staking infrastructure complexity for large validators and improve user experience if implemented.\n\nEthereum eyes staking limit increase\n\nThe minimum and maximum effective balances of Ethereum validators have been capped at 32 ETH since the network\u2019s successful transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism last year. However, a new proposal by Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder aims to increase that number significantly.\n\nThe current 32 ETH cap makes it impossible for validators to earn interest on staked ether beyond that number. The proposed change by Neuder aims to remove this limit and unlock various benefits for validators.\n\nWhile the current 32 ETH has made the Ethereum network more decentralized than ever, boasting 600,000 active validators and counting, the proposed change will enable validators to earn more interest while also reducing infrastructure complexity since they will no longer need to deploy millions of containing 32 ETH nodes, just to increase their yield.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s zkSync Era reaches $500m in TVL\n\nAdditionally, the team has clarified that increasing the maximum effective balance to 2,048 will significantly reduce the load on the network\u2019s peer-to-peer layer brought about by the massive volume of messages.\n\nThe team claims the increase will also make the implementation of future Ethereum roadmap upgrades easier, amongst other benefits.\n\nDuring the just concluded Ethereum All Core Developers\u2019 Consensus (ACDC) call #111, the team also discussed other potential tweaks to the network, including changes to validator attestation and aggregation deadlines and more.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Hong Kong lays out the red carpet for crypto exchanges\n\nWhile some jurisdictions (cough: America) have adopted a regulation-by-enforcement approach toward crypto, others are doing the opposite. According to a June 15 report from the Financial Times, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is pressuring major financial institutions to accept crypto clients. But it\u2019s not just regulators laying down a red carpet to boost the special administrative region\u2019s Web3 industry. For example, Johnny Ng Kit-Chong, a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, wrote on June 10:\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of news about international virtual asset exchanges in the past two days. I send forth an invitation to welcome global virtual asset exchanges, including @coinbase, to come to Hong Kong, apply for a compliant exchange, and negotiate a listing plan. I am willing to provide assistance!\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Joseph Chan Ho Lim, Hong Kong\u2019s under-secretary for financial services and the treasury, revealed in an interview that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has conducted public consultations on the launch of stablecoins and is in the process of establishing a regulatory framework by the end of the year. \u201cHong Kong will continue to support the development of the industry in the future and welcomes the industry and talents to come to the SAR,\u201d the politician said.\n\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Web3 Festival gallery hall (Twitter)\n\nOn June 1, Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission issued regulations stipulating the requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges to apply for a license to operate in Hong Kong. For regulated trading platforms, a license application must be submitted to the Securities Regulatory Commission within nine months, or before Feb. 29, 2024. If not, their business in Hong Kong must be terminated before May 31, 2024.\n\nBank of China mints debt notes on Ethereum\n\nOn June 12, BOCI, the investment banking subsidiary of Bank of China, revealed the tokenization of 200 million Chinese yuan ($28 million) in digitally structured notes on the Ethereum blockchain. The move is reportedly the first act of a Chinese financial institution tokenizing a security in Hong Kong. The notes are governed by both Hong Kong and Swiss law as per their origination by the Swiss investment bank UBS. Ying Wang, the deputy CEO at BOCI, commented:\n\n\u201cWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products, for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products. We are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation.\u201d\n\nPreviously, UBS had issued a $50 million tokenized fixed-rate note in December 2022. Meanwhile, the government of Hong Kong issued an 800 million Hong Kong dollar ($100 million) tokenized green bond on Feb. 16, underwritten by four banks and priced with a yield of 4.05% per annum.\n\nDo Kwon: In and out of jail\n\nOn June 15, The High Court of Montenegro in Podgorica ordered Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon and chief financial officer Han Chang Joon back to jail pending extradition proceedings to South Korea for charges relating to their role in the $40 billion collapse of the Terra Luna ecosystem.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Kwon and Joon were released on 400,000 euros bail each in their ongoing passport fraud case after a Montenegrin Basic Court dismissed an appeal by prosecutors.\n\nTheir brief period out on bail was not a happy time either. During their respite from prison, South Korean prosecutors announced they would apply to freeze Kwon and associates\u2019 $13 million held in Swiss bank accounts. A new hearing on charges of falsifying documents is scheduled for June 16 in the same Basic Court.\n\nDo Kwon faces a long stretch in jail in a number of countries.\n\nAccording to local sources, Kwon and Joon will be detained for a period of six months as the court decides on their extradition case. Kwon and Joon also face extradition to the U.S. on 11 charges relating to fraud, breach of trust, and embezzlement.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, there is yet another legal proceeding against Kwon. On June 16, Kwon will be questioned by the Special State Prosecutor\u2019s Office for a letter he sent from detention to government officials, disclosing his connections with the leader of the Europe Now Movement (PES), Milojko Spaji\u0107.\n\nAccording to the country\u2019s National Security Council, Kwon and Spaji\u0107 have been friends for five years, and last met in Belgrade in December 2022. Investigators claim there is evidence of financing the PES campaign from Kwon\u2019s laptop. If convicted, Kwon not only faces further jail time in Montenegro but could also serve up to 40 years in a South Korean prison, and even more jail time potentially awaits in the U.S.\n\nKorean blockchain firm\u2019s daisy chain contagion\n\nOn June 14, South Korean yield platform Haru Invest filed a criminal complaint against its consignment operator, B&S Holdings, alleging \u201cfraudulently provided management reports containing false information.\u201d\n\nHaru had paused deposits and withdrawals the day before, stating, \u201cWe have discovered through our internal inspection process that certain information provided by a consignment operator was suspected to be false.\u201d Previously, concerned investors took pictures of allegedly empty corporate offices and accused the firm of orchestrating a \u201crug pull,\u201d which Haru says is inaccurate.\n\n\n\nPhoto allegedly showing empty Haru Invest corporate offices after the announcement. (Telegram)\n\nThe move immediately affected South Korean Bitcoin lending firm Delio, which quickly announced the temporary suspension of customer withdrawals \u201cin order to safely protect the assets of customers currently in custody,\u201d citing issues at Haru Invest. Delio is one of the largest such entities in South Korea, holding an estimated $1 billion in Bitcoin, $200 million in Ether and $8.1 billion in other altcoins.\n\nA curious commentary regarding the matter came from Jun Du, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global, who wrote:\n\n\u201cWith the detonation of Delio, the thundering of [crypto] lending platforms is basically over.\u201d\n\nHowever, Du warned that contagion related to centralized trading platforms, which started with FTX, is just the beginning. \u201cNot only the newcomers are confused, but also the OGs in the industry. When will the thundering of the black box of centralized crypto entities end?\u201d the former blockchain executive asked, while also expressing his doubts on whether the industry will witness a \u201cslump\u201d or be \u201cushered into a new bull market\u201d after such issues are resolved.\n\nLast year, Huobi co-founders Jun Du and Leon Li reportedly sold 100% of their stake in the exchange to an entity controlled by Chinese blockchain personality and Tron founder Justin Sun. The latter claims that the exchange is now profitable after a period of reorganization, which by the way, included crushing an employee revolt."

        "content": "The Graph, a blockchain indexing protocol founded in 2018, is fully migrating to the Arbitrum network from Ethereum on Wednesday.\n\nThe Graph\u2019s move to the popular layer-2 was initiated by network participants in an attempt to lower gas fees, accelerate transactions, and increase the protocol\u2019s accessibility, according to a press release from The Graph Foundation.\n\nEdge & Node CEO Tegan Kline said users weighed the options among layer-2 networks and Arbitrum ultimately came out on top.\n\n\u201cThe Graph users have continually searched for solutions to improve gas efficiencies and enhance other aspects of the network,\u201d Kline said in a statement. \u201cAfter careful consideration of all options on the market, the ecosystem selected Arbitrum as the Layer 2 scaling solution that will bring speed and affordability to protocol developers and network participants.\u201d\n\nThis has been long in the making, with plans to move being known as far back as April 2022 via a governance proposal that suggested creating a set of contracts that would bridge GRT transactions to Arbitrum. Discussions about moving to a layer-2 network because of prohibitively expensive gas prices date back to November 2021 on The Graph\u2019s forums.\n\nA June 2022 proposal was the first to present a deployment of The Graph on Arbitrum. Its proposers, Edge & Node software engineers Pablo Carranza V\u00e9lez and Ariel Barmat, suggested it wasn\u2019t a good idea to migrate in \u201cone go.\u201d\n\nSince then, The Graph has gradually taken more steps to exit the Ethereum network, including enabling indexing rewards on Arbitrum and deploying transfer tools enabling users to move tokens to Arbitrum. Both proposals were passed unanimously.\n\nThe statement from The Graph Foundation further explained that its users should start receiving transition prompts today.\n\n\u201cProtocol users will be presented with an option to transition to Arbitrum across The Graph\u2019s suite of products. Protocol rewards will continue to gradually shift from Ethereum to Arbitrum, and over time, will transition entirely to Arbitrum,\u201d the press release said.\n\nUpdated June 14, 2023 at 2:00 pm ET: A previous version of this article stated that The Graph migrated to Arbitrum on Tuesday. The protocol made the switch on Wednesday.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum has plunged below $1,700 during the past day. Here\u2019s the on-chain indicator that may have signaled this dip in advance.\n\nEthereum Age Consumed Metric Saw A Spike Before The Price Decline\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional investors look to have been expecting the move to take place. The indicator of interest here is the \u201cETH age consumed,\u201d which first finds the total number of coins moving on the Ethereum blockchain. Then it multiplies this value by the days these coins had been dormant before their movement.\n\nSo, in this way, the metric keeps track of how many coins are being sold/moved each day and uses their age as a weighting factor. This means that many old coins are moved to the network whenever this indicator\u2019s value is high.\n\nNaturally, low values of the metric, on the other hand, would imply that there aren\u2019t many coins moving on the chain right now or some coins with a low average age are being transferred.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum age consumed over the past month:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum age consumed metric had recently registered a very large spike. This would suggest the potential movement of many dormant coins on the chain during this surge.\n\nGenerally, when such large spikes in the indicator are observed, it\u2019s a sign of selling from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTH cohort includes all the investors holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago.\n\nThese holders are the experienced hands in the market who don\u2019t easily sell even when the market is distressed. Because of this reason, their movements can be something to watch out for, as when they do finally sell, it\u2019s usually not a positive sign for the price.\n\nThe chart shows that the LTHs had also shown a large move earlier in the month. Shortly after these investors became active, the cryptocurrency price plunged.\n\nThis time, the spike in the Ethereum age consumed also seems to have preceded a price decline, as the cryptocurrency\u2019s value has now dropped below the $1,700 level.\n\nThis latest price plunge has come after the news that the US Federal Reserve isn\u2019t raising interest rates this time, but more hikes would be coming later in the year to fight inflation.\n\nSantiment suggests that the spike in the age consumed metric before the price decline could imply that the institutions already expected the move, hence why they shifted their coins early.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,600, down 11% in the last week.\n\nETH has taken a plunge recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

At 12:08 pm PDT, the company first reported it was \u201cinvestigating increased error rates and latencies\u201d in parts of the United States.\n\nMany mainstream news organizations, such as the Associated Press, were affected and unable to publish articles.

Such high reliance on AWS is a worrying sign for the decentralization of the network and a much wider disruption would have resulted in a shock for the Ethereum network.\n\nDistribution of Ethereum nodes from web service providers. Source: Ethernodes\n\nVan Ness added the impact may have been more significant if the outage was in Europe due to the amount of Ether (ETH) staked on Lido, which is currently around 7.1 million or 35% of the total:\n\n\u201cI imagine there would be some effect if AWS went down in Europe given how much of Lido is in the cloud.\u201d\n\nEthereum has previously been criticized for centralization due to its reliance on infrastructure provider Infura, which provides network nodes to companies and organizations. Many of these companies, and liquid staking platform Lido, rely heavily on AWS for cloud hosting services.\n\nRelated: 3 cloud providers accounting for over two-thirds of Ethereum nodes\n\nAround 20 minutes after the discovery of the problem, AWS said that the root cause of the issue was connected to a service called AWS Lambda, which lets customers run code for different types of applications.\n\nOver three hours after AWS went down the company reported that \u201cthe issue has been resolved and all AWS Services are operating normally,\u201d at 3.37 PM PDT.\n\nAccording to the hosting platform Kinsta, AWS has the dominant market share among cloud hosting providers, at 34%.\n\nMagazine: Joe Lubin: The truth about ETH founders split and \u2018Crypto Google\u2019"

        "title": "EigenLayer deploys restaking protocol on Ethereum mainnet - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer has launched on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe launch supports tokens including stETH, rETH, cbETH and solo-stakers.\n\nEigenLayer is designed to extend Ethereum security to software modules such as bridges, oracle networks and consensus mechanisms by utilizing restaking to offer pooled security mechanisms. They\u2019re built on top of the network.\n\nThe EigenLayer protocol consists of stakers, who commit stake, and operators, who provide technical validation services for actively validated services (AVSs), Brianna Montgomery, head of strategy at Eigen Labs, told Blockworks.\n\nSeveral AVSs are building on EigenLayer, and a handful have publicly pointed to their plans, Montgomery said.\n\nKnown AVSs include EigenDA, Espresso, Witness Chain, Omni and Lagrange.\n\n\u201cOthers are building in private,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cMore details about projects building on EigenLayer will be shared as and when available.\u201d\n\nHow does EigenLayer work?\n\nStakers can give permission to EigenLayer smart contracts, subjecting their staked ether to slashing conditions \u2014 and granting the opportunity to validate different software modules on top of the layer-1.\n\nThe design is such that additional rewards are meanwhile earned, and stakers can also delegate the validation to an operator of their choice.\n\n\u201cIn both scenarios, the Restaker retains the agency over their stake and chooses which AVSs they opt-in to validate for,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\nTo ensure honest operators opting in do not face slashing, Montgomery said a handful of checks and balances have been baked in.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we encourage AVSs deployed on EigenLayer to only have objectively attributable faults\u2026Additionally, to prevent unintentional slashing caused by software bugs in the slashing contracts, there is a veto committee consisting of reputable members from the ecosystem,\u201d she said.\n\nAdded Montgomery: \u201cAny AVS smart contract seeking to slash a validator must submit its request to the veto committee, who can veto or approve it based on the legitimacy of the request.\u201d\n\nInitial mainnet launch\n\nThe initial mainnet launch will only include restaking, with operators and validators being part of a second launch iteration in the works. Native staking will also be available in the initial launch.\n\nUsage limits of 3,200 of each asset, with a maximum of 32 token deposits for each unique user address will be set in the interest of protocol security, EigenLayer said in a statement.\n\nThis means there will be a cap of 9,600 liquid staking tokens, coupled with a minimum of 300 unique deposits, able to participate across the three liquid staking tokens available at mainnet.\n\nUsage limits will be evaluated and raised over the coming weeks, with the goal of eventually being completely uncapped.\n\nNative restaking will also be available through the creation of EigenPods \u2014 a smart contract that facilitates staking of the Beacon Chain layer, where stakers must direct their validator withdrawal credentials.\n\nAlthough there are no restrictions on the number of validators that can link to EigenPods being placed, EigenPods will stop being created once native restaking reaches 9,600 ETH.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "XRP SEC Case Could Be A Boon For Ethereum, Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a sharp decline since Saturday, dropping from the $1,838 line down to the current level of $1,738 while XRP traded sideways. This has caused concern among investors and traders in the Ethereum market.\n\nHowever, experts and analysts believe the recent disclosure of the Hinman documents on June 13th could mark a relief wave for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe Hinman documents refer to a series of emails and memos from the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, recently released to the public.\n\nThe Hinman documents include a series of emails and memos from the former director of the SEC, who declared in 2018 that Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether, is not a security.\n\nEthereum Traders Should Keep An Eye On The XRP Case\n\nRecently, the release of emails from former SEC official William Hinman regarding Ethereum has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community. While some have claimed that the documents are a smoking gun for the cryptocurrency, others have downplayed their significance.\n\nHowever, analyst Adam Cochran has argued that the documents are a nuance that puts current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in a corner.\n\nThe Hinman speech attempted to clarify the SEC\u2019s position on digital assets, such as ETH and XRP, and their relation to security regulations. In his speech, Hinman went beyond the scope of the Howey test and attempted to understand the nuanced intent of users vs. investors. He also questioned the concept of morphing, or whether something can be a security and then later not a security.\n\nThe feedback comment from SEC staff specifically noted to him that they wanted to pivot to the discussion of \u201cwhat is a security\u201d rather than the idea of morphing. And that their concerns came from implication differences between the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.\n\nHinman specifically drew attention to the idea that \u201cpromoters\u201d have a very specific legal analysis point \u2013 and that even a coordinated group of actors working on something wouldn\u2019t rise to the level of being deemed the promoter if their efforts weren\u2019t essential.\n\nThe draft on Ethereum, which came after meeting with Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, and his lawyers, noted that Ethereum was not at such time a security and that secondary sales didn\u2019t raise Securities Act concerns \u2013 only Exchange Act and Commodities Act concerns.\n\nAccording to Cochran, that footnote is of incredible importance as it notes that the SEC internally viewed secondary sales not as sales of the promoter at the time.\n\nFurthermore, Cochran believes the documents are damning for Gensler\u2019s position because they acknowledge the idea of \u2018reverse-morphing\u2019 of an asset becoming a security. Suppose the SEC wanted to argue that Ethereum is a security today. In that case, they must acknowledge the idea of \u2018morphing\u2019, prove the burden of a promoter being liable for all secondary sales of an asset ever, and break every precedent of horizontal and vertical commonality.\n\nCochran further claimed:\n\nFor Gary to conclude that proof-of-stake Ethereum is a security, he would both need to fight a landslide of precedent on the most litigated part of Howey analysis \u2013 and admit to the idea that securities status can change over time with decentralization.\n\nOverall, many market analysts believe that disclosing the Hinman documents could boost Ethereum\u2019s price in the short term. This is because it removes some of the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and could increase investor confidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Retest $1,700 Support? Will US FOMC Meeting Trigger ETH Rally Today? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price knee-jerk reaction to Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was not strong enough to weaken the seller congestion at $1,800. However, ETH\u2019s brief rebound touched highs of $1,760 followed by a minor but sharp dip which confirmed the viability of support at $1,730.\n\nThe token powering the largest smart contracts ecosystem is currently trading at $1,738 while bulls battle a seemingly strengthening bearish grip.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith support at $1,700 staying intact coupled with building optimism ahead of the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later on Wednesday, Ethereum price could embark on an upward trajectory targeting $1,800 and $2,000 price points, respectively.\n\nCan US Fed Rate Decision Trigger Ethereum Price Rally?\n\nAccording to this analysis of Bitcoin Price, investor confidence received a boost following the release of the CPI report, which revealed a year-on-year inflation deceleration to 4.9% in April, modestly undercutting the predictions made by market watchers interviewed by Dow Jones survey.\n\nLater today, the FOMC meeting will decide whether to pause interest rate hikes, which have been maintained since Q1 2022. There is a higher probability of a pause following earlier communication by the Fed. About 76% of market participants, according to CoinDesk, believe the regulator will discontinue the historic interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cInflation is coming down, just as the Fed intended, and that\u2019s easing fears about the economy\u2019s future,\u201d Callie Cox, an analyst trading firm eToro told CNBC. \u201cLower inflation also supports the case for the end of rate hikes, and higher rates are what started the crypto winter over a year ago.\u201d\n\nAs the Fed ponders ending rate hikes, optimism is expected to build among investors. Risky asset classes like Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to benefit the most from the \u201ceasing of tight liquidity conditions,\u201d Cox added.\n\nEthereum Price Settles For Consolidation\n\nEthereum price has been stuck between a rock and a hard place since the SEC-triggered sell-off last week. On the downside, support at $1,730 appears robust enough to keep bears in check.\n\nHowever, it has become a daunting task for bulls to deal with resistance at $1,760. If the buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stays put on the four-hour timeframe chart, the probability for a breakout above $1,800 would remain high.\n\nRemember, bulls are at a disadvantage now that ETH is trading below all the major applied moving averages, including the 200-day EMA (purple), the 100-day EMA (blue), and the 50-day EMA (red).\n\nIf push comes to shove and declines extend below $1,730, investors can start acclimatizing to increased overhead pressure and subsequent losses to $1,700 and $1,600, respectively.\n\nEthereum On-chain Activity Steadies\n\nIntriguingly, some key on-chain metrics have remained steady despite last week\u2019s capitulation. Having achieved a record peak in May, the momentum of staking activities within the Ethereum network has extended its upward trajectory into June 2023.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s \u2018Supply in Smart Contracts\u2019 metric offers insights into staking dynamics by gauging the share of the overall circulating ETH currently committed to various protocols.\n\nIn the period spanning from June 1 to June 12, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have further committed an additional 360,000 ETH to the Ethereum Beacon chain and DeFi smart contracts.\n\nThe spike in Ether held in staking contracts shrinks available supply on exchanges, thus reducing selling pressure. If this fundamental factor holds, Ethereum price may ignite an uptrend in the short term.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Ethereum price is finding bids above the $1,720 zone against the US Dollar. ETH could start a decent recovery if there is a move above the $1,770 resistance.\n\nEthereum is struggling below the $1,770 and $1,780 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance near $1,740 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could recover if there is a move above the $1,770 and $1,780 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained well-bid above the $1,720 support zone. ETH seems to be forming a base above the $1,720 level, similar to Bitcoin. A low is formed near $1,718 and the price is slowly moving higher.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,740 level. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance near $1,740 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair is now struggling to settle above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,855 swing high to the $1,718 low.\n\nEther is still trading below $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,760 zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,770 level. The first major resistance is near $1,780 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,855 swing high to the $1,718 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,770 and $1,780 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,850. The next resistance sits near $1,880, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $1,920 level. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,040 resistance.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,780 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,730 level and the triangle trend line.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,720 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,720 support, the price could start a major decline toward the $1,640 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,600 zone.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,720\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A closely followed analyst is outlining key price levels where he believes crypto bulls would step in and ignite trend reversals for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and Litecoin (LTC).\n\nIn a new video update, analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 163,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum is at risk of further downside unless it can reclaim support at $1,785.\n\n\u201cThis entire area of $1,785 is something we need to sustain. Otherwise, we are going to look at a case that I think we are going to retest the area around $1,600 and have the reversal taking place.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,751. A move toward Van de Poppe\u2019s reversal area suggests an over 8% decline for leading altcoin.\n\nLooking at Binance Coin, the utility token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Van de Poppe says that BNB\u2019s failure to stay above support at around $270 suggests that the altcoin is likely en route toward $200, where it could potentially reverse.\n\n\u201cWe need to reclaim the area of [$270] in order to prevent a market breakdown. We did have this market breakdown, and now we\u2019re looking at potentially taking this liquidity beneath the low here for Binance Coin before we are most likely going to reverse. So I\u2019m looking at bids in this range ($200) if we\u2019re going to get that.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BNB is worth $237.\n\nAs for the peer-to-peer payments network Litecoin, Van de Poppe says that LTC may be close to ending its correction.\n\n\u201cI think if we are going to have a reversal taking place, this is the range that we\u2019re looking at, perhaps towards $70 to $73. If that is going to be the case, then I think we\u2019re going to have a swift rally back up.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, LTC is trading for $78.78.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a decline in recent days after being unable to surpass the $2,000 level. However, it is currently testing an important support level, and its response to it is expected to have a significant impact on performance in the coming months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily timeframe, Ethereum\u2019s price has faced rejection from the 50-day moving average at approximately $1,850 and has subsequently declined below $1,800. The price is currently experiencing downward momentum, but it is finding support near the 200-day moving average around $1,600.\n\nThe 200-day moving average is a strong indicator of the overall trend, and if ETH falls below it, it would indicate a continuation of the bearish market sentiment, potentially leading to a drop toward the $1,300 level.\n\nHowever, if the price bounces back from the mentioned moving average and successfully breaks above both the $1,800 level and the 50-day moving average, there is a high likelihood of Ethereum rallying towards the resistance level at $2,300 and potentially even higher.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a rapid decline in recent days after being rejected from the $1,900 level and the upper boundary of the large falling wedge pattern.\n\nIt is currently testing the lower trend line of the pattern, which is situated around the $1,600 support level. A breakdown below it would have severe consequences for the price.\n\nHowever, the RSI indicator is suggesting that the market is oversold, which suggests the possibility of a potential pullback, consolidation, or even a bullish reversal from the current area. Yet, the outcome will depend on whether the price is able to hold at the current level or if it breaks down further.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced a bearish trend after failing to surpass the $2,000 level. To gain insights into the reasons behind this behavior, analyzing the sentiment in the futures market can be informative.\n\nThe taker buy-sell ratio metric, depicted in the chart with a 100-day moving average applied, examines whether buyers or sellers are executing their perpetual futures orders more aggressively, meaning entering at the market price instead of setting limit orders.\n\nIt is apparent that when the price approached $2,000, the metric dropped below 1, indicating that short sellers started dominating the market and actively shorting Ethereum. This contributed to the downward pressure on the price. Although the ratio has shown a slight recovery recently, as long as it remains below 1, there is still potential for further downward price movement."

        "content": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to pause hikes on the benchmark interest rates has left many investors counting losses. Ethereum invalidated the positive market sentiment that had been building following reports of easing inflation in the US with losses amounting to 5.8% in 24 hours, to trade at $1,638 on Thursday.\n\nEthereum Price Downtrend Seems Unstoppable\n\nThe daily chart shows bears aggressively working to validate another drop below the lower ascending trendline. Ethereum price has been vulnerable to declines since early last week when the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a series of attacks on crypto entities and tokens \u2013 suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf ETH price sustains movement below the lower ascending trend line or support at $1,600, it would be an uphill task for bulls to arrest declines before they reach $1,450. Already the On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator, which measures the inflow and outflow of volume in the market, shows sellers resolutely holding the reins.\n\nAll the applied moving averages including the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA hold above Ethereum price. A death cross pattern may come into the picture if losses extend into the weekend, with the 50-day EMA (red) crossing below the 100-day EMA (blue).\n\nTraders considering buying the dip must wait for a confirmed rebound from the short-term support at $1,630, reinforced by the lower ascending trendline. Another buyer congestion holds at $1,600 as the last line of defense to prevent all hell from breaking lose to $1,450.\n\nEthereum DeFi Total Value Locked Dips\n\nEthereum, the time-tested pioneer in the DeFi realm, has experienced a tumultuous journey with regard to its Total Value Locked (TVL). Though it has shown resilience in the face of shifting market tides, Ethereum\u2019s position has faced formidable challenges from rising stars in the space like Optimism (OP), Tron (TRX), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) among others.\n\nSince June 2022, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the DeFi sector has been increasingly contested. Layer-2 solutions like Polygon have seen a considerable surge in TVL, thanks in large part to their ability to provide faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThis has inevitably impacted Ethereum\u2019s position, prompting a reevaluation of its supremacy in the DeFi landscape. According to the latest data on the DeFi space by DefiLlama, the network\u2019s TVL has since June 15 lost $7.84 billion.\n\nIf the rout continues, the TVL may drop further from the current $24.36 billion, thus fading in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s all-time high of approximately $108 billion in November 2021.\n\nLiquid staking platform Lido accounts for the highest TVL in Ether\u2019s ecosystem at $12.65 billion. MakerDAO comes in second place with less than half of Lido\u2019s at $5.47 billion, while Aave, Curve Finance, and Uniswap fill the rest of the top five positions in that order.\n\nThe extensive crypto winter is the biggest challenge to investors in DeFi. As the market wobbles they are forced to pull their staked holdings to diversify their portfolios. Unfortunately, this situation increases overhead pressure for DeFi protocols like Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price is bound to stay vulnerable until resistance at $1,800 is reclaimed for a continued upswing to $2,000 and beyond.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPopular decentralized exchange (DEX), Uniswap, launched its fourth version this week, which brings with it a series of new features and customizability. It also brought, however, the wrath of the open source Ethereum community.\n\nThe reason? The license they are using for v4.\n\nLefteris Karapetsas spoke to Decrypt about the controversy. He is an Ethereum developer, and founder of rotki, a portfolio tracker that protects user\u2019s privacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUniswap decided to go with a Business Source License (BSL), continuing what they did with v3\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s not happy with the decision. Karapetsas added \u201cthe reason is they don\u2019t understand open source and they believe their moat is their code which is wrong.\u201d\n\nReleased as a Business Source License 1.1, this type of license means the code is publicly available and is allowed to be copied, modified or redistributed. It does have a limitation, however. It cannot be used for commercial or production purposes for up to four years, at which point it will convert to a General Purpose License (GPL) in perpetuity.\n\nThere are five licenses that typically come up on truly free open source projects: Permissive, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, the Massachusetts Institute (MIT) license, the Apache license, and Copyleft.\n\nInventor of Total Value Locked (TVL), Scott Lewis pointed out that while Uniswap claims they open sourced v4, it\u2019s actually a 4-year proprietary license. \u201cIf anyone else misrepresented the truth like this they would be torn to shreds,\" he said on Twitter. \"That\u2019s the power of being powerful.\u201d\n\nUniswap Labs\u2019 claim: \u201cwe open sourced v4\u201d\n\nUniswap Labs\u2019 reality: Four Year Proprietary License.

Lead engineer Noah Zinsmeister thinks four years isn\u2019t a very long time, and that [the BSL license] strikes a \u201creasonable balance between incentivizing innovation and giving exclusive rights to the protocol, which has precedents in 'normal' settings as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness source license is a tax on innovation,\u201d tweeted Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, a Web3 research and development platform. He also pointed out that \u201canyone who's looked at BSL code even once, and then later codes something similar, is at a risk of catching a copyright claim.\u201d\n\nThe licenses used in the space are, according to Shapiro, difficult to navigate. \u201cIt would be hard to find a team of devs who are both capable of coding a new AMM from scratch and have never looked at Uniswap v4 code\u201d he tweeted.\n\nsimply put, it would be hard to find a team of devs who are both capable of coding a new AMM from scratch *and* have never looked Uniswap v4 code this doesn't mean they infringed, but that's not enough--they need to be able to *prove* they did not infringe, which will be hard \u2014 _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) June 14, 2023\n\nUniswap\u2019s latest version introduces a new kind of smart contract called \u201chooks,\u201d which allow developers to expand upon already existing liquidity pools. Lead smart contract engineer for the project, Sara Reynolds, told Decrypt the level of innovation that \u201chooks\u201d brings makes it \u201ckind of limitless\u201d in terms of customizability.\n\nMany in the open source community think the marketing language used upon launch is misleading. \u201cYou can\u2019t call something open source when it\u2019s not,\u201d said Lefteris. He was the first to \u201ccall bull\u201d on Uniswap on Twitter after v4 was announced. \u201cPlease use the proper terminology as this is insulting to projects actually building open source software,\u201d he wrote."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTypically, for the majority of blockchains, all metrics of on-chain activity and value transfer decline sharply after the dust settles post-airdrop. When the \"tourists\" and \"airdrop hunters\" are gone, they only mirror the actual utility of L1 or L2. Here's what the Arbitrum (ARB) case can tell us about these processes.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) network metrics rocketing following airdrop\n\nAll key metrics of Arbitrum (ARB) network usage - daily active user count, transaction number and net on-chain value - stabilized at levels higher than they used to be at before ARB token distribution in March. Such results were unveiled by analysts at Nansen on-chain data provider.\n\nArbitrum after the airdrop \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nMany projects have failed to sustain traction after their airdrop, however, initial data points to @arbitrum breaking that trend, with users and txs averaging higher now! pic.twitter.com/5t7yToYNo4 \u2014 Nansen \ud83e\udded (@nansen_ai) June 14, 2023\n\nGas spending data, together with Arbitrum-Ethereum bridge turnover, followed similar patterns. The last metric grows even amid the spiking popularity of competitor protocols zkSync and Starkware.\n\nIn this field, Arbitrum still retains the second position, being surpassed only by Polygon (MATIC), the largest EVM ecosystem blockchain.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, in May 2023, Arbitrum (ARB) also onboarded a Bitcoin-Ethereum interoperability solution called tBTC.\n\nAirdrop hunters responsible for 5-6% of transactions on top L2s\n\nNansen experts also tracked the role of airdrop recepients in the ongoing activity on Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), two of the largest L2s on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nFor them both, \"airdrop hunters\" are only responsible for 1 out of 20 transactions. As such, the vast majority of users are attracted by the long-term value proposition of the networks, not by the airdrop's benefits.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) remains the largest solution for Ethereum (ETH) scaling by total value locked in its protocols. As of mid-June 2023, it is responsible for almost 65% of the entire L2 ecosystem.\n\nIts closest competitor, Optimism (OP), only accounts for 18.55%, L2Beat tracker says."

Check out our guide to learn what MEV is.\n\nFront-running tactics on the Ethereum network will likely always exist. Flashbots is working to channel that behavior and minimize the negative externalities of MEV.\n\nFlashbots operates as a for-profit entity headquartered in the Cayman Islands and was co-founded by Stephane Gosselin and Phil Daian in 2020. That same year (according to Crunchbase), the company received seed funding from Paradigm, a crypto venture capital firm.\n\nIn January 2023, it was widely reported that Flashbots was aiming to raise $30 to $50 million at a ~$1 billion valuation. No official funding announcements have been made to date.\n\nHow To Use Flashbots\n\nEthereum users can use Flashbots by adding support for the Flashbots Protect RPC in their wallet interface. The detailed steps for how to do this are outlined later in this below.\n\nEthereum validators can outsource block building by running the Flashbots MEV-Boost validator software. Steps for how to install the software and configure it can be found here.\n\nFor infrastructure providers, resources for how to become a Flashbots block builder can be found here. And resources for how to operate a Flashbots relay can be found here.\n\nHow To Set Up Flashbots Protect?\n\nFor those familiar with the MetaMask wallet browser extension, enabling Flashbots Protect is simple.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to open the browser extension, choose \u201cEthereum Mainnet\u201d as the network, and click on \u201cAdd Network\u201d at the bottom of the dropdown \u2026\n\n\u2026 this will redirect you to a browser window where you select \u201cadd a network manually\u201d at the bottom \u2026\n\n\u2026 when prompted, input the following information to add the Flashbots RPC:\n\nName: User can choose whatever name they prefer\n\nUser can choose whatever name they prefer RPC URL: https://rpc.flashbots.net\n\nhttps://rpc.flashbots.net Chain ID: 1\n\n1 Symbol: ETH\n\n\u2026 click save, and voila \u2013 you can now submit Ethereum transactions with the peace of mind that trades will not be front-run and fees will only be paid if transactions go through.\n\nWhat Products Does Flashbots Offer?\n\nFlashbots offers 4 products to Ethereum users, infrastructure providers (i.e., validators and block builders), and community members.\n\nFlashbots Protect (Ethereum users) is a remote procedure call (RPC) endpoint that any Ethereum user can use to prevent their trades from being front-run by MEV bots (like jaredfromsubway.eth). It also prevents users from paying transaction fees for failed transactions.\n\nis a remote procedure call (RPC) endpoint that any Ethereum user can use to prevent their trades from being front-run by MEV bots (like jaredfromsubway.eth).

Validators running MEV-Boost essentially sell their blockspace in the open market to increase their staking yields by sourcing blocks assembled via the Flashbots Auction process. Flashbots Data (Ethereum community) is a suite of tools and dashboards aimed at providing transparent insight into Flashbots Auctions and, more broadly, MEV activity on Ethereum.\n\nFlashbots Auction\n\nThe Flashbots Auction architecture aims to employ three separate entities: searchers, builders, and relayers to construct blocks.\n\nSearchers and builders assemble blocks such that the transactions included in blocks and their ordering maximize profitability. As of May 2023, ~9 different entities were serving as builders on Flashbots.\n\nRelayers pass along these blocks to validators who propose them to be appended to the Ethereum Mainnet blockchain. As of May 2023, ~10 different entities were serving as MEV-Boost relays.\n\nHistorically, Flashbots has been the dominant relay \u2013 thus wielding significant influence over block construction and representing a centralization chokepoint. But since the company open sourced its relay software in November 2022, the relay market has become more competitive. There are now ~10 different entities which are serving as relays.\n\nMEV-Boost\n\nMev-Boost is open source software that connects Ethereum validators to this distributed base of relays. It is \u201cmiddleware\u201d in the sense that it allows validators to source the most profitable blocks assembled via the Flashbots auction process thus bolstering their revenue (i.e., staking yield).\n\nSince being launched on proof-of-stake Ethereum in September 2022, MEV-Boost has seen widespread adoption. As of May 2023, ~90% of all Ethereum blocks were proposed by validators that were running MEV-Boost.\n\nGiven that ~$350M worth of MEV has been generated on Ethereum since \u201cThe Merge,\u201d that is not too surprising. Not running MEV-Boost is like leaving money on the table if you are a validator.\n\nFlashbots Data\n\nIn an effort to provide transparency on how much MEV is being generated on Ethereum, who is generating it, and how decentralized the MEV landscape is, Flashbots provides tooling (e.g., APIs and dashboards) which is freely accessible to the Ethereum community.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is MEV? MEV refers to the incremental revenue that blockchain validators can earn by including, excluding, or changing the order of transactions before blocks are finalized. Similar to transaction fees, MEV is a cost borne by users (even if they are unaware of it) that use public blockchains. Some refer to it as an \u201cinvisible tax.\u201d What Is The Source Of MEV? Top examples of MEV sources include sandwich attacks, DEX arbitrage, and liquidation attacks: Sandwich Attacks: A mempool observer spots a large buy order for one asset, places an order ahead of that large buy order, and then sells the asset after the large buy order has pushed up the market price of the asset.\n\nA mempool observer spots a large buy order for one asset, places an order ahead of that large buy order, and then sells the asset after the large buy order has pushed up the market price of the asset. DEX Arbitrage: Buying an asset at a low price on one decentralized exchange and selling it atomically (i.e., within the same transaction) at a higher price on another decentralized exchange.\n\nBuying an asset at a low price on one decentralized exchange and selling it atomically (i.e., within the same transaction) at a higher price on another decentralized exchange. Liquidations: Transactions whereby observers intentionally try to manipulate or change the price of an asset such that a user sees their leveraged position liquidated and benefits by reaping the transaction fees. How Can Users Protect Themselves From MEV? Setting up the Flashbots Protect RPC will protect users from some of the negative externalities associated with MEV. Users can submit transactions through the Flashbots RPC by following the steps outlined above in this article. What Chains Does Flashbots Support? Flashbots is currently only live on Ethereum. What Do Flashbots Do? Flashbots refers to a suite of software products that allow Ethereum users and infrastructure providers to capture and mitigate MEV. Infrastructure providers that run Flashbots software ensure that Ethereum transactions are ordered in such a way that their profitability is maximized. How Many Miners Use Flashbots? Following Ethereum\u2019s merge to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022, Flashbots is used by PoS validators rather than proof-of-work (PoW) miners. The percentage of validators using Flashbots MEV-Boost can be found here. What Is Flashbots RPC? Flashbots RPC refers to the Flashbots Protect remote procedure call (RPC) endpoint. It allows users to submit their transactions to the Flashbots protocol for inclusion in blocks rather than the Ethereum Mainnet mempool. What Percentage Of Blocks Are Flashbots? The percentage of Ethereum blocks sourced via Flashbots MEV-Boost relays can be found here.\n\nData Analyst Andrew Cahill Andrew previously was a Research Director at The Block; a crypto media and research company.

        "title": "EigenLayer goes live on Ethereum with initial $17 million LST deposit limit - The Block",
        "content": "Re-staking protocol EigenLayer launched on Ethereum today, enabling holders of liquid staking tokens to double down for additional yield \u2014 at the cost of extra risk.\n\nThe core idea behind EigenLayer is that the staking security provided by ether stakers can be used to secure other protocols on the network. To use it, holders of liquid staking tokens \u2014 like Lido staked ether (stETH) \u2014 can stake these tokens through EigenLayer. This means that the token holders will gain extra rewards from the newer protocols they\u2019re supporting, but it opens them up to more risk of penalties through slashing.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant step forward for Eigenlayer and we are excited to build the future of shared security together to work to hyperscale Ethereum,\u201d the project's team said in a press release.\n\nAt launch, EigenLayer will support native staking of ether plus liquid staking tokens stETH, Rocket Pool ether (rETH), and Coinbase's wrapped staked ether (cbETH).\n\nThe protocol commences operation with some capacity limits. For example, it will only allow 3,200 tokens for each liquid staking token, creating a total limit of 9,600 liquid staking tokens. At ether's current price, that's a limit of around $16.7 million. The protocol will only let each crypto wallet deposit a maximum of 32 tokens, resulting in at least 300 deposits from separate wallets.\n\nThose who are staking their ether directly can also choose to use EigenLayer. This approach is accomplished through the creation of what\u2019s called an EigenPod. The number of pods will be capped but not the number of staked ether.\n\n\u201cThese limits will be raised progressively over the coming weeks and months, with the goal of reaching a totally open and uncapped state where any user can restake any amount of staked Ether,\u201d said EigenLayer.\n\nEigenLayer previously raised $64.5 million, including a $50 million Series A in March. The startup said today that its Series A raise was at a $500 million valuation, confirming The Block\u2019s reporting ahead of the raise. Its backers include Blockchain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Hack VC and Electric Capital.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe startup was founded in 2021 by Sreeram Kannan, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, Seattle.\n\nConcerns about re-staking\n\nThe re-staking model has drawn criticism from some notable corners of the Ethereum ecosystem. Perhaps most notably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed concern about the emergence of re-staking.\n\n\u201cWe should tread lightly when application-layer projects aim to extend the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus beyond the validation of essential Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d Buterin stated in a blog post.\n\nButerin noted that while re-staking can be used for low-risk purposes, there are situations where it could compromise the mainnet\u2019s security, such as when Ethereum validators face slashing on third-party chains.\n\n\u201cWe should instead preserve the chain\u2019s minimalism and support uses of re-staking that do not seem like slippery slopes towards extending the role of Ethereum consensus,\u201d Buterin suggested.\n\nAt the time, EigenLayer co-founder Sreeram Kannan agreed with some of the concerns but argued that re-staking can be used in low-risk situations."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin network\u2019s social volume has declined, making way for Ethereum, XRP and Binance Coin.\n\nAltcoins continued their recovery by varying degrees with rising confidence from crypto market participants.\n\nBNB price rallied 10% in response to the Binance hearing, which will be updated on Thursday.\n\nSocial media attention has recently turned to Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) at the expense of Bitcoin, a sign of increasing confidence in these altcoins among crypto traders even as the price of the most popular cryptocurrency holds above the $25,000 level.\n\nRecent news affecting these altcoins is the main reason behind the surge in social media mentions. Binance\u2019s hearing on Tuesday marked an important milestone for holders of BNB, the exchange\u2019s native token. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of the D.C. District Court, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance to continue negotiating and to submit a status update by Thursday.\n\nBNB price rallied 10.5% in response to the hearing.\n\nSimilarly, the release of the so-called Hinman emails, key documents for Ripple\u2019s defense against the SEC, fueled a temporary bullish sentiment among XRP holders.\n\nAlso read: XRP volatility surges as Hinman documents support Ripple's case against the SEC\n\nEthereum, XRP and Binance Coin witness spike in social volume\n\nBitcoin\u2019s social volume declined after the asset\u2019s price rally in March, according to data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment. Social volume is built on top of social data collected by the tracker. The platform combs text documents containing the asset name at least once, on Twitter, Telegram and Reddit.\n\nAs seen in the chart below, Bitcoin social volume increased sharply in mid-March, weeks before reaching its recent price peak of $30,899.76 in April.\n\nETH, XRP and BNB social volume\n\nA spike in social volume is typically followed by a rally in the asset\u2019s price in the weeks following a spike in social volume.\n\nETH, XRP and BNB registered an increase in social volume after Tuesday\u2019s events. The Hinman documents, key to Ripple\u2019s defense against the SEC, were unveiled for public view. Their content fueled a bullish sentiment among XRP holders and the altcoin yielded 6% gains before pulling back. Find out more here.\n\nThe Hinman documents shed light on the regulator\u2019s stance on Ethereum and why the asset was considered a non-security, putting the second-largest altcoin by market capitalization under the spotlight too. ETH price held above key support at $1,724, trading at $1,739.57 at the time of writing.\n\nSEC and Binance gear up for Thursday update\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson asked the SEC and Binance to continue negotiating to arrive at a compromise. The Judge asked the two parties to submit a status update by Thursday.\n\nIn the court hearing, the Judge expressed skepticism about the US financial regulator\u2019s move to enforce its powers on Binance and called it \u201cinefficient and cumbersome,\u201d according to a report from the hearing by The New York Times. These comments fueled hopes among Binance\u2019s native token holders, pushing BNB price higher.\n\nBNB price climbed from $228.90 to $252.90, or 10.5%, since Tuesday\u2019s hearing. The exchange\u2019s native token is therefore on track to recoup its recent losses and yield gains for holders ahead of Thursday\u2019s update."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction in the Crypto Market Crash: ETH Crash to $1,400? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is undoubtedly a sea of volatility, and it\u2019s once again undergoing a massive tidal wave. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has plummeted to a new low, crashing below $24,000. Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has not been spared from this downward spiral, falling sharply to $1,600. The unrest in the crypto market further escalated as the SEC initiated lawsuits against two major crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. Amid all these uncertainties, investors and crypto enthusiasts are left pondering over one question: What\u2019s next for Ethereum? Let\u2019s analyze in this Ethereum price prediction.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nBefore diving into the future, let\u2019s take a brief look at what Ethereum is and how it works. Ethereum is a blockchain-based, open-source platform for decentralized applications. It uses its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), as a means for powering these applications. Developers worldwide utilize Ethereum to write smart contracts, representing self-executing agreements coded onto the blockchain.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum\u2019s broader scope allows for a wide array of applications, including DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and much more. However, like Bitcoin, Ethereum is subject to the same market dynamics and sentiment shifts that have recently caused significant price declines.\n\nThe SEC Legal Action and Its Impacts\n\nThe crypto market took a major blow as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. These regulatory actions have further stirred uncertainty, leading to a more cautious approach by investors. The impact of these lawsuits has been far-reaching, instigating a significant sell-off and contributing to the fall in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThis development highlights the growing need for clear regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies, which could potentially stabilize the market in the future. However, in the short term, such news tends to create panic among investors, thereby driving prices down.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: ETH Dips by More Than 6%\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ethereum lost more than 6% of its value, declining from $1,740 to $1,630. This price fall resonates with the bearish sentiment engulfing the broader crypto market. The price volatility has left investors scrambling to reassess their investment strategies and seeking a potential turnaround.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that despite the ongoing crash, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals remain strong. Its utility in various decentralized applications and DeFi platforms continues to foster substantial demand for the asset.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Possible Plunge to $1,400\n\nLooking at the current market dynamics, it\u2019s projected that Ethereum could continue to drop towards $1,600. If the bearish trend persists and market conditions continue to worsen, ETH could potentially decline towards the next support level around $1,400.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

Usually, this peak occurs during a bull market, when the prices of all cryptocurrencies are on an upward trend.\n\nAll-Time Highs By Cryptocurrency\n\nThe top cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum (even your grandma has heard of them\u2026maybe.) There are plenty of other coins too. Some, in fact, that are worth billions of dollars, and may look pretty interesting to investors.\n\nBelow we\u2019ll check out the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and their all-time high prices. But first, a few definitions:\n\nAll-Time High: A cryptocurrency\u2019s value is determined by the price that each token trades at. The all-time high price refers to the highest price at which a token has ever traded.\n\nA cryptocurrency\u2019s value is determined by the price that each token trades at. The all-time high price refers to the highest price at which a token has ever traded. Market Cap: The \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d of a cryptocurrency is the value of all of that cryptocurrency\u2019s tokens combined. This is generally the preferred method for ranking cryptocurrencies in order to determine which crypto projects are larger than others.\n\nToken All-Time High Price All-Time High Market Cap Date of All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) $67,549 $1.27 Trillion 11/8/2021 Ethereum (ETH) $4,724 $558 Billion 11/11/2021 Ripple (XRP) $3.30 $127 Billion 1/4/2018 Binance Coin (BNB) $661 $101 Billion 5/9/2021 Cardano (ADA) $2.95 $94 Billion 9/2/2021 Solana (SOL) $258 $78 Billion 11/6/2021 Dogecoin (DOGE) $0.69 $75 Billion 5/6/2021 Polkadot (DOT) $53 $53 Billion 11/4/2021 Litecoin (LTC) $359 $23 Billion 5/8/2021 Polygon (MATIC) $2.87 $20 Billion 12/26/2021\n\nBitcoin (BTC) \u2013 $67,549\n\nBitcoin reached its all-time high price of $67,549 in November of 2021. At the time, the 2021 bull market was at its height, pushing top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to price levels not seen before. Learn more about Bitcoin price trends.\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 $4,724\n\nEthereum also reached its all-time high price in November 2021 as a result of the broader bull market. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two most popular cryptocurrency investments, so they led the crypto market as it sailed to $3 trillion dollars in overall market capitalization. Learn more about Ethereum price trends.\n\nRipple (XRP) \u2013 $3.30\n\nXRP reached its all-time high early in January 2018 as a result of the first major crypto bull market. At the time, XRP was the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. The token has since fallen far behind its former #2 spot (which is now occupied by Ethereum) and XRP did not do well enough in the 2021 bull run to break its 2018 price record.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) \u2013 $661\n\nThe Binance BNB token reached an all-time high of $661 in May of 2021. This rally was an early part of the larger bull market going on at the time. While most coins reached their peaks in November of 2021, BNB was an early beneficiary of that year\u2019s price action.\n\nCardano (ADA) \u2013 $2.95\n\nCardano reached its all-time high price of $2.95 in September of 2021 as a part of the bull market at the time. In September, the crypto market was just months away from its peak for the 2021 bull run.\n\nSolana (SOL) \u2013 $258\n\nTouted by many as the \u201cEthereum-killer\u201d due to its low fees, large transactions-per-second throughput, and a vibrant developer community, Solana was a very popular coin in 2021. SOL followed in the steps of Bitcoin and Ethereum to attain its $258 all-time high price in November of 2021. The bull market marked November as the top for popular coins like Solana.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) \u2013 $0.69\n\nDogecoin also benefited from the bull market run in 2021, however, its peak was marked by a particular cultural event \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s appearance on the American comedy show Saturday Night Live. In the final days and hours leading up to the show, Dogecoin notched an all-time high of $0.69 cents before falling over 40% just days later.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) \u2013 $53\n\nPolkadot was also one of the coins to benefit from the November 2021 bull run. On November 4th, DOT hit an all-time high of $53 per token. The price was bolstered by the overall bull run, but there was also large demand for the DOT token at the time since Polkadot\u2019s first parachain auction took place during the first week of November 2021. A \u201cparachain\u201d is a part of the Polkadot blockchain that can be used to build a specific blockchain project. There are only 100 parachains available on Polkadot and developers have to bid in an auction in order to win the rights to build on one of the parachains.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) \u2013 $359\n\nBitcoin\u2019s little cousin, Litecoin, achieved an all-time high of $359 in May of 2021 as a result of the 2021 bull market run. This new price record barely beat out Litecoin\u2019s previous all-time high of $314, which occurred in December of 2017.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) \u2013 $2.87\n\nThe MATIC token from the Polygon blockchain hit its all-time high right before the end of the 2021 bull run. On December 26th, 2021, MATIC was trading for $2.87, its highest price to date. The cryptocurrency has since remained a top-10 token in large part due to partnerships with legacy tech companies such as META, Reddit, and Stripe who are using Polygon to build their own blockchain solutions.\n\nCrypto Cycles\n\nCrypto prices, much like prices in the stock market, generally follow cyclical patterns. Periods when prices are going up and investors are optimistic are known as \u201cbull\u201d markets, while periods when prices are going down are known as \u201cbear\u201d markets.\n\nThe crypto world has experienced two major bull runs, as of early 2023. Bull markets happen for many reasons including, heightened developer activity across blockchains, more investor cash flow available for investing in risky assets, and greater media buzz around cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe first occurred at the end of 2017 and lasted through the beginning of 2018, when Bitcoin crossed $10,000 per coin. The second bull market occurred in 2021 when Bitcoin achieved its current all-time high of over $60,000.\n\nDuring bear markets, prices will fall and trading activity will drop. Many crypto traders and experts have predicted that the prices of crypto will start rising again soon and will achieve new all-time highs over the next few years. Ultimately, however, it\u2019s not possible to know whether crypto will go up or down in price over time.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is an all-time high? An \u201call-time high\u201d refers to the highest trading price that a cryptocurrency has attained so far. For example, while the average trading price of Bitcoin in 2022 was around $25,000 per BTC, Bitcoin achieved an all-time high when it was trading for over $67,000 per BTC in November of 2021. What cryptocurrencies are the most valuable? The most valuable cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum. When comparing cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s important to compare them by market capitalization, rather than by the price of each token. This is because cryptocurrencies differ in the amount of tokens they have minted out, which means that token prices are not a good reflection of the size of the cryptocurrency. When will crypto hit all-time highs again? It\u2019s difficult to say when, or if, crypto will hit all-time highs again. The past has shown that the crypto market moves in cycles and that investors can expect price rallies after protracted bear markets. When it comes to investing, however, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nSome notable crypto figures have made price predictions in the past which may prove useful to retail investors. Ultimately, however, it is not possible to know whether crypto will go up or down in price over time.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "title": "Tether Shuffles The Deck: 750 Million USDT Shifted From Tron To Ethereum - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The company behind the issue of USDT stablecoin, Tether Holdings, has announced that it will work with a third-party exchange to convert 750 million USDT from Tron to Ethereum ERC20 via a chain swap.\n\nWith a current market valuation of $83.37 billion, USDT is by far the most valuable stablecoin in existence. Stablecoin use has soared over the last few years, and Tether has been working hard to diversify its reserve holdings in response to the growing need for trust in the network.\n\nTo maintain the liquidity of the stablecoin, cryptocurrency exchange Binance said through Twitter on Monday that it will arrange a swap of 750 million Tether-Tron token pairs for Tether-Ether. Tether has assured that the overall supply of USDT will not increase or decrease as a result of this.\n\nAfter 12pm UTC today, #Binance will be swapping 750M USDT-TRX for USDT-ETH directly with the Tether team to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains for our users. If you see any significant movements of USDT from our wallets today, that\u2019s why. Funds are SAFU. \u2014 Binance (@binance) June 12, 2023\n\nTether Locks On 1:1 USD Anchor\n\nTether, the most popular stablecoin, strives to keep a one-to-one exchange rate with the US dollar (USD) at all times. This token swap will involve Tron, the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $6.3 billion, and Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $210 billion, after Bitcoin.\n\nBy exchanging bitcoin from one blockchain to another, or \u201cswapping chains,\u201d investors can get access to all of the blockchains that back the digital money they possess. Their digital assets can be used on other blockchains that support them.\n\nThe move to rebalance the liquidity base of USDT on Ethereum by shifting from the region of surplus to the region of scarcity remains the most reasonable explanation of the various theories being put forward as to why the USDT is being switched.\n\nMeanwhile, the heightened regulatory scrutiny of Binance has been detrimental to the exchange, prompting this strategic shift. Binance is now engaged in litigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, highlighting the importance of taking preventative action in light of the current regulatory environment.\n\nETH market cap currently at $210 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nRestocking The Ethereum Network Inventory\n\nBinance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao, and Binance.US were all named in a lawsuit brought by the SEC last week. Binance has been accused of engaging in alleged deceptive activities, manipulating trading volumes, diverting user funds, and keeping the identity of those in control of the company in the United States a secret.\n\nTether re-minted $1 billion in USDT on the Ethereum blockchain on Monday, prompting the swap. Tether\u2019s CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted that the recent $1 billion mint was part of the company\u2019s effort to restock its Ethereum Network storage.\n\nIn a related development, as of March, both the Tron Foundation and its creator, Justin Sun, were hit with fraud charges by the SEC. As a result, Binance USA announced that it will be pulling the digital asset token tron from its exchange.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether (ETH was trading at $1,744, down 6.33% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker CoinMarkeCap shows. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is painted in red, and trading at $0.99.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nFeatured image from The Cryptonomist\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Graph \u2013 a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data \u2013 began on Wednesday the final phase of its migration from Ethereum to the layer 2 scaling solution Arbitrum.\n\nWith the migration, The Graph becomes one of the largest Ethereum apps to transition to a layer 2 rollup \u2013 a move that Graph developers Edge & Node say will decrease barriers of entry for The Graph\u2019s participants without compromising on security.\n\nThe Graph, through its web of \u201cdelegators\u201d and \u201cindexers,\u201d allows web3 developers to view blockchain data without trusting centralized intermediaries for the data\u2019s accuracy. Launched initially on Ethereum, its move to layer 2 platform Arbitrum is an effort to decrease gas costs and increase transaction speeds, according to Edge & Node CEO Tegan Kline.\n\nArbitrum, like other Ethereum layer 2 networks, operates as a separate blockchain that runs alongside Ethereum. To reduce fees for users without losing all of Ethereum\u2019s security guarantees, Arbitrum bundles up large groups of transactions and then passes them back down to Ethereum for all-at-once settlement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Graph\u2019s migration involves transferring its \u201csettlement layer\u201d from one network to another \u2013 rather than recording and settling activity directly on Ethereum, The Graph will now settle transactions on Arbitrum.\n\nEvery time a user performs a transaction on The Graph like delegating and indexing, there is a cost to it. \u201cWith this transfer to Artbitrum, those costs are lower. So we expect that there will likely be more indexers that spin up on the network [and] more delegators that get involved because that barrier to entry is lower, the cost isn\u2019t so high,\u201d Kline told CoinDesk.\n\nGRT and ARB, the native tokens for The Graph and Arbitrum, have both remained stable in the past 24 hours amid The Graph\u2019s transition to Arbitrum. GRT has ranged between as high as 99 cents and as low as 97 cents, while ARB has oscillated between 97 cents and $1.01, per CoinDesk data.\n\nThe Graph enables developers to query data from 40 networks and raised $50 million in a 2022 funding round, which saw participation from Tiger Global, Blockwall Digital, Fenbushi Capital, FinTech Collective and Reciprocal Ventures.\n\nCORRECTION (June 14, 2023, 18:23 UTC): Specifies in the piece's first sentence that the final stage of The Graph's migration started Wednesday. The original article stated that the migration itself started on Wednesday."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Collateral Network (COLT) are making waves. As the COLT presale garners attention, Ethereum (ETH) holders are snatching up billions of Collateral Network tokens. Let\u2019s delve into these developments and their implications.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nShiba Inu: The Meme Token with a Bite\n\nThe recent news regarding the memecoin Shiba Inu see a massive transaction of SHIB tokens to Binance. This shift has the potential to increase the Shiba Inu\u2019s popularity in the crypto market.\n\nShiba Inu, often dubbed the \u201cDogecoin killer,\u201d has been on a roller coaster ride. The token, which started as a joke, has now become a serious player in the crypto market. Its decentralized spontaneous community building and its ShibaSwap platform have attracted many investors.\n\nRecent developments have seen a Shiba Inu whale unstake 4 trillion SHIB tokens and move them to Binance. This sizable transaction has increased the circulating supply of Shiba Inu by 1%, bringing the total supply to a staggering 578.9 trillion tokens. On the flip side, the number of staked Shiba Inu tokens has dwindled, indicating a shift in investor strategy.\n\nEthereum: The Backbone of DeFi and NFTs:\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to play a pivotal role in the crypto market. As the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors, Ethereum\u2019s influence extends far beyond its price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain technology, powered by smart contracts, enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and the issuance of a variety of digital assets, including the likes of Shiba Inu and Collateral Network. Its robust platform has made it the go-to choice for developers and investors alike.\n\nHowever, as Ethereum is the second-largest crypto by market cap, it has a limited upside. This is why many Ethereum whales are looking for promising ERC-20 tokens. Recently, a number of them shifted their attention to Collateral Network and its explosive presale.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network: The Future of Lending:\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, will disrupt the lending industry by offering decentralized lending protocols for real-world assets.The platform allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets, addressing the difficulties in obtaining loans for non-traditional assets and the outdated pawnbroking industry.\n\nFor lenders, the platform offers fixed passive income, tangible NFT-backed assets, and security in case of loan default. Borrowers, on the other hand, can enjoy fast turnaround, privacy, transparency, competitive rates, and borderless borrowing.\n\nAdditionally, owners of the $COLT token will have access to our exclusive online auctions for distressed assets. This will give investors the chance to buy properties below market value when a borrower defaults on a loan. Some of these auctions will also be held in the metaverse, as well.\n\nAnalysts predict a 3,500% (35x) price increase during the COLT presale, with the price potentially reaching $0.35. The token is expected to surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. With the team tokens locked for 2 years and the liquidity pool locked for 33 years, the Collateral Network offers a promising investment opportunity.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The Ultimate Guide to the Top 10 Protocols on BNB Chain - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Executive Summary: Since 2021, BNB Chain has made significant strides in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, now holding a roughly 8.5% market share and standing as a formidable competitor to Ethereum and Tron. BNB\u2019s user-friendly design, compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and lower transaction fees position it as an attractive alternative to Ethereum.\n\nOur investing thesis is that Layer-1 blockchains are like operating systems. Just as most of the world runs on either macOS or Windows, so most blockchain apps will likely end up running on either Ethereum, or some competitor. If you believe in the long-term potential of BNB Chain as a top blockchain platform, then buying and holding BNB is the way to invest in it.\n\nWith over 500 DeFi applications, BNB Chain continues to attract robust investor interest, bolstered by Binance\u2019s native token (BNB) being the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. That said, the recent SEC lawsuit against Binance has impacted the BNB token negatively, sending the price roughly 20% lower in a week. That could be signs of worse things to come, or a good way to buy the token at a discount.\n\nBefore 2021, Ethereum monopolized the blockchain applications market, thanks to its intuitive smart contract feature and user-friendly programming language. It accounted for 95% of all DeFi applications. However, the dynamic nature of the crypto space led to the emergence of fierce competition.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, launched its own public blockchain as a competitor to Ethereum. Today, it holds roughly 8.5% of DeFi\u2019s total value locked (TVL), making it the third most popular DeFi ecosystem, following Ethereum and Tron.\n\nWhat is BNB Chain?\n\nBNB Chain has had several rebrandings, but today is made up of two separate blockchains: BNB Smart Chain (originally called Binance Smart Chain), and BNB Beacon Chain (BC).\n\nBNB Chain uses a Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, supported by 50 validators, to ensure short block times and lower fees. The most-bonded validators become block producers, guaranteeing security, stability, and chain finality. BNB Chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and facilitates cross-chain transfers and communications.\n\nBNB Chain offers security and safety through its elected validators. It supports Ethereum tooling, ensuring faster finality and cheaper transaction fees. The native token, BNB, is used for executing smart contracts and staking. Currently, BNB is the 4th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap exceeding $47 billion.\n\nBSC hosts over 500 dapps, and we\u2019ll discuss the top 10 by total value locked.\n\nTop 10 Protocols on BSC by Total Value Locked\n\nPancakeSwap\n\nType of dapp: DEX\n\nBMJ Score: 4.0\n\nPancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on BNB Chain. It enables users to swap Binance\u2019s BEP-20 tokens seamlessly. Borrowing elements from Ethereum-based Uniswap and SushiSwap, PancakeSwap implements an automated market maker (AMM) system, eliminating the need for a centralized order book or facilitator. This means users trade against liquidity pools funded by other users instead of trading directly with counterparties.\n\nBesides trading, PancakeSwap users can become liquidity providers, earn a share of transaction fees, participate in yield farming to earn CAKE tokens, and even engage in a lottery. Moreover, it supports trading and staking of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nPancakeSwap accounts for about 44% of all total value locked (TVL) on BNB Chain, so it easily makes the list of the top 10 largest DeFi protocols.\n\nVenus\n\nType of dapp: Lending\n\nBMJ Score: 4.0\n\nVenus is a DeFi lending platform for the BNB ecosystem. It aims to provide secure and decentralized lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency. Anyone can access this algorithm-based money market by connecting compatible wallets like MetaMask.\n\nUsers can lend or borrow supported digital assets, earn token rewards, and participate in governance via Venus\u2019 native token, XVS. The protocol integrates the functionalities of Compound and MakerDAO, enabling users to lend, borrow, and mint stablecoins within a single ecosystem.\n\nOn Venus, interest rates are set by the protocol, responding to market demands, but the minimum and maximum levels are determined by the governance process.\n\nThe protocol was founded in 2020 by the team behind Swipe. The team\u2019s goal was to bridge traditional finance and DeFi on the BNB Chain. With a TVL figure of $800 million, Venus is the second-largest DeFi protocol on BSC.\n\nBiswap\n\nType of dapp: DEX\n\nBMJ Score: 3.5\n\nBiswap, launched in May 2021, is a DEX offering token swapping on BSC with trading fees starting from as low as 0.1%. Besides providing a platform for trading, farming, and staking, Biswap offers an innovative three-type referral program rewarding users for their referees\u2019 activities in farming, launchpools, and swaps.\n\nThe ecosystem also hosts an NFT marketplace and NFT game. Utilizing an AMM model, Biswap ensures swift transactions while maintaining user control over funds. Its native token, BSW, facilitates incentivization across the platform. With a strategic investment from Binance Labs, Biswap enhances its innovative DEX services.\n\nRadiant V2\n\nType of dapp: Lending\n\nBMJ Score: 3.5\n\nRadiant is an Arbitrum-native omnichain money market protocol that is also supported on BSC. It aims to facilitate cross-chain deposit and borrowing of major assets.\n\nWith the recent launch of Radiant V2, the protocol addresses some of the issues encountered in V1, such as initial emissions, liquidity provision, and fixed unlock times. Enhancements include refined tokenomics, increased utility, the integration of cross-chain capabilities, launches on multiple new EVM chains, and the implementation of LayerZero Omnifungible Token (OFT). V2 is also designed to amass fair value for the DAO, positioning Radiant as a leading fee-generating protocol in DeFi. Notably, the upgrade underwent rigorous security audits by Peckshield, Zokyo, and BlockSec, affirming its robust security framework.\n\nAlpaca Finance\n\nType of dapp: Yield farming\n\nBMJ Score: 3.0\n\nAlpaca Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform launched on BSC in early 2021. It offers leveraged yield farming and supports undercollateralized loans for enhanced yield farming positions, improving capital efficiency.\n\nWith over $300 million in TVL, it has grown rapidly since its launch, diversifying into single-asset staking, LP staking vaults, and experimental synthetics while actively partnering with other protocols.\n\nAlpaca\u2019s lending mechanism lets users earn yield through Alpaca tokens and popular cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and BNB.\n\nNotably, Alpaca adopts a deflationary buyback and burn model for a percentage of platform fees, reducing total supply over time, which further strengthens the value proposition of the protocol.\n\nBinance Staked ETH\n\nType of dapp: Liquid Staking\n\nBMJ Score: 3.0\n\nTo compete with the popular Lido, Binance launched its own Ethereum-based liquid staking product. Like Lido, this service enables users to earn staking rewards on ETH without locking up their assets, providing enhanced liquidity and more yield opportunities in DeFi.\n\nLaunched initially in response to the Ethereum network\u2019s shift to Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof of Stake mechanism, this product was shifted to a wrapped version of Ether (WBETH) after Binance was served with an SEC lawsuit. Naturally, it caters to the Ethereum community\u2019s increasing demand for staking. Users can stake any amount of ETH and receive WBETH tokens in exchange, which can be eventually used for yield opportunities across the BSC ecosystem. These tokens can be traded, transferred, or used as collateral on Binance, multiplying the options for staked ETH.\n\nPinkSale\n\nType of dapp: Launchpad\n\nBMJ Score: 3.0\n\nPinkSale is a decentralized launchpad unveiled in July 2021. It enables token creation and presale funding for projects across various networks, including BSC, Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, KuCoin Community Chain, and Avalanche. It stands apart with its minimalist toolkit for swift token development and Initial Dex Offering (IDO) sales.\n\nPinkSale integrates innovative features such as an anti-rug pull system, antibot feature, and various token types, ensuring platform safety through regular audits by Certik. With more than 6,000 projects launched, 650,000 participants, and $220 million in TVL, PinkSale has solidified its status as a leading decentralized crypto launchpad while actively preventing scams and maintaining platform decentralization.\n\nWarning: These IDOs are most likely to be considered unregistered securities in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUNCX Network (formerly UniCrypt)\n\nType of dApp: Launchpad\n\nBMJ Score: 2.5\n\nLaunched in June 2020, UNCX Network, previously UniCrypt, is a one-stop DeFi solution providing five principal services to streamline project development and enhance investor security. With offerings such as Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO) services, liquidity lockers, token vesting, staking-as-a-service, and ENMT Token Minter, UNCX Network facilitates transparency and safety for both project creators and investors.\n\nDevelopers can create bespoke presales, lock liquidity to protect investors, vest tokens for price stability, and establish staking pools. For those lacking token or solidity skills, the network\u2019s minter creates pre-audited tokens, boosting project credibility. UNCX Network\u2019s integrated platform simplifies project launch and operation while promoting secure investment.\n\nWarning: These ILOs are most likely to be considered unregistered securities in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCoinWind\n\nType of dapp: Yield\n\nBMJ Score: 2.0\n\nCoinWind is a smart yield farming platform supported by HECO and BSC. Launched in 2021, it is strategically designed to optimize user revenues by automatically matching pledged tokens (digital assets locked for rewards). As of May 2023, the protocol\u2019s TVL is over $200 million.\n\nCoinWind effectively addresses the issues of low revenues from single-token mining and high risks from LP mining in the DeFi landscape. As a smart decentralized finance management platform, CoinWind aggregates funds from various token pools to participate in diverse liquidity mining opportunities. It combines this with price hedging strategies to lessen impermanent loss, aiming to maximize user returns while minimizing unpredictable losses.\n\nTHENA\n\nType of dapp: General\n\nBMJ Score: 1.0\n\nTHENA is a relatively new project that aims to become the go-to DeFi trading platform on BNB Chain. According to its roadmap, the ecosystem will include a wide range of DeFi products, including ALPHA, an advanced perpetual trading platform, WARP, a launchpad accelerator, and CORE, a social hub promoting user interaction. On top of that, RAMP will ensure seamless fiat transactions \u2013 something that other DeFi projects don\u2019t offer.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nSince 2021, BNB Chain has demonstrated significant growth and adoption in the DeFi space, capturing nearly 10% of the total market and vying with Tron for the spot as second-largest DeFi ecosystem. Despite Ethereum\u2019s dominance, BSC\u2019s lower transaction costs, shorter block times, and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine have made it an appealing alternative for many projects.\n\nThe BNB Chain hosts a multitude of DeFi applications, with a diverse range of protocols leading the way. Projects like PancakeSwap and Venus have left their mark on the ecosystem, with the former accounting for almost half of BSC\u2019s total value locked.\n\nWhile BNB is currently maintaining its position among the top 5 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, investor interest and confidence in the BNB ecosystem has taken a hit due to the lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance and its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao. Given the uncertainty surrounding the exchange it would be wise to remain cautious about investing in BNB, as well as any project building within the Binance ecosystem.\n\nSubscribe to Bitcoin Market Journal to discover more investment opportunities in blockchain!"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s market cap soared by over 118% in the first quarter of the year, despite earlier network performance issues. This growth sparked a surge in transaction activity and boosted the entire ecosystem. Notably, Solana\u2019s DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi sectors witnessed significant development. Furthermore, the total value locked in Solana surged by 23.5% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: The Battle of Meme Coin Across Networks\n\nHowever, Ethereum-based meme coins such as Pepecoin, Dejitaru Tsuka, and MillionaireGame Coin (MG) remain strong contenders. These coins continue to attract attention from the market, posing a challenge to Solana and its native meme coins, Bonk.\n\nIntroducing popular meme coins on the two networks:\n\nBonk (BONK) Pepe (PEPE) MillionaireGame Coin (MG) Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA)\n\nBONK: What Happened to Solana\u2019s Meme Coin?\n\nBonk (BONK), once the representative meme coin on Solana, has been struggling to maintain its price growth trend since the end of 2022.

        "title": "7 Cryptos To Help Beat The Bear Market - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 7 cryptos to help beat the bear market. While the crypto bear market can be boring, it is a good time to look at old and new beginner cryptocurrency opportunities. Bitcoin can store value, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality, or innovative tokens such as InQuBeta\u2019s QUBE and NFTs are all exciting examples. This article will explore various options for entering the cryptocurrency space, the tokens to watch, and how to strategically find the best crypto to invest in and understand which crypto to buy today for long-term growth.\n\nHow to Get Into Cryptocurrencies?\n\nTo get into cryptocurrency for beginners, start by educating yourself on the basics of blockchain technology and researching various coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. Then, choose a reputable cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase to create an account, which is an essential step in how to get into cryptocurrency. For cryptocurrency trading for beginners, it is crucial to invest prudently, diversify your portfolio with different coins, and constantly monitor market trends. Remember to practice secure storage for your assets and be prepared for market volatility.\n\n7 Cryptos To Help Beat The Bear Market\n\nDiversify your portfolio with these seven cryptocurrencies: InQubeta (QUBE), DigiToads (TOADS), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) to hedge against bear market downturns and seek potential profits.\n\nInQuBeta (QUBE) \u2013 Best ICO to Buy Now\n\n\n\nIn the flourishing sector of AI startups, InQubeta presents what could be considered one of the best new ICOs to buy with its innovative Web3 crowdfunding platform. It aims to change how AI startups engage with their communities and raise funds by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts. Through its platform, InQubeta enables a more transparent, secure, and democratic DeFi crypto ecosystem for investment in AI startups. The token symbol for InQubeta is QUBE, which operates on the Ethereum network (ERC-20).\n\nWhat makes InQubeta exceptionally alluring as one of the altcoins is its ability to fractionalize investment opportunities. AI startups can mint their investment opportunities into NFTs, which can be fractionalized, making them some of the top crypto coins and allowing investors to invest according to their budget. This lowers barriers to entry and provides an opportunity to be part of the following significant AI innovation, even with modest investment capital.\n\nFurthermore, InQubeta is slated to launch its custom-built NFT marketplace, further facilitating AI startups in raising funds by offering a reward and equity-based NFTs. QUBE token holders can seamlessly invest in projects of their preference, establishing a symbiotic ecosystem for investors and startups. QUBE serves not just as a medium of investment but also as a governance token. It is deflationary, meaning its value is expected to rise as tokens are gradually burnt over time. An exciting feature of QUBE is the \u2018burn tax\u2019, whereby 2% of all token sales and 1% of purchases will be permanently removed from circulation and burnt, creating a scarcity effect.\n\nFor those seeking a more passive income, QUBE has covered you with its staking rewards pool. Long-term QUBE holders who stake their tokens will be rewarded from buy/sell taxes. Additionally, tokens are vested over 12 weeks to foster a sustainable market for investors.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) \u2013 Best Crypto to Invest for Metaverse\n\n\n\nDigiToads is a remarkable collection residing on the Ethereum blockchain The DigiToads community, which is steadily expanding, is driven by passionate collectors and enthusiasts who deeply value the creativity embedded in each toad. Every DigiToad is distinctive due to a wide variety of features, ensuring that no two toads are alike. This individuality has catapulted DigiToads into a much-coveted collection within the NFT space and makes it one of the top NFT collections.\n\nIn addition, DigiToads is not just a static collection; it is an evolving ecosystem. Through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), DigiToad owners can participate in governance and shape the project\u2019s trajectory. This sense of ownership and contribution further solidifies the community\u2019s involvement and dedication to the DigiToads world. On top of that, this project has also built their own metaverse called The Swamp. This is where you can let your DigiToads play and use the TOADS token to buy potions, food or training equipment.\n\nIn a nutshell, DigiToads effortlessly combines artistry, community involvement, and exclusivity through its diverse toad characters, community-driven development, and real-world perks for holders.\n\nBuy DigiToads Now\n\nBitcoin (BTC) \u2013 Best Crypto to Invest in Now to Weather the Bear Market\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the original and most prominent cryptocurrency, remains an attractive investment option for seasoned and novice investors. Bitcoin for beginners is one of the easiest ways to get started within the cryptocurrency world. As the pioneer in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin holds a unique position and has consistently proven to be the best crypto to invest in due to its upward trend in value since 2009. Its decentralized nature, secured through blockchain technology, ensures that any government or financial institution does not control it. This makes it a go-to asset for individuals seeking an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Additionally, Bitcoin has proven to be a reliable store of value, often called digital gold, especially during economic uncertainty. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity is another appealing factor, as it protects against inflation. The widespread adoption and integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial systems and payment gateways have further solidified its dominance and utility. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, gain exposure to an alternative asset class, and potentially achieve substantial returns, Bitcoin stands out as an exceptional choice in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 Best Altcoin To Watch\n\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the top 10 altcoins and even a top 5 cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a digital currency and store of value, Ethereum serves as a decentralized computing network built on blockchain technology and is a leading DeFi crypto. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood, Ethereum has grown exponentially and represents a significant portion of the global cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhat sets Ethereum apart is its versatility and functionality. Ether, the native token of Ethereum, can be used for financial transactions similar to Bitcoin. However, the Ethereum network allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain. This innovative feature enables the secure and transparent handling of complex transactions, including the execution of smart contracts, which automatically enforce themselves once certain conditions are met. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is faster than Bitcoin\u2019s, with a new block validated every 12 seconds as opposed to Bitcoin\u2019s 10 minutes.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) \u2013 Best Utility Crypto to Buy\n\n\n\nBinance Coin (BNB), the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, presents itself as a utility token with multifaceted applications, making it a shield in bearish times for investors. Initially launched in July 2017 through an initial coin offering, BNB was primarily used for availing trading fee discounts on the Binance platform. However, with Binance\u2019s evolution into an extensive ecosystem, BNB\u2019s applications have diversified substantially.\n\nOne of the distinct aspects of Binance Coin is its token-burning mechanism. Every quarter, Binance uses a portion of its profits to buy back and permanently destroy BNB tokens, a practice known as burning. This reduces the BNB supply, which could affect its value positively. In market downturns, utility tokens like BNB are top crypto to buy as they tend to retain value better than purely speculative assets due to their intrinsic usefulness in various ecosystems. This renders BNB a viable option for investors seeking a protective hedge during bearish market conditions.\n\nSolana (SOL) \u2013 Best Crypto to Invest in for P2E\n\nSolana (SOL) has emerged as an investment-worthy cryptocurrency that continues to perform resiliently despite the turbulent waves of the bear market. Solana stands out because of its ultra-high-speed transaction processing capabilities, achieved without compromising decentralization through a combination of innovative technologies, including the \u201cproof of history\u201d consensus mechanism. With the ability to process approximately 50,000 transactions per second, Solana trounces Ethereum\u2019s current throughput and is vying to compete with centralized payment processors like Visa.\n\nThe meteoric surge in the price of SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, was partly fuelled by the launch of a primate-themed NFT collection called Degenerate Ape Academy, which drew mainstream attention. Furthermore, Solana\u2019s low transaction fees and lack of congestion make it an attractive platform for developers and users alike, especially for DeFi projects and NFTs. Its native token, SOL, is used for transaction fees and staking, granting holders voting rights in governance proposals.\n\nGiven its technological innovations, scalability, and growing ecosystem of applications, Solana\u2019s SOL appears as an alluring crypto asset with the potential to stay buoyant even in bearish market conditions.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) \u2013 Good Crypto to Buy for Cheap Fees\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is a robust choice for cryptocurrency investors, as it provides a much-needed stability anchor amidst the tumultuous tides of the bear market. Polygon is a multi-chain scaling solution that improves Ethereum\u2019s scalability and interoperability. It efficiently addresses network congestion issues by processing transactions on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain before returning them to the main Ethereum chain. This framework allows for significantly faster transactions. With its native token, MATIC, Polygon offers various scaling solutions, including Plasma chains, PoS blockchain bridges, zk-rollups, and optimistic rollups, catering to diverse security, speed, and cost needs.\n\nNot merely an alternative, Polygon seeks to bolster Ethereum\u2019s capabilities and foster mass adoption. By enhancing Ethereum\u2019s performance without competing against it, Polygon (MATIC) appears as an astute investment for those looking for a stable, synergistic, and future-proof asset in the crypto sphere during the bear market.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\n7 Cryptos To Help Beat The Bear Market \u2013 Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the crypto space offers many possibilities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. From understanding blockchain technology to researching and investing in diverse coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, InQuBeta, or engaging in the NFT space with DigiToads, there is something for every investor. Investing wisely, diversifying, and staying informed is essential to navigate volatile cryptocurrency markets successfully. Remember to prioritize security and make calculated decisions based on research and market trends.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "A token is a type of cryptocurrency that can be created by anyone, without the need for much technical know-how or skill.\n\nThis is one of the reasons there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market - tokens have enabled almost any brand, company or idea to make their own in a matter of minutes.\n\nERC20 is a technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn this guide we explain how they work, list some popular ones and show you where to store them.\n\nDisclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nWhat are ERC20 tokens?\n\nSince its launch in 2015, Ethereum has become one of the driving forces behind the growth of cryptocurrency. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have raised billions of dollars in funding for crypto projects from all around the world, and most of these ICOs are based on the Ethereum platform. Buyers contribute Ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC) to participate in a crowdfunding sale, and in return receive some of the ICO project\u2019s native tokens.\n\nERC20 is a technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow. These include how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, how users can access data about a token and the total supply of tokens. The protocol is necessary to ensure compatibility between the many different tokens issued on Ethereum.\n\nJust like bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency, ERC20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, these tokens are issued on the Ethereum network. This means they\u2019re hosted by Ethereum addresses and are sent using Ethereum transactions.\n\nERC20 tokens are \"smart assets\" that can be programmed to do certain things by using smart contracts. For instance, tokens can be programmed to be paid out to employees by the hour or minute instead of at the end of the work week. This sort of programmability allows for new sorts of financial applications and innovations and is part of what makes Ethereum special.\n\nHackday project In 2018 as part of a hackathon I created a cryptocurrency in about 20 minutes by using the ERC20 token standard. It cost me about AUD $30 of ETH at the time. The goal was to use the tokens as reward points that would automatically be paid out to anyone who used green financial products. Doing so helped me bring my prototype to life by having a working cryptocurrency that I was able to send to judges and other participants. \u2014 James Edwards, Cryptocurrency Expert\n\n\n\nPopular ERC20 tokens list\n\nMany crypto newcomers are surprised to discover just how prevalent ERC20 tokens are. Take a look at a list of the top 100 digital currencies by market cap, and you'll see plenty of well-known currencies that use the ERC20 standard, including:\n\nImportant: Some coins are launched as an ERC20 token, before being migrated over to their own blockchain. This means that the token will have to be swapped for a coin on the new blockchain once the migration is complete. If this happens, you will need to migrate your tokens over to the new chain, and will no longer be able to send the tokens to an Ethereum-based wallet. If you send coins from one blockchain to a wallet on another blockchain, you will lose your coins. Make sure you know which blockchain your coins or tokens are hosted on before sending them to a new wallet or address, especially as some tokens may exist across multiple chains.\n\nFind out more about altcoins in our top 100+ list.\n\nDid you know? Want to know why they're called ERC20 tokens? The \"ERC\" stands for \"Ethereum Request for Comments\", which is an official protocol used to propose improvements to the Ethereum network. The \"20\" is the unique ID number used to identify the proposal.\n\nWhich wallets support ERC20 tokens?\n\nIf you\u2019re buying any digital currency that\u2019s issued as an ERC20 token, you\u2019ll need to find a wallet that\u2019s compatible with these types of tokens. Happily, because ERC20 tokens are so popular, there are plenty of wallets to choose from, including the following:\n\nTo find out ways to securely store your ERC20 tokens, you can begin by comparing the above wallets.

        "title": "XRP Army Finds Clues Why Hinman Gave Ethereum Free Pass - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The XRP community has been digging through the recently released 400+ pages of Hinman documents in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), examining why the former director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, Bill Hinamn, gave Ethereum (ETH) a free pass as a non-security.\n\nAs NewsBTC reported, Hinman spoke on the phone with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin ahead of his speech to ascertain how Ethereum operates. In addition, Hinman defied the recommendation of the SEC\u2019s Office of General Counsel (OGC), which opposed including ETH in the notorious speech.\n\nNew Revelations By The XRP Army\n\nXRP community member Ashley Prosper has read the Hinman documents in full and found some interesting stuff regarding Ethereum and Bill Hinman. To recall, Hinman returned to the law firm Simpson Thacher, which is also part of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, in 2020.\n\nAccording to Prosper, the documents reveal how Hinman was pushed hard by Simpson Thatcher and ConsenSys to give the Ethereum Free Pass speech. Hinman intentionally refrained from sending the speech to any of the commissioners except Jay Clayton because it would, in his words, \u201cslow down the process significantly.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Hinman stated that he researched Ethereum in depth before giving his speech. Still, he could not answer how much Ether (ETH) Joe Lubin, Vitalik Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation owned, or who was funding the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe XRP Community member also speculates that the SEC is so concerned about the revelation of Joseph Lubin\u2019s name that it has blacked out any mention of the name \u201cJoe\u201d in Hinman\u2019s interview. Even when it was about Joseph Grundfest. Prosper further states:\n\nJorge Tenreiro [SEC attorney] is fighting tooth and nail in Hinman\u2019s deposition to prevent any answers related to ETH, Ethereum, Consensys, or Lubin. Just look at how he approaches the ETH questions compared to the Bitcoin ones.\n\n#XRP #XRPCommunity\n\nThe SEC is so worried about revealing Joseph Lubins\u2019 name that they redacted every reference to the name Joe in Hinmans deposition. Even when it belonged to Joesph Grundfest, whom they already identified by name. The fear is real\u2026 what does @ethereumJoseph\u2026 pic.twitter.com/j9vUnuHIOy \u2014 Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) June 15, 2023\n\nYet Prosper found a passage in the documents that reveals Hinman had four to five meetings with ConsenSys, as well as face-to-face conversations with people associated with the company.\n\nRenowned XRP community member Mr Huber speculates, based on Prosper\u2019s findings, that the reason for the urgency of the speech was to exempt Ethereum from the ethics provision coming into effect the next week, which would have required all government employees to disclose their ETH holdings.\n\n\u201cHinman\u2019s speech not only prevented that from happening, it also ensured that many politicians joined Ethereum afterwards, which is why people are still trying to cover it up,\u201d Mr Huber says.\n\nRenowned XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan has a similar suspicion. He claims Hinman was paid to \u201cgive ETH a free pass\u201d. In an interview on CryptoLaw, Hogan speculated that an Ethereum member bribed Hinman to give ETH a free pass during the speech:\n\nMy speculation is that Ripple\u2019s position here is that Bill Hinman was somehow paid, and he was paid by the Ethereum Foundation or someone related to Ethereum to give the speech, give Ethereum a free pass.\n\nHowever, Hogan also clarified that Ripple does not want to make accusations against others like the Ethereum Foundation, presumably because there is not enough evidence.\n\nAt press time, XRP changed hands for $0.4735, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from VOI, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Crypto Analyst Reveals Reversal Levels for Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Litecoin Amid Altcoin Correction \u2013 Potential Trend Reversals Ahead - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Crypto analyst, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, shared valuable observations regarding potential levels of reversal for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Litecoin (LTC).\n\nVan de Poppe indicates that BNB\u2019s inability to sustain support around the $270 level indicates a possible trajectory toward $200.\n\nIn a YouTube video, cryptocurrency analyst, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, shared valuable observations regarding potential levels of reversal for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Litecoin (LTC) during the ongoing correction in altcoins. Van de Poppe\u2019s analysis emphasizes crucial price levels that have the potential to initiate trend reversals for these prominent digital currencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThe renowned analyst, with a subscriber base of 163,000, expressed concern about Ethereum\u2019s potential for additional downward movement unless it manages to regain stability around the $1,785 support level. According to Michael,\n\nThis entire area of $1,785 is something we need to sustain. Otherwise, we are going to look at a case that I think we are going to retest the area around $1,600 and have the reversal taking place.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,636.51. If the market moves towards the reversal range identified by Van de Poppe, it implies a potential decline of more than 8% for this prominent altcoin.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nAnalyzing Binance Coin (BNB), which serves as the utility token for the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Van de Poppe indicates that the altcoin\u2019s inability to sustain support around the $270 level indicates a possible trajectory toward $200, where a potential reversal could occur.\n\nVan de Poppe added that placing bids in the $200 range could become significant if the market continues to demonstrate weakness. As of press time, the coin is currently trading at $237.59.\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nRegarding Litecoin (LTC), Van de Poppe indicates that the correction phase for this decentralized payment network might be approaching its conclusion. He identifies $70 to $73 as the potential zone for a trend reversal in LTC. A rapid upward surge can be expected if Litecoin successfully secures support within this range. Presently, LTC is trading at $72.65.\n\nNevertheless, the reversal levels identified can play a vital role in signaling possible market trends for Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Litecoin in the upcoming days. Traders will closely monitor whether these cryptocurrencies succeed in reclaiming their support levels or if they persist in the ongoing downward correction.\n\nIn a video analysis he uploaded on the 5th of this month, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe said that Litecoin\u2019s narrative surrounding the halving event could drive the peer-to-peer payments network to a price level previously observed in December 2021.\n\nHe further stated,\n\nLitecoin is doing absolutely great, too. It is on the edge of having a breakout\u2026 I think the halving will take place in (August), which means that we still have six to eight weeks before it takes place. I think having a strong rally is likely if it breaks through $100.\n\nVan de Poppe further said that Ethereum, the prominent smart contract platform, is in a similar situation. According to the crypto strategist, as long as ETH maintains a trading price above $1,800, it can surpass its immediate resistance level.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Estimates do not guarantee end-of-month prices.\n\nThe 2023 year has breathed new life into the crypto market, with many major cryptocurrencies and altcoins witnessing a striking recovery following an extremely harsh 2022. Among digital assets that saw a significant rebound in price is Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nApart from the broader market rally, ETH price received an additional boost following the long-awaited Shapella upgrade, aimed at facilitating the blockchain\u2019s road to achieving higher security, decentralization, and scalability.\n\nHowever, the market is now facing fresh uncertainty stemming from the intensifying regulatory crackdown on the industry, led by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Seeking further insights, on how this could impact ETH\u2019s price, Finbold analyzed the latest crypto community predictions on CoinMarketCap on Thursday, June 15 for the end of this month.\n\nFor June 30, 2023, the community members predict an average Ethereum price of $1,809, representing a potential price increase of 10.31% from the current price.\n\nCoinMarketCap community\u2019s price prediction for June-end.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEthereum (ETH) price analysis\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,644, down 5.6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn a weekly chart, Ethereum is down more than 11.2%, trading in a notable trading range from $1,632 to $1,916 during that period.\n\nETH 1-week price chart.

        "content": "Venture capitalist and billionaire Tim Draper says the SEC chair is crippling the American technology and crypto innovation progress with damaging policies.\n\nDraper thinks \u2018America is going to be a technology wasteland in 40 years.\u2019\n\nTim Draper, an American Venture capitalist, and billionaire, has responded to SEC Chair Gary Gensler calling the crypto industry \u2018scam artists\u2019 and \u2018fraudsters\u2019 in an interview on Fox Business show \u2018The Claman Countdown.\u2019\n\nThe Draper Venture Network founder said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Gary Gensler, runs the US with policies that cripple crypto innovation.\n\nDraper said that Gary Gensler and the SEC have no right to oversee crypto technology and that crypto should be regulated in a new way. The billionaire said crypto firms do not expect zero crypto regulations and are willing to abide by clear guidelines. However, the SEC has issued confusing guidelines, upsetting and discouraging the crypto industry from growth.\n\nDraper criticizes SEC\n\nDraper, an early Bitcoin (BTC) investor, said if there is any fraud, as in FTX, the SEC chair has the job of protecting investors but should not randomly shoot down any firm with new technology.\n\nDraper continued to say, despite having a few characters going against the law, Gensler should not enforce random things as if the country does not have guidelines. These baseless enforcements will drive innovation out of the country, and America will be a technology wasteland in forty years. He gave an example of how Coinbase was willing to abide by the law, but the new SEC regulations weighed them down.\n\nIf there was a fraud [in FTX], and I think there probably was, then you have a job to do. But you don\u2019t just start shooting randomly at any company with new technology. That makes absolutely no sense.\n\nDraper remarked and continued to say:\n\nAnd sure, there are certain people who are doing things that you clearly don\u2019t want to have done in the US. We all have to play by a certain set of rules. We play by those rules. We always believed in those rules in the US. But now, it\u2019s like we don\u2019t know the rules, and [Gensler] can enforce whatever he wants and whenever he wants. That is going to drive all the innovation right out of the country. It makes no sense at all. He is damaging our country if he is going to do that.\n\nTim Draper also commended Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for doing everything as dictated by American law. Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange by volume in the US, was charged by the SEC last week with allegations of security violations. Draper noted that Brian had done everything right and brought innovations that would transform the global economy. However, the American regulators can decide whether Coinbaase and Brian\u2019s transformational innovations will happen in the US.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "Binance, the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, continues to employ the Ethereum (ETH) account it was accused of using to commingle clients\u2019 funds as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indictment against them lingers. The allegations against Binance involve the mingling of funds into accounts controlled by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of Binance, namely Sigma Chain and Merit Peak.\n\nThe Ethereum account, initially brought to public attention by journalist Mike Burgersburg, alias \u201cDirty Bubble Media,\u201d remains in use despite the ongoing controversy. Recent transaction data on Etherscan reveals that the account received approximately $7 million in Tether and 299,999 Uniswap tokens, with a combined value of around $1.3 million, from two separate Binance.com accounts. Intriguingly, they were swiftly transferred to Binance US accounts shortly after the funds arrived.\n\nThis Ethereum account, established in August of the previous year, has been consistently utilized for moving funds from Binance.com to Binance US. The total amount transferred through this account is $1.4 billion.\n\nBinance has yet to provide a comprehensive explanation for this activity. However, during a Twitter Space session organized after the crash of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, CZ admitted to being a shareholder in a market maker that serves Binance. Notably, he emphasized that this market maker does not generate profits.\n\nIn the same interview, CZ asserted that Binance is an exchange that operates transparently and honestly, denying any claims of trading against its clients. Nevertheless, the recent SEC indictment accuses CZ of using up to 300 personal accounts for trading on Binance.\n\nBinance\u2019s response to the SEC\u2019s allegations did not directly refute the claims made. Instead, the exchange stated that clients\u2019 funds were never endangered and criticized the regulator\u2019s actions, asserting they are detrimental to the US\u2019 global financial innovation and leadership position.\n\nThe persistence of Binance in using the contentious Ethereum account raises further questions about the exchange\u2019s operations and compliance with regulatory standards. The ongoing controversy surrounding Binance, coupled with the indictment by the SEC, has undoubtedly cast a shadow over the exchange\u2019s reputation and intensified scrutiny from the cryptocurrency community and regulatory bodies alike.\n\nConsequently, Binance faces a critical juncture as it must navigate these allegations and provide a more transparent account of its actions. The impact of this controversy on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and the perception of regulatory compliance within the industry remains to be seen."

        "content": "EigenLayer, a Seattle-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform, announced the deployment of its staking protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum released its Shapella Upgrade on April 12, 2023, allowing un-staking of Ether. The investors who staked 32 ETH to become validators could not withdraw their money, and the upgrade allowed them to gain rewards from this staking mechanism.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the deployment of the Stage-1 EigenLayer protocol on Ethereum Mainnet!\n\n\n\nThis marks a significant milestone in our mission to create a permissionless environment for innovation.https://t.co/QZ529WsIAS pic.twitter.com/SYHexSRTA0 \u2014 EigenLayer (@eigenlayer) June 14, 2023\n\nRe-staking Protocol Rolled out on Ethereum Mainnet\n\nEigenLayer would allow ETH stakers to deposit select liquid staking tokens, including Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Lido stETH (stETH), and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH). In March 2023, EigenLabs, the developers behind EigenLayer, raised $64.5 million at the valuation of $500 million in a series of investment rounds, adding another $50 Million in a Series A funding round.\n\nThe parameters set by the DeFi protocol for liquid and native staking are set along with liquid re-staking acceptance of a maximum of 3,200 for each liquid re-staking token and a maximum limit of 32 tokens per deposit address. Native re-staking is scheduled to be paused with the limitation of 9,600 ETH reached on the protocol.\n\nThe concept of liquid staking has been gaining serious ground since the blockchain shifted from energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism through a merge that occurred in September 2022. Data suggests that a total of $16.92 Billion ETH are currently staked on the top five liquid staking protocols.\n\nThe Upgrade Which Allowed Un-Staking\n\nThe Ethereum Shapella Upgrade was operationalized on April 12, 2023. The soft-fork event on the blockchain allowed the un-staking of nearly 4.4 Million ETH staked after the merge. Before the upgrade, analysts argued that this step would be devastating as it would result in a withdrawal influx, which would badly affect the price.\n\nContrary to speculations, the upgrade proved beneficial as most stakers steered away from dissolving their stake and preferred to earn passive income through staking. Moreover, developers were rooting for this to happen, as this is believed to be the main motive behind the upgrade.\n\nExperts predict that the scenario shall only grow from here onwards, especially when deflationary forces come into play. The average waiting time for gaining yield from staking is roughly over a month. Still, the investors are lining up for it.\n\nData suggests that over 50,000 individuals want to become validators on the blockchain. Also, the current annualized yield for staking ETH is between 4% to 5%. This hints that the Ether owners are eager to become validators and enjoy dual benefits.\n\nThe Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, and since then, staking emerged as a passive source of income. However, following this, the stakers could not leverage any yield from the locked coins. Furthermore, the subsequent price drop caused most stakers to bear losses.\n\nThe upgrade facilitates the flexibility of withdrawing the staked ETH, preventing the fear of the amount being locked for an extended period. This scenario caused the deposits on the blockchain to surpass the withdrawals for the first time. Additionally, the investors now have a new avenue to earn apart from holding on to ETH and waiting for the price to surge."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment for Beginners? - Coinposters - Cryptocurrency News",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have gained significant popularity in recent years, and Ethereum, in particular, has emerged as one of the leading blockchain platforms. As a beginner investor, it\u2019s important to carefully evaluate the potential of any investment before committing your hard-earned money. This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of whether Ethereum is a good investment for beginners. We will delve into the features of Ethereum, examine the factors to consider, explore the benefits and risks associated with investing in Ethereum, and offer tips to help you make an informed decision.\n\nOverview of Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015. Ethereum stands out among other cryptocurrencies due to its versatility and ability to support a wide range of applications beyond digital currency.\n\nKey Features and Advantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum offers several key features that contribute to its appeal and potential as an investment:\n\nSmart Contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules. These contracts automatically enforce the terms and conditions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enhancing efficiency.\n\nDecentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications. These dApps operate on the blockchain, offering transparency, immutability, and resistance to censorship.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It allows developers to write code in multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a broad developer community.\n\nComparison with Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile Ethereum is often compared to Bitcoin, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin primarily functions as a digital currency, whereas Ethereum\u2019s primary focus is on facilitating the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum\u2019s programmable nature and extensive developer support give it a unique advantage over many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount to invest in Ethereum\n\nFactors to Consider for Beginner Investors\n\nBefore investing in Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to evaluate several factors that can significantly impact the investment\u2019s success.\n\nMarket Analysis of Ethereum\n\nTo assess the investment potential of Ethereum, consider the following:\n\nHistorical Performance and Price Trends: Analyze the historical price data of Ethereum and its market performance. Look for patterns, trends, and potential catalysts that have influenced its price movements in the past.\n\nMarket Capitalization and Liquidity: Market capitalization represents the total value of all Ethereum in circulation. Higher market capitalization indicates a more established and liquid market, which can contribute to price stability and ease of trading.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nUnderstanding the risks associated with investing in Ethereum is essential. Consider the following:\n\nVolatility and Price Fluctuations: Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are known for their price volatility. The value of Ethereum can fluctuate significantly in a short period, which may lead to substantial gains or losses.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Considerations: The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is evolving. Changes in regulations or government interventions can impact the value and adoption of Ethereum.\n\nSecurity Risks and Potential Vulnerabilities: Like any digital asset, Ethereum is susceptible to security risks such as hacking, phishing attacks, and smart contract vulnerabilities.

        "content": "EigenLayer Stage 1 has been positioned on the Ethereum mainnet, through which Ethereum stakers can take part in EigenLayer, control their liquid staking tokens, and shift their funds. This is made possible with the help of EigenLayer contracts. Another option is building an EigenPod and shifting the funds to the EigenPod addresses.\n\nIn the next stage, Eigenlayer will be bringing in operators who will carry out the confirmation activities related to Actively Validated Services (AVSs) that have been duly created on the EigenLayer protocol. The third stage will witness the protocol setting off the deliverance of various AVSs by utilizing the strong EigenLayer base.\n\nFollowing the delivery of restakers, operators, and AVSs on EigenLayer, the ecosystem will provide the option for stakers to allocate their staked ETH to operators. The control will remain with the stakeholder, and they will be able to select the AVSs of their choice. Operators and AVSs need to work in tandem.\n\nInitially, the EigenLayer will have some limitations for reasons of safety. Thereafter, the restrictions will slowly be lifted until they reach an absolute no-limit situation, all for the benefit of ether holders. At this point, the protocol will be fully backing liquid staking with regards to Lido stETH (stETH), as well as Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH).\n\nAs for the staking limits, deposits will be accepted for 3,200 tokens against every backed asset. In the case of a user transaction, 32 tokens will be allowed. There will also be no further building of EigenPods the minute the conventional restaking reaches roughly 9,600 ETH. There will be the introduction of a seven-day withdrawal period for safety reasons.\n\nIn order to ensure further safety, EigenLayer has gone through several external safety audits, along with $2,000,000 bug bounties accessible through Immunefi. EigenLayer has the vision of decentralizing the protocol and bringing together the attached community to participate in a complete trustless staking protocol.\n\nSmart contracts that are scalable and have the ability to pause operations were used to construct EigenLayer. Three prime governance multisigs have been assigned oversight over issues relating to contract scaling and the pause feature. There is the community multisig, the operations multisig, and the pauser multisig. All things considered, the launch of EigenLayer on Ethereum marks a significant milestone and moves open innovation into a more favorable environment."
