        "title": "Bitcoin And Ethereum Maximalism: Silly And Self-Defeating - Blockworks",
        "content": "Maximalism is one of the least attractive philosophies in crypto.\n\nIt\u2019s the belief that any given blockchain is fit for all purposes, and that other blockchains are therefore inherently useless and of no value.\n\nThis is as dumb as it sounds.\n\nThe original maximalists were Bitcoiners, many of whom predate the era of smart contracts.\n\nAccording to Bitcoin maxis, the Bitcoin blockchain is capable of almost any functionality that later chains have added; or they assert, bizarrely, that any functionality not supported by the Bitcoin blockchain is not useful, and is therefore unnecessary.\n\nNever mind that Bitcoin is often slow, and somewhat expensive for everyday transactions.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty big fan of Bitcoin. It has many strengths, not least the fact that it\u2019s decentralized, secure, an excellent way to store value, and pretty much censorship-resistant. This makes it useful for all manner of things; some anticipated and desirable, some less so.\n\nI\u2019m also a major admirer of Ethereum. It is also highly decentralized, and it has a fantastic community of developers and builders who have created thousands of useful and utterly new applications on Ethereum.\n\nIt\u2019s also a little expensive, scaling it has involved a lot of compromises and a confusing array of solutions, its governance is tricky, and the manner of its launch made a few people who probably deserved it very rich (as well as a couple of folks who were just lucky enough to be in the room at the time).\n\nAnd I\u2019m excited about lots of other foundational blockchains, some of which have features they don\u2019t really share with Ethereum or Bitcoin, some of which are optimized for transaction cost, or volume, or some other metric.\n\nI try to imagine what it must be like to assert, contrary to logical analysis, that MY blockchain is the ONLY blockchain.\n\nAnd I guess it must be the equivalent of having just one tool in your garage, a drill, and wanting to use that drill for every home improvement project.\n\nHanging some drywall? Drill it! Repairing the stucco? Drill it! Fixing the plumbing? Drill it!\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t necessarily have exactly the right tool for every single situation. Your car, for example, may be a compromise car.\n\nMaybe you own a Toyota Camry. It\u2019s not designed to go extremely fast around corners. It wouldn\u2019t be much good off-road. It doesn\u2019t haul half a ton of lumber.\n\nEssentially the Camry is the Ethereum of cars. It does a bit of everything, which makes it a great solution for people who need their car to do a bit of everything.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you need your blockchain to be very, very good at one thing.\n\nFor instance, you are designing for the billion or so gamers out there.\n\nGamers don\u2019t want to pay little fees every time they mint an NFT achievement like clearing a level in record time, or collect an item they might use in a sequel.\n\nSo maybe you need a blockchain that has no fees.\n\nThat takes some pretty specialist design. Ethereum can\u2019t, by its very nature, support that precise need.\n\nMaybe you need your blockchain to be more private, or more secure, or much faster, or infinitely scalable, or to support some novel quantum-resistant cryptography. There are lots of reasons you might be prepared to trade all the usefulness of Ethereum for something very, very specific to your needs.\n\nIn which case, maximalism is exposed as a fraud.\n\nSure, clever folks have figured out lots of workarounds to make Ethereum more useful. In much the same way that Toyota figured out a nicer set of features to appeal to the customer who orders the loaded Camry \u2013 a better stereo, a more powerful engine, quad exhaust tips (don\u2019t get me started).\n\nBut a very nicely-equipped Camry is still not a Mercedes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Ethereum is a general use blockchain suitable for most general uses.\n\nIt is not the answer to every single real-life use case.\n\nWhich is why maximalism, in all its forms, no matter what blockchain the maximalist is maximizing, is an indication of a minimalist level of intellectual curiosity and honesty.\n\nNot to mention: We\u2019re ostensibly all in this together, right? We all want roughly the same thing: A better way of doing things, for the betterment of our experience on this planet?\n\nWe get there by collaborating, cooperating, working to find the right tool for the right job. Not by screaming at each other for daring to suggest that a general-purpose blockchain may not fit every use case.\n\nEthereum is a great innovation, it has a wonderful community and almost endless uses. Bitcoin is a remarkable and world-changing accomplishment, one that has opened countless minds to new possibilities.\n\nNeither of them is perfect. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nA version of this op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter.

        "content": "Bitcoin price witnessed sharp volatility this April as the bear market comes to an end and Bitcoin prepares for the Bitcoin halving event. While traders anticipate upcoming bullish run amid the banking crisis, U.S. debt-ceiling crisis, and weakening macro, the outlook for Ethereum price and altcoins remains weak.\n\nEthereum price has mostly been under pressure after the Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade as all platforms slowly opened staked ETH withdrawals. The largest liquid staking platform Lido is expected to open withdrawals at the end of May.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price and Other Altcoins Under Selling Pressure\n\nPopular analyst Michael van de Poppe shared his new analysis on altcoins on April 29 as the month comes to an end, with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices need to break key levels in order to maintain upside momentum.\n\nHe believes the bear market looming for Ethereum and altcoins as altcoins loses momentum against BTC and continues to fall. The collapse of First Republic Bank amid the brink of depression and recession will be huge trigger adoption of DeFi.\n\nOther news impacting the crypto prices includes the U.S. Fed rate hike decision, if Fed hike rates it will put addition pressure on the government and banks as they have to give more interest on the money they borrow. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned an economic catastrophe if the U.S. debt ceiling is not raised. The US House has passed the debt ceiling bill, and it now faces the Democratic-led US Senate hurdle.\n\nIn the weekly timeframe, Ethereum (ETH) against Bitcoin (BTC) is showing weakness and altcoins are in correction. ETH/BTC needs to break the 0.069 level for a bullish move and start an altcoin season. The resultant rally in Bitcoin above $30,000 will bring strength in the market and altcoins will follow suit, but BTC price needs to consolidate for ETH price to rally higher.\n\nMichael van de Poppe predicts BTC price reaching $50,000 in the next quarter as positive sentiment in the market considering macro weakness and bitcoin halving.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price To Hit $35000 As First Republic Starts Second Wave Of Banking Crisis"

        "content": "Addresses holding more than 1,000 ETH accumulated more of the altcoin.\n\nETH nears $2,000 but overall activity on the network reduced.\n\nDespite being 33.93% down in the last year, Ethereum [ETH] whales and sharks seem to have found no good reason to deter from accumulating the coin. According to on-chain data, the number of addresses holding 1,000, or more ETH increased to 7091, representing a 5.7% rise.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFurthermore, this action suggested that this group of holders has a long-term bullish outlook, even amid short-term price fluctuations.\n\nUp to the daunting task\n\nAlthough the price remained relatively stable over the past few months, the Ethereum blockchain itself was involved in a series of significant upgrades.\n\nAnd usually, when investors perceive that a particular development depicts remarkable improvement, they tend to stick with the project and contribute more. So, this could have also enabled the decision to accumulate.\n\nHowever, data from Santiment showed that Ethereum\u2019s development activity has subdued. At press time, the metric was down to 53.\n\nFor context, the development activity measures the commitment of developers to polish the working system of a project. Therefore, the value mentioned above implies that major innovation around the Ethereum blockchain has slowed down.\n\nBut it was an entirely different scenario with the Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV). At press time, the 365-day MVRV ratio of Ethereum was at 22.79%. This means that the sharks who were committed to buying ETH made more in profits over the last year.\n\nAt the same time, the current metric condition could serve as an obstruction to a further hike if ETH pushes upwards. However, there were talks of a bull market resumption which could negate speculation around ETH being overvalued at the MVRV spot.\n\nSometimes, appearances are deceptive\n\nWhile whales have turned to spot buying opportunities, the overall market did not share the same sentiment. This was because the active addresses in the last 30 days dropped from 7.9 million to 5.8 million.\n\nActive addresses indicate the daily level of participation and speculation around a token. Therefore, the decrease is a reliable indication that activity has slowed down on the Ethereum network. Often time, this serves as a signal that the general interest in a cryptocurrency is low.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nWith respect to circulation, it was not surprising that ETH tremendously fell for most of 2022. However, the condition at the time of writing showed an improvement.\n\nAt 46.8 million, the rise in circulation signifies an increase in the use of ETH. The coin exchanged hands at $1,800, a 4.41% increase in the last 24 hours."

That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIf Congress fails to lift the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit, a default could come sometime in the summer \u2014 an event that could cause seismic ruptures global markets. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned a default would be catastrophic for the US economy, sparking mass unemployment, payment failures, and higher rates \"into perpetuity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith House Republicans and the White House still far from a deal to raise the debt ceiling, yields on three-month Treasurys recently jumped to a 22-year high, as they would mature around a potential default date.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is still recovering from a massive sell-off that began in late 2021 and continued through much of 2022 as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle.\n\nBut bitcoin has rallied nearly 80% so far in 2023 and recently neared $30,000 as First Republic Bank's woes reignited fears over the financial sector.\n\nFor his part, Kendrick is already bullish on bitcoin, saying in a note on Monday that it could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024 due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things, though it didn't mention the risk of a US default.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" he wrote."

So, how are things going so far? \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/G878AkMCwP \u2014 Coinbase \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@coinbase) March 16, 2023\n\nAccording to Jesse Pollak, Lead for Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase, Base is seen as a means of expanding into the developer space and making it easier for developers to build dApps. Additionally, the platform aims to provide easy access for users to these dApps through Coinbase products with the ultimate goal of bringing a billion users into the cryptocurrency economy as part of Coinbase\u2019s fourth phase of its master plan.\n\nThe L2 is said to be a secure and cost-effective chain that aims to provide a developer-friendly environment for creating dApps on the blockchain, as per the company\u2019s statement. Base is developed on the OP Stack, licensed by MIT, and in collaboration with Optimism, a layer-2 blockchain also focused on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nA number of crypto businesses, platforms, marketplaces and infrastructure firms have reportedly already committed to build on Base. These include:\n\nBlockDaemon\n\nChainlink\n\nEtherScan\n\nQuicknode\n\nAave\n\nAnimoca Brands\n\nDune\n\nNansen\n\nMagic Eden\n\nPyth\n\nRainbow Wallet\n\nRibbon Finance\n\nThe Graph\n\nWormHole\n\nGelato\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made an effort to go out to everyone and bring them into this open ecosystem,\u201d Pollak said.\n\n\u201cWhat will be required of us to make this successful is to continue to double down on those values of decentralization, open source and having this be for everyone and a bridge that connects our users into the crypto economy and brings them to places they can go that aren\u2019t controlled by Coinbase but can offer them valuable experiences.\u201d\n\nCoinbase also plans to integrate the L2 chain across its exchange, wallet, NFT marketplace, and developer products, with the intention of making it interoperable with other blockchains in the ecosystem beyond Ethereum, according to Pollak. In this regard, Base has already held discussions with teams working on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and other blockchains.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s goal with Base is to also provide the foundation for developers and users to enable folks coming in, Pollak said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to require us making Base as cheap as possible, as secure as possible and as decentralized as possible because that decentralization is a key aspect to enable the openness of the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBase is also said to be launching an ecosystem fund in partnership with Coinbase Ventures to make mainly pre-seed investments in builders developing on Base across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

        "title": "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) vs Blockchain - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The directed acyclic graph (DAG) vs. blockchain debate brings new life to the cryptocurrency industry. Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has exploded in popularity. Many crypto enthusiasts don\u2019t know blockchain systems aren\u2019t the only decentralized network.\n\nWhile they have plenty of similarities, DAG-based networks like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and IOTA (MIOTA) work slightly differently from traditional blockchains like Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat is a directed acyclic graph? Are DAG networks truly better equipped to handle real-world use cases?\n\nThis article will explore the basics of DAG technology and how it stacks up against blockchain networks.\n\nWhat Is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)?\n\nA directed acyclic graph, or DAG, is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions and stores cryptocurrency. Like a Layer 1 blockchain, some DAG networks support smart contracts and host innovative dApps and DeFi products.\n\nTo the untrained eye, using a DAG isn\u2019t very different from using a traditional blockchain. However, looking under the hood, you\u2019ll find that DAG-based networks use a slightly different data structure.\n\nHow Do Directed Acyclic Graphs Work?\n\nIn a blockchain, new blocks are validated by nodes or miners and added to the network. Nodes validate new transactions by confirming their data against the recorded history of previous transactions in the last block.\n\nIf a blockchain resembles a chain of blocks, a DAG looks more like a tree with unclosed vertices and edges. Every node in a DAG-based model can have more than one parent root, meaning multiple new transactions can be validated simultaneously. Instead of referencing only the last block, DAG nodes reference previous transactions from any node in the network.\n\nIn a directed acyclic graph, interconnected nodes build off each other and reference multiple transactions. This theoretically makes them more expansive and eases network congestion.\n\nLike traditional blockchains, nodes achieve network validation by \u2018agreeing\u2019 on the network state through consensus algorithms. Generally speaking, DAG networks use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism due to its low energy consumption.\n\nWhich Crypto Projects Use DAG Technology?\n\nDespite being a relatively new DLT system, DAG-based networks are proving popular within the crypto market. Crypto projects like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom (FTM) are built using DAG technology to great effect. They are supporting thousands of users within their thriving ecosystems.\n\nOther projects include IOTA, a directed acyclic graph designed to support Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and Nano, a decentralized payment network.\n\nDistributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Compared: DAG vs. Blockchain\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to understand how directed acyclic graphs work, most people are more interested in results. How does DAG technology fare against traditional blockchain standards?\n\nScalability\n\nDAG networks were invented to solve some of the scalability issues faced by legacy Proof-of-Work blockchains, including high transaction fees and low throughput.\n\nSpeed\n\nOn paper, a directed acyclic graph can reach consensus and process transactions faster than blockchain networks. Why? Blockchains are only able to create one new block at a time, and cannot begin producing a new block until the previous one has been completed.\n\nIn contrast, nodes in DAG-based networks can reference multiple other operators simultaneously. In Hadera Hashgraph\u2019s Gossip protocol (pictured below), nodes share information with each exponentially, meaning large amounts of data flow freely across the network quickly, helping nodes reach validation quickly.\n\nWhile this sounds great in theory, DAG-based networks like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom still can\u2019t achieve the same transaction speeds that we see in top PoS chains like Solana (SOL) or Aptos (APT).\n\nCosts\n\nCompared with legacy traditional blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche, DAG-based networks are more affordable. Transaction fees on Hadera Hashgraph cost as little as a fraction of a penny, while a similar transaction on Ethereum might set you back a few dollars.\n\nThe competition gets a bit tighter between Fantom and Avalanche, with both networks demanding only a few cents to process transactions. It\u2019s also important to mention that network demand plays an important role here. While Ethereum, Avalanche, and Fantom have all witnessed spikes in gas prices due to congestion, Hadera Hashgraph\u2019s scalability hasn\u2019t been truly tested yet.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nIf there is an area where DAGs shine, it is their sustainability. Directed acyclic graphs typically boast low energy consumption rates, making them an ideal candidate for global adoption.\n\nTo give you an idea, the Fantom network uses between 0.000024-0.000028 kWh to process a single transaction. While it has made huge strides in reducing its environmental impact by moving to a PoS consensus, it still uses 0.03 kWh to execute a transaction.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDue to slow adoption rates, decentralization is a weakness for DAG networks. For example, the Hedera Hashgraph is governed by the Hedera Council, a central committee of 39 node operators. Compared to Ethereum, which has over 500,000 validators, you can see how easy it would be to convince a majority of validators to take over the network.\n\nAdditionally, DAG networks are less secure than their blockchain counterparts. Blockchains benefit from a \u2018global state\u2019 or a universally agreed-upon condition of the network with the creation of each new block. In a DAG, this global state is altered every time a new transaction is processed.\n\nIf communication between nodes isn\u2019t fast enough to ensure every node is referencing correct information, there are increased chances of vulnerabilities or inaccuracies.\n\nDAG Technology & The Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nDespite the architectural differences behind the scenes, most users won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between using a DAG or a blockchain. This is due mainly to the simplicity and practicality of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nTop DAG-based networks like Fantom and Hedera are both EVM-compatible. Their smart contracts are generally written in Solidity and compatible with EVM wallets like Metamask. Thanks to the EVM, developers can easily \u2018copy and paste\u2019 Ethereum-based applications directly onto Fantom and Hedera.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nDirected acyclic graphs are fast and affordable networks far more scalable than legacy blockchains like Bitcoin or pre-merge Ethereum. However, they still face some decentralization and security issues that might discourage some users.\n\nMoreover, modern Proof-of-Stake blockchains like Solana and Aptos are theoretically more scalable than the leading DAG networks, meaning DAGs still have some work to do to compete with top Layer-1s.\n\nThat being said, blockchain technology has been in development for much longer than DAG networks. With time and resources, DAG-based networks might still overcome their current limitations and push new boundaries in distributed ledger technology.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, it\u2019s almost impossible to tell whether you\u2019re using a directed acyclic graph or a blockchain. The average person doesn\u2019t care about the underlying infrastructure as long as the final product is functional and serves its purpose.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nDirected acyclic graphs are a creative method of building a distributed ledger. Just because blockchain is the most common and best-understood kind of DLT network, that doesn\u2019t mean that innovative new systems can\u2019t emerge and improve the industry.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "This article lists the top 5 blockchain programming languages for smart contracts\n\nSmart contracts are the foundation of all Web3 apps, so learning how to write them is a requirement if you want to work as a Web3 developer. Briefly stated, smart contracts are computer programs installed and run on a blockchain network, providing deterministic assurances that permit multiple parties to reach an accepted tamper-proof outcome. A smart contract platform is a blockchain that provides programming and testing services for smart contracts. It serves as a framework for dApp development. On blockchain networks, smart contracts can be created using a variety of programming languages. The top five blockchain programming languages for smart contracts are listed below:\n\n1. Solidity: Solidity is the most widely used Blockchain programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a high-level language that is similar to JavaScript and is specifically designed for creating smart contracts. Solidity has a large developer community and offers many features for secure, decentralized programming.\n\n2. Vyper: Vyper is a newer blockchain programming language that was created specifically for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. It is similar to Solidity but with a focus on simplicity and security. Vyper is designed to be more secure than Solidity by limiting the number of features available to developers.\n\n3. Rust: Rust is a general-purpose programming language growing in popularity for blockchain development. It is known for its security and performance features and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including Polkadot and Solana.\n\n4.

        "title": "Tron (TRX): Justin Sun's Decentralized Internet - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The Tron crypto ecosystem continues to fly somewhat under the radar in the eternally competitive race to be the top Layer-1 blockchain. The cornerstone of Justin Sun\u2019s cryptocurrency empire, the Tron blockchain holds more funds than Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) combined, but attracts far less hype and attention.\n\nWith over 150 million unique accounts, the Tron blockchain claims to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing public blockchain. On paper, the Tron network is a perfect candidate to lead a decentralized internet revolution. The network is fast, affordable, and supports smart contract and dApp development, fitting the bill as a potential Ethereum (ETH) killer.\n\nWhat is Tron, and how does it work? Led by the Tron Foundation, can this scalable network separate itself from the fierce competition and fulfill its destiny to become a truly decentralized internet?\n\nWhat Is Tron (TRX)?\n\nTron is a Layer-1 blockchain network that aims to provide a frictionless and accessible decentralized internet for the masses. Like most blockchains, Tron features an account-based structure, meaning anyone can create a wallet and store their digital assets on a public ledger.\n\nThe Tron network was initially designed to provide a global entertainment platform where content creators could easily share their work worldwide. While Tron still supports these features, the network has also grown to offer a range of blockchain-based applications, like DeFi apps and NFT functionality.\n\nHow Does Tron Work?\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Tron is that from the get-go, the team never promised to bring any wildly new innovations or progressions in blockchain technology. Everything from Tron\u2019s consensus mechanism to its programming language was recycled from other networks, drawing criticism from experts.\n\nDespite this, Tron has become one of the largest blockchains in the crypto industry, both in terms of user count and market cap.\n\nThe Tron Blockchain\u2019s Consensus Mechanism\n\nA delegated-Proof-of Stake consensus secures the Tron blockchain. In this DPoS chain, Tron token holders delegate their tokens to validator node operators. These validators, called Super Representatives, are responsible for producing new blocks on the network and representing their stakers in matters of protocol governance.\n\nEvery six hours, 27 Super Representatives (SRs) are chosen from a selection pool of over 100 SR Partners, who are in turn shortlisted from over 300 SR Candidates. The 27 chosen Super Representatives earn TRX tokens as a reward for creating new blocks and securing the Tron blockchain.\n\nNew blocks are created every three seconds and added to the circulating supply, with each new block rewarding the chosen Super Representative with 32 TRX coins.\n\nTron Network Architecture\n\nThe Tron blockchain operates a TVM (Tron Virtual Machine), which records all accounts and transactions on the network and enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the Tron Mainnet.\n\nWhile similar to an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), the Tron network is not EVM-compatible. Cryptocurrency tokens on the Tron network follow the rules set by the TRC-20 token standard, unsurprisingly similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard.\n\nAs outlined in the Tron whitepaper, the main infrastructure of the Tron blockchain is broken down into three layers. Separating network responsibilities into different layers helps ease congestion and scale the blockchain.\n\nCore Layer \u2013 The Tron core layer handles computational instructions written in Java or Solidity. Transactions are then sent to the Tron Virtual Machine, which executes code logic.\n\nApplication Layer \u2013 Users and developers interact with this layer to execute on-chain transactions and deploy decentralized applications, products, and services.\n\nStorage Layer \u2013 As the name suggests, the storage layer records blockchain data and keeps a live register of the state of the network and all Tron-based smart contracts.\n\nTron Blockchain Performance\n\nDespite not boasting any revolutionary new technologies or innovative features, the Tron network achieves high levels of scalability and decentralization. Tron claims that its network can reach a maximum transaction throughput of around 2,000 TPS (transactions per second).\n\nOn top of that, transaction fees on the network are typically low, with users expecting to pay around $0.000005 per transaction. In this respect, the Tron blockchain is comparable to Ripple (XRP).\n\nThese are impressive figures compared to certain Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain, which respectively struggle to hit 15 TPS and 150 TPS. However, Tron still falls short of networks like Solana and Aptos, which theoretically handle over 100,000 transactions per second while maintaining low transaction fees.\n\nThe Tronix token\n\nThe native token of the Tron blockchain, Tronix, is used to pay transaction fees and secure the network through Tron\u2019s DPos consensus mechanism.\n\nTRX tokens are also used as the main currency of exchange for Tron NFTs and can be used in DeFi apps within the Tron ecosystem.\n\nThe Tron Ecosystem\n\nDeFi is booming on Tron thanks to a variety of decentralized applications and products. What many people don\u2019t know is that the Tron network is the king of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin in the crypto market. More Tether coins are stored on the Tron blockchain than on any other network. This adds to Tron\u2019s impressive stablecoin dominance over all chains that aren\u2019t Ethereum.\n\nThe Tron network also hosts several DeFi apps exclusive to the Tron ecosystem, including JustLend, JustStable, and SunSwap, a decentralized exchange. DeFi users can also trade wrapped versions of other popular coins, like Bitcoin (BTC), in liquidity pools on the Tron blockchain.\n\nAdmittedly, it seems ironic that a blockchain so committed to decentralization would name its main dApps after one person, Tron founder Justin Sun.\n\nTron Partnerships\n\nLed by Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation, the Tron blockchain is no stranger to blockbuster partnerships. In October 2019, the Tron network confirmed a partnership with Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. Tron tokens are integrated directly into Samsung\u2019s built-in blockchain wallet, while the Samsung App Store has a section exclusively dedicated to Tron applications.\n\nTron also acquired one of the world\u2019s largest online file-sharing platforms, BitTorrent, in 2018. The acquisition brought over 100 million users to the Tron ecosystem, making BitTorrent the largest decentralized application.\n\nTron History\n\nJustin Sun founded the Tron Foundation in 2017 to create a blockchain-based platform to share digital files and data and fairly reward content creators. Tron hosted an ICO (initial coin offering) on the Ethereum blockchain, successfully raising $70M.\n\nThe platform proved a great success but was initially limited by Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. Sun set a course of action to deploy a dedicated blockchain to host the platform and launch the Tron blockchain just one year later.\n\nIn 2021, Justin Sun stepped down as the CEO of Tron. This marked a significant moment for the Tron blockchain, which became truly decentralized. The network is now governed by its community of token holders and the Tron Foundation, a non-profit organization.\n\nTron\u2019s Controversial Founder: Justin Sun\n\nThe founder of Tron, Justin Sun, is a polarizing personality in the crypto community. He never shies away from an online argument, even with industry thought-leaders like Vitalik Buterin, who insinuated that Sun plagiarized content from Ethereum when writing the Tron white paper.\n\nSome believe that Justin Sun has more money than sense. He once paid over $4M to have lunch with legendary investor Warren Buffet. He also spent over $500,000 on an Etherrock NFT, laughing about his purchase on Twitter.\n\nTron Pros and Cons\n\nThe Tron blockchain has plenty to offer. It\u2019s fast and cheap, with over 100 million unique accounts stored on the network. Despite this, the Tron network still has a lot of work to do if it wants to compete with other top Layer-1 blockchains.\n\nPros\n\nHigh Transaction throughput \u2013 The Tron network claims to execute up to 2,000 transactions per second, making it significantly faster than Ethereum.\n\nLow fees \u2013 Transaction fees of the Tron blockchain cost less than a cent, making it affordable and accessible to users from all kinds of backgrounds.\n\nHigh TVL \u2013 Second only to Ethereum, the Tron network has a higher TVL (Total Value Locked) than all its other competitors. This means more funds are stored on Tron than on most other networks.\n\nCons\n\nLow comparative volume \u2013 Despite hanging high TVL, the network sees comparatively low trading volume. This suggests that even if plenty of people store their cryptocurrency on the Tron blockchain, most DeFi users aren\u2019t trading there.\n\nOutperformed by other chains \u2013 The competition between Layer 1 blockchains is fierce. While Tron\u2019s scalability is superior to legacy chains like Ethereum, more powerful networks like Solana and Aptos blow it out of the water.\n\nLow developer activity \u2013 Tron has a high user count and plenty of value stored on-chain. However, there are few dApps on the network compared to other chains. What\u2019s more, this doesn\u2019t look to be changing anytime soon. Electric Capital\u2019s developer report suggests that fewer than 100 developers are building on Tron, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 5,000+.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is rapidly evolving, with new technology being discovered and implemented every day to improve blockchains. Even when Tron was launched, it didn\u2019t provide any innovative developments. With so many emerging chains pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology, there is a chance that Tron will be left behind if it cannot adapt.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nTron is one of the largest crypto projects in the blockchain industry and holds the largest supply of Tether on its network. Tether plays an immense role in the health and reputation of the crypto space; if the Tron network were to suffer an outage, it would have a significant impact on the entire crypto market.\n\nFAQs"
