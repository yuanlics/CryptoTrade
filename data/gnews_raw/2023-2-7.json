        "title": "Ethereum gas price spikes 29% in January as user activity grows: Report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Stepping into 2023, the cryptocurrency market seemingly shrugged off the year-long bearish sentiment from 2022. As investors took notice, the long-awaited price corrections had a significant reaction, showcased through on-chain activities on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccording to a data report from Analytex, Ethereum\u2019s average gas price \u2014 calculated in terms of the smallest Ether (ETH) denomination, gwei \u2014 increased by 29.27% in January 2023. The report compares gas prices from January to December 2022, noting an increase in user activity as a key indicator for the rise in average gas price from 19.2 gwei to 24.82 gwei month-on-month.\n\nEthereum average gas price per month. Source: app.analytex.today\n\nThe report also notes that the average number of unique active Ethereum wallets per day decreased by around 10% to 387,475, the lowest figure over the past six months. Meanwhile, the average number of unique active smart contracts increased by 6.74%.\n\nEthereum transactions peak, January 2023. Source: app.analytex.today\n\nAs shown above, other important metrics measured include daily Ethereum transaction data, which showed a slight decrease of 0.8% from December to January. The report notes that the average number of Ethereum transactions per day has declined for eight months.\n\nRelated: \u2018Decentralized Infura\u2019 may help prevent Ethereum app crashes: Interview\n\nEthereum block statistics show that the average number of blocks mined each day showed little to no change, while the total block size per month increased by 7%. Following the Merge, daily average block data has been stable at around 0.01% monthly. The total Ethereum block size per month for January was 17.24 GB, up 7.08% from December\u2019s 16.1GB total.\n\nEthereum average number of blocks per day. Source: app.analytex.today\n\nThe report highlights contrasting data metrics across the board. The number of transactions and unique active wallets was down from December. The Ethereum activity index also showed that the number of active smart contracts and average gas cost prices have increased.\n\nAnalytex suggests that this indicates \u201cincreased interest of both current blockchain users, as well as smart contracts developers.\u201c\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols saw an increase in total value locked across different staking pools in January, per a report from DappRadar. The market hit $74.6 billion worth of staked assets, increasing by 26% from December 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s looming Shanghai upgrade is also driving staking in DeFi due to the expected opening of withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts. Lido Finance flipped Maker DAO as the largest DeFi protocol in January, driven by the popularity of liquid staking derivative protocols."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a leading figure on the cryptocurrency market, Michael Saylor is widely recognized for his strong advocacy of Bitcoin (BTC) technology. In 2020, amid the global economic impacts of the pandemic, Saylor's company, MicroStrategy, began purchasing large amounts of Bitcoin. Under Saylor's direction, MicroStrategy acquired 21,454 BTCs in August 2020 and has continued to accumulate the cryptocurrency, positioning Saylor as a significant player on the BTC market.\n\nIn addition to his role in leading MicroStrategy's Bitcoin purchases, Saylor has also made private investments into the cryptocurrency and publicly voiced his support for it, particularly in comparison to other digital assets. He holds the belief that Bitcoin is the most mature and robust cryptocurrency and offers the best investment opportunities for both investors and users.\n\nIn 2022, when asked by the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex via Twitter to name the three cryptocurrencies they would choose to invest $100 million in, Saylor quickly responded with: Bitcoin, Bitcoin and Bitcoin. He confidently stated that BTC will \"be worth millions\" even after the correction it experienced in the previous year.\n\nWhat does Saylor think about Ethereum?\n\nMichael Saylor is known for his critical stance toward Ethereum (ETH) and its capabilities as a cryptocurrency. He believes that ETH has yet to prove its technical and ethical stability and thus needs to be monitored for five to ten years before it can be considered reliable. Saylor also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the protocol cannot be altered by anyone, including Vitalik Buterin, if ETH is to have a chance of becoming a global currency.\n\nSaylor views Ethereum as a financial asset issued by a company, rather than a commodity, due to its origin through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and the existence of a management team responsible for its administration. He argues that the presence of an issuer negates the possibility of a cryptocurrency being considered a commodity.\n\nThe former CEO of MicroStrategy has also criticized the centralization of ETH, arguing that its frequent hard forks make it vulnerable to changes by the development team. Saylor claims that such significant changes to the protocol mean that the development team is making decisions, and if the monetary protocol can be altered, Ethereum may fall under the classification of an investment contract under securities law.\n\nIs Saylor no longer a Bitcoin maximalist?\n\nRecently, an audio recording that purports to feature Michael Saylor has gained attention on the internet. In the audio, Saylor is alleged to have stated that he is tired of Bitcoin and wishes to sell it but is waiting for a breakeven point. He is also reported to have expressed his dislike for the maximalists of the primary cryptocurrency and regret for not investing in Ethereum instead.\n\nThis alleged change of stance from someone who has historically been critical of Ethereum, raises questions about the authenticity of the recording and whether it may be a hoax created using artificial intelligence, a trend that is becoming more prevalent in 2023.\n\nSaylor's strong preference for Bitcoin can be seen in his public statements and tweets, and if his opinions are important to Ethereum holders (which does not appear to be the case), they may need to wait until the executive takes a closer look at the altcoin."

        "title": "Ordinals: A common ground for Ethereum and Bitcoin maximalists? - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "Representing real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain is nothing new.\n\nOver a decade ago, projects like the Colored Coin protocol and Counterparty exchange proved Bitcoin could track items, not just units of currency, in a decentralized way.\n\nHowever, consensus issues prevented either project from gaining widespread adoption in the market. Ethereum quickly took over as the go-to platform for minting and deploying unique digital artifacts. This preference led to the rise of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs as they\u2019re more commonly known today.\n\nBut, things appear to have come full circle as one Bitcoin developer looks to reinvent tokenized assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Even the Ethereum community seems to be encouraging this new venture. The move suggests a potential unity between what many see as two of the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s longest-standing rivals.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals use an open-source protocol that assigns unique identities to individual satoshis (sats). Named after Bitcoin\u2019s creator(s), Satoshi Nakamoto, satoshis are the smallest units of bitcoin. Using the Ord software, the protocol adds data to these sats and allows software users to track them based on a system called ordinal numbers.\n\nAt a high level, this involves assigning a numerical value to each satoshi based on several factors. These factors include the time when that satoshi entered into circulation through mining as well as the specific block height where the satoshi appears.\n\nUsers can use software called Ord to track each satoshi. The system also inscribes them with content to create bitcoin-native digital artifacts.\n\nUsers can trade and transfer these uniquely-identified satoshis just like any normal bitcoin unit. But unlike Colored Coins or most Ethereum NFTs, the digital item itself is stored entirely on-chain \u2014 not elsewhere on the internet.\n\nThis functionality wouldn\u2019t be possible on Bitcoin without implementing SegWit and Taproot \u2014 two soft fork upgrades that helped to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block capacity.\n\nWho created Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinal protocol on January 21, 2023. Rodarmor set out to create a system for numbering satoshis that would give each a unique serial number. This unique identifier would then allow users to track each satoshi across the blockchain. He wanted to be able to accomplish this in a way that was entirely Bitcoin native, without using sidechains or separate tokens.\n\nRodarmor earned a degree in Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley. Most recently he worked as a software engineer for Agora, an open-source app that improves upon the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nRodarmor\u2019s idea isn\u2019t the first time a numbering system has been proposed to assign unique identifiers to individual satoshis. In fact, a BitcoinTalk user by the name of jl2012 published an almost identical proposal for Ordinals in October 2012. At the time, another Bitcoin developer discredited the post as an \u201cold idea.\u201d\n\nRodarmor has since acknowledged jl2012\u2019s work in the last section of a mailing list post announcing Ordinals.\n\nHow do Ordinals work?\n\nThe Ordinal protocol consists of two main parts:\n\nOrdinal theory : The method of numbering satoshis for tracking, transfer, and value assigning purposes.\n\nInscription: The process of using the Ord software to associate content with a satoshi based on the number the software assigns. The Ord software associates content with real satoshis, but does so according to a numbering scheme unique to the Ord software.\n\nOrdinal theory\n\nOrdinals offer a method for assigning a unique identifier value to each of the 2.1 quadrillion satoshis that will ever be created.\n\nThe numerical value assigned to each satoshi acts as a serial number. The system creates this serial number based on how that satoshi relates to different periodic events that happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, including:\n\nBlocks : Batches of transactions that are committed to the Bitcoin blockchain roughly every 10 minutes. Blocks are the most common event Ordinals use to derive their numerical value.\n\nDifficulty adjustment periods : After every 2,016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), the Bitcoin protocol adjusts its mining difficulty target based on the amount of computational power being used to maintain the network. We call this the hashrate.\n\nHalvings epochs : After every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), the system halves the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation. There have been three halvings since the launch of Bitcoin.\n\nCycles: After every six halvings, a difficulty adjustment and halving take place simultaneously, resulting in an event known as a conjunction. Because halvings only take place every four years, conjunctions only take place every 24 years. Conjunctions are the least common event that Ordinals track, and the time frame between conjunctions is called a cycle.\n\nOrdinals use these events to create a process for tracking the comparative rarity of satoshis. The Ordinal Theory Handbook breaks down how satoshis relate to each of these events using the following rarity levels:\n\nRarity level Condition Amount (in total BTC supply) Common Any sat that is not the first sat of its block 2,099,999,990,756,525 Uncommon The first sat of each block 6,929,999 Rare The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period 3,437 Epic The first sat of each halving epoch 32 Legendary The first sat of each cycle 5 Mythic The very first sat of the genesis block 1\n\nBy assigning a unique identifier to each satoshi, Ordinals open a way of making inherently fungible satoshis into non-fungible objects. This identifier makes them completely unique, just like NFTs.\n\nOrdinal inscription\n\nWe refer to the committing of a piece of content to a satoshi as \u201cinscription.\u201d This process is accomplished using Ord, and you can see inscriptions with the ordinals explorer.\n\nThe system identifies the content by its MIME type (whether it\u2019s a JPEG, an MP3 file, HTML code, etc) and a byte string (the content itself). Inscriptions don\u2019t necessarily have to represent a non-fungible token. Users can also create Bitcoin-based security tokens and other assets.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are entirely on-chain and stored within the script of a taproot transaction. This process is different from many of the most prevalent NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain. Usually, the Ethereum blockchain stores NFT media content off-chain, while keeping only a record of the NFT on the blockchain.\n\nOnly a select few NFT collections, the most prominent of which are CryptoPunks, store both the media and the NFT directly on-chain.\n\nThrough this inscription process, the blockchain stores content alongside a specific satoshi. The process turns the satoshi into a unique digital artifact that users can track, transfer, hold, buy, and sell.\n\nHow Bitcoin Ordinals (may) impact Ethereum NFTs\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has resurrected the vast potential of tokenizing assets on Bitcoin\u2019s highly secure, decentralized blockchain. Not only that, it also serves as a means of permanently storing digital content directly on-chain \u2014 something rarely seen in the NFT space.\n\nThis innovation has already spurred the interest of existing Ethereum-based NFT creators, including Tom W, a co-founder of Cool Cats. On the official Ordinals Discord server, they commented, \u201cHey all, Im Tom, one of the co-founders of Cool Cats NFT. Here to experiment with some cool shit. https://twitter.com/coolcats.\u201d\n\nWith renewed capabilities for launching existing popular collections on the Bitcoin blockchain, Ordinals may help to combat the long-standing problem of lost NFTs. These prevent external file storage issues and could open up potential new revenue streams for NFT creators.\n\nInterestingly, Ordinals are actually gaining traction. For example, Bitcoin Rocks from the Ethereum-based original collection have already sold for 0.2 BTC, while a blue check-verified Twitter user with the handle \u201cbusinessman.eth\u201d posted, \u201cWOW!!! 0.42 BTC sale for an @OrdinalPunks #Bitcoin Ordinals are starting to gain steam.\u201d\n\nWhile the true impact of Ordinals is still emerging, one thing is clear: maximalists from both Bitcoin and Ethereum camps are excited about the new opportunities these digital artifacts present.\n\nFollow blog.kraken.com and our Twitter account @KrakenFX for all the latest developments shaping the crypto industry.\n\nWant to see an Ordinal for yourself?\n\nClick here to see one of the latest Ordinals to be inscribed, brought to you by Kraken.\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any digital asset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

        "title": "What is Optimism (OP): Guide to One of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-Two Scaling Solutions - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry, in general, became a lot more popular in the past couple of years. This saw the development and launch of hundreds, if not thousands, of decentralized applications (dApps) in various fields, such as DeFi, gaming, learning, trading, investing, and whatnot.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, including but not limited to the massive bull run in 2021, the rise of non-fungible tokens, the popularity of memecoins, and more. This saw hundreds of thousands of users flocking to whatever the next trend may be.\n\nUnlike previous cycles, however, this time, we also saw regular users take advantage of on-chain availabilities and interact with various dApps such as Uniswap, OpenSea, and so forth. And while this had a massively beneficial effect on the industry\u2019s growth and valuation, it also highlighted some very critical issues.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum \u2013 where the lion\u2019s share of dApp activity takes place \u2013 struggled in terms of affordability, scalability, and even accessibility. Layer one alternatives like Solana also proved to be insufficiently effective in handling the massive load of user requests.\n\nThis brought up a topic that\u2019s been largely discussed in the cryptocurrency community for years \u2013 scalability. Now that scaling solutions became essentially imperative for the future growth of the industry, projects like Optimism saw the light of day.\n\nBeing one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions, Optimism aims to solve some of the underlying issues with the network with a particular focus on scaling.\n\nQuick Facts About Optimism\n\nOptimism\u2019s mainnet went live on December 2021\n\nOptimism launched its native token (OP) on May 31st, 2022.\n\nA total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum scaling solution. In essence, its purpose is to help the main network run smoothly by taking some of its transactional load. In technical terms, Optimism is an \u201cOptimistic rollup,\u201d and it\u2019s important to understand what rollups do before diving deeper.\n\nWhat is a Rollup?\n\nRollups are one of the multiple scaling solutions intended to help Ethereum achieve a higher transaction throughput.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation explains that they \u201cperform transaction execution outside layer 1, and then the data is posted to layer 1 where consensus is reached.\u201d\n\nThe main benefit of this is that it reduces the load on the main network while also guaranteeing the broadcasted information by its native security.\n\nThere are two main types of rollups, mainly differentiated by their security models:\n\nZero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups \u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain.\n\n\u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain. Optimistic rollups \u2013 these assume that transactions are valid by default and only run computation through fraud-proof if there\u2019s a challenge.\n\nOptimism falls within the second category, and, as you may have probably guessed already, its parent chain is Ethereum.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nThe big idea that makes Optimism interesting to most is the Optimistic Rollup. The following is a brief explanation of the fundamental principles of the concept.\n\nHowever, the TLDR of it is that an Optimistic Rollup is another way of calling a blockchain that\u2019s designed to take advantage of the security of another network that acts as a parent one.\n\nBlock Storage\n\nAll of the blocks on Optimism are stored within a specific smart contract that\u2019s built on Ethereum and is called CannonicalTransactionChain \u2013 CTC to make it easier. They are helped within a list that\u2019s inside of the CTC, and it\u2019s append-only.\n\nThe CTC contains code that guarantees that the current list of blocks can\u2019t be altered by newer transactions on Ethereum. This guarantee can be broken if the Ethereum network itself goes through a reorganization (reorg) and the order is changed.\n\nBlock Production\n\nThe \u2018sequencer\u2019 is the single party that manages block production on Optimism. It helps with the network by delivering the following:\n\nInstant transaction confirmations and state updates;\n\nConstructing and executing layer-two blocks;\n\nSubmitting user transactions to layer one.\n\nIt has no mempool, which means that the transactions are accepted (or rejected) immediately. This happens in the order they are received. When someone sends a transaction, the sequencer will check if it\u2019s valid (pays a sufficient fee) and apply it to the local state as a block that\u2019s pending. These pending blocks are then batched and periodically submitted to Ethereum\u2019s network for finalization.\n\nThe main goal of this batching is to reduce the overall transaction fees by spreading certain fixed costs over all of the transactions within a single batch. Of course, this fee may vary depending on the network load at the time when the transactions were sent to the sequencer.\n\nBlock Execution\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that Ethereum nodes download blocks from Ethereum\u2019s network that\u2019s peer-to-peer. Optimism nodes, on the other hand, download blocks directly from the CTC append-only contract.\n\nThere are two primary components that make Optimism nodes. These are the Ethereum Data Indexer and the Optimism Client Software.\n\nEthereum Data Indexer\n\nIt\u2019s designed to reconstruct the optimism blockchain from blocks that are published to the CTC contract. It\u2019s also called the data transport layer.\n\nOptimism Client Software\n\nThis one closely resembles Geth, which means that Optimism, overall, is very close in its design to Ethereum. This is also because Optimism shares the same Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), as well as the same account and state structure and the metering mechanism for gas, and the fee schedule.\n\nFault Proofs\n\nUsing an Optimistic Rollup means that the state commitments are published to Ethereum\u2019s network in a way that\u2019s direct without requesting any proof of the validity of these commitments. Fault proofs are requested when a state commitment is challenged. If it\u2019s challenged successfully, it would be then removed and eventually replaced by another one.\n\nThis document provides a more in-depth and technical explanation of the terms and overall process described above.\n\nHow to Bridge Assets Between Layers\n\nWith layer-two scaling solutions such as Optimism, being able to swap assets between different layers is obviously of paramount importance.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can go about it. First and foremost, you can hop on the official website and use the bridge provided there. This would only require you to have a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask.\n\nFrom there, you have to select the network that you want to bridge tokens from. This is the supported list:\n\nThere are also options to bridge from centralized exchanges, but it\u2019s critical to note that these happen through providers that Optimism has simply linked to \u2013 meaning there\u2019s no endorsement, and you should proceed with caution and after making thorough due diligence.\n\nFrom there, the process is particularly simple, as all you need to do is confirm the amount and sign the transaction in your wallet.\n\nTo bridge assets from Optimism, there are a couple of options. You can use a third-party bridge or use the official bridge instead. The following is an example of the latter, but keep in mind that bridging from Optimism to Ethereum takes seven days.\n\nAll you need to do is click the arrow in between the value boxes, and this will switch the above transaction. If you haven\u2019t added Optimism to MetaMask, this will also handle it for you. From there, you only have to confirm the amount and sign the transaction:\n\nGovernance: Optimism\u2019s Model\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Optimism ecosystem is the OP token.\n\nOptimism is governed by the so-called Optimism Collective. According to the official website, the collective is:\n\n\u201c\u2026 a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThat said, the governance of the Optimism Collective itself will consist of two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe Token House\n\nThe launch of the OP token and the Token House set forth the beginning of the governance of Optimism. OP itself was distributed to hundreds of thousands of addresses, who engaged in community-oriented behavior through the first airdrop (more on that later.)\n\nIn any case, members of the Token House are responsible for deliberating, submitting, and voting on various proposals. To do so, OP holders can either vote directly o choose to delegate their voting power to a third party.\n\nIn essence, the Token House votes on proposals of the following types:\n\nProtocol u grades\n\nInflation adjustment\n\nTreasury appropriations\n\nRights protection\n\nGovernance fund grants\n\nThe Citizens\u2019 House\n\nAt its core, the Citizens\u2019 house is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model. It is responsible for retroactive public goods funding.\n\nThe above brings us to our next point, which is the OP token.\n\nIntroducing the OP Token\n\nThe OP token was launched through an airdrop which distributed a total of 5% of the total supply.\n\nThat said, qualifying users included:\n\nDAO voters\n\nMulti-Sig signers\n\nRepeat Optimism users\n\nGitrcoin donors\n\nIf you suspect you are eligible, you can check out any associated wallets on the official claim page.\n\nMany wonder if there will be a new airdrop, and the short answer is \u2013 yes. The team has made it clear that it plans to allocate a total of 19% of the supply for this purpose. Here\u2019s what the overall tokenomics of OP look like:\n\nFor a more complete look at the economics behind the Optimism ecosystem, please make sure to visit the official website.\n\nConclusion\n\nOptimism has quickly become one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions. Most recently, the Optimism Foundation released a proposal to upgrade the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, which is a new generation of decentralized Rollup architecture developed by Optimism Labs. Speaking on the matter, the team said:\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the post-Bedrock experience will be a positive change for developers in the Optimism ecosystem and have received consistent excitement for the upgrade from our partners. We are committed to making this upgrade a success and are eager to see the results in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to monitor how the different layer-twos fare in the coming years as the battle between optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups continues."

        "content": "Ethereum is entering its fourth consecutive week of deflationary issuance as activity on the network grows.\n\nA deflationary issuance rate for cryptocurrencies means that the number of tokens being burnt is greater than the number of tokens being minted. This implies that the token is limited in supply compared to demand, giving the currency greater purchasing power.\n\nGrowing activity in decentralized platforms could indicate more people turning to DeFi after the collapse of its centralized competitors last year, Michael Bentley, CEO and co-founder of DeFi lending protocol Euler, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cFollowing protocol upgrades last year, Ethereum has an in-built fee burning mechanism that ensures that the more people transact on the network, the more ETH gets burned,\u201d Bentley said.\n\nAt the time of writing, the annualized inflation rate for Ethereum currently sits at -0.01% according to information from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much activity on Ethereum in early 2023 that ETH itself is becoming more and more scarce, and has even recently become a deflationary asset,\u201d Bentley said.\n\nOver the past seven days, Uniswap\u2019s universal router has burned almost 2,500 ETH, taking the top spot in the burn leaderboard previously occupied by OpenSea.\n\nUniswap is the second-largest decentralized exchange in DeFi today in terms of total value locked, at $4.03 billion, behind Curve Finance. But Uniswap is the clear leader when measuring 24-hour trading volume with \u200b\u200b$1.78 billion, information on DefiLama shows. That volume is what\u2019s driving Ethereum fees.\n\nAccording to Blockworks Research analyst Matt Fiebach, \u201cEthereum gas fees hover around 40 gwei and a 7-day moving average over 25 gwei, the highest seen since July of last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Uniswap leading the pack as the largest gas guzzler by a mile over the last 7 days, it is clear that crypto market participants are risk-on and actively trading high beta bets,\u201d Fiebach said.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Umee, a Web3 bond-market platform for building DeFi utility, who told Blockworks that the increase in network activity on Ethereum is the primary reason that we see a deflationary issuance on the chain.\n\n\u201cThis is a good sign. It means that Ethereum is doing well \u2014 notably since daily network fees are up substantially since their December lows,\u201d Xu said.\n\nXu also notes that user activity is increasing not only on Ethereum but on other blockchains as well.\n\n\u201cMore broadly, all this is indicative of positive signs for the broader crypto ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Have you heard the term \u201cgas\u201d in relation to the Ethereum Virtual Machine? Are you scratching your head, wondering how someone could possibly need gasoline so they can pay $30,000 for a jpeg of a drooling gorilla?\n\nWhat Is Gwei? Gwei is a denomination of a popular cryptocurrency known as Ether or Ethereum. It is the fuel used to power transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and provide the gas that keeps the network running.\n\nYou\u2019re in the right place. This article will break down some of the basics of gwei and gas and how they relate to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFurther Reading On BlockchainThe Blockchain-Powered Web3 Is Emerging. What Will It Be Like When It\u2019s Here?\n\nWhat Is Gwei?\n\nGwei is simply a denomination of a popular cryptocurrency known as Ether or Ethereum. It is not the only denomination; if you look at the table below, you will see that kwei, mwei and gwei are featured in rapid succession. Following the prefix designations used within the metric system, each of these unit denominations is a portmanteau of the prefix. In the case of gwei this would be \u201cgiga\u201d or billion, and \u201cwei.\u201d In short, 1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nThe easiest way to conceptualize gwei is with a simple chart.\n\nMost informed consumers will not be satisfied merely understanding that one gwei is equivalent to one-billionth of a unit of Ether. Curious folk will want to understand what that truly means. Fortunately for these individuals, we can break this concept down even further with an example.\n\nWhat Is Gwei? An Example\n\nPicture a table with two individuals seated across from each other. Benjamin is holding a crisp $100 bill and Abraham is holding a shiny penny. What is the difference between the currency Ben and Abe are holding? Ben is holding a paper-like fabric with various distinctive markings on both sides. Abe is holding a small metal disk made of zinc coated in copper.\n\nThe currency Ben is holding could be used to purchase a reasonably full cart of practical groceries. The currency Abe is holding is worth less than the scrap metal value of the material it is printed on. The difference between a unit of Ether and a unit of gwei is more than twice the difference between the orders of magnitude between $100.00 and $0.01.\n\nThe term \u201corders of magnitude\u201d typically refers to the smallest possible power of 10 that can be used to represent a number in relation to a standard reference point. Consider $1USD to be the standard in this example. The $100 note is 2 orders of magnitude larger than a single dollar. Conversely, the penny is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than a single dollar.\n\nNow imagine two denominations of a currency with a difference of 9 orders of magnitude. Like many other cryptocurrencies, and in contrast to more traditional fiat currency, Ether is not restricted to the bounds of physical objects like fabric or metal.\n\nInstead, the currency is built on a platform that allows for 18 decimal places for the division of Ether. Building on our earlier U.S. dollar comparisons, the dollar has 2 decimal places for the division of dollars. You can\u2019t cut a penny into pieces. It\u2019s both illegal and an ineffective strategy for further dividing the store of value.\n\nVerbiage gets a bit tricky here. The Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum Network and an expansive community of Ethereum developers created the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a distributed, trustless computer capable of processing smart contracts. This system raised an early round of funding through the initial coin offering of Ethereum.\n\nMore Reading on Blockchain61 Blockchain Companies Paving the Way for the Future\n\nWhat Is Gwei Used For?\n\nWith the current ETH / USD exchange rates, gwei is used to quantify the fees involved in processing on-chain transactions. With time this will likely change. The price of Ether could crater, and gas fees may then be calculated in Microether or Milliether; but for the foreseeable future it\u2019s safe to assume gwei will be the best denomination for quantifying transaction fees.\n\nTransactions can be a simple transfer of value between two accounts, but the Ethereum Virtual Machine is also capable of processing complex logical operations carried out by smart contracts. In our next example, let us assume the former for the sake of simplicity. You bought 2 Ether from an exchange. You navigate to the withdrawal/send functionality, and transfer half your purchase to your friend Stanley and the other half to another friend, Albert. One might assume Stanley and Albert each have 1 Ether, right?\n\nEthereum transactions need gas fees to support the expense of operating the network.\n\nIn a practical sense, yes, but technically no: for the sake of simplicity we will say they each received 0.99 Eth. What happened to that hundredth of an Ether? It was used to pay for the gas fees necessary to execute the transaction. In centralized systems this is meaningless. Transferring money from a checking account to a savings account with the same bank is a poor parallel for what\u2019s happening in a blockchain based system of accounts.\n\nIn short, Ethereum transactions need gas fees to support the expense of operating the network."

        "title": "Is Staking Ethereum Really Worth It? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When Ethereum (ETH 0.32%) developers implemented The Merge, the name given to its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, they made it so that staked funds couldn't be withdrawn and were locked on the network for an indeterminable amount of time. This inability to withdraw likely dissuaded would-be holders from staking, as there was no end in sight to when they could reclaim their staked funds if needed.\n\nBut now it looks like there is an end in sight. Building off of The Merge, Ethereum developers are in the process of fine-tuning the next upgrade, known as Shanghai, which will allow users to finally withdraw funds and should be unveiled this March.\n\nSo, with light at the end of the tunnel, this begs the question: Should you stake your Ethereum?\n\nA couple of options to consider\n\nBefore answering that question directly, let's evaluate the different ways to stake.\n\nThere are two primary ways. One is through an exchange that provides access to staking pools, and the other is known as a liquid staking protocol. Both provide users with interest rewards, but the manner in which it is done differs slightly.\n\nUsing a staking pool through an exchange is easily the most straightforward and simple. Popular exchanges like Binance or Coinbase allow users to lock up their Ethereum and earn generous rewards that are paid out every few days.\n\nThe alternative to a staking pool are liquid staking protocols. Rather than staking your funds and only earning interest, liquid staking lets you earn interest and provides an equivalent amount of the funds staked in the form of another unique token. In doing so, users get the benefit of earning rewards but also maintaining liquidity to go participate in other crypto endeavors like buying non-fungible tokens or using them for other investing options.\n\nOne of the most popular is Lido. Users who stake their Ethereum through Lido (LDO 1.53%) receive another token in exchange, stETH (STETH 0.16%). Users are compensated with an equal amount of stETH as the amount of ether they staked. The stETH tracks Ethereum's price, so there is virtually no lost value. This stETH is also the means by which rewards are paid out.\n\nA word of caution is needed, though, as this method is slightly more technical for the average user.\n\nThe crypto version of a dividend stock\n\nWhile it would have been tough to advise staking without knowing when withdrawals would be allowed, the loom of Shanghai makes staking much more alluring. While staking Ethereum isn't a get-rich-quick strategy, it can still be a valuable way to pad your portfolio and put your money to work. Rewards are paid out every few days and are proportionate to the value staked -- meaning the more you stake, the more you earn.\n\nCurrently, the annual percentage rate hovers around 4% to 5%, but this rate is set by the Ethereum network and rises and falls based on the number of validators. The fewer validators, the higher the return, which incentivizes users to join the network and stake funds. The greater the number of validators, and the APR will fall slightly.\n\nModest profits can be made at the current APR (4% to 5%). For investors with $1,000 worth of Ethereum, they can expect around $43 per year. At $5,000, that number grows to nearly $220. But the beauty of this method is that you can reinvest these rewards, let them compound, and reap the benefits of letting your money work for you. In addition, should Ethereum rise in price, the total value you have staked will also increase, thereby increasing your return.\n\nYou could think of staking as being similar to a stock that pays dividends. It may not be much in the short term, but consistency over the long run is where true gains can be made. Although the payout might feel minuscule in the beginning, one day it could turn into a significant source of income, especially if Ethereum continues to rise in value as it has over the past few years."

I don\u2019t like these very nicely stacked trendline-esque higher lows. So if there\u2019s going to be any visible rejection from this monthly level [$1,678], I wouldn\u2019t be terribly shocked if we saw some trading through those lows [below $1,600], especially given this pre-breakout consolidation has rather been messy.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,673, still below Cred\u2019s monthly resistance area.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), Cred explains why he believes the king crypto\u2019s rally has stalled.\n\n\u201cYou can see on the daily timeframe that momentum has changed to a decent extent. Here [$18,000 to $21,000] you had impulse, very short consolidation, another strong impulse. Here [$23,000] you just had consolidation, attempt to break out, but you did not get continuation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because here [$21,000], we just reclaimed the big level [$18,000], and we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere.

        "content": "Liquid staking protocol Lido is set to roll out staking reward withdrawals and improved staking architecture with the announcement of the upcoming Lido v2 upgrade.\n\nTwo major focal points of the planned upgrade include Lido\u2019s introduction of its new Staking Router and enabling withdrawals for Ether (ETH) stakers.\n\nThe Staking Router introduces a modular architectural design allowing the development of on-ramps for new node operators, including solo stakers, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and distributed validator technology clusters. The latter is a protocol that allows validator duties to be shared across multiple nodes.\n\nThe Staking Router is envisaged to allow Lido to become an extensible protocol due to its modular design. Validator modules will be treated as sets of validator pools that can act as a supply for the protocol. Modules will manage an internal operator registry, store validator keys, and allocate staking and rewards among its operators.\n\nThe enabling of liquid staking rewards withdrawals allows Lido Staked ETH (stETH) holders to withdraw funds from Lido at a 1:1 ratio in ETH. An overview of the upgrade shared with Cointelegraph notes that the withdrawals feature also mitigates risks in the secondary market, which is provisionally set for activation after Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nRelated: Lido overtakes MakerDAO and now has the highest TVL in DeFi\n\nUsers looking to withdraw ETH will have to follow a proposed request and claim process. A request will require users to lock stETH to start the withdrawal. The protocol sources ETH to fulfill the request, locks the ETH, burns the locked stETH, and marks the request as claimable for the user to retrieve their ETH.\n\nA short timeline outlines development milestones through February to April 2023, where code will be tested on the Goerli Testnet before a withdrawal credential rotation ceremony and the upgrade itself are set to take place.\n\nThe withdrawal credential rotation is necessary due to a discrepancy between Lido protocol validators using BLS-based \u201c0x00\u201d signatures and those using newer smart-contract based \u201c0x01\u201d signatures.\n\nLido intends to rotate the credentials through a DAO ceremony, where participants will sign a rotation message that will then be broadcast to the consensus layer network.\n\nAs previously reported, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade has seen Lido Finance lead the charge as the largest decentralized finance protocol, with over $8 billion of value staked on its platform going into 2023."

In a recent statement, Burniske suggested that Ethereum will lead investors to Valhalla next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe analyst believes that the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market will soon experience a volatility spike that will send ETH to new highs that they have not been seen before. This prediction is based on Burniske's extensive analysis of the Ethereum network and its potential for growth.\n\nBurniske is particularly optimistic about the upcoming Shanghai update implementation. He believes that this upgrade will be a turning point for Ethereum, as it will bring a significant improvement to the network's scalability, security and overall performance. He expects a breakout of the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair after the update is implemented, which will drive the price of ETH to new heights.\n\n$ETH looking like it wants to lead us to Valhalla next \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) February 8, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone shares Burniske's optimism. Some analysts believe that ETH may face unprecedented selling pressure after the Shanghai update, due to stacking funds being unlocked. The argument is that investors who have been stacking their funds for a long time may want to cash out after the update, which could cause a significant drop in the price of ETH.\n\nDespite these opposing views, Burniske remains confident in his prediction. He believes that Ethereum has the potential to become the leading cryptocurrency on the market and that it will lead investors to Valhalla, the mythical Norse hall of the slain, where heroes feast for eternity. This is his way of saying that Ethereum will deliver a substantial return on investment for investors who are brave enough to take the risk."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO has passed a vote to liquidate 10,000 ether (ETH) for USDC to cover operating costs for the next two years.\n\nENS is a decentralized domain name protocol; its ENS token has a market capitalization of $316 million. The governance proposal was initially submitted on Jan. 18.\n\nThe vote concluded with 89% of participants voting in favor of the proposal, which also aims to reduce the project's exposure to ether in case of a market move to the downside.\n\nThe 10,000 ETH will be liquidated on decentralized exchange aggregator CoW Swap with the decentralized autonomous organization expecting to receive at least $13 million in the USDC stablecoin.\n\nThe DAO's treasury currently holds 40,746 ETH ($67 million) and $2.46 million of USDC.\n\nThe sale will take place in one transaction as opposed to multiple tranches following discussion on the ENS governance forum. The decision swayed to a single sale as multiple transactions would have required numerous governance votes at every step.\n\nThe ENS token is currently trading at $15.69 having risen by about 4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently reached a new milestone in its burning volume. The implementation of the Merge protocol has resulted in the destruction of over 10,000 coins, marking a significant increase in the rate of burning compared to previous periods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increase in Ethereum's burning pace has the potential to finally start affecting the actual market price of the asset, as its circulating supply is now decreasing at a faster rate. Previously, the burning of Ethereum was more of a speculative opportunity that attracted investors, but the impact on the price was minimal.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has been consistently moving upward throughout the market recovery that started in January, contrary to assets like XRP and Cardano. The cryptocurrency has been receiving constant support from retail investors as ETH staking became more popular on the market, in contrast to the December stalemate.\n\nThe burning of Ethereum coins serves to reduce the supply of the asset and increase its scarcity, thereby potentially leading to an increase in its value. This increase in demand and scarcity could be one of the factors that will drive the price of Ethereum upward in the future.\n\nDespite the possibility of an improving price performance on the market with the help of coin burning, it cannot become a main source of support for the cryptocurrency, as Ethereum's backbone is network revenue that includes transaction fees and network activity.\n\nWith the further recovery of the market, we should see the rise of new solutions on the network, which should lead to the fundamental growth of the ecosystem and positive performance on the market."

        "title": "Create Your Own Blockchain From Scratch - Built In",
        "content": "What is blockchain? Is it hard to build one? Where do you start? Which programming language should I use?\n\nI get these questions quite often when meeting people who are interested in blockchain technology. You may also be one of those people, but don\u2019t worry, I was, too.\n\n4 Steps to Creating a Blockchain Create a block. Add the data (header and body) to the block. Hash the block. Chain the blocks together.\n\nThere are plenty of blockchain resources online, but it can be overwhelming and frustrating to understand as a beginner to this booming technology. However, this article is a little different than those other resources.\n\nI\u2019ll approach the subject in baby steps with you, and guide you through the basic concepts of blockchain and how to program one using Golang (Go).\n\nFor speed, endurance, and security, most blockchain core engines are built in C/C++ (Bitcoin, EOS, etc.\u2026), Go (Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum), Java (Ethereum), Rust, Haskell (Cardano) and/or Ruby (Ethereum), then provide bindings to other easy-to-use programming languages.\n\nAlso, some blockchain engines combine many programming languages for robustness and ease-of-use for developers. Ethereum is the best example of this.\n\nWhat Prerequisites Do I Need to Create a Blockchain?\n\nA network.\n\nCryptography.\n\nA data structure and algorithms.\n\nDecentralized systems.\n\nJavascript, Go or Python knowledge.\n\nYou only need to understand the basic concepts to program your first blockchain prototype, so let\u2019s begin with some theories.\n\nMore on Blockchain: Sushiswap vs. Uniswap: What Are the Differences?\n\nWhat Is a Blockchain?\n\nYou can\u2019t program something you don\u2019t understand, right? Let\u2019s break it down. Blockchain is not Bitcoin. Blockchain is not a digital currency, Blockchain is a set of different technologies that had already existed before its creation.\n\nSo, is this a blockchain?\n\nNo, but bear with me.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify things with an example and some figures.\n\nLet\u2019s take a MySQL database that stores some information in different tables.\n\nAn illustration of a MySQL database. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nWith the above database, there are some limitations. It allows you to do some tasks, including:\n\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) operations. Storing the same information twice.\n\nBut its limitations are many, including:\n\nWe can drop the entire database either mistakenly or intentionally. We can\u2019t share sensitive information with others. It\u2019s centralized, which means there\u2019s a single point of failure and a security issue. There\u2019s no way to trust everything that is stored in it. Ill-intentioned people can comprise the database. The database needs a manager. The users don\u2019t have power over their own data\n\nWe need something different that\u2019s transparent, reliable and independent from people. Something that\u2019s automatic, immutable, decentralized and indestructible. That\u2019s where blockchain kicks in.\n\nA blockchain is a secure, trusted decentralized database and network all in one.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Work?\n\nIn other words, a blockchain is a chain of blocks. These blocks are like tables in the database, but they can\u2019t be deleted or updated. The blocks contain information such as transactions, nonce, target bit, difficulty, timestamp, previous block hash, current block hash, Markle tree and block ID, etc, and the blocks are cryptographically verified and chained up to form an immutable chain called a blockchain or a ledger.\n\nAn illustration of a blockchain. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nThe same chain is then distributed to all the nodes (computers or miners) across the network via a P2P network.\n\nIllustration of a blockchain P2P network. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nSo, instead of a centralized database, all the transactions (data) that are shared across the nodes are contained in blocks, which are chained together to create the ledger. This ledger represents all the data in the blockchain. All the data in the ledger is secured by cryptographic hashing and digital signature and validated by a consensus algorithm. Nodes on the network participate to ensure that all copies of the data distributed across the network are the same.\n\n5 Key Concepts in the Blockchain Ecosystem Cryptographic hash and digital signature. Immutable ledger. P2P network. Consensus algorithm ( PoW, PoS, PBFT, ETc\u2026). Block validation ( Mining, Forging, etc\u2026).\n\nI will explain these concepts more in detail as we go.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Using Blockchain?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to using blockchain, including:\n\nRemoving intermediary organizations. An immutable ledger Transparency Security Reliability\n\nWhen Should You Use Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is not a silver bullet, so, it\u2019s best to use it when:\n\nThe data stored cannot be modified (proof of existence ). The data cannot be denied by its owner (non-repudiation). You want decentralization. You want one source of truth. You want high security. You don\u2019t care about speed. For example, Bitcoin takes 10 minutes on average to validate a block of transactions. But some blockchains are faster because they use different consensus algorithms other than PoW. We will talk about this later.\n\nBlockchain Use Cases\n\nBlockchain goes beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. It can be used in different sectors, including:\n\nReal estate : Land ownership.\n\nHealthcare : Securely record the patient\u2019s data.\n\nFinance : Reduce the taxes and intermediaries, anti-money laundering and cross border payment.\n\nSupply chain : Track items from the vendors to the customers, including verifying authenticity and original content creation.\n\nCybersecurity : DDOS attacks.\n\nGiving the power back to the user: Own your data and share it securely with whom you want (DID).\n\nCryptocurrency .\n\nVoting mechanism .\n\nBlockchain Platforms and Applications to Know\n\nBitcoin\n\nEthereum\n\nHyperledger Fabric\n\nEOS\n\nChainlink\n\nCardano\n\nDogecoin (meme coin)\n\nMore on Blockchain: 22 Crypto Apps to Know\n\nBlockchain Types\n\nThere are three types of blockchain:\n\nPrivate: Use only internally, and when we know the users (eg. Hyperledger Fabric).\n\nPublic: Everyone can see what is going on (Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n\nHybrid: In case you want to combine the first two.\n\nCreate Your Own Blockchain\n\nThere are two ways to build a blockchain\n\nThe easiest way is to use a pre-built blockchain open-source like Ethereum (create distributed applications, altcoins , decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , etc.), Fabric (configure a private blockchain), EOS or Cardano, etc. so that you don\u2019t have to deal with the core engine, which is difficult to implement. If that doesn\u2019t fit your requirements, then you can build one from scratch or fork, modify and/or improve an existing blockchain open-source code. For example, Litecoin and Bitcoin cash were forked from Bitcoin. This last method is tougher, more time-consuming and requires a lot of work and a strong team.\n\nIn this article, we will build a blockchain prototype from scratch so that you can thoroughly understand the blockchain\u2019s state machine.\n\nMore on Blockchain: What Is Layer 1 in Blockchain?\n\nHow to Create a Blockchain From Scratch in Go\n\nWe\u2019re going to create the first baby blockchain in Go. You can also learn how to create it in Python, and JavaScript. These prototypes can help you understand the concepts we described earlier. We\u2019ll complete this in four steps:\n\nCreate a block. Add the data (header and body) to the block. Hash the block. Chain the blocks together.\n\nA block contains information mentioned earlier, but to simplify things We are going to remove some. Let\u2019s delve into the specifics.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Go, try to familiarize yourself with the basics, including functions, methods, data types, structures, flow controls and iterations, etc.\n\nAn error occurred. Unable to execute JavaScript. Try watching this video on www.youtube.com , or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.\n\nA tutorial on how to build a blockchain in Golang. | Video: Tensor Programming\n\n1. Create a Block\n\nWe\u2019ll start with creating a folder with two files in it, main.go and block.go\n\nFolder structure\n\ngo // the folder main.go // file 1 block.go // file 2\n\nMain.go\n\n// use the main package package main //import the fmt package import ( \"fmt\" ) func main(){ fmt.Println(\"I am building my first blockchain\") // print this CreateBlock(\"The hearder will be shown here\", \"the body will be shown here\") // call the function that will create the block and pass some parameters in it. }\n\nIf you run this program it will show an error because the CreateBlock function is not defined yet, so go ahead and create it in block.go .\n\npackage main import ( \"fmt\" // this will help us to print on the screen ) func CreateBlock(Header, Body string){ fmt.Println(Header ,\"\n\n\", Body) // Show me the block content }\n\n2. Add Data to Your Blocks.\n\nThe beauty of Go is that you don\u2019t have to import or export functions, just declare them with capital letters, and Go will find them for you. Now, open a terminal and move to your created folder, and run go build , then run .\\go on Windows, or ./go on Linux and Macbook.\n\nScreenshot of the Go program that calls a function and passes a string of data. | Screenshot: Sinai Nday\n\nWe just created a simple Go program that calls a function and passes some string data. Let\u2019s add two more files, blockchain.go and structures.go . Now we have four files: main.go , block.go , structures.go , and blockchain.go\n\n3. Hash Your Block\n\nI will add to each line of code some comments in order for you to understand what I am doing.\n\nStructures.go\n\npackage main //Import the main package // Create the Block data structure // A block contains this info: type Block struct { Timestamp int64 // the time when the block was created PreviousBlockHash []byte // the hash of the previous block MyBlockHash []byte // the hash of the current block AllData []byte // the data or transactions (body info) } // Prepare the Blockchain data structure : type Blockchain struct { Blocks []*Block // remember a blockchain is a series of blocks }\n\nBlock.go\n\npackage main import ( // We will need these libraries: \"bytes\" // need to convert data into byte in order to be sent on the network, computer understands better the byte(8bits)language \"crypto/sha256\" //crypto library to hash the data \"strconv\" // for conversion \"time\" // the time for our timestamp ) // Now let's create a method for generating a hash of the block // We will just concatenate all the data and hash it to obtain the block hash func (block *Block) SetHash() { timestamp := []byte(strconv.FormatInt(block.Timestamp, 10)) // get the time and convert it into a unique series of digits headers := bytes.Join([][]byte{timestamp, block.PreviousBlockHash, block.AllData}, []byte{}) // concatenate all the block data hash := sha256.Sum256(headers) // hash the whole thing block.MyBlockHash = hash[:] // now set the hash of the block } // Create a function for new block generation and return that block func NewBlock(data string, prevBlockHash []byte) *Block { block := &Block{time.Now().Unix(), prevBlockHash, []byte{}, []byte(data)} // the block is received block.SetHash() // the block is hashed return block // the block is returned with all the information in it } /* let's now create the genesis block function that will return the first block. The genesis block is the first block on the chain */ func NewGenesisBlock() *Block { return NewBlock(\"Genesis Block\", []byte{}) // the genesis block is made with some data in it }\n\nBlockchain.go\n\npackage main // create the method that adds a new block to a blockchain func (blockchain *Blockchain) AddBlock(data string) { PreviousBlock := blockchain.Blocks[len(blockchain.Blocks)-1] // the previous block is needed, so let's get it newBlock := NewBlock(data, PreviousBlock.MyBlockHash) // create a new block containing the data and the hash of the previous block blockchain.Blocks = append(blockchain.Blocks, newBlock) // add that block to the chain to create a chain of blocks } /* Create the function that returns the whole blockchain and add the genesis to it first. the genesis block is the first ever mined block, so let's create a function that will return it since it does not exist yet */ func NewBlockchain() *Blockchain { // the function is created return &Blockchain{[]*Block{NewGenesisBlock()}} // the genesis block is added first to the chain }\n\nMain.go\n\n//Time to put everything together and test package main import ( \"fmt\" // just for printing something on the screen ) func main() { newblockchain := NewBlockchain() // Initialize the blockchain // create 2 blocks and add 2 transactions newblockchain.AddBlock(\"first transaction\") // first block containing one tx newblockchain.AddBlock(\"Second transaction\") // second block containing one tx // Now print all the blocks and their contents for _, block := range newblockchain.Blocks { // iterate on each block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the block %x\n\n\", block.MyBlockHash) // print the hash of the block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the previous Block: %x\n\n\", block.PreviousBlockHash) // print the hash of the previous block fmt.Printf(\"All the transactions: %s\n\n\", block.AllData) // print the transactions } // our blockchain will be printed }\n\nLet\u2019s run it now, go build then .\\go .\n\nResult. | Screenshot: Sinai Nday\n\nVoila. Easy, right?\n\n4. Chain Your Blocks Together\n\nOops, our blocks in the blockchain don\u2019t have any IDs and timestamps. So, let\u2019s add that information by modifying the main.go file, add these two lines in the for loop :\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Block ID : %d\n\n\", i) fmt.Printf(\"Timestamp : %d\n\n\", block.Timestamp+int64(i))\n\n//Time to put everything together and test package main import ( \"fmt\" // just for printing something on the screen ) func main() { newblockchain := NewBlockchain() // Initialize the blockchain // create 2 blocks and add 2 transactions newblockchain.AddBlock(\"first transaction\") // first block containing one tx newblockchain.AddBlock(\"Second transaction\") // second block containing one tx // Now print all the blocks and their contents for i, block := range newblockchain.Blocks { // iterate on each block fmt.Printf(\"Block ID : %d\n\n\", i) // print the block ID fmt.Printf(\"Timestamp : %d\n\n\", block.Timestamp+int64(i)) // print the timestamp of the block, to make them different, we just add a value i fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the block : %x\n\n\", block.MyBlockHash) // print the hash of the block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the previous Block : %x\n\n\", block.PreviousBlockHash) // print the hash of the previous block fmt.Printf(\"All the transactions : %s\n\n\", block.AllData) // print the transactions } // our blockchain will be printed }\n\nLet\u2019s save the code and run it again, go build then ./go .\n\nFinal result of your blockchain. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nAs you can see, the blockchain is well structured. Except for the genesis block, each block contains its hash and the hash of the previous block, which makes it immutable. If the data in the block is altered, the hash will automatically change and the block will be discarded. The genesis block doesn\u2019t have any previous hash because it\u2019s the first one. There is no previous block.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Congratulations, you\u2019ve just created your first baby blockchain in Go.\n\nWe will gradually fulfill the blockchain requirements. Blockchain is a masterpiece that needs to be engineered the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nIn blockchain, there are also two common roles. A blockchain engineer and a blockchain developer. A blockchain engineer is a professional who thoroughly understands the principles of blockchain, security, and software engineering for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating the blockchain core engines and software. A blockchain developer is a professional who builds software on top of the blockchain called decentralized applications.\n\nMost blockchain developers use open blockchain platforms and frameworks like Ethereum, hyperledger fabric, EOS, etc. Now that you have the basics, it\u2019s up to you to decide which one you want to be."

However, the price declined from the major resistance level of $1.7K and is now consolidating beneath it.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a substantial bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the daily timeframe. It could lead to volatility in the upcoming days.\n\nNonetheless, there are three critical static levels for Ethereum on the daily chart; the $1.7K major resistance level, the $1.3K minor support level, and the $1K major support level.\n\nThe price has been ranging between $1K and $1.7K for several months, and the $1.3K minor support level is likely to be Ethereum\u2019s next stop in case of rejection from $1.7K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s price action seems to be bearish on the 4-hour timeframe as it has been forming an ascending Head and Shoulder pattern, also known as a three drives pattern, a popular reversal pattern in the classic price action, after reaching a vital resistance region.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency cascades below the neckline, roughly at $1.5K, the market should expect a short-term plummet toward the $1.3K minor support level. Hence, considering the current price action and the bearish signs mentioned above, Ethereum is likely to experience a period of consolidation correction before the next impulsive move.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe following chart demonstrates the Open Interest metric\u2019s 14-day RSI alongside Ethereum\u2019s price. Following the recent uptrend in Bitcoin\u2019s price during the last two weeks, ETH has also printed a surge, showing signs of demand in the market.\n\nAs a result, the futures market activity has also increased in the last week resulting in an uptrend in Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest. Typically, when the Open Interest\u2019s RSI reaches the red zone (above 70), the possibility of a short-term correction expands.\n\nPresently, the metric has surged and is close to entering the red area. Accordingly, a short-term plummet might flush out the highly leveraged long positions. This structure underlines the risk of the futures market in the short term."

        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed key positions in 2023 with assistance from the overall market rally and increasing network development activity. Indeed, the crypto community is looking forward to how ETH\u2019s price will play out in the coming days amid lingering crucial network milestones.\n\nTherefore, the community has fronted possible ETH price trajectory scenarios. In particular, a crypto community at CoinMarketCap, through the price estimate feature, projects that Ethereum is likely to trade at an average price of $1,542 on February 28, 2023.\n\nAs per the data obtained by Finbold on February 8, the community projection is based on votes by 1,754 members, with the price representing a correction of over 7% from the ETH\u2019s price at the time of publishing.\n\nEthereum community price prediction. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nIndeed, the community prediction points to consolidation compared to a forecast by a machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions. Per the projection, ETH was to trade at $1,582 on February 1, 2023.\n\nThe community accounts for a sixth-month average accuracy rate of 82.53% by factoring in past predictions. The latest accuracy rate for January 2023 stood at 89.879%.\n\nEthereum community price predication estimated accuracy: Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish catalyst\n\nAs the community expresses bearishness for ETH\u2019s price movement, the asset seeks to build on the possible bullish sentiments from last year\u2019s Merge upgrade that transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Currently, Ethereum investors are aiming to start withdrawing their staked ETH in March when the Shanghai hard fork is expected to go live.\n\nIn the meantime, stakers are trialing the withdrawals feature following the Zhejiang testnet activation. Overall, some of the implications of the Shanghai upgrade will be the start of a possible boom in the popularity of staking among investors looking to earn yield and likely impact the value of ETH.\n\nAlthough the full impact of the upgrade is yet to be determined, Ethereum is witnessing increased network activity. Interestingly, the activity has not been weighed down by the network\u2019s gas fees, which have spiked steadily since the Merge.\n\nEthereum gas fees chart. Source: Hilldobby\n\nAway from the network upgrades, Etheruem will aim to build momentum from the institutional adoption of its services. Finbold reported that the latest ETH developments involving institutions would see Russia\u2019s Sberbank launch and Ethereum-based DeFi platform mid-year.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nEthereum is changing hands at $1,674, having rallied by almost 3% in 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, ETH is up over 5%.\n\nEthereum seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold.\n\nElsewhere, Ethereum one-day technical analysis remains bullish, with the summary opting for the \u2018buy\u2019 sentiment at 14. Moving averages are for \u2018strong buy\u2019 gauging at 14, while oscillators are for \u2018sell\u2019 at 2.\n\nEthereum technical analysis.

They transfer zero tokens from any wallet with the help of the \"TransferFrom\" feature via a smart contract. In this way, they are able to create a fake wallet history with zero transfers to trick innocent victims.\n\nUnsuspecting users can use the scammer's address without doing any research, which puts their funds at risk since their wallets will likely be compromised.\n\nPeckShield has detected that the leading spenders on Ethereum are, in fact, scammers who conduct such zero-token transfers.\n\nIt is crucial for users to be extra careful when conducting blockchain transfers, especially on the Ethereum network. Users should always check the authenticity of the wallet addresses they are using before sending any money. By taking these precautions, users can protect their funds and avoid falling victim to zero-transfer scams."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nCrypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group has begun to sell shares in several of its most prized cryptocurrency funds at a steep discount, as it seeks to raise capital to pay back creditors of its bankrupt lending arm.\n\nSoftBank-backed DCG has started to offload its holdings in several investment vehicles run by its subsidiary Grayscale, according to US securities filings seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe move to sell down the assets underscores the financial difficulties at DCG as it tries to raise funds to support collapsed lending units under crypto broker Genesis, while seeking to preserve its most cash-generative business.\n\nConnecticut-based DCG, founded in 2015 by former banker Barry Silbert, is one of the largest and oldest investors in crypto coins and businesses. It is backed by investors including SoftBank, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC and Alphabet\u2019s venture arm CapitalG.\n\nGrayscale, DCG\u2019s asset management business, is an important asset: it earns hundreds of millions of dollars per year in lucrative fees for managing large pools of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies in funds that investors can buy shares in from their brokerage accounts.\n\nDCG is selling stakes in one of Grayscale\u2019s largest trusts even though the shares over the past two years have fallen to substantial discounts to the underlying value of cryptocurrency they hold.\n\nIt is seeking to raise money after the lending units of Genesis, its crypto broker, collapsed into bankruptcy in January, becoming the latest large crypto company to fail after the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange rocked the digital asset industry.\n\nThe US group has been attempting to repay more than $3bn to its creditors and has been embroiled in a public dispute with the Winklevoss twins\u2019s Gemini exchange over the debts. To raise further funds, the group last month hired Lazard bankers to help sell its trade news site CoinDesk. It is also seeking to offload some of its $500mn venture portfolio, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nOn Monday, after months of negotiations, DCG reached an agreement with Genesis\u2019 main creditors, including Gemini. \u201cThis plan is a critical step forward towards a substantial recovery of assets,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nDCG\u2019s recent share sales have focused on Grayscale\u2019s ethereum fund, where the group has moved to sell about a quarter of its stock to raise as much as $22mn in several trades since January 24, according to the filings. The company is selling at about $8 per share, despite each share\u2019s claim to $16 of ether.\n\n\u201cThis is simply part of our ongoing portfolio rebalancing,\u201d DCG said.\n\nGrayscale earns a 2.5 per cent management fee on the 3mn of ether in the trust, equating to $209mn in the year to end September. DCG last sold shares in the Ethereum Trust in 2021, when the vehicle traded nearly at par with its net asset value, according to the filings provided by The Washington Service. Today the shares trade at half the value of the ethereum coin they represent.\n\nIts flagship bitcoin trust holds about 3 per cent of all bitcoin, worth $14.7bn, from which Grayscale earns a 2 per cent fee. It earned $303mn from fees on the bitcoin trust in the first nine months of 2022, according to securities filings.\n\nDCG has also moved to sell down smaller blocks of shares in Grayscale\u2019s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust and Digital Large Cap Fund, according to the filings.\n\nThe group does not allow investors to redeem their shares for the coins held in the trusts, which would help close the significant net asset value gaps. Grayscale is suing the US Securities and Exchange Commission over blocking the creation of a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing that this would benefit investors and allow redemptions.\n\n\u201cDCG faces a trade-off: they could allow redemptions and enable liquidity at par value, including for their own holdings, but they\u2019re better off not doing it because they make so much money from the management fees,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of Lumida Wealth. \u201cClosing the discount would mean giving up this cash cow.\u201d\n\nBefore cryptocurrency was easily tradable through reputable exchanges, the shares in Grayscale\u2019s trusts traded at a large premium to the value of the coins they held, incentivising holders of bitcoin and ethereum to hand over their coins for shares in the Grayscale vehicles."

        "content": "Digital Currency Group (DCG) has reportedly been selling shares of some of Grayscale Investments\u2019 crypto trusts in an effort to raise capital following the bankruptcy filing of Genesis.\n\nFounded by Barry Silbert, DCG is the parent company of crypto lending firm Genesis, asset manager Grayscale Investments and media company CoinDesk, among others.\n\nA quarter of DCG\u2019s stock in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has been sold, raising as much as $22 million in several trades since Jan. 24, the Financial Times reported late Monday, citing filings.\n\nETHE, which launched in 2017, has $5 billion in assets. The trust was trading at a roughly 54% discount to its net asset value on Monday, according to YCharts.com.\n\nDave Nadig, a financial futurist at data firm VettaFi, said the trust issuer\u2019s reported sale at such a steep discount highlights the need for a redemption window. Redemptions of shares for ETHE are not currently authorized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great look, obviously, but on the other hand, if a corporation needs to raise cash, selling assets is a pretty time-honored way of doing so,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nDCG has also moved to sell a smaller number of shares in Grayscale\u2019s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust and Digital Large Cap Fund.\n\nThose four trusts have combined assets under management of roughly $700 million.\n\nSpokespeople for DCG and Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nGenesis filed for bankruptcy last month after taking a major hit during last year\u2019s market turmoil. The company on Monday reached an agreement in principle with Gemini and other creditors on a restructuring plan, following a public feud with Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nDCG\u2019s reported sale of various Grayscale trust shares comes after the Financial Times said last month DCG was looking to sell some of its venture capital holdings, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s largest investment product is its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which launched in 2013 and has $14.5 billion in assets.\n\nThe cryptoasset manager has sued the SEC in an attempt to convert GBTC to an ETF, a process Grayscale executives said would help close the trust\u2019s discount, which has exceeded 40% in recent months.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told investors in a December letter the firm would consider a tender offer for GBTC shareholders if its bid to convert the trust to an ETF fails.\n\nThere is no concrete timeframe for a resolution to the legal wrangling, and some GBTC shareholders are growing impatient.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

However, the bank\u2019s staking services are only available in the UK and select EEA (European Economic Area) markets.\n\nAccording to Revout, customers may receive up to 11.65% back in cryptocurrency rewards for particular tokens. However, based on the staked token, returns might differ and be subjected to change. Polkadot (DOT) currently has the highest return, while Cardano (ADA) offers the lowest yield at 2.79%, and at 3.88% and 4.59%, respectively, Ethereum (ETH) and Tezos (XTZ) are in the center.\n\nMore coins will be made available for staking by the bank. However, it did not specify which tokens or nations will be included next to expand the service.\n\nWill Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos staking attract new users?\n\nRevolut has more than 25 million customers globally and is one of Europe\u2019s most valued fintech companies. In addition, it received a $33 billion valuation in its most recent investment round in July 2021. Revolut has dramatically increased the number of digital assets it supports, offering more than 90 tokens today. In 2021, it also permitted the withdrawal of Bitcoin (BTC) to individual wallets.\n\nThe CEO of Revolut, Nikolay Storonsky, stated in November that while cryptocurrency made up 30% to 35% of the company\u2019s overall income in 2021, it accounted for only around 5% in 2020.\n\nNow staking has taken a hit over the past year. A majority of Ethereum stakers are currently at a loss. However, many expect the market to pick up steam once the global financial troubles are dealt with. Moreover, staking is a lucrative way to earn constant rewards when the market is right. Hence, Revolut could see an uptick in users, thanks to its new staking service.\n\nWith inflation slowing down in the U.S., interest rates are expected to cool over the year. Once inflation is controlled, an influx of funds into risky assets such as cryptocurrencies should be a reality."

New data on 6 February suggested that the number of new validators added to the network remained constant in 2022, even during the bear market.\n\nDid you know that there were 218,068 new Ethereum validators (almost 7 million ETH worth) that were spun up in 2022 alone?

The upcoming Shanghai Upgrade was expected to further incentivize new validators to join the network.\n\nRecent validator interest could be driven by the positive developments surrounding Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the positives\n\nA positive indicator for Ethereum was the declining number of addresses in loss, reaching a five-month low according to Glassnode.\n\nHowever, despite this positive news, whale interest decreased over the last month. If large addresses decided to sell their investments, it could negatively impact retail investors.\n\nHaving a look at Ethereum, on-chain\n\nEthereum\u2019s declining network growth could be one reason for the decrease in whale interest, as there was a cutback in new addresses transferring ETH for the first time. This suggested that new addresses were not showing interest in the network.\n\nAnother reason for the lack of whale interest could be the decline in Ethereum\u2019s velocity, meaning that the frequency of ETH trades decreased.\n\nAdditionally, trader sentiment also turned negative during this period. Short positions against Ethereum increased, according to Coinglass. This surge in short positions increased after 1 February. At press time, the percentage of short positions against ETH was 51.57%.\n\nEven though traders were pessimistic about Ethereum, a new development with Visa could improve the network\u2019s odds of success.

        "title": "3 High-Growth Coins That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2030 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the cryptocurrency market, only one coin has ever attained a trillion-dollar market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC 0.65%). But a growing number of analysts and investors now think the next crypto bull market will result in multiple coins attaining a trillion-dollar valuation.\n\nJust how likely is that scenario? After all, the highest-ever market capitalization of all cryptocurrency combined -- which encompasses thousands of different coins -- was $3 trillion. So, unless the size of the crypto market expands dramatically, the path to a trillion-dollar valuation for any coin is difficult at best. Here's a closer look at three high-growth coins that might get there.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nThe case for Bitcoin attaining a $1 trillion valuation in the next bull market is more reasonable than it might sound, given that it topped out at $1.28 trillion in the last bull market. At a current market cap of $458 billion, Bitcoin needs to slightly more than double in value to reach the trillion-dollar mark. Given its current price of $23,785, that would imply a future price near $50,000 -- well below Bitcoin's all-time high of $68,789.63.\n\nThere are other, more sophisticated ways to think about a trillion-dollar valuation for the token. For example, prominent Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor has focused on the world's physical gold supply.\n\nIf you buy into the notion that Bitcoin is \"digital gold,\" then at some point, the value of Bitcoin and the value of the world's physical gold supply should start to converge. Right now, the value of the world's physical gold supply is estimated to be between $10 trillion and $15 trillion, so Bitcoin's maximum possible valuation could also rise to that level.\n\nThat logic might sound far-fetched, but Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has applied a similar reasoning process, arriving at a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin in January 2022.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nThe case for a trillion-dollar valuation is harder to make for Ethereum (ETH 0.32%), which currently has a nearly $200 billion market cap. It would need to increase in value fivefold to hit $1 trillion.\n\nEven at its all-time peak, the digital coin only reached a market cap of $571.67 billion, so there's clearly work to do. Slow, incremental growth is not the path to a trillion-dollar valuation for Ethereum.\n\nOne approach to valuing Ethereum is to separately value all of its business lines -- e.g. non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. You would then need to make a growth projection for each of these business lines.\n\nBut are any of Ethereum's core business lines capable of growing at a 5X rate? Take, for example, the NFT market, which was worth $25 billion in both 2021 and 2022. Assuming that Ethereum currently controls close to 75% of the NFT market, that's roughly $20 billion in annual sales. A 5X scaling factor would imply $100 billion in annual NFT sales for Ethereum.\n\nThat's possible over a long-enough time horizon, but most likely we would need to look elsewhere for a huge 5X impact. That's why many analysts are focused on sectors like the metaverse, where growth could be truly exponential.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the metaverse could be a trillion-dollar market opportunity, so even if Ethereum claims just a 10% market share, that's still $100 billion, more than enough to make up for any sluggishness in the NFT market.\n\n3. Solana\n\nLastly, there's Solana (SOL -0.98%), which had been a crypto market darling before the events of 2022 unfolded. Solana is up more than 100% in 2023, so things are looking sunnier for the crypto. Even with that rapid rise, its market cap is still less than $10 billion, so a trillion-dollar valuation would imply a more than 100X gain in value.\n\nThis presents enormous challenges from a financial modeling perspective. Is there anything Solana can do that will lead to 100X returns? Most likely, it would require several high-risk, high-reward strategies and a lot of good luck.\n\nThe good news is that it is making a big bet on mobile crypto with its new Solana Mobile initiative. And its expanding network of retail stores (which Solana prefers to call \"embassies\") could be one way to supercharge growth with retail investors.\n\nSolana is also going big on its global expansion strategy, investing in new initiatives across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nA long-term view of crypto\n\nThere's a good reason why venture capitalists like to refer to start-up companies that attain a billion-dollar valuation as \"unicorns.\" They are extremely rare. And rarer still are companies that obtain a trillion-dollar valuation. Right now, only a handful of publicly traded companies have ever topped that figure.\n\nThat's why I think it might take nearly a decade before we see multiple cryptos obtain a trillion-dollar valuation. For now, I'm pinning my long-term investment hopes on Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are both capable of reaching that peak without dramatic changes to their overall growth plans. If you are looking for cryptos to buy and hold for the long haul, Bitcoin and Ethereum are potential options."

        "title": "Ethereum upgrade moving on track to implement super important update for ETH ecosystem - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Ethereum testnet Zhejiang has successfully processed staked ETH withdrawals.\n\nThe testnet is the first of three dress rehearsals towards the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is another step closer to its historic transition to a fully-featured proof-of-stake network as a testnet, Zhejiang, processed its first withdrawals of staked ETH. Developers\u2019 and users\u2019 test code changed to their application with testnets, which are duplicates of the main blockchain. Following the first testnet upgrade are the Sepolia and Goerli updates.\n\nEthereum Testnet Zhejiang Conducts Staked ETH Withdrawals\n\nAccording to an explorer website that tracks transactions on the system, the Ethereum testnet performed the withdrawal process early Tuesday. This happened after it launched last week. Also, the upgrade was triggered at epoch 1350 at 15:00 UTC and concluded at 15:13 UTC.\n\nThe Zhejiang upgrade is designed as a dress rehearsal in preparation for the Shanghai update. The Shanghai update is expected to occur in March, and it is the blockchain\u2019s first major upgrade since its transition to POS in September last year. Following the transition, Ethereum became more energy-efficient compared to the proof-of-work protocol.\n\nAfter the hard fork, the network validators will have access to withdraw 16 million staked ETH. Ethereum began to use validators in place of miners after the Merge. The validators were required to stake 32 ETH with the chain to be able to participate in the block validation princess. The more the ether staked, the more the validators are likely to be selected to \u201cpropose\u201d the next block of Ethereum transactions. They were also open to certain network rewards.\n\nValidators at the Brink of Cashin Out\n\nNotably, the Ethereum ecosystem informed validators that the accrued rewards, as well as their staked ETH would be locked till another update happens to the chain. These participants have been staking ETH and gathering rewards since the release of the proof-of-stake \u201cBeacon Chain\u201d in December 2020. The launch of the Beacon Chain was the first move in aspiration for the Merge. After years of staking ETH, validators can finally cash out their portions.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk on the recent Ethereum testnet, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation stated:\n\nOn the Zhejiang testnet, partial and full withdrawals as well as BLS changes are included in the execution payload. We have a successful fork.\n\nFingers are crossed on the possible impact of the update on the Ethereum ecosystem. While some believe that the Shanghai upgrade may encourage more staking, others say the price of ETH may decline due to pressure from stakers who may rush to withdraw their funds when the hard fork is over.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

According to the announcement, Brave users can now connect to Solana DApps through Brave\u2019s built-in crypto wallet without leaving the browser.\n\nAmelia Daly, head of partnerships at Solana Foundation, said that the new integration is important because it gives users browser-based connections to Solana programs, optimized for mobile use.\n\n\u201cAdvances in UX and mobile are among the most important ways to onboard new users.\u201d\n\nBrave CEO and co-founder Brendan Eich says,\n\n\u201cBrave is increasingly the browser of choice for the Web3 world, and with the addition of Solana DApp support on mobile, we\u2019re expanding that reach to another key group that is seeking fast and friendly ways to use their crypto on the go.\u201d\n\nBrave first revealed a plan to integrate with Solana in late 2021 but held back on details.\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is up nearly 200% from its lows early last month, currently trading for $23.35.

        "content": "The report discloses that there are fears that consumers may hoard or shift their wealth instantly between accounts due to the frictionless nature of digital money.\n\nAccording to reports, consumers would be under strict limitations by transferring just a few amounts of pounds into their accounts.\n\nThe United Kingdom is working around the clock to introduce a digital pound issued by the Central Bank of England. Based on the idea of producing a more stable alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both the central bank and the UK Treasury believe that this could offer a financial advantage that could be needed in the future. According to them, the decision to introduce a digital pound could be made around the middle of the decade.\n\nThe report discloses that there are fears that consumers may hoard or shift their wealth instantly between accounts due to the frictionless nature of digital money. This could collapse banks as they may be under severe stress in such situations. A consultation paper that suggests a new form of money could be introduced by 2030 has suggested that authorities could bring it under control by blocking consumers from hoarding the digital pound. Governor Andrew Bailey and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt released a roadmap for creating this digital currency. According to reports, consumers would be under strict limitations by transferring just a few amounts of pounds into their accounts. The idea is to prevent the rapid outflow of large amounts of money from traditional high street banks.\n\nThe Treasury said:\n\nA limit on individuals\u2019 holdings would apply at least in the introductory phase. This would strike a balance between both encouraging use and managing risks, such as the potential for large and rapid outflows from banking deposits into digital pounds. These limits could be amended in the future.\n\nThe digital pound would bear no interest\n\nAccording to Mr. Hunt, protecting financial stability is their top priority. Having emphasized that cash is here to stay, Mr. Hunt and Mr. Bailey explained that CBDC offers a new payment method for consumers. UK is far advanced in researching the economic benefits of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and millions of pounds have already been spent on this course as claimed by the Bank\u2019s annual report.\n\nSome key figures including Former Bank of England governor Lord King have strongly disagreed with the implementation of the digital pounds. In his statement, Lord King mentioned that CBDC has no obvious benefits but offers risk. He further said that the public does not need it, and its consideration is mere because it has a \u201d sexy name of a digital currency.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that there will be a consultation to invite comments from businesses and the wider public in the next four months. However, decisions on its implementation will not happen until 2025.\n\nMr. Bailey said:\n\nThis consultation and the further work the Bank will now do will be the foundation for what would be a profound decision for the country on the way we use money.\n\nThe Digital pound would not bear any interest and would be risk-free according to the authorities. It would also be equivalent in value to the physical pound. \u00a310 of a digital pound would be worth \u00a310 in cash in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "After suffering a massive sell-off in 2022, this year started with a bang for all major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum, two leading digital assets of the cryptocurrency market, have always been the center of attraction for crypto traders. So, it\u2019s quite understandable when someone wants to choose between Bitcoin vs Ethereum for the long-term investment option.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum: Let\u2019s put their performance in perspective\n\nAre you looking to start your long-term crypto journey and curious about the future of bitcoin vs Ethereum? You are at the right place, here is a quick rundown of some of the biggest considerations regarding the investment outlook for each cryptocurrency.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin: BTC price eyeing $25K\n\nBitcoin price is currently valued at $22,953.15 and has a $24,117,660,098 24-hour trading volume. With a live market worth $442 billion, BTC has gained over 38% in the past four weeks.\n\nThe recent price surge might expose BTC to levels as high as $23,900 and $25,150 in the forthcoming months. Now, talking about whether Bitcoin is a good long-term investment or not. So, many crypto experts believe that for the next one to three years, BTC prices will be bullish and may touch new heights soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Holds Steady at $1.6k\n\nThe price of Ethereum in the last 24 hours was $1,633.93, with a trading volume of $6,700,985,956. On the upside, ETH is anticipated to face a bullish crossover that might expose ETH to $1,750. In the past 30 days, Ethereum has risen nearly to 36%.\n\nEthereum has remarkable long-term staying power in terms of utility and real-world use cases. From being the pioneer of the concept of smart contracts to an innovation leader when it comes to decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, Ethereum has shown its dominance in the world.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum: Conclusion\n\nBoth the leading cryptocurrencies have strong growth potential, but at the same time, they are extremely volatile. That means investing in cryptocurrencies for the long term involves carefully considering factors such as technology, adoption, regulation, market demand, and detailed research.\n\nAlso Read: First Golden Crossover Of 2023 Sets Bitcoin Price To Cross Above $40000"

        "content": "While Ethereum has been an attractive asset to whales given its potential, altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) have joined in on the whales\u2019 favorite tokens list. Earlier today, Whalestats, an account that monitors whales\u2019 transactions and discloses them, revealed that two blue whales were seen purchasing a massive amount of MATIC.\n\nPer the account, the whale reportedly bought 2,061,476 MATIC worth around $2.6 billion. The purchase had some notable impact on MATIC\u2019S price. Of the top ten cryptocurrencies with the largest market share, only MATIC gained the most in the last 24 hours.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Surges Nearly 20%\n\nSince the whale activity to the time of writing, MATIC has spiked in price by 4%, cumulating bullish momentum in the past seven days and recording a profit of nearly 20%. Among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, MATIC is still the only asset trending to the upside.\n\nNotably, the past few weeks have seen MATIC moving upward before the whales\u2019 intervention, especially since the beginning of the year. MATIC has moved from the $0.75 price tag seen late last year to $1.28 at the time of writing.\n\nThe Polygon token still ranks steadily as the tenth most valuable by market capitalization according to data aggregators \u2014 CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap. Polygon records a market cap of $11.5 billion, higher than Solana with $8.6 billion but below Dogecoin, which holds a $12.4 billion market cap.\n\nWhile the Polygon token has climbed multiple highs since the beginning of the year, it is still down 56% from its all-time high of $2.92, seen in December 2021. If the crypto market continues the current rally, MATIC and other altcoins could retake previously lost territory.\n\nMATIC Attracts Ethereum Investors\n\nWhaleStats\u2019 leadership board shows that the top 100 massive ETH holders hold roughly $100 million in MATIC. Other altcoins on the list include meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), with whales holding less than 700 million SHIB tokens. Over the past seven days, SHIB has surged by more than 16%, with a market cap of over $8.1 billion.\n\nSHIB currently outshines Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC), and Avalanche (AVAX) and holds the 12th position as the most significant crypto by market cap. SHIB\u2019s previous rally was not surprising for some traders following the development of the Layer 2 solution Shibarium which is expected to play a big part in the token\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "DeFi's Next Big Thing: Liquid Staking Derivatives - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The popularity of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) has increased significantly in recent months resulting in a surge in cash flow in DeFi. LSDs are a relatively new type of token that enables stakers to augment potential returns by unlocking liquidity for their staked cryptocurrency, such as ETH.\n\nLSDs have been exploding in popularity across the Ethereum ecosystem and have the potential to become equally as widespread among other Layer-1 networks, such as Polygon and Avalanche.\n\nLSDs are already playing a significant role in DeFi, making up over 20% of the entire TVL across liquid staking protocols. The dominance of Lido alone \u2014 currently the largest liquid staking protocol \u2014 is over 17% of DeFi\u2019s TVL as of February 2023.\n\nLSDs may have jump-started a strong rebound in DeFi activity, as the trend is likely to accelerate with the deployment of the Shanghai upgrade, which is expected to attract more stakers and thus boost demand for LSDs.\n\nHow do LSDs stimulate DeFi activity?\n\nLSDs grabbed the attention of DeFi users after Ethereum adopted the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which replaces mining with staking. ETH holders can now stake their tokens to maintain the network and generate an annual yield.\n\nHowever, two conditions limit access to staking for regular token holders. First, there is a minimum deposit limit of 32 Ether (ETH) to join the block validation battle. Second, the staked ETH remains located on the Beacon Chain until the Shanghai Ethereum update is completed, and even then, rewards will gradually become available.\n\nLiquid staking protocols solve the first problem by pooling ETH from multiple holders to facilitate participation in Ethereum\u2019s block validation process. Thus, protocols such as Lido, enable ETH holders to stake without having to run a validator node.\n\nLiquid staking protocols not only enable fractional deposits in their staking pools but also offer stakers derivative tokens based on a 1:1 ratio in the form of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs).\n\nStakers can use these LSD tokens in the broader DeFi market to leverage yield opportunities. Thanks to LSD tokens, stakers can multiply the benefits from their locked tokens, which otherwise would only generate staking rewards.\n\nHow to put LSDs to work?\n\nStakers that utilize LSDs can leverage various yield opportunities in the fast-growing DeFi space. For example, they can pursue generous yield opportunities on lending platforms by depositing their derivative tokens or using them as collateral to borrow assets for further market activities.\n\nSeveral DeFi lending protocols have integrated LSDs into collateral markets. Among them is Euler Finance. This Ethereum-based non-custodial lending protocol allows users to lend and borrow several LSDs, such as cbETH and stETH, derivatives that are facilitated by Lido and Coinbase.\n\nRecently, Euler added support for cbETH, the LSD token issued by Coinbase to ETH stakers who choose to stake with the exchange. Prior to the listing, cbETH holders couldn\u2019t leverage their collateral to facilitate other market opportunities. After launching support for this derivative, Euler attracted about $29 million in this asset alone, demonstrating the tremendous potential of LSDs in DeFi.\n\nSeraphim Czecker, Head of Risk at Euler Labs commented:\n\n\u201cThe fact that supplied cbETH on Euler exceeded grew so rapidly overnight after being promoted to collateral tier suggests wide appetite across retail and funds alike to trade LSD products beyond just Lido\u2019s staked ETH. With more than a billion in mintable cbETH, this market is bound to expand as DeFi traders use Euler to earn additional yield on cbETH or lever up on staking rewards.\u201d\n\nLSDs\u2019 market share in DeFi may surge\n\nThe DeFi boom back in 2020 wouldn\u2019t have been possible without stablecoins, which accounted for over 30% of the entire DeFi market at their peak. LSDs can have a similar impact thanks to their unique ability to enhance staking benefits.\n\nAccording to Staking Rewards, the percentage of staked Ethereum is only 14%, which is very low compared to Cardano\u2019s 71%, Avalanche's more than 62%, and Polygon's nearly 40%. One of the reasons why ETH holders are still hesitant to stake has to do with the restrictive condition of locking the ETH tokens when staking.\n\nThere is good news, though. The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will include a code, referred to as EIP 4895, which will enable staked ETH withdrawals. The upgrade will allow a 1:1 exchange of Beacon Chain staked ETH for ETH. This will encourage more ETH to be staked through liquid staking pools, which would drive demand for LSDs and potentially trigger rapid growth in DeFi TVL.\n\nEventually, other blockchains, such as Polygon and Avalanche, can benefit from their own LSDs, which would help them compete with Ethereum and contribute to a healthy balance across the DeFi space.\n\nLearn more about Euler Finance"

        "content": "Shiba Inu has gained ground tremendously over the past week as its price continues to see double-digit gains. With this newfound momentum has come renewed interest from investors and Ethereum whales are notably taking advantage of SHIB\u2019s growth during this time.\n\nEthereum Whales Boost Shiba Inu To Top Holding\n\nThe year 2022 actually saw the price of Shiba Inu fall over 80% from its all-time high, triggering immense bearish sentiment among its investors. During this time, the 5,000 largest Ethereum whales, who had collectively held over $1 billion worth of SHIB at one point, would reduce their holdings drastically. This saw Shiba Inu\u2019s position as the largest token holding by dollar value among these large investors eradicated over time.\n\nHowever, there has been a turn in the tide and SHIB has risen once again to reclaim its position. At the time of this writing, the meme coin is now the largest token position by the top 5,000 Ethereum whales behind ETH, beating out the likes of USDT and USDC that have dominated the list over the last couple of months.\n\nSHIB is largest token holding behind ETH among top 5,000 Ethereum whales | Source: WhaleStats\n\nCurrently, these whales hold over 50.5 trillion SHIB worth approximately $708.4 million, accounting for 17.82% of their total value holding. This puts it ahead of stablecoins USDT and USDC which make up 17.35% and 14.46% of the holdings of these whales, respectively.\n\nHow Does This Affect SHIB Price?\n\nThere is no doubt that this renewed interest from investors has put Shiba Inu in a very good position in the market. Over the last seven days, the token\u2019s price is up more than 19%, and despite multiple drawdowns, SHIB\u2019s price is trading at a three-month high.\n\nWhales\u2019 interest is also helping to drive the price higher as SHIB is the most traded token among the top 5,000 ETH whales in the last 24 hours. This puts the meme coin in a unique position to benefit from the increased volume but it also means that if there were to be a sharp drop in this volume, then the price would suffer.\n\nPresently, SHIB\u2019s price is sitting at $0.00001403, a 2.74% decline from its value in the past 24 hours. This follows the general market downturn ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech. This could trigger volatility in the market, but where the prices will end up is anyone\u2019s best guess at this point.\n\nSHIB price trading at three-month highs | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com"

        "content": "In the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in southeastern Turkey, many in the cryptocurrency industry have sought a crypto wallet address to donate to, following the examples of India in 2021 and Ukraine in 2022.\n\nBut Turkey\u2019s 2021 ban on crypto as an everyday currency in payments discouraged the Turkish crypto community from starting a fundraiser, Baki Er, Turkish co-founder of crypto research platform Lytera, told DL News. There was a fear that donations would count as payment and would be illegal, he said.\n\nThe tide quickly turned when well-connected Turkish rock star Haluk Levent personally took the matter to the government.\n\nLevent, who also heads non-profit Ahbap and is currently involved in the rescue efforts in the eathquake region, asked his 6.9 million followers in a poll yesterday whether he should push for crypto donations since \u201cmany in the world are asking to donate in crypto.\u201d The poll received nearly 1 million votes, as of this writing, with 82% supporting the idea.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nAfter consulting the government\u2019s financial watchdog MASAK, Levent said, he received approval to accept crypto donations for one week.\n\nCrypto wallet addresses, set up in various blockchains such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, received more than $2 million in various cryptocurrencies within a few hours of his announcement. Avalanche Foundation, headed by Turkish-American Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, has donated $1 million.\n\nBlockchain explorer Etherscan has labelled the wallet on Ethereum as \u201cAhbap Yard\u0131m / Earthquake Support\u201d to distinguish it from scammer wallets. Ethereum is permissionless, meaning anyone can set up a crypto wallet and solicit transfers. No central authority may revert blockchain transactions.\n\nCrypto donations are tax-efficient in most jurisdictions since donors don\u2019t have to sell crypto for fiat, and can instead transfer 100% of the value to the recipient. They\u2019re also fast and low-cost, allowing for near-instant transfers from anywhere.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe death toll in the aftermath of the earthquake that struck near the city of Gaziantep has risen to nearly 5,000, with more casualties expected as search and rescue efforts continue for those still trapped beneath the rubble. This is the largest earthquake to hit the region in eight decades."

        "content": "TRON outperformed Ethereum in stablecoin dominance.\n\nThe network\u2019s growth is shown in TVL, whale interest, and price increase.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world has seen tremendous growth in recent times, with several networks vying for dominance in different sectors. One area where TRON [TRX] has been making significant headway is in the stablecoin sector.\n\nInteresting. More than 50% of USDT is on Tron and this % has been growing recently. For comparison, 39.87% is on Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/V30EbK1EJA \u2014 Patrick | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) February 6, 2023\n\nTRON saw growth in these aspects\n\nAs per the tweet above, 50% of USDT was present on the network, as opposed to Ethereum [ETH]. This dominance in the stablecoin sector was a significant achievement and could suggest TRON\u2019s strength in the DeFi space.\n\nThe stability that USDT provided made it a crucial component of DeFi, and TRON\u2019s ability to hold a significant portion of USDT was testament to its growing influence in the sector.\n\nRead TRON\u2019s [TRX] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAlong with its stablecoin dominance, TRON also saw an increase in its TVL. According to DefiLlama, TRON\u2019s TVL increased from 4.11 billion to $5.04 billion, indicating a growing interest in the network. The rise in TVL also suggested that more people are placing their trust in the TRON network and its capabilities.\n\nAnother positive indicator for TRON was the increasing interest of whales in the network. As more and more whales invested in TRX, the price of the token also increased, providing a significant boost to the network.\n\nNot all roses and sunshine\n\nIn spite of its growing performance, TRON was not bereft of challenges. According to Santiment, TRX\u2019s volume fell from 902 million to 423.75 million, which could impact the protocol\u2019s future. The declining volume suggested that fewer people were actively trading TRX at press time, which could negatively impact the network\u2019s liquidity.\n\nAlong with the declining volume, the number of stakers on TRON decreased by 21.49% over the last 30 days. This could suggest a lack of confidence in the network, causing a drop in TVL and future stability.\n\nAnother issue that TRON was facing was the decrease in the number of active and new accounts on its network. The decrease in active accounts is also a negative indicator, as it could lead to a drop in liquidity and make it more challenging for people to trade on the network.\n\nIn conclusion, the network\u2019s dominance in the stablecoin sector is a significant achievement, but the network also faced several challenges that could impact its future. It remains to be seen how things pan out for the altcoin."

        "content": "Ethereum is still one of the most used blockchains. However, many people are not happy anymore with the existing Ethereum-compatible wallets. That\u2019s why we introduce Rabby Wallet to you. This is a great alternative to either MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\n\nSo, let\u2019s have a look at what Rabby Wallet has to offer.\n\n1/3 Excited to see the growing community turning to Rabby for a better & more secure wallet experience thanks to all the supporters. First-time users may wonder how to connect Rabby to dapps. You can use Rabby to access all dapps through a \"One-click-switch\"\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/bmCkHlTmil \u2014 Rabby Wallet (@Rabby_io) February 3, 2023\n\nWhat Is Rabby Wallet?\n\nDeBank is the company behind Rabby Wallet. This is a Chinese company, founded by Tang Hongbo. However, they reside in Singapore. They track DeFi protocols, currently well over 800 spread out over 15 chains. DeBank also raised $25 million in funds for development. There were some well-known investors involved. For instance, Coinbase Ventures, Crypto.com, Circle Ventures, and more.\n\nOne of their development areas was with the Rabby Wallet. This is an Ethereum-compatible, non-custodial wallet. In other words, it connects to all dApps that MetaMask supports. But, it has more to offer. So, here are three features that make this wallet stand out.\n\n1: Multi-chain. Currently, Rabby connects to 44 chains. But the great thing is that Rabby will automatically switch to the correct chain. You don\u2019t have to manually switch chains anymore. However, you can set up a manual switch, but the settings only work for that specific chain.\n\n2: You see what you sign. This is a great feature because this wallet shows you exactly what you sign. This is in contrast to most other wallets. So, no more signing of transactions that you don\u2019t understand. It shows you what your balance will look like after the transaction. See the picture below.\n\nSource: Rabby Wallet website\n\n3: The wallet scans pre-transaction risk. Another great feature. Rabby screens each transaction before you can sign it. It will warn you if the transaction may fail or if there\u2019s a security risk. It will also tell you if the address was previously under attack. Furthermore, it will also tell you if the address doesn\u2019t exist on the chain. See the picture below.\n\nThey update their security rules on a regular basis. Rabby Wallet also underwent various audits.\n\nHow to Set Up Your Rabby Wallet\n\nSetting up the Rabby Wallet is super easy. To clarify, though, it\u2019s only currently available as a Chrome and Brave extension. Firefox and Edge versions are on their way. Follow the following steps for installation:\n\n\n\nDownload the Chrome extension and open it.\n\nNow you can either set up a new Rabby address or import an existing address. For instance, you can import your MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\n\nIf you set up a new address, write down the 12-word seed phrase. Make sure to store this in a safe and secure place.\n\nYou can also import your MetaMask. You have two options \u2013 either import the MetaMask seed phrase or the private key. That\u2019s all you have to do. You\u2019re all set to go.\n\nBesides hot wallets, like MetaMask, you can also connect to hardware wallets. For instance, to a Ledger .\n\nNow, all your tokens across all EVM chains are visible to you in the dashboard. See the picture below.\n\nBefore you can start writing down the seed phase, the wallet gives you ample warnings. This emphasizes the importance of storing your seed phrase in a safe and secure place. Furthermore, keep in mind that you should not store your seed phrase on your phone or laptop/PC. See the picture below.\n\nHowever, before you start using your this wallet, you may see the following message:\n\n\n\n\u201cMetaMask is in use and Rabby is banned.\u201d\n\nThis means that MetaMask is set as your default wallet. You can click on the \u201cflip\u201d button. This will make Rabby Wallet your preferred or default wallet. See the picture below.\n\nNFTs\n\nRabby Wallet also shows your NFTs in a well-organized way. You can see them, and the wallet shows you all Ethereum and Polygon NFTs you own. The wallet should show NFTs you own from all 44 chains the wallet connects to. Furthermore, all NFTs are also in specific collection sections. In other words, the NFT section of the wallet is efficient and easy to navigate.\n\nThis in contrast to other Ethereum-compatible wallets that don\u2019t show you your NFTs at all. I like it when a wallet is this well set up and organized for my NFTs. See the picture below. The yellow arrows show you the different chains.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Rabby Wallet seems like a perfect alternative to other Ethereum-compatible wallets. What I like about it are its three main features. The automatic change to the correct chain. The screening for potential risks. And Rabby shows you the transaction before you sign it. Furthermore, the wallet also has a well-organized NFT section. I have installed my Rabby Wallet, imported my MetaMask, and am about to start testing this wallet.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Investors in cryptocurrencies are attempting to predict the timing of the next cryptocurrency boom, after a turbulent 2022. Lots of investors can fondly remember the era considered the best cryptocurrency era of all time, when Bitcoin reached an all-time high. November 2021 won\u2019t be forgotten in a hurry, as Bitcoin traded at around $68,000. At the time of writing, the price of BTC now stands a little over $22,000.\n\nBe that as it may, it was anticipated that Bitcoin would continue to fluctuate, trade within a range, and be susceptible to macroeconomic factors like rising interest rates. Another school of thought believes however, that, going by how cryptocurrency has shown promise at the start of the year, 2023 could be the time for that much anticipated \u2018bullish run\u2019.\n\nBitcoin: Will The \u2018Bull\u2019 Run Yet Again?\n\nSince the 2021 cryptocurrency boom that saw Bitcoin selling around $68,000, BTC investors have been waiting for another bull run that will see the cryptocurrency selling for a fee that high. Bitcoin has seen a modest increase at the start of the year; however, according to experts, the price of Bitcoin may have bottomed out and is unlikely to retest its all-time high of little less than $69,000.\n\nAccording to Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, Bitcoin is likely to trade in a range, between $15,000 and $20,000 on the low end and $25,000 to $30,000 on the high end. She claimed that while much of the \u201cforced selling\u201d that occurred in 2022 as a result of market falls has ended, little fresh capital is still entering the Bitcoin market.\n\nEthereum: Still Banking On The Merge?\n\nThe Merge, the cryptocurrency\u2019s eagerly awaited switch from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain, was meant to be the catalyst that would send Ethereum\u2019s price soaring in the year. The Merge technically proceeded as expected, but from an investing standpoint, it didn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll never really know what might have been because the crypto exchange FTX (FTT -0.18%) crashed around two months after The Merge happened. However, we do know what actually occurred: since September 15, when The Merge took place, Ethereum has decreased by around 25%.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Making History At Presale\n\nThe most talked about cryptocurrency, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has taken another giant step towards going live. The meme coin has now raised a staggering USD 23.71 million in presale and is closer to launch than ever before.\n\nDue to popular demand, BIG has now extended its 200% bonus offer date, until Monday the 20th of January, 2023. This means, for every purchase of the Big Eyes Coin, investors get three times the value of their investment. For instance, a one thousand dollar investment gives cryptocurrency investors three thousand dollars worth of Big Eyes Coin.\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity to invest early and grow rich, as proven by Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe blockchain-powered sports fan token launched its own layer 1 decentralized network on Tuesday.\n\nChiliz\u2019s L1 chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine program, allowing developers to broadcast smart contract codes on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s token CHZ pumped as high as 20% on the news.\n\nBlockchain sports coin Chiliz announced the launch of its brand new layer 1 decentralized chain aimed at driving growth around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and on-chain gaming tied to reach world sports franchises.\n\nA blog post released on Tuesday noted that Chiliz validated the genesis block of its blockchain to mark the company\u2019s fifth (5th) anniversary. The new chain functions as a layer 1 network using Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus. There are currently 11 validators on the blockchain and they are all allowed to deploy smart contracts on the network.\n\nAlso, the PoSA blockchain from Chiliz supports a popular program known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM. EVM acts as a run-time development area that allows on-chain builders to design decentralized applications (dapps) and launch these dapps on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain as smart contracts.\n\nThis means that CHZ developers will able to build and run dapps on Ethereum since the Chiliz blockchain is EVM-compatible. The CHZ token will power interaction on the blockchain and provider holders with staking rewards via the Socios platform, the blog post said.\n\nChiliz native token $CHZ will be the fuel for the entire Chiliz Blockchain ecosystem, including all the dApps that will be built on top of it. $CHZ token holders will also be able to receive rewards for staking (delegating) on the network.\n\nChiliz Token Pumps On L1 Blockchain Announcement\n\nThe CHZ token which will reportedly fuel the new blockchain, soared as high as 20% following the announcement. CHZ traded around $0.1656 per data from TradingView.\n\nCHZ\u2019s market cap was over $1.1 billion when this report was written. The Chiliz token also had a daily trading volume above $683 million across available markets.\n\nSince launching in 2018, the blockchain-based company has sought to bridge the gap between on-chain technology and sports fan interaction. The CHZ token allows sports fans to hold assets linked to real-world teams across sports industries like the major European football leagues in Spain, France, and Italy to name a few.\n\nAs part of its latest rebrand and new blockchain, Chiliz will onboard as many as 10 start-ups. These entities will head ventures like NFT ticketing, Watch2Earn sports events, and Play2Earn games."

        "title": "'Multichain future is very clear' \u2014 MetaMask to support all tokens via Snaps - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "MetaMask Snaps aims to facilitate a \u201cmultichain future,\u201d allowing the Ethereum-based wallet service to support non-native blockchains and tokens for the Web3 economy.\n\nDetails of the latest in-development addition to MetaMask\u2019s growing ecosystem were unpacked at the StarkWare Sessions event in Tel Aviv, Israel, in Feb. 2023. Speaking to Cointelegraph Magazine editor Andrew Fenton, Alex Jupiter, product manager of accounts and key management at MetaMask, revealed details about potential blockchain synergies.\n\nThe last 18 months have seen the development of Snaps speed up after the success of MetaMask Swaps, which brought token swap functionality to the service\u2019s native browser extension. As Jupiter explained, interoperability is becoming increasingly important in the blockchain space:\n\n\u201cMetaMask has historically been an Ethereum wallet. We need to start moving beyond that. The multichain future is very clear.\u201d\n\nSnaps aims to create a permissionless ecosystem where developers can extend MetaMask in any way they want. Jupiter says the team is trying to create an environment where developers can use various application programming interfaces (APIs) from different blockchains to bring additional options to a user\u2019s core wallet experience.\n\nRelated: The blue fox: DeFi\u2019s rise and the birth of MetaMask Institutional\n\nMetaMask describes Snaps as a system that allows developers to extend the capabilities of the wallet extension. A snap is a program that runs in an isolated environment that can customize a user\u2019s wallet experience.\n\nThe possibilities are extensive, with a snap allowing the addition of new APIs to MetaMask, multi-blockchain protocol support and the ability to modify existing MetaMask functionality using external APIs. According to Jupiter, Snaps should be able to integrate with most blockchain protocols:\n\n\u201cTechnically it\u2019s possible for us to incorporate all of them. I\u2019m sure there's going to be an edge case. We have managed to extend Bitcoin, managed to extend to StarkNet. So it should be possible with any of them.\u201d\n\nAs Jupiter explains, MetaMask has already created a Bitcoin (BTC) Snap that allows users to interact with its protocol from the wallet extension. This is a more difficult proposition than integrating Ethereum virtual machine-compatible chains like Polygon, but the end result is a highly-interoperable wallet extension across the broad blockchain-based ecosystem:\n\n\u201cIt basically means that you don\u2019t need to go anywhere else and MetaMask can almost be the core of your Web3 experience.\u201d\n\nImproving Web3 functionality is another driving factor in the development of Snaps. Despite onboarding millions of users to Web3 through MetaMask\u2019s tools, Jupiter says that simple actions like signing transactions can still be precarious:\n\n\u201cPeople have problems in terms of knowing if they\u2019re signing a transaction whether it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nJupiter believes Snaps can address this area, allowing third parties to create transaction insights and potentially warn users of signing dubious transactions with unwanted consequences.\n\nMetaMask Snaps is currently available in the developer version of MetaMask Flask. Jupiter says the aim is to have Snaps integrated with the main MetaMask by the end of 2023."

        "title": "Scammers are targeting crypto users with new 'zero value TransferFrom' trick - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Data from Etherscan shows that some crypto scammers are targeting users with a new trick that allows them to confirm a transaction from the victim\u2019s wallet, but without having the victim\u2019s private key. The attack can only be performed for transactions of 0 value. However, it may cause some users to accidentally send tokens to the attacker as a result of cutting and pasting from a hijacked transaction history.\n\nBlockchain security firm SlowMist discovered the new technique in December and revealed it in a blog post. Since then, both SafePal and Etherscan have adopted mitigation techniques to limit its effect on users, but some users may still be unaware of its existence.\n\nRecently we have received reports from the community of a new type of scam: Zero Transfer Scam. Be careful if you see suspicious 0 transfer in your wallet record:\n\n\n\n1/10 \u2014 Veronica (@V_SafePal) December 14, 2022\n\nAccording to the post from SlowMist, the scam works by sending a transaction of zero tokens from the victim\u2019s wallet to an address that looks similar to one that the victim had previously sent tokens to.\n\nFor example, if the victim sent 100 coins to an exchange deposit address, the attacker may send zero coins from the victim\u2019s wallet to an address that looks similar but that is, in fact, under the control of the attacker. The victim may see this transaction in their transaction history and conclude that the address shown is the correct deposit address. As a result, they may send their coins directly to the attacker.\n\nSending a transaction without owner permission\n\nUnder normal circumstances, an attacker needs the victim\u2019s private key to send a transaction from the victim\u2019s wallet. But Etherscan\u2019s \u201ccontract tab\u201d feature reveals that there is a loophole in some token contracts that can allow an attacker to send a transaction from any wallet whatsoever.\n\nFor example, the code for USD Coin (USDC) on Etherscan shows that the \u201cTransferFrom\u201d function allows any person to move coins from another person\u2019s wallet as long as the amount of coins they are sending is less than or equal to the amount allowed by the owner of the address.\n\nThis usually means that an attacker can\u2019t make a transaction from another person\u2019s address unless the owner approves an allowance for them.\n\nHowever, there is a loophole in this restriction. The allowed amount is defined as a number (called the \u201cuint256 type\u201d), which means it is interpreted as zero unless it is specifically set to some other number. This can be seen in the \u201callowance\u201d function.\n\nAs a result, as long as the value of the attacker\u2019s transaction is less than or equal to zero, they can send a transaction from absolutely any wallet they want, without needing the private key or prior approval from the owner.\n\nUSDC isn\u2019t the only token that allows this to be done. Similar code can be found in most token contracts. It can even be found in the example contracts linked from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s official website.\n\nExamples of the zero value transfer scam\n\nEtherscan shows that some wallet addresses are sending thousands of zero-value transactions per day from various victims\u2019 wallets without their consent.\n\nFor example, an account labeled Fake_Phishing7974 used an unverified smart contract to perform more than 80 bundles of transactions on Jan. 12, with each bundle containing 50 zero-value transactions for a total of 4,000 unauthorized transactions in one day.\n\nMisleading addresses\n\nLooking at each transaction more closely reveals a motive for this spam: The attacker is sending zero-value transactions to addresses that look very similar to ones the victims previously sent funds to.\n\nFor example, Etherscan shows that one of the user addresses targeted by the attacker is the following:\n\n0x20d7f90d9c40901488a935870e1e80127de11d74.\n\nOn Jan. 29, this account authorized 5,000 Tether (USDT) to be sent to this receiving address:\n\n0xa541efe60f274f813a834afd31e896348810bb09.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Fake_Phishing7974 sent a zero-value transaction from the victim\u2019s wallet to this address:\n\n0xA545c8659B0CD5B426A027509E55220FDa10bB09.\n\nThe first five characters and the last six characters of these two receiving addresses are exactly the same, but the characters in the middle are all completely different. The attacker may have intended for the user to send USDT to this second (fake) address instead of the real one, giving their coins to the attacker.\n\nIn this particular case, it appears that the scam did not work, as Etherscan does not show any transactions from this address to one of the fake addresses created by the scammer. But given the volume of zero-value transactions done by this account, the plan may have worked in other cases.\n\nWallets and block explorers may vary significantly as to how or whether they show misleading transactions.\n\nWallets\n\nSome wallets may not show the spam transactions at all. For example, MetaMask shows no transaction history if it is reinstalled, even if the account itself has hundreds of transactions on the blockchain. This implies that it stores its own transaction history rather than pulling the data from the blockchain. This should prevent the spam transactions from showing up in the wallet\u2019s transaction history.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wallet pulls data directly from the blockchain, the spam transactions may show up in the wallet\u2019s display. In a Dec. 13 announcement on Twitter, SafePal CEO Veronica Wong warned SafePal users that its wallet may display the transactions. In order to mitigate against this risk, she said that SafePal was altering the way addresses are displayed in newer versions of its wallet so as to make it easier for users to inspect addresses.\n\n(6/10) Upon this, we have taken actions:\n\n1) In the latest V3.7.3 update, we adjusted the length of the wallet address displayed in the transaction history. The first and last 10 digits of the wallet address will be displayed in default, for the sake of address examination \u2014 Veronica (@V_SafePal) December 14, 2022\n\nIn December, one user also reported that their Trezor wallet was displaying misleading transactions.\n\nCointelegraph reached out through email to Trezor developer SatoshiLabs for comment. In response, a representative stated that the wallet does pull its transaction history directly from the blockchain \u201cevery time users plug in their Trezor wallet.\u201d\n\nHowever, the team is taking steps to protect users from the scam. In an upcoming Trezor Suite update, the software will \u201cflag the suspicious zero-value transactions so that users are alerted that such transactions are potentially fraudulent.\u201d The company also stated that the wallet always displays the full address of every transaction and that they \u201cstrongly recommend that users always check the full address, not just the first and last characters.\u201d\n\nBlock explorers\n\nAside from wallets, block explorers are another type of software that can be used to view transaction history. Some explorers may display these transactions in such a way as to inadvertently mislead users, just as some wallets do.\n\nTo mitigate against this threat, Etherscan has begun graying out zero-value token transactions that aren\u2019t initiated by the user. It also flags these transactions with an alert that says, \u201cThis is a zero-value token transfer initiated by another address,\u201d as evidenced by the image below.\n\nOther block explorers may have taken the same steps as Etherscan to warn users about these transactions, but some may not have implemented these steps yet.\n\nTips for avoiding the 'zero-value TransferFrom' trick\n\nCointelegraph reached out to SlowMist for advice on how to avoid falling prey to the \u201czero-value TransferFrom\u201d trick.\n\nA representative from the company gave Cointelegraph a list of tips for avoiding becoming a victim of the attack:\n\n\"Exercise caution and verify the address before executing any transactions.\" \"Utilize the whitelist feature in your wallet to prevent sending funds to the wrong addresses.\" \"Stay vigilant and informed. If you encounter any suspicious transfers, take the time to investigate the matter calmly to avoid falling victim to scammers.\" \"Maintain a healthy level of skepticism, always stay cautious and vigilant.\"\n\nJudging from this advice, the most important thing for crypto users to remember is to always check the address before sending crypto to it. Even if the transaction record seems to imply that you\u2019ve sent crypto to the address before, this appearance may be deceiving."

        "content": "Majority of cryptocurrencies saw a decline over the course of the weekend as a result of the fall in US stocks brought on by Friday\u2019s strong job growth figures, raising worries about potential interest rate hikes to control the economy and tame inflation.\n\nAfter giving up all of their weekend gains and trading flat on a weekly basis, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major crypto tokens were trading low on Monday. Traders eagerly anticipate the US Fed Chairman\u2019s speech on Tuesday for hints about inflation and monetary tightening. However, investors don\u2019t appear to be in a rush, as there seems to be a feeling of confidence that the market will soon be up and blazing again.\n\nBitcoin Fails To Continue Bullish Run\n\nBitcoin lost roughly 4% of its value and fell to around the $22,000 level in the early Asian hours. However, although falling more than 4%, Bitcoin still aintains an unassailable lead on the top of the hierarchy, with a lead of over USD 20,000.\n\nIt was, no doubt, a weekend to forget for Bitcoin, as it was seen fluctuating within a small band of $22,900 and $23,100 on Sunday. Bitcoin has dropped over the last week in the last 24 hours, with support at $22,800 and resistance at $23,150. And on Monday morning, it traded for as low as $22,700.\n\nHowever, analysts believe that BTC will bounce back up during the week and push further forward to continue its transcedental start to the New Year.\n\nEthereum Loses By 2%\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin\u2019s biggest rival lost about 2% of its total value over the weekend. Most alternative currencies were trading at lower prices, but the losses were limited. Ethereum however maintained above $1,600, despite the downslide and traded at $1,619 on Monday morning.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been moving in lockstep with that of Bitcoin, but if the negative regime starts, ETH will experience a sharp decrease. The smart contract token could find support at $1,429 in the event of rejection at the $1,677 monthly resistance level and a subsequent decline. Due to the intense pressure from investors seeking to book profits, a collapse of this level might push the price of Ethereum to $1,331. ETH might return to the $1,227 floor in a severe situation.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: All The Way Up!\n\nMeme coin, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has continued to live up to expectations, despite the cryptocurrency market going down over the weekend. As at Monday morning, the soon-to-be-launched token had made an incredible USD 23million in presale, after making USD 21 million by Friday\u2019s close of business.\n\nBIG also extended its 200% launch bonus till Monday, February 20, 2023. This allows investors to earn a treble of their investment when they purchase the meme token. This means, a one thousand dollar investment gives investors three thousand dollars worth of Big Eyes Coin. No doubt, this is the best cryptocurrency offer!\n\nThe exceptional performance of BIG at the presale is a testament to the trustworthiness of the token and its commitment to deliver premium cryptocurrency dividends for its investors. BIG has been on a constant rise since it was created towards the end of 2022, and will be going live in the shortest possible time. Don\u2019t forget, investing pays, and investing early pays even better.

        "title": "How to Setup RPC on Metamask \u2013 Easy Guide - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Metamask is one of the well-known decentralized wallets. It allows users to easily store tokens, NFTs, and other DeFi belongings. Everyone can easily download the app or extension, create an account, and start using it. However, there are ways to make your Metamask a little bit better, faster, and more reliable. That\u2019s why in this article, we\u2019re going to go over the basics, then look into how to setup RPC on Metamask.\n\nWhat is a Metamask?\n\nMETAMASK is a mobile app and browser extension that lets users connect their wallets to decentralized apps (DApps). There are several DEXs available, including Aave, OpenSea, and Kava. You would need to be able to communicate with their protocols in order to access those DEXs. To do so, you simply connect to the network which the DEXs are utilizing using Metamask. This is technically your gateway into the Web3.0 space.\n\nIs METAMASK a wallet?\n\nTechnically yes, METAMASK has two functions, the first being a bridge to decentralized apps (smart-contracts friendly), and the second, being a decentralized wallet. So yes, you can say that Metamask is a Wallet that allows you to:\n\nSend Tokens\n\nReceive Tokens\n\nStore NFTs\n\nLogin to DApps privately\n\nStake Tokens\n\nAre METAMASK wallets SAFE?\n\nTotally! Think about it this way\u2026Blockchain is a technology that takes pride in both anonymity and security. Blockchain technology has so far been regarded as very safe that major companies have chosen to adopt it internally. If Amazon Managed Blockchain is now supporting the Ethereum blockchain, why wouldn\u2019t YOU, mister secure dude? Just make sure to keep your seed phrase in a safe place, and beware of phishing scams.\n\nWhy is Metamask Slow?\n\nIn order to understand why Metamask might feel slow, it is crucial to understand what nodes are.\n\nWhat are Nodes in Blockchain?\n\nWhen Metamask connects to a blockchain, it basically connects to a node on that blockchain. It does so to read and write information based on your activities. Usually, Metamask connects to a default node provider which all Metamask users share. This allows users to easily start using Metamask on the go without the hassle of connecting to any node.\n\nHowever, this is not a perfect solution, as the default node might become overcrowded with requests. That\u2019s why transaction processing becomes slower, users might see irregular block data, and worse, the default node might shut down unexpectedly.\n\nWhat is RPC Metamask?\n\nA Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a way to communicate with other servers remotely. It provides the ability to run programs in a separate location. For Metamask, RPCs allow users to access a server node on a specified network. When you first create an account, you will be linked to a specific blockchain (ex. Ethereum blockchain) through a default RPC.\n\nIf you want to enhance your Metamask experience, you might want to add a custom RPC to your Metamask. This will detach you from the \u201coverloaded\u201d node which all default users are using and plug you into another \u201cless-busy\u201d node.\n\nDefault node for Ethereum on Metamask\n\nWhat are Ethereum Layer 2s?\n\nAn Ethereum layer 2 is a different network that works with the Ethereum network (mainnet) and are sidechains to it. There are many different variants to those L2 networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Loopring, and Immutable X.\n\nLayer 2 solutions carry the weight off the main chain by processing data that will cause it to experience issues. A typical example is carrying out transactions away from the main chain. Doing this paves the way for the main blockchain to be able to carry out a massive number of transactions. Asides from that, the security of the solutions is always optimum in the sense that the same security covers it as the main chain. This is mainly because the solution is always built on top of the main blockchain. They are also regarded as off-chains.\n\nHow to setup RPC on Metamask?\n\nIn order to choose a different node, you need to first decide which network you want to go for. In this example, we\u2019ll choose to use the Polygon PoS mainnet.\n\nFirst, go to the official website on Polygon. In their official documentation, they\u2019ll provide you with all the details which you\u2019ll need to fill in. Same thing goes out to other networks.\n\nSecond, you\u2019ll go to your Metamask wallet and click on \u201cAdd Network\u201d from the Mainnets dropdown.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be redirected to the \u201cAdd a Network\u201d page. From there, you\u2019ll need 5 important infos which you\u2019ll copy/paste from the official documentation we saw previously:\n\nNetwork Name : Polygon\n\n: Polygon New RPC URL (Node endpoint): wss://rpc-mainnet.matic.network/\n\nwss://rpc-mainnet.matic.network/ Chain ID (chainId): 137\n\n137 Currency Symbol (Gas Token) : MATIC\n\n: MATIC Block Explorer URL (Block explorer): https://polygonscan.com/\n\nOnce done, click on the \u201csave\u201d button. The new network will be added to your Metamask, and you\u2019ll be able to select this new network from the networks dropdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Blockchain Companies"

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Is Leading The Crypto Flock As One Of The Biggest Presales In Recent History. Bitcoin and Ethereum ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Another day, another record for the daring Big Eyes Coin project, which is on its way to reaching the $50 million presale mark any time now. Against all odds, this project proved haters wrong and, in a year, managed to unite a massive fan base and rally support behind its brand. If the current pacing continues, little will stop this project from going down as one of the best presales in recent history. Today\u2019s editorial will consider reasons why Big Eyes is on the rise and look into why Bitcoin and Ethereum are finally ready to travel up north.\n\nBitcoin: The OG Crypto\n\nIt is no secret that Bitcoin will always occupy an exceptional place in the heart of crypto aficionados. Being the first cryptocurrency ever created, it has paved the way for blockchain technology to flourish on a large scale. Before Satoshi Nakamoto dropped Bitcoin\u2019s white paper, centralised banks ruled the world, preventing competition from challenging their solidified status quo.\n\nHowever, everything changed when Bitcoin came onto the stage, enabling permissionless peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary to control the process. Operating on the proof-of-work mechanism, Bitcoin became a symbol of the free Internet and, to this day, is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization by a long shot. When Bitcoin travels north, the crypt flock follows its movement, and its upward trajectory became imminent in the past month.\n\nEthereum: Supercomputer In Action\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin initially created Ethereum in 2014, a handful of people believed this project would skyrocket into the stratosphere. Fast forward to the present moment, and Ethereum comfortably occupies second place among the top cryptos by market capitalisation. What made Ethereum stand out from the competition was its holistic design, enabling anyone to build virtually anything on top of this blockchain.\n\nAs a result, most DeFi applications and NFTs are currently utilising the benefits Ethereum blockchain offers, making it arguably one of the best cryptos out there. And while in terms of market capitalisation, it is still behind its main rival, in terms of the use case applications, Ethereum by far exceeds any other blockchain out there. With the current market U-turn, there is a good chance that Ethereum might break the $2000 support level, finally indicating the bull run that most of the crypto flock has long anticipated.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: 10th Stage Is Selling Fast\n\nAfter the vast majority of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s loyal fanbase requested to extend the launch code for a 200% bonus, the team finally agreed to proceed with this request. Understandably, this news generated a lot of buzz on Twitter, with more and more people jumping onto this crypto bandwagon to reap some hefty benefits after the project is finally launched.\n\nOn paper, Big Eyes Coin is a win-win for everyone involved. Those who wish to sell NFTs would get this chance soon enough, while if you are a liquidity mercenary, then there will be options to stake the project\u2019s native token BIG. Moreover, if you are into charity and protecting our planet, then Big Eyes Coin is a perfect place, as this project pledged to preserve marine and ocean life. Use this promo code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 for a 200% bonus before it runs out on the 20th of February.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
