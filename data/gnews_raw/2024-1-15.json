        "title": "Ethereum to Flip Bitcoin: Cathie Wood's Bold Prediction for the Next Bull Run - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCathie Wood is bullish on cryptocurrencies, predicting a substantial growth of the entire crypto asset class.\n\nArk Invest is launching five separate crypto ETFs.\n\nEthereum is poised to outperform Bitcoin in the long run due to its multifaceted role in the evolving digital economy.\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, is known for her bullish stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn a recent interview , Wood articulated her conviction in the potential of these digital assets, predicting a substantial growth of the entire crypto asset class from $1 trillion today to $25 trillion over the next five to seven years.\n\nWood Declares Confidence in Crypto with New ETF Launch\n\nARK Invest is launching five separate crypto ETFs , including a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF and a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Wood\u2019s enthusiasm started in the mid-2010s, when it had a market cap of about $6 billion. The involvement of economist Art Laffer , who praised Bitcoin for its rules-based monetary policy, significantly influenced her perspective.\n\nWood\u2019s focus is particularly interesting when it comes to Ethereum. She acknowledges Ethereum\u2019s burgeoning role in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), recognizing its ability to satisfy the unmet need for yield in the financial markets. This view is underscored by the current state of fixed income markets , where the search for yield has reached unprecedented levels.\n\nFurthermore, Wood emphasizes the importance of following the developers in the crypto space. By this metric, Ethereum stands out, with its ecosystem supporting a wide range of applications. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s blockchain\u2019s holds DeFi and NFTs, and attracts a large community of developers. This aspect of Ethereum, combined with its potential in empowering the creator community, contributes to Wood\u2019s optimism about its future.\n\nCathie Wood expects #Ethereum will most likely outperform Bitcoin in the next Bull Run. pic.twitter.com/FEK9YAIZWo \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 15, 2024\n\nWood\u2019s bullish stance on Ethereum does not overshadow her confidence in Bitcoin. She sees both cryptocurrencies as having a bright future, highlighting the importance of investing during times of volatility, which she believes strengthens the credibility and investor confidence in these digital assets.\n\nWood also touches upon the broader economic context, discussing monetary policies and trust issues in traditional finance. She suggests cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized and transparent nature, offer a more trustworthy alternative in the current economic climate.\n\nEthereum Poised to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nIn terms of long-term predictions, ARK Invest\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d presentations provide ambitious forecasts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. In their 2023 presentation, they laid out three scenarios for Bitcoin, ranging from a bear case of $258,000 to a bull case of $1.48 million by 2030. For Ethereum, their 2022 forecast envisages a market cap that could exceed $20 trillion by 2032, potentially valuing each ETH at more than $166,000."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class. This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. You could lose all of your capital.\n\nWith the release of smart contracts, new consensus mechanisms, and improvements to network efficiency, the cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially in recent years, leading many investors to ask, is Ethereum a good investment?\n\nThroughout this guide, we\u2019ll be taking an in-depth look at Ethereum, analyzing its utility and potential for growth in the future. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment? Our Verdict\n\nWith the asset growing by tens of thousands of percent since its launch, many investors are asking the questions, what is Ethereum? Is Ethereum a good investment? After conducting hours of detailed research into the topic, we\u2019ve got an answer.\n\nAs the crypto market expands, there will likely be a sharp increase in the number of applications built upon the Ethereum network. This will naturally result in significantly boosted demand for the ETH token, in turn pumping the token\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum is one of the most proactive blockchains in developing and upgrading its network and following the Merge in 2022 \u2013 which cut energy usage by an estimated 99.95% \u2013 other upgrades are in the pipeline, only helping to further boost its performance.\n\nEthereum remains, by far, the most popular network for decentralized app (dApp) builders and developers, with almost 1,000 major protocols built on its network as well as thousands of meme tokens and NFT collections. In fact, Ethereum\u2019s TVL (total value locked, the combined value of projects built on its network) is over $21 billion, more than three times nearest rival Tron ($6.7bn TVL).\n\nThat is unlikely to change any time soon making Ethereum, by far, the most useful cryptocurrency and giving it a huge network of reliant projects \u2013 even if that isn\u2019t always reflected in the current price of ETH.\n\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve reached a positive verdict on whether Ethereum is a good investment. While the coming months are likely to be rather rocky, over the long-term Ethereum should perform quite well.\n\nHow Ethereum Has Performed Since Launch & in 2023\n\nEthereum has been performing well since its official launch in 2014, when the price of ETH was just $0.31 during its initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nBased on the asset\u2019s past performance, it will have likely provided great returns to investors that gave it enough time to grow. Regardless of when an investor picked up ETH, historically, it\u2019s been possible to turn a profit simply by waiting, making ETH a great long-term crypto investment.\n\nInvestors that bought into the asset during its 2018 highs, would\u2019ve had to wait until at least 2021 just to break even. However, given that ETH was held to the bull run\u2019s peak, investors could\u2019ve netted themselves returns of around 275% or an annualized rate of 91.66%. Furthermore, anyone that invested during the 2017 high would\u2019ve secured 482% in returns.\n\nWith this in mind, while it\u2019s true that anyone that bought ETH at the peak of the 2021 bull would be down roughly 65% at today\u2019s prices, given enough time they could end up securing huge returns, especially given the continued improvements to the Ethereum network, that have massively boosted efficiency, scalability and transaction price.\n\nThe same is true for investors that got involved during the January 2022 dip, while they would currently be down around 53%, given a few years in the market, it\u2019s possible that ETH could yield annualized returns similar to its last run. As such, ETH could be the best crypto to buy in the crash right now.\n\nSince its launch, Ethereum has increased in value by millions of percent.\n\nInvestors that stocked up on ETH during the 2017 run would be enjoying 482% returns.\n\nAnyone that purchased ETH in 2018 would have earned an annualized return of 91.66%.\n\nAfter hitting a new all-time high in 2021. ETH has been on a steady decline.\n\nThroughout 2022, the price of ETH fell alongside the wider market.\n\n2023 has brought better performance with the coin reaching a yearly high of $2120 in April.\n\nAt the time of writing in September 2023, ETH is around 40% up from its price in January.\n\nBuy ETH with MEXC\n\nCrypto assets are a volatile investment product. Your capital is at risk.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nLaunched back in 2014, Ethereum has grown from a humble initial coin offering (ICO) into a titan of industry and the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market. The asset, now boasting a price tag of around $1,600 was originally sold for just $0.311 during its ICO, a discount of 99.97% compared to today\u2019s figure.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s smart contract ecosystem grew and began to attract attention from developers, the price of ETH exploded, rising from a 2017 low of just $8.17 to a high of $820.24, an increase of nearly 10,000%. Naturally, this fast growth led many investors to wonder is investing in Ethereum a good idea.\n\nThis trend continued into 2018, with Ethereum growing massively. Likely helped along by the fact that the world\u2019s largest blockchain game (at the time), CryptoKitties was built on the Ethereum network, leading many other developers to follow suit. At its peak price in 2018, the price of ETH soared, hitting $1,270.47.\n\nHowever, what goes up must come down. Over the next couple of years the price of Ethereum, one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies on the market at the time, slowly declined. Throughout 2018 ETH fell as low as $90.60 and traded between $150 and $200 during 2019. Over this same period, the price of Bitcoin fell from $19,118 to a low of $3,460.55.\n\nThe ETH price stayed within this range until late 2020 promoting crypto enthusiasts everywhere to wonder will Ethereum go up. While things were looking bleak, the cryptocurrency market picked up significantly as thousands of investors entered the market, pushing ETH to new heights, first taking the asset to $4,174, then even further to an all-time high of $4,878.26 on November 10, 2021.\n\nLike the rest of the market, Ethereum has suffered through a prolonged bear market since those highs, with macroeconomic factors such as the Russia-Ukraine War, inflation, plus the collapse of various crypto companies, including FTX, seeing the price dip below $1,000 in mid-2022.\n\nETH has been rising steadily in 2023 \u2013 and was up as much as 77% between January and June to a high of $2,100 \u2013 but has since taken a step backwards leading to its present-day valuation of around $1,600.\n\nEthereum Highs and Lows\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve summarized the highs and lows of Ethereum since its launch, putting the asset\u2019s growth in perspective, and making it simpler to determine is Ethereum a good investment.\n\nEarly 2014 \u2013 Ethereum was released as an ICO with ETH available for around $0.311\n\nEthereum was released as an ICO with ETH available for around $0.311 Mid-2017 \u2013 Ethereum slowly grew, then exploded in 2017, rising from $8.17 to $820.\n\nEthereum slowly grew, then exploded in 2017, rising from $8.17 to $820.

A few of these include the economy as a whole, the crypto market, potential competitors, and even Ethereum\u2019s utility as well as any planned updates to the network. Let\u2019s dive into our prediction.\n\nEnd of 2023 \u2013 Looking toward the end of next year, we could expect to see growth from Ethereum, however, the market will likely remain bearish as a reaction to uncertainty in the economy. As a result, we could see ETH test a previous support of $1,800 .\n\nLooking toward the end of next year, we could expect to see growth from Ethereum, however, the market will likely remain bearish as a reaction to uncertainty in the economy. As a result, we could see ETH test a previous support of . End of 2024 \u2013 Moving onwards, as long as nothing unexpected occurs, we\u2019ll likely see the economy begin its path to recovery, something likely to have a very positive impact on the crypto and stock market. The next Bitcoin halving is also approaching, which has sparked all previous bull runs. This will likely lead to Ethereum trading for an average of $3,000 , an increase of around 75% over today\u2019s prices.\n\nMoving onwards, as long as nothing unexpected occurs, we\u2019ll likely see the economy begin its path to recovery, something likely to have a very positive impact on the crypto and stock market.

End of 2025 \u2013 With more time to build positive traction, continued updates and widespread crypto adoption, we could see some impressive moves from the price of ETH during 2025. It seems likely that a retest of the asset\u2019s prior high will be required. This would place the value of ETH at approximately $4,900 .\n\nWith more time to build positive traction, continued updates and widespread crypto adoption, we could see some impressive moves from the price of ETH during 2025. It seems likely that a retest of the asset\u2019s prior high will be required. This would place the value of ETH at approximately . End of 2030 \u2013 The Ethereum team will have had plenty of time to work on developing new features and any improvements to the network currently in the pipeline may have rolled out. Combined with the expected growth of the crypto market (11.1% annually), we could see ETH hit $7,985 with a high of $10,000 also possible.\n\nEthereum Utility \u2013 What Does the Future Hold?\n\nWhen it comes time for an investor to answer the question, should I buy Ethereum now, it\u2019s crucial to consider the project\u2019s long-term utility \u2013 which is among the very best in the crypto space.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict the market\u2019s movements with 100% accuracy, but investing in utility-centric projects drastically increases the chances of an investment paying off over the long term.\n\nTo make it more simple for investors to determine whether Ethereum holds enough utility to be considered a worthwhile investment, we\u2019ve outlined a few of its top uses below.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nPerhaps the most widely used feature of the Ethereum network is its smart contract capabilities. Developers can build their own decentralized applications known as dApps, directly on the Ethereum network. This helps to facilitate interoperability between applications and allows new projects to take advantage of the various benefits offered by an established network like Ethereum.\n\nNumerous high-profile and highly important protocols are based on Ethereum, including the likes of Lido, Maker, Aave and Uniswap. A number of the largest meme coins in the space are also ERC-20 tokens, powered and secured by Ethereum, including Shiba Inu, Pepe and Floki.\n\nAs applications created on the Ethereum network boost demand for the ETH, this could be phenomenal for the long-term growth of this innovative proof-of-stake crypto.\n\nNetwork Upgrades\n\nThe recent update to the Ethereum network, known as the Merge, switched Ethereum from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. This has created a new economy on the network, with ETH holders able to earn rewards for validating transactions and adding to the network\u2019s security. This incentivizes long-term holds and rewards the project\u2019s top supporters.\n\nOn top of introducing staking to the network, the Merge has paved the way for sharding to be introduced to the network. This will allow transaction data to be split among the network, sharply increasing throughput and reducing congestion during periods of load.\n\nEthereum is one of the most active networks for consistently trying to improve and upgrade its network.\n\nSecurity\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of the Ethereum network is its security. Achieved through decentralization, Ethereum is considered to be one of the most secure networks on the planet.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s commonly used for sensitive applications, like Aave which is a crypto lender and Lido, which offers liquid staking. With the rate at which crypto hacks are increasing, developers will aim to build on secure networks, boosting the demand for Ethereum.\n\nNFTs\n\nThe NFT sector has struggled badly since the 2021 boom \u2013 much more so than crypto investment \u2013 but it remains one of the most rapidly evolving areas in cryptocurrency. A large portion of the best NFTs are built on the Ethereum network, including the likes of Crypto Punks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nNaturally, this has drastically increased the number of transactions taking place on the network, booting its dominance. With NFTs quickly being picked up by mainstream companies this is very promising for Ethereum.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Long-Term Investment or Short-Term Investment?\n\nFor investors considering is now a good time to buy Ethereum, it\u2019s important to have an investing plan in place. This means determining which prices to buy and sell at and also deciding whether you want to hold Ethereum as a long or short-term investment.\n\nWe\u2019ll be discussing the merit of ETH with both strategies, making it simple for investors to choose the one right for them.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering should I invest in Ethereum over the short term, it\u2019s important to take the performance of the wider economy into consideration. With assets across the board taking a beating and mass uncertainty being present in the crypto market, it\u2019s probably best to avoid a shorter-term investment in ETH, until the market gets a clear directional bias.\n\nOn the other hand, as a long-term investment, Ethereum has excellent merit \u2013 the project boasts a wide array of utilities, a strong use case and is consistently attempting to improve.\n\nFurthermore, a number of the world\u2019s largest crypto-assets are built upon the Ethereum network, a clear indicator of longevity. As it stands today, anyone holding ETH for at least 2 years would be in profit, so ETH could work well as a long-term hold.\n\nWhat Experts Say on Whether You Should Invest in Ethereum\n\nMany experts have strong feelings on the topic is Ethereum still a good investment. While hundreds of prominent figures have shared their opinions regarding this top trending crypto.\n\nCapital.com , a popular broker discussed the potential of Ethereum saying that the improvements to the network\u2019s scalability and throughput are likely to offer a sizable long-term boost to the asset. The broker summarized predictions from various outlets, almost all of which offered a positive outlook over a 6+ month period.\n\n, a popular broker discussed the potential of Ethereum saying that the improvements to the network\u2019s scalability and throughput are likely to offer a sizable long-term boost to the asset.

Time , a well-known media outlet shared the thoughts of Mike McGlone, an intelligence analyst for Bloomberg. McGlone predicted that Ethereum could end 2022 trading for roughly $4,000 to $4,500. However, another market analyst, Wendy O expects ETH will drop to around $750, providing a mixed answer to the question is Ethereum a good investment.\n\n, a well-known media outlet shared the thoughts of Mike McGlone, an intelligence analyst for Bloomberg.

WalletInvestor a prominent price prediction platform, shared its rating for Ethereum giving the smart contract network an A+. The predictions platform also stated that according to their forecasts, an increase in the price of Ethereum is expected over the coming years making it a solid long-term pick.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nInvestors trying to determine is it a good time to buy Ethereum will also likely be wondering where they can pick up the digital asset. We\u2019ve included a review of MEXC, a leading crypto exchange and our top pick for the best exchange to buy ETH.\n\nMEXC \u2013 Popular Crypto Exchange With 0.1% Spot Trading Fees\n\nMEXC is a crypto exchange that offers over 1,700 tokens to trade with low spot fees of 0.1% and futures fees from 0.01%. This means that not only is MEXC an excellent choice to buy ETH, but also to trade it on the spot market or the futures market with leverage.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to simply buy ETH, you can do so quickly when you deposit funds via bank transfer or via third-party providers such as Mercuryo, Banxa, Moonpay and Simplex. These providers let you buy ETH with a card, with Apple Pay or Google Pay. Note, these come with a slightly higher fees than if you made a bank deposit and purchased ETH on the spot market. But sometimes, buying ETH faster, even if it comes with higher fees, could be a better option, especially if the price of ETH soars.\n\nOnce you have your ETH, you can withdraw it to your wallet, such as MetaMask, or you can keep some of it on the exchange and stake it with MEXC Savings where you can get up to 4.80% annual percentage yield. Keeping it on the platform can also be useful if you need instant liquidity. With MEXC Loans you can use your ETH as collateral to borrow funds.\n\nMEXC offers additional features such as copy trading, where you can copy popular traders, you can get new tokens from the MEXC Launchpad, or learn to trade with demo accounts.\n\nBuy ETH with MEXC\n\nShould I Buy Ethereum Now? Our Verdict\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the factors influencing our verdict, it\u2019s time to answer the question, is it still a good time to buy Ethereum?\n\nWhile the short-term outlook of just about every financial market leaves a lot to be desired right now, Ethereum seems to be very strong in a macro sense. Just about every long-term (2+ years) ETH holder would currently be in profit, with the only exception being those that invested during the 2021 bull run. As such, it\u2019s clear that Ethereum provides a great long-term opportunity.\n\nWith Ethereum boasting strong utility and a clear plan for future developments, our Ethereum price predictions look rather promising. While 2023 might be a slow year for crypto, we expect that ETH could reach between $7,500 to $10,000 during 2030, an increase of 350% on the low end.\n\nWhile the experts seemed mostly divided on how Ethereum might perform over the short term, one thing was clear, long-term growth was expected by most. It seems as though most people believe Ethereum will play a crucial role in the crypto space over the next few years, so it\u2019s not an asset to overlook.\n\nAll in all, while its short-term potential is murky, Ethereum seems like a strong long-term investment. As such, it could be a good time to buy Ethereum, for investors focused on the macro perspective.\n\nCoins to Consider Alongside Ethereum\n\nNow that we\u2019ve answered the question is Ethereum a good investment, it seems fitting to discuss a couple of smaller projects built on the Ethereum network, that could provide even greater returns than ETH.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token \u2013 ERC20 Presale With 450% Dynamic APY And Market-Focused Roadmap\n\nBitcoin ETF Token ($BTCETF) is an Ethereum-powered presale with a dynamic APY PoS of 450% at the current time and a roadmap that is tied to important events in the wider crypto economy.\n\nThe primary event is the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should this event manifest, it could increase the total crypto market cap by hundreds of billions of dollars, and possibly result in price increases for BTC and altcoins.\n\nBitcoin ETF token, however, stands to benefit the most, as it was created with this exact scenario in mind. It could be a 10x token or more if approval occurs, something which could happen in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe ERC20 presale also provides a 25% token burn to encourage price appreciation for the remaining supply. The token burn takes place in five distinct intervals dependent on key events, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the price of Bitcoin breaching $100,000.\n\nSo this is a campaign that is tied to the market, as opposed to being a self-contained ecosystem with arbitrary goals. It has a market focus that differentiates it from many other presales. Aside from this, it offers a significant price increase throughout its presale.\n\nIn the initial round, the token retails at $0.0050, a price which will rise substantially to $0.0068 by the final round (round ten). This is an automatic price increase of nearly 40% simply for buying and holding coins.\n\nThis could be an ideal Ethereum alternative with more upside potential and a number of incentives for investors.\n\nThe presale maintains a dedicated section on its website for BTC ETF-related news, along with its official Twitter and Telegram accounts.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Token Whitepaper contains all the essential information about this new presale.\n\nPresale Started 6 Nov 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, BNB, MATIC, Card Chain Ethereum Min Investment None Max Investment None\n\nBitcoin Minetrix \u2013 Stake-to-Mine Project Offering Huge 6,000% APY During Presale\n\nBitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) is a brand new ERC-20 token launched on Ethereum that is the world\u2019s first stake-to-mine crypto project.\n\nThe project has only just launched its presale but is seeing a lot of interest from investors and has already raised more than $200,000.\n\nAs well as offering incredible staking rewards \u2013 with the current APY sitting at over 6,000% \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix token holders can also mine Bitcoin.\n\nThis works by staking tokens which then generate cloud mining credits. They can be burnt to earn allocated mining time, with mined BTC sent back to the user.\n\nThe whole process is managed via a dedicated mobile app and takes all the risk out of cloud mining \u2013 which has been a hotbed for scammers \u2013 by tokenizing the process.\n\nThat means there are no upfront fees or long fixed-term contracts to agree, with Bitcoin Minetrix holders able to stake as much or as little as they like and unstake at any time and sell their tokens on an exchange.\n\nThe project has just launched stage 1 of its presale, wihich will run for 10 stages in total \u2013 tokens currently cost $0.011 but will increase 8% to $0.0119 in the final stage.\n\nThere is a max supply of 4 billion tokens, with 2.8 billion available during the presale. More information and the latest news can be found in the whitepaper or on Telegram.\n\nPresale Started 26 Sept 2023 Purchase Methods ETH, USDT, BNB Chain Ethereum Min Investment $10 Max Investment None\n\nReferences\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment in 2024?\n\nEvery investor will have a different opinion of what constitutes a good investment. However, with Ethereum constantly working on developing new features and with most people expecting ETH to slowly increase in value, Ethereum could be a good investment in 2024.\n\nWhat Ethereum be worth in five years?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict the value of an asset in the future, but based on the growth of the crypto market and the planned improvements to the Ethereum network, we could see the value of ETH at around $5,000 by 2025 and around $7,500 in five years times.\n\nIs it worth buying Ethereum now?\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment? This is the question on the minds of thousands of investors. Right now, ETH can be purchased for around $1,700, a significant discount compared to 2021\u2019s prices. As such, if you were debating buying ETH at $4,000+ it\u2019s most probably worth buying today.\n\nIs Ethereum a safe investment?\n\nThere is no such thing as a safe investment. Everything has risks. However, the general consensus among professional investors and traders seems to be that Ethereum will grow steadily over the coming years."

        "content": "The official Starknet Ethereum address made seven cross-chain transactions ahead of the anticipated launch of STRK, the protocol\u2019s native token expected by Q2 2024.\n\nStarknet transferred less than three STRK tokens between Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and the project\u2019s layer-2 network, per data seen on block explorer Starkscan. The action was likely part of an on-chain test exercise for the Ethereum-based scaling solution before developers rolled out the ERC-20 cryptocurrency.\n\nSTRK test transactions | Source: Starkscan\n\nThe transactions for users and network participants indicate progress toward STRK\u2019s launch, which may accompany an airdrop and community rewards. The Starknet Foundation revealed 1.8 billion STRK tokens earmarked for its distribution plan in December last year.\n\nHalf that amount was designated network rebates to reward users already transacting on the L2 chain, crypto.news noted. Beneficiaries of the Early Community Member Program are also set to receive a portion of some 50 million STRK coins when the token is released.\n\nYou might also like: Starknet community approves STRK for transaction fees\n\nFurthermore, STRK is set to onboard additional utilities following a pivotal community vote on Jan. 8. Delegates approved STRK as a valid transaction fee payment currency in a two-token gas structure alongside Ether (ETH).\n\nAccording to a Starknet Foundation committee, STRK should launch by April 2024, barring any delays or technical hiccups. Built by Israeli-based blockchain startup Starkware Industries, the L2 network deploys zero-knowledge rollup technology to scale Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nThe idea is to decongest Ethereum\u2019s mainnet by providing an alternative transaction chain with cheap fees and faster settlement while retaining on-chain security and transparency. Starknet had over $169 million in total value locked as of Jan. 15, L2Beat confirmed.\n\nNow that the news is out, we might as well tell you more!\n\n\n\nStarknet is about each of you. Every user, builder and member of our community \u2013 existing and future \u2013 is a critical piece to building our network into the future of decentralisation for generations to come.

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Explained: Is ETH Staking Worth It? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "In September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain received its biggest upgrade to date. The Merge upgrade moved Ethereum from Proof-of-Work over to Proof-of-Stake. The transition to Proof-of-Stake has made the Ethereum much more environmentally friendly and also laid the foundation for future upgrades, which will significantly improve the scalability of the network.\n\nWith the introduction of Proof-of-Stake on Ethereum, ETH holders now have the opportunity to stake their coins and earn staking rewards in the form of additional ETH. In this article, we\u2019ll explain Ethereum staking and present the different options ETH holders have when it comes to earning staking rewards.\n\nKey highlights: The Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in September of 2021.\n\nThis means that ETH holders can now stake their ETH to provide additional security to the network and earn rewards.\n\nIf you want to run your own validator, you need 32 ETH.\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH, you can still earn staking rewards. You can use liquid staking protocols such as Lido or stake your ETH with the help of a crypto exchange.\n\nWe explain all the different ways of staking ETH and highlight the benefits and disadvantages of each.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum now uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, in which validators stake ETH in exchange for participating in the consensus process. Validators are rewarded for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and for checking that blocks proposed by other validators follow the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\nValidators that are reliable and act in the best interests of the network receive ETH as a reward. At the time of writing, validators on Ethereum are earning an APR (annual percentage rate) of about 4%. If you\u2019re investing in Ethereum and don\u2019t plan to sell in the short term, staking ETH is certainly worth considering to passively grow your ETH holdings.\n\nThe rewards earned by each validator depend on the total number of validators that are active on the Ethereum network, as well as network activity (more activity means more potential income from transaction fees).\n\nThe catch is that validators who are not reliable or are found to be breaking the rules are punished by having a portion or the entirety of their ETH stake taken away.\n\nWho can stake ETH?\n\nIn order to launch your own validator, you need to have 32 ETH. At the time of writing, this translates to about $57,000, so it\u2019s definitely not accessible to everyone from a financial perspective.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are still ways to earn staking rewards with your ETH even if you don\u2019t have the 32 ETH required to launch your own validator. We\u2019ll discuss the different ways to stake ETH a bit further below in the article.\n\nInitially, staked ETH coins could not be withdrawn. However, this was changed with the Shapella upgrade in April of 2023, which gave users the ability to withdraw their staked coins.\n\nWhere to stake ETH?\n\nThere\u2019s four distinct options for ETH holders that want to stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nSolo staking\n\nStaking as a service\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking through crypto exchanges\n\nHowever, solo staking and staking as a service are limited to those that have at least 32 ETH.\n\nDo you have 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you have 32 or more ETH to stake, you can access solo staking or staking as a service solutions. Of course, you can also use other ways of staking ETH that are also available to users that have less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nSolo staking\n\nSolo staking involves launching your own Ethereum validator and maintaining it yourself. Each validator you run requires a stake of 32 ETH.\n\nWhen you\u2019re solo staking, you\u2019re directly participating in the consensus process of the Ethereum blockchain and contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization. In addition, you remain in full control of your private keys and receive full staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. This is why the Ethereum Foundation describes solo staking as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for Ethereum staking.\n\nWhile solo staking certainly has a lot of benefits, it is the least accessible way to stake ETH for the average person. The most obvious barrier to entry is that you need at least 32 ETH, which is simply out of reach for most Ethereum investors. Operating a validator also requires some technical expertise, and you need to ensure that your validator stays online continuously to avoid inactivity penalties.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nThere are various staking as a service providers that offer to manage one or more Ethereum validators on your behalf. When using these services, you\u2019re required to provide ETH (32 ETH per validator). In most cases, you get to keep control of your private keys, which is a plus.\n\nOf course, staking as a service providers need some form of compensation for operating validator nodes on your behalf. So, while your validators will be earning ETH staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol, you will have to pay a fee to the service provider to keep your validators up and running.\n\nSo, staking as a service can be a good option if you have the sufficient amount of ETH to have your own validators but don\u2019t want to deal with the technical aspects of setting up a node and keeping it operational.\n\nOverall, your returns will be slightly lower than what you\u2019d get with solo staking as you\u2019ll have to pay a fee to the provider. Some examples of staking as a service providers are BloxStaking and Abyss Finance.\n\nDo you have less than 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH to stake, you can't engage in solo staking, but there's other options available to you.\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking pools take ETH deposits from multiple users and pool them together to launch Ethereum validators. This makes it possible for anyone to stake their ETH, even if they don\u2019t have 32 ETH themselves.\n\nStaking pools are a very popular way of staking Ethereum, and many of them offer liquid staking, which is a very handy feature. Here\u2019s two examples of the top two Ethereum staking pools available today.\n\nLido\n\nLido is a liquid staking solution that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Lido is the most popular way to stake Ethereum. At the time of writing, over 30% of all staked ETH has been staked through Lido.\n\nAfter staking your ETH through Lido, you will receive an equivalent amount of stETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH and any accrued rewards. These stETH tokens can be used in DeFi protocols or even sold if you need liquidity.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that the stETH to ETH exchange rate is usually skewed in favor of ETH, so you will likely receive a bit less than 1 ETH for each stETH you sell. Of course, you are also able to redeem your stETH for staked ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is also a liquid staking solution that allows users to stake smaller amounts of ETH. The minimum amount of ETH that can be staked through Rocket Pool is 0.01 ETH, which makes the service highly accessible.\n\nWhen you stake ETH through Rocket Pool, your staked coins and accrued rewards are represented with rETH tokens. Similarly to stETH, you can use rETH in any way you please. rETH holders can redeem their tokens for ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nOverall, staking pools are a good option for anyone that\u2019s looking to earn Ethereum staking rewards but has less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges offer Ethereum staking services to their users. For example, you can stake your Ethereum on Binance, which is a solid option since you will be able to retain liquidity thanks to BETH, a token that represents ETH staked through Binance.\n\nWhen staking through an exchange, you deposit ETH to the exchange. The exchange then pools together ETH from multiple users to deploy Ethereum validators. The rewards earned by these validators are then distributed to the users who staked their ETH, but the exchange will typically take a cut from the rewards as a fee for the service they provide.\n\nStaking through exchanges is probably the most convenient way to earn Ethereum staking rewards, but it also requires the most trust. When you deposit your ETH to a centralized crypto exchange, you have to trust that they will manage your funds responsibly. In addition, there could be a negative impact to the decentralization of Ethereum if exchanges control a large number of validators.\n\nComparison of Ethereum staking methods\n\nNow that we\u2019ve briefly explained each different Ethereum staking method, let\u2019s do a quick comparison of their pros and cons.\n\nMinimum amount Pros Cons Solo staking 32 ETH Full control over staking setup\n\nReceive full rewards\n\nContributes most to decentralization High barrier to entry\n\nRequires technical knowledge Staking as a service 32 ETH Much simpler than solo staking\n\nKeep control of keys required to withdraw or transfer staked ETH Service providers take a fee\n\nHigh barrier to entry Staking pools Small (0.01 ETH or less) You can stake smaller amounts of ETH\n\nMany staking pools offer liquidity tokens\n\nNon-custodial options available Smart contract risks\n\nLiquidity token price fluctuations Crypto exchanges Small (0.01 ETH or less) Very convenient way of staking ETH\n\nMany exchanges offer liquid staking options Requires trust in the exchange\n\nExchange takes a cut of the rewards\n\nCentralization risks\n\nEthereum \"restaking\"\n\nRecently, the concept of Ethereum \"restaking\" has started to gain traction in the crypto community. Through protocols such as EigenLayer, users who own staked ETH can choose to \"restake\" their coins to help provide security to applications that function on top of the Ethereum network. Essentially, this means that staked ETH can be used to validate networks and services other than the Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to earn additional rewards on top of the standard ETH staking yield.\n\nCurrently, the most popular Ethereum restaking protocol is EigenLayer, which supports restaking both for ETH as well as liquid staking tokens such as stETH and rETH. Please keep in mind that restaking is a relatively new concept and doesn't have a long track record in real-world conditions. If you're using a protocol such as EigenLayer to restake your ETH, you could be taking on substantially more risk than if you just kept your coins staked normally.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014ETH staking is a good choice for long-term holders\n\nEthereum staking is worth it if you\u2019re an ETH holder and plan to hold your coins over the long term. This is already the position of many ETH holders, as Ethereum is widely perceived as one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold for the long term. Before deciding whether staking is right for you, make sure to check the current ETH staking rewards to see what kind of APR to expect.\n\nIf you\u2019re also interested in cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum, check out our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now."

        "content": "Finding the next big thing is the secret sauce for many investors, whether it\u2019s startups, stocks, bonds, commodities or crypto.\n\nObsession with discovering \u201cthe next Ethereum\u201d \u2014 or even an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d \u2014 then seems only natural.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts set the industry standard nearly a decade ago and have since inspired dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands, of rival networks.\n\nSolana is generally considered Ethereum\u2019s primary competitor right now. Comparing market values shows nothing has really come close to eclipsing Ethereum. Yet.\n\nIn fact, BNB Chain (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have come the closest over the past three years.\n\nThe market cap of BNB in April 2021 and late 2022 was about 33% of ether\u2019s (ETH).\n\nADA had up to 25% of ether\u2019s cap during the last bull market.\n\nSolana (SOL) set a new record relative to ether last month with 19%.\n\nRead more: It\u2019s a Solanaissance: These 5 charts will cure the Ethereum vibecession\n\nPrice ratios \u2014 dividing one assets\u2019 price by another and comparing over time \u2014 are commonly used to gauge the relative strength of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnalyzing price alone is problematic due to inflation and deflation rates of many top cryptocurrencies.\n\nSolana\u2019s market cap ratio against ether has retraced by a quarter since Christmas, now about 14%\n\nTake ATOM, the native asset for multichain ecosystem Cosmos. Over the past year, ATOM\u2019s circulating supply has swelled by a third and its token price has slipped by 20%, according to data from The Tie.\n\nMeanwhile, ATOM\u2019s market cap has grown 15%. Price alone implies ATOM is struggling, when it could be the market is simply absorbing fresh supply \u2014 and then some.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has almost 17% more circulating supply than this time last year. Its price has quadrupled across that period, while its market cap has nearly quintupled. Comparing only SOL\u2019s price would leave a chunk of the asset\u2019s growth unaccounted for.\n\nMuch of Solana\u2019s outsized growth over the past year can be attributed to its gradual recovery since the FTX debacle.\n\nRead more: Rebuilding trust: Solana\u2019s roadmap after a challenging year\n\nDisgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a significant investor in Solana and its ecosystem, leading SOL to collapse by up to 65% directly following FTX\u2019s implosion in late 2022. Ether fell less than 30% and completely recovered in about two months.\n\nMarket caps are just one metric by which to compare cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Total value locked, unique addresses, on-chain volumes, developer activity, fee revenues and transaction counts are among others. Each has its flaws.\n\nIn any case, Ethereum isn\u2019t exactly threatened right now. But going by market cap growth alone, Solana is well on track to become Ethereum\u2019s primary competitor over BNB.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin by 20%, but how long can ETH hold $2.5K support? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), rallied 20% between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11 but struggled to sustain the $2,600 level. The subsequent 3.5% correction down to $2,560 on Jan. 16 may have disappointed some bulls, but Ether's price has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 19.5% since Jan. 8. Such gaps are quite uncommon and last occurred in October 2022.\n\nEther investors question if the $2,500 level will hold, given that the most obvious drivers are not expected in the short term, namely the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the planned Ethereum network upgrades. From a bullish perspective, these events present an opportunity for Ether to further decouple from the remaining cryptocurrency market, but they also present a risk if it either backfires or is postponed.\n\nEther usually does not outperform Bitcoin by 15%\n\nThe price of Ether outperforming Bitcoin by 15% or higher in a week is not something common, at least in the past two years. Besides the high correlation between the two cryptocurrencies, 2023 was marked by disappointment with Ethereum's declining total value locked (TVL) and persistently high gas fees, paving the way for competing blockchains. Meanwhile, Bitcoin benefited from the anticipation of a spot ETF approval, especially after BlackRock joined the race in June 2023.\n\nIn fact, the latest instance happened 14 months ago as Ether's price rallied from $1,305 to $1,615 in the seven days leading to Oct. 29, 2022. After outperforming Bitcoin by 17%, the gap closed in the following 11 days as ETH crashed below $1,100 on Nov. 9, 2022.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), October 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nA single past instance should not serve as guidance for prices, especially considering November 2022 marked the downfall of the FTX exchange after reports of customer funds mismanagement and a potential $8 billion shortfall. A counter-example includes the 31 days between July 13, 2022, and Aug. 13, 2022, where Ether's price outperformed Bitcoin by 63%.\n\nEther/USD (blue) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange), August 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nETH rallied from $1,080 to $1,990 during the 31 days ending Aug. 13, 2022, and despite failing to break above $2,000, the gap relative to Bitcoin's price persisted in the following month. In essence, a much different type of price action from the short-lived outperformance in October 2022. More importantly, the gap continued even though the cryptocurrency market capitalization faced a correction, which is opposite from what one typically expects given Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nEthereum network activity signals strength and higher demand for ETH\n\nTo understand whether Ether has what it takes to hold the $2,500 support, one should analyze the Ethereum network activity, including its scaling solutions. Decentralized applications (DApps) are at the core of this smart contract-capable blockchain, thus diminishing use in terms of users and volumes is indicative of less demand for ETH.\n\nRelated: Spot Ethereum ETF not coming 'anytime soon,' says Mark Yusko\n\nTo assess network demand, one needs to analyze metrics related to DApp usage, as some projects including games, decentralized finance (DeFi), and nonfungible token marketplaces are not financially intensive, rendering the total value locked (TVL) metric irrelevant. Over the past 30 days, the top Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) have seen an average 26% decrease in the number of active addresses.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 30-day DApp volumes. Source: DappRadar\n\nOver the past 30 days, Ethereum DApps experienced a 41% gain in volume fueled by increases in Uniswap, Balancer, ParaSwap, and Aave. Consequently, even if one excludes the activity in Ethereum rollups, the base layer holds a 6 to 1 advantage versus its largest competitor, BNB Chain. That shows how bears' criticism toward Ethereum high fees is exaggerated in terms of dominance in the DeFi industry.\n\nBesides the strong on-chain activity, Ether's price could benefit from the \"Dencun\" hard fork, an upgrade that aims to increase data availability and reduce costs for rollup transactions. The test implementations are expected to initiate on Jan. 17. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, reinforcing the bullish momentum and the strength of the $2,500 price support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink Sees \u201cValue\u201d in Ethereum ETFs, Future of Tokenization\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has thrown his support behind an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling the asset management giant's growing interest in cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\"I see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\" Fink said. \"These ETFs are stepping stones towards tokenization, and I believe that's where we're headed.\"\n\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was among the several bitcoin ETFs that made their trading debut in the United States on Thursday, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval. IBIT accounted for a significant portion of the total trading volume that the ETFs collectively saw.\n\nFink's endorsement of an Ether ETF comes as BlackRock is looking to list a similar product for Ethereum's native token. This move would align with the company's broader strategy of embracing tokenization, which involves representing assets (real world or digital) in the form of tokens on the blockchain. Fink believes that tokenization can help eliminate issues related to money laundering and other forms of corruption. He also sees cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as an asset class that can provide protection against geopolitical risks.\n\n\"Bitcoin is similar to gold in that it's a scarce asset,\" Fink said. \"However, unlike gold, we're almost at the maximum supply of bitcoin that can be created.\"\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Wash trading volumes on Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces are the lowest they've been since May 2022, The Block Pro's Data Dashboard shows.\n\nNFT wash trading volumes on Ethereum marketplaces hit 1.8% on Jan. 9 and Jan. 13. That compares to 36.2% of trading volumes on Jan. 1, 2023, and it's also the lowest level since the 0.35% rate seen on May 1, 2022. The percentages refer to the portion of total USD volume associated with wash trading, a type of market manipulation in which individuals trade assets between themselves to artificially drive up price or the appearance of liquidity.\n\nStamping out wash trading\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe NFT platforms that have contributed the the most to wash trading in the past \u2014 LooksRare, X2Y2 and Blur \u2014 have all made changes that dissuade such activity further.\n\n\"We've started to see exchanges like LooksRare and X2Y2 begin to phase out some of their trading rewards programs,\" said The Block's Senior Research Analyst Rebecca Stevens. \"Blur was actively trying to filter wash traders from their airdrop, which has made wash trading less attractive. That, in addition to the valuations of several NFT marketplace tokens dropping, has caused overall wash trading to continue to decline.\""

        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 3 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH 1.41%) is a cryptocurrency that really doesn't get as much attention as it probably should. Over the past week, that's certainly true, with any sort of discussion around Ethereum dwarfed by the massive catalyst that hit the overall crypto sector -- the highly anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC 1.96%) ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThis key catalyst initially drove a significant amount of buying interest in Bitcoin but has since given way to outperformance for Ethereum. As it turns out, investors are clearly focused on the next crypto with a big catalyst on the horizon, which could certainly be the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs. Given the rather positive stance regulators have taken with Ethereum, market anticipation around such an event has driven Ethereum upward this week to levels not seen since spring 2022.\n\nNow, the question is whether this momentum can continue. For long-term investors, the question of where Ethereum may be in three years' time is one that is certainly worth trying to answer.\n\nNo one knows where any asset will ultimately end up over any given period of time, and I'm not going to suggest I have a crystal ball. However, I'll attempt to at least rationalize why I think Ethereum will more likely than not continue to move higher over the next three years and potentially surge past its previous highs.\n\nEthereum ETF hype should be taken seriously\n\nIt's not just crypto bros, talking heads, and pundits suggesting spot Ethereum ETFs could be on the horizon. There's been some rather compelling commentary from big-name investors around the potential approval of such investing vehicles, with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink opining on this topic.\n\nFink noted in a recent interview that he believes there's \"value\" in a spot Ethereum ETF being launched at some point. His view is that Ethereum is among the most viable assets within the crypto space, and while these aren't necessarily currencies by technical definition, they do carry value similar to other assets like gold. That's a rather widespread view among mainstream investors, and given the SEC's stance toward Bitcoin and Ethereum, if regulators take a similar view, it's certainly likely we could see spot Ethereum ETFs on the horizon.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Blackrock is among the companies that have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF already. So, perhaps there's some level of \"talking his book\" that investors need to price in. But given the interest major institutional investors have in promoting digital assets as a viable investment-grade option, Ethereum certainly has a future catalyst investors need to watch closely.\n\nTokenization likely to remain a key catalyst for Ethereum investors\n\nThe tokenization of real-world assets, or the ability to trade rights to physical assets such as art, collectibles, or even real estate, is a trend that's continuing to gain steam. In 2023, it's been estimated that the total value of all real-world assets that have been tokenized and trade on the blockchain has doubled, from around $1 billion at the start of 2023 to $2 billion at year's end. Notably, much of the trading volume in this nascent space has taken place on Ethereum's network, given its scale and ubiquity among users in the decentralized finance sector.\n\nEthereum's pole position as the leading blockchain for anything tied to decentralized finance (including tokenized real-world assets) benefits investors. Ethereum's token price has proven to be correlated over long periods of time to its network activity. Considering Ethereum's impressive ecosystem growth over the years, some investors have called into question where the next growth catalyst will come from. In the past, gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) alongside other financial services took center stage. But given the nascent nature of the tokenized real-world assets market, this could be the next growth catalyst that drives Ethereum's fundamentals, and its price, higher over time.\n\nDoes Ethereum have what it takes to make new highs over the next three years?\n\nLong-term investors can find plenty of other catalysts to focus on when it comes to Ethereum. After all, this ecosystem is vast and supports a great deal of the utility created in the crypto space. The launch of an ETF, continued growth in tokenization, and future Ethereum-network upgrades all remain key catalysts to watch over the next three years. However, who knows, maybe a bigger and more prominent catalyst will materialize. After all, this innovative space continues to evolve in rapid fashion, and I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nMy view is that over the next three years, Ethereum will continue to see the sort of volatility it's seen in the past. But given its fundamental tailwinds, and the potential for the macro- and monetary-policy environments to improve, I think it's far more likely that Ethereum makes new highs rather than multiyear lows."

        "title": "Ethereum: What Q1 2024 holds for investors - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Ethereum faced some turmoil after recent volatility muted bullish sentiment.\n\nDespite this, the usage and holder sentiment remained strong, which is good news for investors.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a drop in its estimated leverage ratio metric over the past month. This downward trend came at a time when prices managed to scale past significant resistance levels.\n\nThe volatility behind Bitcoin [BTC] was one contributing factor. BTC threatened to break out past $44.3k multiple times (and accomplished it twice), only to fall back within the range formation of the past six weeks.\n\nThis has inspired some doubt in the minds of ETH speculators and investors. Additionally, Ethereum has also lagged behind Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. AMBCrypto looked closer at relevant on-chain metrics and found that investors have reason to be confident.\n\nWhat are the implications of the Estimated Leverage Ratio falling?\n\nWhen the prices of ETH go up but the leverage ratio trends downward, it points toward reduced speculative activity and leverage trading. This could be due to diminished bullish sentiment. Alternatively, it could also be indicative of a rally that is driven by the spot markets and organic demand instead of Open Interest in the futures market.\n\nThe chart showed that the metric saw sharp drops in the past month. The 14-day simple moving average has trended downward. However, the leverage ratio saw a sizeable bounce after 6 January as prices rebounded higher.\n\nThe volatility in the past few weeks also likely forced leveraged traders to close their positions or liquidate them. This also likely led to a falling estimated leverage ratio.\n\nTo understand whether an accumulation of ETH in the spot markets was a significant contributing factor, AMBCrypto analyzed the exchange outflow metric.\n\nThe 7-day EMA of the exchange outflow was used to see if it trended upward noticeably. While there were individual spikes upward, it was not like the steady uptrend of October.\n\nThis suggested that the idea of a market-wide accumulation of ETH in the spot markets was not backed strongly by the outflows.\n\nThus far, the evidence points toward profit-taking and reduced risk-taking tendency in the Futures market. Once again, given the volatility of the past three weeks, the explanation held credibility. Yet, there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nThe reasons why investors could take heart from the recent developments\n\nTo highlight the market sentiment, AMBCrypto took a look at the Open Interest chart of Ethereum. Once again, the 7-day EMA gave a clearer picture of the current trends.\n\nIt showed that since the 9th of December, the OI has oscillated significantly instead of the uptrend it had been on since mid-September.\n\nThe decline in OI came alongside strong price drops, especially during the rejections that ETH faced at $2.4k throughout December.\n\nThe recent price action suggested that ETH has not found its local top. The multiple rejections at $2.4k were followed by a huge surge in prices after the BTC spot ETF approvals came.\n\nThis saw the prices touch the $2.7k mark, breaking the resistance zone at long last.\n\nTo understand if holders are confident of further gains, the MVRV ratio was analyzed, among other metrics. The MVRV ratio nearly reached December\u2019s highs during the rally.\n\nMore importantly, it remained well above zero to show that a large amount of holders were in profit at press time.\n\nThe Weighted Sentiment also saw a strong peak during the price rally, but has fallen since then. The Active Addresses has steadily trended higher in the past two months, which indicated increased engagement and potential demand.\n\nAdditionally, the transaction volume (30-day SMA) has not fallen dramatically either. It has maintained a roughly steady level in the past two months and saw occasional large peaks as activity surged enormously.\n\nOnce again, this was a sign of steady network usage.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nEven though the price volatility hurt futures traders and diminished the bullish sentiment, the on-chain metrics showed that it was business as usual.\n\nThe high MVRV ratio was encouraging, even though the exchange outflows were not particularly convincing. This is why Ethereum\u2019s prices are expected to climb higher in Q1 2024."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA previously inactive Ethereum address holding a substantial amount of ETH has suddenly become active.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, this pre-mine Ethereum address, containing 200 ETH (equivalent to $506,140), has shown activity after lying dormant for over eight and a half years.\n\nOther recent transfers\n\nOften, the activation of long-dormant cryptocurrency addresses stirs speculation and interest within the crypto industry. Such movements are typically linked to early adopters or investors who had mined or purchased cryptocurrencies like Ethereum during their initial phases.\n\nThe recent activation of this address is not an isolated incident. In December 2023, a similar pre-mine address with 11,640 ETH resumed activity after 8.4 years.\n\nEarlier, in October and September of the same year, addresses containing 2,000 ETH and 200 ETH respectively, were reactivated after over eight years of inactivity.\n\nThese instances suggest a pattern where early investors or holders, potentially re-evaluating their investments or deciding to cash in on their holdings, trigger such movements.\n\nThe Ethereum price performance\n\nThe activation of these dormant addresses comes at a time when Ethereum's market performance remains volatile.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $2,515.28, witnessing a minor increase of 1.2% after a significant price drop.\n\nDespite minor fluctuations, Ethereum maintains a significant market capitalization of approximately $301.7 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $17.9 billion."

ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $2,420 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nIn the past few weeks, Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,320 resistance zone against the US Dollar. ETH price climbed above the $2,400 and $2,500 resistance levels.\n\nFinally, it tested the $2,720 resistance zone. A high was formed near $2,717 before there was a downside correction. There was a move below the $2,600 support zone. The price even traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,167 swing low to the $2,717 high.\n\nETH is now trading above $2,450 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key declining channel forming with support at $2,420 on the 4-hour chart.\n\nOn the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $2,550 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,580 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,600 zone. A clear move above the $2,580 and $2,600 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $2,720.\n\nAny more gains could even send the price toward the $2,850 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $2,440 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,167 swing low to the $2,717 high.\n\nThe next major support is now near the $2,400 level. A break below the $2,400 support could push the price to $2,280. If the bulls fail to protect the $2,280 support, the price might decline toward $2,165.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly trading above $2,400 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, Ether price could continue to move down if it breaks the $2,420 support zone.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $2,440, followed by the $2,420 zone.\n\nKey Resistance Levels \u2013 $2,560 and $2,600."

This uniqueness and versatility make it essential to understand how to buy Ethereum, especially using handy tools like PayPal.\n\nBenefits and risks of buying Ethereum with PayPal\n\nHere\u2019s the essential stuff:\n\nBenefits Risks Using PayPal to buy Ethereum means you don\u2019t have to figure out a brand-new platform for purchasing crypto. Not every crypto exchange is PayPal-friendly, so your options might be a bit limited. Most of us have used PayPal at some point, right? That familiarity reduces the learning curve. Using PayPal might be convenient, but it sometimes comes at a price. PayPal comes with a reputation. It\u2019s been in the digital payment game for a while and offers robust security measures. While PayPal has its protections, remember, the crypto world is like the Wild West. Always stay vigilant\n\nBenefits and risks of using PayPal to buy ETH\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Buying Ethereum with PayPal\n\nTogether, we\u2019ll dissect how to buy Ethereum with PayPal, making it as simple as grabbing a coffee with a friend.\n\nSetting Up a PayPal Account\n\nBefore you can grab some Ethereum with PayPal, you\u2019ve got to set up your PayPal account. It\u2019s easy-peasy:\n\nSigning up for a PayPal account. Head to the website, hit \u2018Sign Up,\u2019 and follow the prompts. Linking a bank account or credit/debit card. This allows smooth transactions. No hiccups when you\u2019re ready to make your purchase. Verifying your identity and account. This might sound tedious, but it\u2019s for safety. A few extra minutes here can save you a world of trouble later on.\n\nPurchasing Ethereum from the PayPal app\n\nHow to use the PayPal app to buy ETH:\n\nEver wondered about the quickest ways to turn your money into Ethereum? Look no further than the PayPal app. Here\u2019s your bite-sized instruction:\n\nOpen the app. Look for \u201cCrypto\u201d on your dashboard. Out of all the cryptos listed, click on Ethereum or \u2018ETH.\u2019 Tap \u2018Buy,\u2019 enter the amount, and select your payment method. Your PayPal balance or linked account will do the trick. Confirm your transaction, and you\u2019re all set!\n\nNote the fees: There\u2019s a little catch. Trading Ethereum using PayPal isn\u2019t entirely free. Always be aware of the spread and transaction fees. It\u2019s a small price for the convenience of using a platform you trust.\n\nChoosing a cryptocurrency exchange that supports PayPal\n\nYou want to choose a cryptocurrency exchange that won\u2019t disappoint. Look for sites with a strong reputation, great trading volume, and a solid number of users.\n\nComparing fees and supported cryptocurrencies\n\nNot all exchanges are created equal. Some might offer Bitcoin and Litecoin but not Ethereum. Others might have hefty fees. Always weigh your options and consider the spread.\n\nReading user reviews and checking for security measures\n\nWould you buy something without reading reviews? Browse through user feedback and ensure your chosen exchange takes security seriously.\n\nSelecting a suitable exchange for Ethereum purchases\n\nAfter researching, choose an exchange that aligns with your needs, whether you need lower fees, a wider variety of crypto assets, or a user-friendly interface.\n\nRegistering and verifying your account\n\nThis is pretty straightforward. Just like any other sign-up process, but ensure your password is robust!\n\nCompleting identity verification (KYC) requirements\n\nTo prevent fraudulent activities, most cryptocurrency exchanges will ask for some proof of identity. Don\u2019t fret; it\u2019s a one-time hassle. Once you complete the Know Your Customer process, you\u2019ll remove all limits on your account.\n\nSetting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security\n\nThis is a no-brainer. It\u2019s like adding an extra lock to your digital funds. Use Google Authenticator or similar tools to set up this security feature.\n\nAdding PayPal as a payment method\n\nHere\u2019s where the magic happens. Link your PayPal account to your chosen exchange, verify the connection, and monitor potential fees or limits.\n\nMaking a purchase\n\nFind and navigate to Ethereum on the exchange, confirm the transaction, and review all details. Remember, double-checking never hurts.\n\nSecurity best practices\n\nYour digital assets are like precious jewels. Safeguard them with two-factor authentication (2FA). Consider hardware wallets, often described as a digital vault for your cryptos.\n\nAlways be diligent, update your passwords, and remember: if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nTips for successful transactions\n\nBe watchful: Keep an eye out for favorable exchange rates.\n\nKeep an eye out for favorable exchange rates. Stay informed: Impulse buying might hurt your finances. Always do your research.\n\nImpulse buying might hurt your finances. Always do your research. Broaden your horizons: For bigger amounts, ponder over alternative payment methods like debit cards or bank transfers.\n\nFor bigger amounts, ponder over alternative payment methods like debit cards or bank transfers. Keep the record: Never overlook tracking your transactions. It\u2019s not just good practice but essential for tax reasons.\n\nSo You\u2019ve Bought Ethereum, What To Do Next?\n\nNow that you\u2019ve secured some Ethereum, the real journey begins.\n\nSecure your Ethereum\n\nCongratulations on buying your first Ether! Now it\u2019s time to keep it safe.\n\nMany beginners leave their assets on a trading platform, thinking it\u2019s the safest option. But that exposes you to unnecessary risks. Exchanges may get hacked or closed down, and you may lose your funds.\n\nThe golden rule? Don\u2019t leave your Ethereum on an exchange for too long. Consider moving it to a cold wallet away from online fraud and hacking attempts.\n\nUse Ethereum\n\nNow, owning Ethereum offers a plethora of possibilities. You could just hold it and watch as market forces play out. But have you considered staking?\n\nIt\u2019s a fabulous way to earn interest on your Ethereum holdings. Or perhaps use it for purchases in the ever-growing list of outlets that accept Ether.\n\nAnd if you have an appetite for risk, there\u2019s always trading to increase your holdings. The options are diverse, so choose what suits your comfort level.\n\nDiversify your holdings\n\nA piece of advice\u2014never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying is key. While Ethereum is a great asset, spreading out your investments is wise.\n\nAim to include at least five different types of cryptocurrencies in your portfolio. This spreads the risk and exposes you to market changes.\n\nStay informed\n\nThe crypto world is dynamic. Regulations get updated, market trends shift, and new coins emerge almost daily.\n\nThe best traders and investors are always in the loop. Staying informed ensures you\u2019re ready to adapt to these changes, optimizing your chances of success.\n\nWrapping Up the Ethereum Journey\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to reflect on our journey together. I\u2019ve walked you through the ins and outs and showed you how to buy Ethereum with PayPal.\n\nDiving into the crypto world, especially making your first purchase, can feel like exploring a new city. Luckily, getting some ETH with PayPal is straightforward. If you select the right exchange, you shouldn\u2019t face issues.\n\nStill, be mindful of potential risks and focus on maintaining your account safe with strong passwords and 2FA. Secure your Ethereum on a hardware wallet and store it or trade it on the exchange if you\u2019re looking for some thrill.\n\nSo, as you move forward, remember to stay curious, stay informed, and, most importantly, enjoy the ride!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has reportedly engaged in another sell-off of Ethereum (ETH), the largest altocoin.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, the Ethereum Foundation transferred 100 ETH, valued at approximately $253,000, to an unknown address and subsequently received an equivalent amount in DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.\n\nEthereum Foundation's asset holdings\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a key non-profit organization behind the Ethereum blockchain, maintains a substantial portfolio of crypto assets.\n\nRecent transactions suggest that the foundation's wallet labeled \"Grant Provider: 0x9ee\" has made notable moves involving ETH.\n\nDespite the latest sell-off, the Ethereum Foundation's holdings remain robust, with over 312,000 ETH still in its possession.

        "title": "Ethereum Classic Maintains 32% Steady Rise \u2013 What\u2019s Driving ETC Up? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The recent approval of the first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, triggering a significant surge in various altcoins, with Ethereum Classic (ETC) taking the spotlight.\n\nOften overshadowed by its more well-known sibling, Ethereum, ETC has emerged as the clear winner in the aftermath of the groundbreaking news, experiencing an impressive surge of over 31% in the past seven days.\n\nEthereum Classic Trading Volume Up\n\nSince the SEC\u2019s approval of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF on January 10th, Ethereum Classic has skyrocketed by a staggering 30%, currently maintaining a trading value around $26. This meteoric rise has been accompanied by a remarkable 270% increase in trading volume, soaring to a substantial $1.8 billion.\n\nSuch robust figures underscore a palpable surge in investor confidence, suggesting the potential for further gains in the near future.\n\nWhile Bitcoin itself witnessed a modest price increase, briefly touching $47,000, Ethereum stole the limelight by breaking a 20-month barrier and surpassing $2,600.\n\nEthereum Classic currently trading at $26.36 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThis remarkable 10% surge within a mere 24 hours has positioned Ethereum at its highest value since May 2022. Analysts attribute this impressive performance to Ethereum\u2019s robust underlying technology and recent network upgrades, cementing its status as a favorable option for investors after Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF is not the sole catalyst for this altcoin rally; the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for later in the year, is also playing a pivotal role in bolstering bullish sentiment.\n\nETC price action in the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko\n\nThis event, occurring approximately every four years, involves a reduction in the number of newly minted Bitcoins and has historically coincided with price appreciation in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe confluence of these factors has created a perfect storm for Ethereum Classic, propelling it towards the coveted $30 mark.\n\nETC Strong Performance\n\nIndustry experts anticipate that this milestone may be achieved soon, fueled by Ethereum Classic\u2019s impressive trading volume and market capitalization, which has surged by 34% to cross the $4 billion mark since the ETF news broke.\n\nHowever, amidst the euphoria surrounding this surge, it remains crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the impending halving event offer promising prospects, unforeseen factors can swiftly alter market dynamics.\n\nThe recent ascent of Ethereum Classic serves as a compelling testament to the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market and the substantial impact of major regulatory decisions.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to observe how other altcoins respond to these developments and whether Ethereum Classic can sustain its lead in this post-ETF era.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Classic surges as ETF speculation continues - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) experienced a 37% increase over the past seven days.\n\nObservers note that the surge is likely due to investors anticipating that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will consider applications for an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). On Jan. 10, the agency approved spot Bitcoin ETFs,\n\nHowever, SEC Chair Gary Gensler cautioned that the BTC ETF green light should not be interpreted as a signal of the agency\u2019s willingness to give ETH the same treatment.\n\nStill, Ethereum Classic witnessed a surge of over 35% this week. The altcoin is exchanging hands for $26.65 at press time, with a market cap of $3.8 billion, per data from CoinGecko. This upward movement has been credited to heightened trading volumes and the hype surrounding Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nThe rapid ascent of Ethereum Classic seems somewhat inexplicable given the timing. Some skeptics argue that ETC\u2019s swift climb is in anticipation of an upcoming hard fork later this month.\n\nThis hard fork is speculated to enhance the alignment of the network\u2019s EVM with Ethereum\u2019s, potentially attracting projects to collaborate with the chain.\n\nAdding to the context, the network\u2019s hashrate surged to all-time highs after Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake in late 2022. Former Ethereum miners redirected their GPU mining rigs to Ethereum Classic, seeking an alternative revenue stream, thereby contributing to the network\u2019s heightened hashrate.\n\nDespite Ethereum Classic\u2019s post-Merge hash rate remaining relatively stable, the network registers only about 30,000 transactions per day, roughly the baseline for Bitcoin Cash. Nevertheless, Ethereum Classic\u2019s hashrate is less than 15% of what Ethereum recorded just before the Merge.\n\nIn contrast, ETHPoW, the hard fork of Ethereum initiated around the Merge to compete with Ethereum Classic, currently operates with approximately one-tenth of the latter\u2019s hashrate.\n\nHowever, market reactions appeared to anticipate the SEC\u2019s unofficial announcement, selling the news prematurely, while simultaneously speculating on potential Ethereum ETFs.\n\nLarry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has also expressed support for the idea of introducing an Ethereum-based ETF, following the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF.\n\nYou might also like: Vanguard ceases support for Bitcoin futures ETF purchase\n\nPaving the way for ETH approval\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF enables ordinary investors to tap into the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without direct purchase. This milestone decision holds potential implications for the approval of spot Ether ETFs in the future.\n\nThe green light for Bitcoin ETFs could position Bitcoin as a possible fixture in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans, fostering mainstream acceptance.\n\nSince the announcement, Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced immense volatility, and the onset of 2024 witnessed it surpassing $47,000 marking its highest level in nearly two years, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nMajor asset managers like BlackRock expressing interest have spurred other asset managers to follow suit.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs encompasses several companies, including Ark Invest and 21 Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Hashdex, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and VanEck. Some of these ETFs commenced trading shortly after approval, with Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity dominating trading volumes.\n\nLooking ahead, the SEC is reportedly expected to make decisions on spot Ether ETF applications starting in May. BlackRock, along with Invesco, Ark, VanEck, and Grayscale are among the firms seeking approval.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

However, Yusko disagrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably say less than 50/50,\u201d he told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview.\n\nDespite the recent Bitcoin ETF approval, Yusko argued that the SEC remains broadly hostile toward cryptocurrencies, as was suggested by the agency\u2019s head, Gary Gensler, in his message on the day of the approval.\n\nAnother obstacle, according to Yusko, is that the SEC may still regard Ether as a security \u2014 unlike Bitcoin, which is considered a commodity.\n\nSwitching topics to Bitcoin, Yusko argued that the approval of the spot ETF will dramatically reduce BTC\u2019s volatility and, therefore, its potential returns. Investors should welcome that, according to Yusko, as it\u2019s a sign of the maturation of the asset.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t invented for day trading,\u201d he said about Bitcoin. \u201cIt was invented to allow you and I to exchange value without asking permission.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about the long-term impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, check out the full interview on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "title": "US ETF market heats up with Ethereum: what you need to know - crypto.news",
        "content": "The excitement over spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs has calmed, but a fresh wave of enthusiasm is emerging. Could the prospect of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF propel the crypto market to new heights?\n\nIn the United States, competition is unfolding for supremacy in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, with a particular emphasis on prominent crypto assets. While the initial funds, both operational and awaiting regulatory approval, were exclusively linked to Bitcoin, a new wave of ETFs has seized the spotlight. These latest offerings enable investors to speculate on the price movements of ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhy does the market need cryptocurrency ETFs?\n\nThe launch of the first ETFs pegged to the price of Ethereum occurred two years following the introduction of the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States \u2013 the Bitcoin Strategy ETF from ProShares, with shares traded on exchanges under the ticker BITO. At that time, the launch coincided with the pinnacle of excitement surrounding the crypto market, marked by historical record highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The landscape has evolved somewhat since then: the crypto industry is currently grappling with substantial regulatory scrutiny globally, and the trading volume on crypto exchanges has dwindled to its lowest point in three years.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum ETF becomes most attractive prospect, poll shows\n\nIn the context of the cryptocurrency market, ETFs enable investors to track the price movements of coins without directly owning them. Rather than navigating exchanges and wallets independently, investors can purchase ETF shares through standard brokerage accounts. This investment approach is more prevalent among clients of management companies or pension funds in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to several Bitcoin ETFs, specifically those based on futures contracts. Unlike spot ETFs, futures ETFs do not offer direct ownership of cryptocurrency and do not entail its delivery (i.e., buying it on the market). Instead, they track futures contracts that forecast their price at a future date. Several market players introduced Ethereum futures funds on October 2, 2023.\n\nProShares, Bitwise, and VanEck, among others, debuted their Ethereum funds after receiving regulatory approval to launch them. A few hours before the opening of the American market and the commencement of fund trading, the price of the ETH cryptocurrency surged by almost 5%. However, during the trading session, it started to decline, and within a day, it had dropped even lower, erasing all the previous gains.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nDo we need an Ethereum ETF?\n\nInvestor interest in Ethereum could reignite if its prices recover to previous highs, particularly considering that many prefer Ether to Bitcoin due to numerous options for utilizing its blockchain as infrastructure for various projects and financial services.\n\nBack in May 2023, a few months before the launch of their Ethereum-ETF, VanEck analysts published an extensive report in which they shared the results of a study on the technical component of the Ethereum blockchain and its prospects. Based on their calculations and the rationale for the demand for the ETH cryptocurrency as \u201cfuel\u201d for future infrastructure, they predicted a range of future prices for the coin.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nAccording to their estimates, by 2030, the price of ETH under the \u201cbase\u201d scenario will be $11,848, and under the \u201cbullish\u201d scenario, the coin will exceed $51,000. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario and with a lack of proper demand, the ETH exchange rate, according to their estimates, may drop to almost $300.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nWho has applied for Ethereum ETFs?\n\nIn August 2023, crypto asset manager Valkyrie announced the conversion of its Bitcoin futures ETF into a fund that invests in Ethereum futures. At the beginning of October, several market players, including ProShares, Bitwise, and VanEck, launched futures ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nIn September 2023, entrepreneur Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest also applied for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn November 2023, the world\u2019s largest investment firm, BlackRock, filed with the SEC to list a spot ETF on Ethereum.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones decision on Grayscale\u2019s application for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nWill applications for spot Ethereum ETFs be approved?\n\n\n\nAnalysts believe that spot Ethereum ETFs could also be approved within a year. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said he does not see a scenario in which Bitcoin ETFs will be authorized but Ethereum ETFs will not.\n\nThe expert added that he estimates the likelihood that the SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs before May is 70%. Lawyer Joe Carlasar believes the agency will do this before the end of the year, but \u201cthe process will take longer than people expect.\u201d\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart is confident that the SEC will \u201cgive the green light\u201d to spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is now expecting the launch of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nHowever, SEC Chair Gary Gensler is exercising caution on Ethereum. While acknowledging the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, he emphasized that this was specific to Bitcoin as a non-security commodity token.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones deadline for decision on Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Crypto intelligence platform DappRadar says user activity on one Ethereum (ETH) challenger exploded in 2023 as decentralized applications (DApps) saw remarkable growth during the period.\n\nAccording to DappRadar\u2019s yearly industry report, smart contract platform Near (NEAR) recorded 302,000 new unique active wallets (UAWs) last year, marking a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 1,902%, the most out of any chain.\n\nEnterprise-grade blockchain Klaytn (KLAY) and layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) rank next to Near as the networks with the highest UAW increase gain with 73,000 new UAWs, representing a 1,099% increase, and 88,000 UAWs, a 624% increase, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn terms of chain performance, Near, Klaytn, and Arbitrum were the top gainers in UAW percentage increase. They had also a good performance looking with their token, as Near had an increase of 200% since the beginning of the year, Klaytn a 20% and Arbitrum a 32% increase since its launch in March 2023.\u201d\n\nConversely, DappRadar says Ethereum rival Solana (SOL) recorded only 65,000 new UAWs in 2023, a 76% drop on a year-over-year basis. Web3-focused blockchain Hive (HIVE) saw 77,000 new UAWs, representing a 68% drop, as per the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana experienced a rough start of the year, influenced by its association with the FTX fallout. However, the Solana ecosystem saw an impressive recovery during the last months of 2023. Hive, primarily hosting the trading card game Splinterlands, also had a difficult year, missing financial targets and reporting significant losses.\u201d\n\nOverall, DappRadar says the DApp industry had a good run in 2023 with a 124% YoY increase in UAWs and ending the year with an average of 4.2 million daily UAWs.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, the DApp industry surpassed all expectations, and reinforced the notion that it\u2019s an enduring and evolving part of the global financial and technological landscape.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "After Bitcoin Euphoria: All Eyes on Ethereum ETFs, Will They Be Approved? - Blockonomi",
        "content": "The recent flurry of activity around Bitcoin spot ETF approvals has the crypto world buzzing about what could be next. All signs point to Ethereum being the next major digital asset in focus for exchange-traded fund providers seeking regulatory approval.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum (ETH) has significantly outperformed Bitcoin in recent days, indicating traders are anticipating potential approval of spot ETFs for ETH.\n\nApproval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has increased odds for ETH spot ETF approval, as SEC used similar logic regarding fraud/manipulation impacting both spot and futures prices.\n\nTraders are accumulating other Ethereum-related assets like layer-2 tokens in anticipation of spot ETH ETF approval being next big catalyst.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink sees value in an Ethereum ETF, giving confidence to the prospect. Multiple major firms have filed for ETH spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, some predict ETH spot ETF approval could face delays due to regulatory concerns around classifying Ether as a security rather than commodity.\n\nEthereum has handily outperformed Bitcoin in recent trading, surging over 10% versus Bitcoin since fake news of a BTC spot ETF approval earlier this month. According to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock, this suggests traders are operating under the assumption that Ethereum will be the next cryptocurrency to be granted a spot ETF.\n\nThe logic follows the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) own reasoning in finally approving Bitcoin spot ETF products. In its approval order, the SEC stated that potential manipulation impacting Bitcoin\u2019s spot markets would likely have a similar effect on related futures markets. Given that Ethereum already has a futures-based ETF trading in the US, the door seems open for regulators to apply the same thinking to a spot ETF tied directly to Ether.\n\nThe market enthusiasm extends beyond just Ethereum itself. Other crypto assets related to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem have also seen traders piling in over the past week. This includes layer-2 tokens associated with Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions as well as tokens tied to liquid staking protocols. With the expectation that approval of spot ETFs tracking digital assets can provide a significant catalyst for prices, the broader community is positioning for an Ether spot ETF green light.\n\nAnd that approval may have just gotten more likely following comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. The head of the world\u2019s largest asset manager told CNBC he sees value in an Ethereum ETF. BlackRock has already started the process of applying for such a product.\n\nMajor financial powers like Fidelity, Ark Invest, and VanEck have also thrown their hats in the ring with filings for spot Ether ETFs. In fact, VanEck has the earliest deadline for a decision from the SEC, coming up on May 23rd of this year. Some analysts give over a 70% probability of approval by that date.\n\nHowever, there are also notes of caution from other market experts. Investment bank TD Cowen predicts delays may be ahead, with the SEC likely taking a very cautious approach even in light of the Bitcoin approvals. The key question centers around whether regulators will classify Ether similarly to Bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security. If the latter, it introduces more complexity around applying standards meant for exchange-traded products around traditional securities. Until the SEC gains further confidence from observing recently approved Bitcoin ETFs, an Ethereum product may remain sidelined despite industry pressure.\n\nYet with mounting options for institutional and retail investment gaining SEC approval, the path ahead seems increasingly positive. While delays may yet materialize, an Ethereum ETF seems destined to arrive sooner rather than later. Once open for trading by the masses, such a product would arguably be an even greater catalyst for growth and mainstream adoption than Bitcoin has enjoyed thus far.\n\nAs the crypto community shifts attention to the next likely milestone, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Ethereum to fully emerge from Bitcoin\u2019s shadow and cement its status as the leading smart contract platform."

        "content": "There has been a steady fall in active validator count on Ethereum since the 4th of January.\n\nETH accumulation persists among coin traders.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network has witnessed a sharp drop in active validators, hitting a year-to-date low on the 12th of January, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nAMBCrypto found that the decline began on the 4th of January, the same day that the total number of validators that exited the network\u2019s validator pool voluntarily climbed to an all-time high of 17,821.\n\nThis trend emerged just a day after Matrixport, a prominent crypto investment services provider, predicted a potential rejection of all Bitcoin ETF applications by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nFollowing the report\u2019s publication, the prices of leading assets plummeted, causing over $500 million in liquidations.\n\nMany feared that Matrixport\u2019s predictions might be accurate and result in a severe market decline, hence the surge in the daily count of validators that left the Ethereum network on the 4th of January.\n\nWhile the daily active validator count on the PoS chain has begun to rise, it still sits at low levels recorded in December.\n\nAs of the 14th of January, the active validator count on Ethereum totaled 897,121. Likewise, with the rise in ETH\u2019s price post-ETF approval, voluntary exits from the chain have reduced.\n\nOn the 14th of January, only 124 validators left the network, data from Glassnode showed.\n\nBullish momentum intensifies\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $2,517, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The coin\u2019s price has risen by 15% in the last week.\n\nIts price movements assessed on a weekly chart revealed that bullish pressure persisted. This was gleaned from ETH\u2019s momentum indicators, showing that traders have continued accumulating the altcoin.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were spotted at 70.37 and 87.02, respectively. These levels suggested that buying pressure exceeded coin sell-offs despite the recent uptick.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt is, however, key to note that these RSI and MFI values typically indicate an overheated market. Hence, a minor drawback in ETH\u2019s value should be anticipated.\n\nETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remained in an uptrend and positioned above the zero line at press time. Returning a value of 0.16, ETH\u2019s CMF showed a steady supply of liquidity required to sustain a price rally."

        "content": "Staked Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals hit a record high last week.\n\nThe surge appears to be heavily linked to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nDespite the mass-staked ETH withdrawals, the network impact is expected to be minimal.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the Ethereum (ETH) network has experienced a spike in validator exits. Capping off this trend last week, this surge in validator exits culminated in the network recording over 650,000 ETH in staked ETH withdrawals, the largest amount of redemption in a single week since withdrawals were enabled with the Shanghai upgrade. The record withdrawal begs the question of what is driving this surge.\n\nCelsius Bankruptcy Proceedings at the Helm?\n\nDisclosing last week\u2019s record-staked ETH outflows on Monday, January 15, 21.co researcher Tom Wan shared Dune Analytics data showing that bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment were the largest contributors to the withdrawal spike in the past week. Specifically, withdrawals directly attributed to Celsius and Figment accounted for over 85% of staked ETH withdrawals, with 206.9k ETH and 356.4k ETH, respectively.\n\nChart showing staked ETH withdrawals by entity. Source: Tom Wan\n\nWhile the data on face value suggests Figment clients and not Celsius are the primary drivers of the recent surge in staked ETH withdrawals, Wan has previously suggested that the reverse is more likely the case. Wan had noted that Celsius was also a Figment client with at least 197,000 ETH staked through the platform. As such, the analyst suggested that it was likely that the bulk of the ETH being withdrawn by Figment belongs to Celsius.\n\nThe move follows plans revealed by the bankrupt lender earlier in the month to unstake ETH to offset restructuring costs and settle creditors. At the time of writing, Arkham Intelligence data suggests that Celsius holds over 580,000 ETH worth a staggering $1.4 billion at current rates.\n\nUnderstanding The Impact of Celsius\u2019 Staking Withdrawals on Ethereum\n\nCelsius\u2019s staked ETH withdrawals are unlikely to cause dire consequences for the Ethereum network aside from increasing the unstaking wait time due to Ethereum\u2019s \u201cchurn limit,\u201d which limits the number of validators that can exit or enter the network to 2,925 per day.\n\nDespite technically reducing the validator count and amount of ETH securing the network, the Ethereum staking contract still holds over 36 million ETH, per Etherscan data at the time of writing.\n\nAt the same time, while Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings place selling pressure on the price of ETH, the firm is unlikely to unload its holdings all at once as it would also impact the value of its holdings.\n\nAmid the looming selling pressure, ETH\u2019s price continues to hold steady.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade should scale the platform\u2019s transaction processing capacity.\n\nThe introduction of Proto-Danksharding and stateless clients will allow Ethereum to process data more efficiently.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Core developers have often rejected efforts to scale Bitcoin.\n\nFrom the beginning, Ethereum (ETH) has been defined as much by its differences as by its similarities to Bitcoin. In line with Vitalik Buterin\u2019s vision, Ethereum had upgradability in mind from the outset. In contrast, convincing Bitcoin node operators to support even small changes to the way the platform functions has proven almost impossible.\n\nAlthough the process hasn\u2019t always run smoothly, over the years, Ethereum developers, node operators and token holders have generally achieved the consensus needed to implement upgrades. Currently expected to occur in mid-2024, the next major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, promises to significantly scale the platform\u2019s transaction processing capacity.\n\nHow Dencun Can Boost Scalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade aims to enhance scalability through two key innovations: Proto-Danksharding and stateless clients.\n\nProto-Danksharding introduces \u201cdata blobs\u201d. These store compressed transaction data off-chain, freeing up valuable block space so Ethereum can support a higher volume of transactions. Blob transaction data is also self-deleting, reducing the blockchain\u2019s long-term storage requirements.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade marks a significant milestone in Ethereum's evolution! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\u2070\n\nGet ready by exploring our Ethereum Evolved: #Dencun Upgrade series, starting with an in-depth look at EIP-6780 and EIP-5656.https://t.co/ryHUFiFzBf \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) January 11, 2024\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will also lay the groundwork for the introduction of full Danksharding in later upgrades. This promises to further boost throughput by distributing data processing across validators.\n\nLike Proto-Danksharding, the idea behind stateless clients is to streamline the way Ethereum handles data.\n\nUnder the current model, full nodes store Ethereum\u2019s entire state history, from Genesis right up to the present day. Post-Dencun, however, stateless clients won\u2019t need to process the full state history and will be able to verify transactions using cryptographic proofs.\n\nBitcoin Developers Remain Committed to Satoshi\u2019s Vision\n\nUnlike Ethereum, which has a history of sometimes-radical forks and upgrades, Bitcoin has been remarkably resistant to change, even for proposed upgrades that would scale its capacity.\n\nBitcoin Core v26.0 was released!\n\nIt is available from: https://t.co/wXCpf4qscl\n\nRelease annoucement: https://t.co/2oLlmkYWlT \u2014 Bitcoin Core Project (@bitcoincoreorg) December 6, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core is hardly monolithic, the open-source software remains true to the basic design principles laid out in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original white paper and implemented by the first generation of Bitcoin (BTC) clients.\n\nOver the years, Core developers have adhered to a singleminded and ultimately rigid vision for Bitcoin, an approach that appears to have the support of the majority of node operators, who have mostly rejected attempts to unseat Bitcoin Core as the blockchain\u2019s preeminent software client.\n\nThe Bitcoin Block Size Debate\n\nObservers can see Bitcoin Core\u2019s general resistance to significant change in the debate over Bitcoin\u2019s block size, which the software has capped at 1 MB since 2010. In contrast with Ethereum\u2019s determined march toward ever greater scalability, the block size limit imposed by Bitcoin Core constrains Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing capacity to a maximum of around five transactions per second.\n\nBefore 2017, a number of alternative Bitcoin implementations broke with Bitcoin Core to increase the maximum block size. The divergence, which aimed to increase capcity, ultimately led to a hard fork. Software clients that supported higher block sizes branched off to form Bitcoin Cash, an alternative blockchain that is more focused on everyday payments than the core network from which it split.\n\nInteresting take on BTC SEGWIT \ud83e\udd14\n\nI wonder what other changes that are architecturally useful for Adam. pic.twitter.com/EyNDZ3WKhI \u2014 cryptotweek (@cryptotweek1) January 15, 2024\n\nAs for Bitcoin Core, developers ultimately settled on a compromise. Rather than increasing the maximum block size, the software has introduced a concept known as Segregated Witness (SegWit). Under the previous model, each block consisted of roughly 35% transaction data and 65% signature data. Post-SegWit, however, signature data is stored off-chain. In turn, this has effectively tripled the amount of transaction data that can be inscribed on each block."

        "content": "The native utility token of a South Korean Ethereum (ETH) rival is rallying after news of a new blockchain merger proposal.\n\nLayer-2 smart contract platform Klaytn (KLAY) leaped from a 24-hour-low of $0.189 to a high of $0.262, a 39% gain, following the announced proposal of a merger to create \u201cAsia\u2019s leading blockchain system.\u201d\n\nKLAY has since stabilized and consolidated, trading for $0.219 at time of writing, still up nearly 17% in the last 24 hours.\n\nKlaytn is a public blockchain platform aiming to provide a user-friendly interface and experience. Klaytn is owned by South Korean internet and mobile provider Kakao. KLAY is the native token and medium of exchange within Klaytn\u2019s blockchain ecosystem, used to pay transaction fees and staking.\n\nEarlier today, Klaytn and Finschia, an independent non-profit aimed at expanding Web3 and blockchain technologies, announced a joint proposal to merge blockchains.\n\n\u201cKlaytn Foundation, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of South Korea\u2019s leading Layer 1 blockchain Klaytn, has teamed up with Finschia Foundation, the operator of the Finschia blockchain developed by LINE Tech Plus, to propose the merger of the two existing blockchains into a new mainnet. The two blockchain foundations will submit the integration proposal to their respective governance members today to open up the proposal for discussion, and voting will take place from 26 January to 2 February 2024.\u201d\n\nAccording to the announcement, the merger will aim to consolidate blockchains and combine the blockchains\u2019 strengths, all while simultaneously creating Asia\u2019s largest blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe proposal aims to create a new industry leader with a technologically superior blockchain that supports both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and CosmWasm, as well as one of the largest ecosystems of DApps (decentralized applications) and users in Asia. The two foundations will also merge into one organization, combining their technology, services, and business networks which include Kakao, LINE, and many other strategic partners.\u201d\n\nAccording to the proposal, holders of Klaytn and Finschia\u2019s native tokens, KLAY and FNSA, will be able to swap out their old tokens for new native tokens once they are issued.\n\n\u201cDrawing on the combined experience of both foundations, the proposed tokenomics for this new native coin will focus heavily on delivering sustainable value creation. This will be achieved via a lower base inflation rate and a three-layer burning model designed to drive the coin towards deflation as network activity increases.\u201d\n\nThe proposed merger also promises to enhance the blockchain\u2019s level of decentralization, modes of governance, and interoperability with other blockchains.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be taking the first step toward unlocking the enormous synergy of merging the public blockchains started by Kakao and LINE, which are both leading IT companies in Asia. We will give our best to make this merge an opportunity to innovate and lead the Asian blockchain industry in both technology and adoption.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Amidst a volatile crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) is gaining momentum, outperforming its long-time rival Bitcoin (BTC). According to Kaiko data, the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily risen, rebounding from multi-year lows.\n\nETH/BTC Ratio Rising, ETH Momentum Building\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio technically gauges market sentiment towards these two leading crypto. The recent rebound indicates investors are increasingly bullish on Ethereum\u2019s potential relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThis upward trajectory is fueled by growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and the general confidence that markets will trend higher in 2024. The prospect of this product entering the market has also injected fresh energy into the ETH ecosystem, lifting the second most valuable coin by market cap.\n\nRelated Reading: Institutional Inflows Into XRP Surges 244% Amid ETF Speculation\n\nAfter protracted lower lows, the ETH/BTC ratio began rising immediately after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. This unexpected shift, analysts observe, is primarily because of increasing confidence in the SEC approving a similar product for ETH.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs, which would provide direct exposure to the Ethereum market, would make it easier for institutional investors to benefit from the volatility of ETH. So far, the SEC has approved an Ethereum Futures ETF, which, unlike the spot ETF, tracks an index, not the direct price of this asset.\n\nBlackrock is among the leading Wall Street giants interested in issuing a spot Ethereum ETF. Considering its history of success, the decision by one of the world\u2019s leading asset managers to apply for this product is an endorsement of its prospects. Earlier, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, said Ethereum, despite its scaling challenge, might spearhead the tokenization drive in the years ahead.\n\nUS SEC Yet To Clarify Whether Ethereum Is A Commodity Or Security\n\nEven so, the SEC has yet to clarify whether ETH, a coin pre-mined with some assets distributed to the Ethereum Foundation, is a commodity like Bitcoin. Earlier, Gary Gensler, the chairperson of the SEC, was cornered by the United States policymakers to give the agency\u2019s stand on the coin but didn\u2019t.\n\nNonetheless, with the prospect of spotting Ethereum ETFs and the dominance of Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ETH will likely continue outperforming BTC in the coming months. Price action data shows that ETH is already up 20% versus BTC in the past trading week.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Nayms, the leading blockchain-based marketplace for alternative risk transfer and capitalization, has announced its successful launch on Base, a secure and low-cost Ethereum layer-2 solution. This collaboration aims to provide investors with streamlined access to tokenized (re)insurance opportunities, revolutionizing the insurance industry by leveraging blockchain technology.\n\nBuilding on the success of its initial investment offerings, Nayms continues to innovate in reshaping the insurance landscape. The first product launched on Base is an Industry Loss Warranty (ILW) contract, specifically reinsuring against weather-related catastrophic events in Florida. Institutional investors can now earn yield on their capital within a Bermuda-regulated segregated account structure. The target returns range from mid to high teens, paid through (re)insurance premiums by real (re)insureds seeking risk coverage. Early investors can also enjoy an additional reward of NAYM tokens, equivalent to up to 15% of their invested capital.\n\nTokenization emerges as a pivotal element in the evolving insurance sector, providing institutional investors with a unique avenue to diversify their portfolios. Nayms\u2019 tokenized offerings span (re)insurance for property and casualty (P&C) risks, including Cyber, Errors and Omissions, Directors and Officers coverage, crime/specie, and various Industry Loss Warranty products. This level of exposure, traditionally limited to major institutional investors, is now accessible to all qualified investors through tokenization.\n\nKey benefits of tokenized (re)insurance exposure for qualified investors include diversification of returns from the broader crypto market, access to historically challenging private markets now in a tokenized wrapper, high-yield returns with liquidity and low volatility, and the safety and security of the decentralized Ethereum network at a low cost, with faster settlement times through Base Layer 2.\n\nNayms\u2019 Co-Founder and CTO, Ted Georgas, expressed enthusiasm about the Base launch, stating, \u201cWe are excited to be launching on Base, our first Ethereum Layer 2 network. Our deployment was seamless as it is fully EVM compliant, and we look forward to leveraging the reduced fees and easy onramp that Base provides.\u201d\n\nThe ILW market targeted by Nayms is a crucial segment of the global catastrophe reinsurance market, generating over $300 billion in annual renewal premiums. Nayms\u2019 ILW introduces an innovative approach by safeguarding buyers against named windstorms in Florida, requiring two independent storms to each cause damage exceeding $10 billion to trigger indemnification during the 2024 in-force period. The use of USD Coin (USDC) as collateral within an independently audited Ethereum smart contract enhances transparency and operational efficiency.\n\nAbout Nayms\n\nNayms is a fully regulated marketplace for on-chain insurance, pioneering a new digital asset risk market. Regulated brokers and underwriters can connect with digital asset capital providers to share in premiums and liabilities covering digital asset risk. Nayms\u2019 traceable smart contract operates on a trustless system, enabling insurance brokers to place contracts between market participants across various sectors and share in the future value of open trade.\n\nImage by David Jorre from Unsplash\n\nRead other stories: Ask Me Anything\u2026 Part 6\n\nDigiFT and HashKey Capital Forge Strategic Partnership for Regulated Treasury Management and Investments"

        "content": "Ethereum price has prodded above $2,500 on Jan. 15, further stretching its post-ETF approval lead over BTC, on-chain data trends provide vital insights into the underlying drivers.\n\n\u2018Buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news\u2019 is a popular trading strategy where speculators make acquisitions ahead of a material news event in hopes of selling at a profit when news is confirmed. BTC speculators capitalized on this trading strategy to earn historic gains in the build-up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval verdict. Vital on-chain data trends now reveal that Ethereum (ETH) has also begun to show early signs of a similar phenomenon.\n\nBTC speculators earned 97% profits in build-up to ETF approval\n\nThe Bitcoin spot ETF approval quest suffered multiple setbacks recently, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) citing market manipulation, oversight, and liquidity concerns.\n\nHowever, on June 15, 2023, things turned positive when BlackRock (NASDAQ: BLK) officially filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. With over $13 trillion in assets under management (AUM), BlackRock is one of the largest asset management firms in the world.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s entry into the fray raised optimism about Bitcoin derivatives and effectively spun the rumor mill.\n\nAs of June 15, Blackrock\u2019s official filing date, Bitcoin price was trading around $24,800. Within the first two weeks, speculators who aped-in early on the rumor sent Bitcoin price rallying 25% to hit $30,000 for the first time in 12 months, dating back to June 2022.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action in build-up to spot ETF Approval June 2023 \u2013 Jan. 15, 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nBetween June 15 and Jan. 11, when the SEC eventually confirmed the news, Bitcoin price nearly doubled, moving from $24,800 to a local top of $48,890. This effectively sent speculators who bought the rumor after BlackRock\u2019s filing into 97% profit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the wave of profit-taking that ensued in the aftermath of the SEC approval has sent BTC price spiraling to 15% toward $42,500 as of Jan. 15. This affirms the full cycle of the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news cycle on the spot Bitcoin ETF narrative.\n\nWith the Bitcoin ETF now at a conclusion, investors have switched focus to Ethereum. BlackRock had filed for spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 16. In a recent interview on Jan. 12, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink re-emphasized the value of an Ethereum spot ETF as an asset class.\n\nWhile the BTC price has dropped by 3.8%, Ethereum has increased by 13.5% in the past week. In effect, ETH price has outperformed BTC by approximately 10%.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) price performance \u2013 Jan. 9 \u2013 Jan. 15, 2024. Source: Coin360\n\nInterestingly, in addition to this divergent interplay between ETH and BTC price movement over the past week, strategic on-chain movements from Ethereum whales since Jan. 11 also corroborate early signals of the buy-the-rumor strategy playing out in ETH markets.\n\nEthereum whales have acquired $1.4 billion ETH since Bitcoin ETF approval verdict\n\nOn paper, Ethereum price has outperformed BTC by 10% in the past week, per Coin360 data. Looking beyond the price charts, a vital on-chain indicator has revealed that ETH\u2019s performance has been boosted by corporate entities and high net-worth investors who increased their buy pressure shortly after the Bitcoin ETF approval verdict.\n\nSantiment\u2019s \u2018supply held by top addresses\u2019 metric shows a real-time snapshot of the aggregate balances currently controlled by the largest wallets in a crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe latest readings show that the top 1,000 Ethereum wallets held just 66 million ETH in cumulative balances as of Jan. 10.\n\nBut since the focus switched to spot Ethereum ETF, strategic ETH investors have entered a buying spree, adding 570,000 ETH to bring their balances to 66.5 million ETH at press time on Jan. 15.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply held by top addresses | Source: Santiment\n\nValued at the current price of $2,540, the Ethereum \u2018top holder supply\u2019 chart above illustrates that the top 1,000 investors have added ETH coins worth $1.4 billion to their holdings in the last four days alone.\n\nIntuitively, when the largest stakeholders increase their balances rapidly by hundreds of millions, it is interpreted as a strong bullish signal. Firstly, the buying trend among the largest stakeholders increases overall confidence within the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nGiven that large holders are often likely to hold longer than small-holder swing traders, this accumulation puts ETH in a prime position to score historic gains in the weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum market dominance climbs after spot Bitcoin ETF approval | Source: TradingView\n\nBut more importantly, the timing of the recent buying spree suggests that investors are buying the rumor with optimism that Bitcoin\u2019s ETF approval will increase the likelihood that ongoing ETH applications will also obtain a positive verdict from the SEC.\n\nThe Ethereum Dominance (ETH.D) chart further affirms this stance. Ethereum has cornered 14% more market share between Jan. 10 and Jan. 15, while Bitcoin price has declined at a nearly identical 15%.\n\nThis suggests that speculative traders are selling the news on BTC, rapidly buying the rumor ahead of a possible spot ETH ETF approval verdict.\n\nETH price forecast: can Ethereum reach $5,000 in 2024?\n\nFrom the data points analyzed above, the large holder wallets\u2019 accumulation and the rising ETH dominance suggest that the buy-the-rumor strategy is now widely in play in the Ethereum markets.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin had scored 97% gains in the build-up to the spot ETF approval verdict, a similar performance could put ETH in line to reach $5,000 in the instance of a positive outcome.\n\nBut in the short term, the ETH bulls will have to scale the $2,900 resistance to keep the momentum going. IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money chart, which highlights potential support/resistance points using the historical entry prices of current ETH holders, also supports this ETH prediction\n\nIt shows that with ETH prices currently trading above $2,500, 91% of all ETH holders are now in profit positions. With the ETH ETF approval process on the front burner, these holders could increasingly become less inclined to sell.\n\nHowever, the 8.5 million Ethereum holders who bought 4.1 million ETH coins could pose significant resistance if they book early profits as prices approach their break-even point.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price forecast | Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe bears could negate this bullish prediction if the ETH price unexpectedly retreats below $2,000. However, 7.9 million investors acquired 43.4 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,039.\n\nConsidering this is the largest cluster of ETH current holders, they will likely have enough in the tank to overturn such bearish pressure.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granting approval for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, TD Cowen, a prominent American investment bank and financial service firm, foresees potential delays in the approval process of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Faces Potential Hold-Up\n\nTD Cowen, an investment bank and financial service division of TD Securities has made a bold forecast, predicting that the US SEC is unlikely to approve Ethereum Spot ETFs before its deadline. Presently, the SEC is obligated to make its final decision on its rejection or acceptance of Ethereum Spot ETF from May 23 to August 7, 2024.\n\nEarlier on January 10, the SEC officially approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs, triggering expectations that ETH Spot ETFs would follow suit. Several major firms including Ark 21 Shares, VanEck, Fidelity, BlackRock, and Hashdex have submitted applications for a Spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the regulatory agency has fixed a new deadline for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF to January 25.\n\nTD Cowen\u2019s predictions align with the SEC\u2019s typical cautionary approach towards cryptocurrency-related investment products. The investment bank has disclosed that the regulator may delay ETH Spot ETFs until it accumulates sufficient knowledge and experience from its previously approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs. The bank estimates that while the delay may not take as long as 26 months, it is likely to persist beyond the upcoming elections.\n\nSimilarly, Scott Melker, a crypto investor on X (formerly Twitter) has highlighted the possibility of the SEC hesitating to approve Ethereum Spot ETFs. Melker predicted that the SEC would be reluctant to approve Ethereum ETFs without external legal pressures similar to those observed during the approval process of Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cGary Gensler isn\u2019t going to entertain an Ethereum Spot ETF unless the courts force it on him. I very seriously doubt we will see one anytime soon, but would love to be proven wrong,\u201d Melker stated.\n\nETH price recovers above $2,500 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nClass Before Approval\n\nJP Morgan, an American multinational financial service firm has introduced another layer of complexity in the approval process of Ethereum Spot ETFs. Managing Director at JP Morgan, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated that there was a 50% chance of the US SEC approving these Spot ETFs by its May deadline.\n\nPanigirtzoglou revealed that the SEC would need to classify ETH as a commodity, similar to Bitcoin before it can officially grant authorization for Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn contrast, Bloomberg senior analyst, Eric Balchunas is more optimistic on Ethereum Spot ETF approvals. The analyst has disclosed a 70% chance of the SEC approving ETH Spot ETFs. Balchunas said previously that he could not imagine a scenario where the SEC would approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs and reject Ethereum Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFeatured image from Tech Cabal, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Bloodbath Incoming? Celsius\u2019 $125 Million Move Threatens ETH Price - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum price might be doing well post-spot Bitcoin ETF launch, but recent moves by Celsius threaten to destabilize the price movement. The now-bankrupt crypto lender seems to have begun its reimbursement plan to its creditors, as on-chain data reveal the movement of its ETH holdings to crypto exchanges.\n\nAccording to crypto market intelligence company Arkham Intelligence, Celsius Network carried out transfers worth over $125 million worth of ETH last week to various crypto exchanges.\n\nCelsius Transfers ETH To Exchanges\n\nData shows that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius executed transfers worth $95.5 million to crypto exchange Coinbase while also sending $29.73 million to FalconX. At the time of writing, Celsius Network\u2019s balance sheet has 584,601 ETH worth $1.47 billion. Notably, it also has 9,799 BTC worth $418.2 million and 659 million CEL tokens worth $133.2 million on its books, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLooks like Celsius took the opportunity to unload >$125M of ETH over ETF Week. In the past week, they\u2019ve deposited $95.5M to Coinbase and sent $29.73M to FalconX. They still have $1.4 billion (540K ETH) remaining.https://t.co/jp1PJbN46r pic.twitter.com/xgfX6yU5Ye \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) January 13, 2024\n\nCelsius\u2019s motive behind the transfers into exchange points to nothing apart from an intending selloff, as the company is well on its way to clearing its liabilities under bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nCelsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 shortly after the fall of TerraUSD and the LUNA ecosystem, leading to creditors having their funds trapped on the platform for the last 18 months. However, the defunct crypto lender has been making major moves in its bankruptcy proceedings to refund creditors. According to reports, the company sold $240 million worth of ETH in December 2023.\n\nNotably, the company communicated its decision earlier this month on January 5 to unstake $465 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) which will be distributed to its creditors.\n\nETH price shows strength as new trading week opens up | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIncoming Ethereum Price Crash?\n\nEthereum is currently on a roll, still on a 13% gain in the past seven days. However, huge selloffs like this tend to shake market confidence, leading to a sell-off from other investors. On the other hand, some tend to believe that the crypto is sufficiently resilient.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Ethereum retained its bullish sentiment during the time these transfers were made, as price action revealed a 23% jump from $2,191 on January 8 to $2,706 on January 12. Ethereum has declined since then and is now trading at $2,514. According to Coinglass, $23.84 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours.\n\nDespite the recent large transfers, Celsius still retains significant cryptocurrency assets including ETH, BTC, MATIC, and LINK. A decision to continue the selling off of these assets could lead to a bigger dent in the price of the assets, particularly Ethereum, which is now testing the $2,500 support level.\n\nOn-chain data from Spotonchain also reported FTX and Alameda Research moving 1,000 ETH worth $2.33 million to crypto exchange Coinbase during the week.\n\nFeatured image from The Daily Hodl, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Two interesting crypto projects are in the spotlight recently \u2013 Ethereum Classic and Galaxy Fox. Ethereum Classic ($ETC) caught the attention of many investors and traders with its 35% surge.\n\nMeanwhile, Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) is gaining traction with its ongoing presale, which is on track to hit the $3 million mark.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Classic ($ETC) Going Up?\n\nEthereum Classic ($ETC) has emerged as a dark horse, surging by a staggering 35% in a week.\n\nBut what\u2019s fueling this unexpected rise? Ethereum Classic, which hard-forked from Ethereum ($ETH) in 2016, is outpacing its more renowned big brother. Hovering above $27, $ETC has soared by 35%, propelled by positive market sentiment following the approval of the first batch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nEthereum Classic split from the Ethereum Blockchain over a disagreement with founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s decision to reverse a 2016 hack of smart contract system The Dao, which had experienced $60M in stolen Ether. While Buterin\u2019s decision to turn back the clock on the hack was supported by the majority of the community, some developers thought it violated the \u201ccode is law\u201d principle of blockchain \u2013 and thus Ethereum Classic was born. The Ethereum Classic blockchain continues to have a small, but devoted following of users and developers.\n\nAs to the question of why $ETC is pumping recently, part of it has to do with macro-conditions in the market.\n\nSantiment, a leading on-chain analytics platform, reports a rise in $ETC trading volume, reaching levels not seen since September 2022. The report shows the recent surge is closely linked to the Bitcoin ETF announcement and marks a significant milestone for $ETC.\n\nThe coin\u2019s recent bullish movement showcases heightened trader interest and a positive market outlook.\n\nGalaxy Fox Presale Eyes $3 Million\n\nGalaxy Fox has reached a significant milestone with $2.5 million in its presale. This momentum shows substantial investor confidence in this meme coin that\u2019s not just riding the crypto hype but is set to redefine the landscape. The $GFOX presale is currently in Stage 7, with tokens available for purchase at 0.00198 USD. It has already placed over 2.3 billion tokens in the hands of early investors, and raised a remarkable $2.6 million. The project is gearing up for the next stage, which features an increased token price of 0.002178 USD.\n\nDesigned as an ERC-20 coin, Galaxy Fox is a key player in the web3 space. Its utility extends beyond its ecosystem, making it a standout altcoin in the crypto world.\n\nThe Galaxy Fox ecosystem promises exciting opportunities, including a play-to-earn (P2E) game that rewards users for having fun. Staking $GFOX tokens will be possible, with users earning rewards within the ecosystem. Furthermore, $GFOX serves as the primary payment medium within the Galaxy Fox NFT marketplace, enhancing gameplay and boosting chances of earning.\n\nAdditionally, Galaxy Fox promises to attempt to dominate the Web3 sector. With many of the coolest NFT assets directly linked to its Web3 game, $GFOX holders can mint and trade these digital assets for real money on NFT platforms.\n\nGalaxy Fox\u2019s presale is a corrective path to an innovative ecosystem with profit potential. The projected growth in the meme sector and Galaxy Fox\u2019s unique features make this presale an interesting one to watch.\n\nIn a world where crypto trends evolve rapidly, Ethereum Classic\u2019s surge and Galaxy Fox\u2019s presale capture the essence of development in this dynamic space.\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

It\u2019s usually interpreted as a bullish pattern.\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,517 at time of writing.\n\nMartinez also notes that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator recently presented a buy signal for top meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE). The TD Sequential indicator is used by traders to predict potential trend reversals based on the closing prices of the 13 previous bars or candles.\n\nSays Martinez,\n\n\u201cAs long as the $0.074 support cluster continues to hold, DOGE has a great chance of rebounding to $0.100 or higher!\u201d\n\nDOGE is trading at $0.080 at time of writing.\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez notes that the BTC Miners\u2019 Position Index (MPI) hit a high of 9.43 on January 12th.\n\n\u201cThis indicates miners moved more BTC than usual, hinting at potential sales.

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is enjoying bullish momentum in 2024 thus far, gaining 96% over the past week, per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe surge comes after ENS experienced a massive drawdown in 2023 due to the longstanding crypto winter and regulatory uncertainties.\n\nIn June, ENS witnessed a bloodbath triggered by regulatory actions against leading exchanges, hitting a five-year low of $6.69. ENS started sliding from its all-time high of $83.40 on Nov. 11, 2021, ending with a cycle low. The bear market continued till 2023.\n\nAt the time of writing, ENS is exchanging hands for $24.8, representing a 96 % increase in the past seven days. With a circulating supply of 31 million ENS, the project\u2019s market cap stands at $761 million.\n\nThis resurgence indicates a positive trend for ENS, emphasizing its resilience in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain It allows users to acquire human-readable names like \u201cbob.eth\u201d and link them to identifiers such as addresses, content hashes, and metadata. Unlike traditional DNS, ENS domains are governed by smart contracts and a DAO, reflecting a departure from centralized authority.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder, has emphasized the significance of layer-2 blockchains incorporating ENS domains.\n\nHis call for trustless, Merkle-proof-based CCIP resolvers aims to enable ENS subdomains to register, update, and be readable directly on layer-2 solutions. This move aligns to make ENS more affordable and underscores its importance in the evolving crypto ecosystem.\n\nIt will be recalled that the recent Spot Bitcoin ETF approval triggered a 55% price increase for ENS token last week, with Ethereum (ETH) breaking above $2,400 on January 10.\n\nButerin advocates for the adoption of ENS domains in decentralized finance. His vision is rooted in enhancing user experiences across various layer-2 solutions by integrating ENS domains. This aligns with the broader industry trend of seeking faster and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nYou might also like: SEC chair Gary Gensler assures no breach after X hack\n\nENS enables users to purchase domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, offering a more user-friendly alternative to alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nENS has made its unique niche with 2.1 million registered domains and 800,00 participants where efficient fund transfers are enabled.\n\nDespite the recent approvals of bitcoin spot ETFs, SEC Chair Gary Gensler expressed wariness towards an Ethereum ETF. When mentioning Bitcoin\u2019s status as a non-security commodity token, Gensler did not give any hint about the classification of Ethereum.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic: 5 Key Differences Between ETH and ETC - CoinGape",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic came from the same network, but they are two different blockchains.\n\nEthereum and Ethereum Classic differ based on their origin, consensus mechanism, token supply, market value, and network developments and upgrades.\n\nEthereum has quickly become one of the most popular blockchains with its innovative capabilities such as smart contract support and dApp development. However, it had to face an unfortunate hack called \u201cthe DAO hack\u201d in 2016, which resulted in a split in the network. That\u2019s how Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains have emerged. The major difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is that Ethereum relies on Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism while Ethereum Classic sticks to the original Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Even though both share similarities like decentralization and smart contract support, they share multiple differences. Let us discuss a few of the major differences between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in the present article. But, before that lets first understand the history behind these two blockchains.\n\nEthereum vs Ethereum Classic: Why There Are Two Networks? Ethereum brought a revolution with its launch by taking blockchain technology beyond mere peer-to-peer transactions. It enabled the development of decentralized applications and \u201cThe DAO\u201d was one of the pioneering apps on Ethereum. The DAO project allowed retail investors to participate in crowdfunding of other projects. However, the smart contract of The DAO project had a vulnerability called \u201cSplit Function\u201d. The developers of the project deliberately included that feature to allow investors to withdraw their investment based on their preference. When investors withdraw their funds, they will get their ETH back and the data on the blockchain will get updated. The Split Function feature paved the way for hackers to breach \u201cThe DAO\u201d project and Ethereum suffered a major loss in 2016. Malicious hackers drained around $50 million dollars from the project without actually updating the transaction history. To make the Ethereum blockchain secure again and to gain the trust of the community, Vitalik Buterin and other developers decided to hard fork the network. However, the entire community didn\u2019t agree with the decision. Just like how the community split based on their decision, the Ethereum blockchain was also split, giving birth to two networks. The original blockchain that remained immutable is today known as the \u201cEthereum Classic\u201d network whereas the new network is the present \u201cEthereum\u201d blockchain.\n\nEthereum vs Ethereum Classic: 5 Key Differences\n\nOrigin of Crypto As we have explained above, after the hard fork in 2016, Ethereum community members divided into two parts, having different opinions. While a part of the community believed that it is important to have the hack in its history and the blockchain should continue as it was. On the other hand, the other part of the community believed that it is important to undo the hack and retrieve the lost money. However, the decision to implement the hard fork gained more votes and the developers implemented the hard fork on July 20, 2016. The network that remained as it was became the \u201cEthereum Classic\u201d network and the new network is the present \u201cEthereum\u201d network. Thus, Ethereum and Ethereum classic differ based on their origin.\n\nConsensus Mechanism Consensus mechanism is another major difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Walking through the footsteps of the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum also initially worked based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, the developer team of Ethereum decided to change it into a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network to make it sustainable. The Ethereum network transitioned from PoW to PoS mechanism after the historical \u201cEthereum Merge\u201d event in September, 2022. This not only saves energy but also helps the network process transactions faster. On the other hand, Ethereum Classic remained a PoW network, sticking to the traditional mining process.\n\nToken Supply and Monetary Policy Token supply and monetary policy behind Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are top differences between them. While Ethereum has no fixed token supply, Ethereum Classic\u2019s token supply is fixed at around 210.7 million. Furthermore, the inflation rate of Ethereum is capped at 4.5% and developers can make changes to its monetary policy as per requirements. But this is not the case with Ethereum Classic. When all the 210.7 million ETC are mined, miners will only get transaction fees as rewards.\n\nMarket Value & Community Ethereum holds a large market value compared to Ethereum Classic, being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As of January 2024, the total market capitalization of Ethereum is more than 300 billion. On the other hand, the market capitalization of Ethereum Classic is over 3 billion. Both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic differ a lot when it comes to their market prices as well. Adding to that Ethereum has a wide user base and adoption with its functionalities and huge number of dApps. When it comes to Ethereum Classic, the community is smaller and more focused on PoW mechanism and immutability rather than dApp ecosystem.\n\nNetwork Developments & Upgrades The developer team behind Ethereum is relentless with network developments and upgrades. From London upgrades to the Merge and Shapella upgrade, Ethereum went through several major events. All of these Ethereum upgrades aim to improve scalability, sustainability, and overall functionality of the Ethereum network. When it comes to Ethereum Classic, there isn\u2019t much activity in terms of its development and network upgrades. It focuses more on stability and doesn\u2019t undergo frequent upgrades. The Ethereum Classic community prioritizes immutability. Thus, the network completely sticks to PoW and traditional functionalities.\n\nConclusion Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are two notable cryptocurrencies in the industry. Even though they came from the same blockchain, they share several major differences. While the smart contract functionality and decentralization features are available on both of them, they differ based on token supply, origins, market value, and network upgrades."

        "content": "After the approval of the 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin (BTC) price shot up significantly, nearing $49,000. However, subsequently, the oldest crypto witnessed a bearish turn, now trading at around $43,000. Amid the declines, a crypto analyst sold off a substantial share of his Bitcoin holdings to acquire Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhy did the crypto analyst sell Bitcoin for Ethereum?\n\nIn a recent video, Crypto Rover, a popular crypto analyst on YouTube and X, stated that he is considering a significant Bitcoin selloff to invest in Ethereum. Additionally, he noted that ETH has a better upside than BTC. He linked this to the upcoming Spot Ethereum ETFs that are expected to launch in four months.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe analyst added that a major Ethereum upgrade is also slated for launch in the next four months. Hence, he expects the coupled impact of both these events to propel the Ethereum price up unprecedentedly. Whilst, he noted that last week, he began selling off Bitcoin when it neared the $49,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, Rover underscored that Bitcoin has registered over $200 million in short liquidations. He noted that Bitcoin tends to grab the liquidity before significant chart movements. Hence, he expects the BTC price to surge past $43,500 before a notable correction.\n\nMoreover, he added that the surge could be extended to $44,500 prior to the anticipated declines. In addition, the analyst stated that he will place buy orders for BTC when the price falls around $39,750, indicating a massive correction. However, he also noted that if Bitcoin breaks the resistance at $44,500 and sustains over it, a massive surge could follow.\n\nAlso Read: Arthur Hayes Expects Hong Kong To Hinder Bitcoin ETF Adoption In West\n\nBTC Price Today\n\nThe Bitcoin price slumped significantly after attaining a high of $48,969.37 last week. Moreover, it has since experienced significant declines despite attempts to rebound. It retraced the $43,500 mark but faced a rejection.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price witnessed a dip of 0.15% to $42,778.53 on Tuesday, January 16. Whilst, the crypto holds a market cap of 838.70 billion, down by 0.14%.

        "content": "Over 650,000 units of staked Ethereum, valued at approximately $1.6 billion, were redeemed last week\u2014the largest amount of redemption since the Shanghai Upgrade was completed last year.\n\nA Dune Analytics dashboard shared by Tom Wan, an analyst at 21 Shares, showed that the bankrupt crypto lender Celsius and staking service provider Figment were the primary contributors to this substantial redemption surge. Together, they orchestrated withdrawals totaling 563,300 staked ETH, constituting an impressive 85% of the total redemptions during the reporting period.\n\nCryptoSlate highlighted these firms\u2019 role in pushing Ethereum\u2019s validator exits to a record high of over 16,000 validators on Jan. 5. At the time, the two firms made up roughly 75% of the total withdrawals in the queue as they planned to remove more than 550,000 staked Ethereum.\n\nCelsius previously revealed plans to unstake 206,300 ETH, worth around $470 million, as part of efforts for its bankruptcy process. The failed lender said the withdrawals would be used to facilitate the distribution of assets to its creditors.\n\nOn the other hand, Figment was also making substantial withdrawals of over 350,000 staked ETH on its clients\u2019 behalf.\n\nFollowing these substantial withdrawals, the total amount of staked Ethereum now sits at 28.9 million, according to Nansen\u2019s Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) Upgrade dashboard.\n\nETH\u2019s price unaffected\n\nThe staked Ethereum withdrawal activity did not negatively impact ETH\u2019s price performance during the past week, as the digital asset\u2019s value rose by around 12% to a peak of $2700, its highest value since May 2022.\n\nSuggestions that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) following similar approvals granted to Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to this upward price movement.\n\nLarry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock, further fueled the optimism when he said he saw \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF\u201d during an interview with CNBC.\n\nData from Polymarket shows that around 55% of bets on the platform anticipate an Ethereum ETF approval by the end of May."

        "title": "SSV Network: Transforming Ethereum Staking with Distributed Validator Technology - Blockonomi",
        "content": "With Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, staking has become vital to securing the network. But even after the Merge, operating validator nodes still requires 32 ETH, advanced technical skills, and reliable infrastructure. This creates barriers to participation for many people.\n\nEnter SSV \u2013 an open source protocol enabling decentralized and accessible Ethereum staking built atop the post-Merge landscape.\n\nHow does Ethereum staking currently work?\n\nUnder PoS, validator nodes add new blocks rather than miners. To become a solo validator, you must lock up 32 ETH and set up nodes to do the validation work \u2013 whether on hardware you control or using a third-party service. These validators then earn rewards in the form of additional ETH proportional to their stake. However, there are significant hardware demands and the risk of penalties if your validator goes offline.\n\nThe SSV solution\n\nSSV is a staking infrastructure protocol developed by a community-driven DAO. It works by distributing validator keys among non-trusting nodes called \u201coperators\u201d. This means multiple operators can jointly run a validator without any one operator having full control.\n\nAnyone can join SSV as an operator by running an open-source node and registering keys. The protocol handles distributing validator key shares among operators automatically. Validators with 32 ETH at stake provide the keys to the network to have their ETH staked across the operator pools. This gives them effortless access to staking without infrastructure costs. Even if some operators go offline, rewards keep accruing due to the distributed nature.\n\nBenefits of the SSV model\n\nSSV unlocks Ethereum staking for regular users in a decentralized way. By splitting up infrastructure needs, it offers:\n\nReduced barriers to entry: No need for 32 ETH or to maintain validator hardware Enhanced security: Collective validation by operators, with distributed keys More decentralization: Anyone can be an operator or staker Fault tolerance: The network sustains some operator downtime Flexibility: Stakers can choose operator pools based on geography, hardware etc. Censorship resistance: Decentralized operators make collusion unlikely Community-oriented: Open source network governed by a DAO\n\nBy innovating staking infrastructure for the Web3 era, SSV helps move Ethereum towards greater decentralization and accessibility. Now anyone can play a role in shaping consensus and earning rewards.\n\nThe SSV Token\n\nSSV is the native token and has two core functions:\n\nNetwork Governance\n\nSSV holders can create and vote on proposals to steer policies, partnerships, tech upgrades, and more. Just as tokens enable on-chain governance for DeFi protocols, SSV puts the direction of the network in community hands.\n\nValidators pay fees to operators for securing and managing their staked ETH using SSV as interoperable currency. With skin in the game, SSV holders are strongly incentivized to contribute to and monitor the network\u2019s growth.\n\nPayments Between Staking Actors\n\nThe SSV token facilitates exchange of value between validators, who deposit ETH to earn staking rewards, and operators, who maintain infrastructure for validators and take a cut of yields.\n\nValidators fund their accounts with SSV, which operators draw from as a fee in proportion to the staking rewards they generate. Operators also get compensated for actions like submitting slashing proofs. This mechanic aligns incentives \u2013 the more rewards an operator enables, the more SSV they earn.\n\nBridging Incentives Through Tokens\n\nThis tokenized model is key to decentralizing staking on Ethereum in practice. By bridging incentives between essential participants, and allowing validators choice based on real-time operator performance, staking becomes open and efficient like never before.\n\nThrough clever tokenomics design, SSV is bolstering accessibility and decentralization of the rapidly evolving Ethereum network.\n\nKey Moments and Achievements\n\n2023 marked a significant chapter in the evolution of Ethereum staking, with the SSV Network pioneering a transformative approach through its permissionless mainnet deployment. Underpinning this revolutionary shift is the innovative Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) introduced by the SSV Network, which promises to enhance the security, decentralization, and robustness of Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\nThe SSV Foundation\u2019s creation of four testnet versions set the stage for the network\u2019s progress. Boasting 92 active operators from five continents and staking 70,000 ETH, the SSV Network exhibited impressive global participation. The launch of the Shifu testnet V2 marked a significant milestone, enabling operators to engage in Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus using DVT.\n\nETH Denver\u2019s \u2018BUIDLWeek\u2019 in February 2023 showcased the SSV Network\u2019s commitment to fostering development and creativity. With a $50 million ecosystem fund and the announcement of the Shifu testnet V2, the SSV Network provided a robust foundation for aspiring developers.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s commitment to autonomy reached new heights with the establishment the SSV DAO Verified Operators (VOs). These individuals, selected for their strong work ethic and technical expertise, were vital in overseeing a subset of the network\u2019s validators during the Limited Launch period.\n\nDecentralized Governance and Expansion\n\nWhen the Multi-Sig Committee and Quorum Proposal were first introduced in August of 2023, it was a momentous day for the SSV Network. The purpose of these suggestions, which were included in the second round of DAO projects, was to improve network security, simplify decision-making processes, and support efforts that contribute to the expansion of the network.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s governance system, combined with the Karma dashboard and Vote Delegation, significantly reduced the barriers that prevented community members from participating in decision-making processes.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s open-source ETH staking architecture, powered by DVT, addresses critical challenges in Ethereum staking. Active-Active Redundancy and Fault Tolerance ensure uninterrupted validator operation, even in the face of node failures. The unique approach of securing ETH without custody, where validator keys are generated, split, and securely stored offline, enhances the safety of staking for users.\n\nDecentralization and Diversity are cornerstones of the SSV Network, as independent node operators globally contribute to the network\u2019s infrastructure. This strengthens the Ethereum blockchain and reduces risks for individual stakes.\n\nFlexibility and Lack of Coordination are integral to SSV Network\u2019s implementation of DVT. Stakeholders can choose validator operators without collaboration, all managed through smart contracts. The ability of distributed validators to swiftly switch nodes adds a layer of flexibility to the network.\n\nHistorical Evolution and Notable Achievements\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s inception traces back to the team\u2019s involvement in Blox Finance in 2017, evolving into a non-custodial ETH staking provider, Blox Staking. The adoption of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s DVT technology idea in 2020 led to the creation of the SSV protocol, with the mainnet launch in 2023.\n\nFounder Alon Muroch, a leading Ethereum POS specialist, spearheaded the team\u2019s efforts, securing strategic partnerships with Coinbase, Digital Currency Group, and OKEx. Over three years, the team achieved significant milestones, including the release of the SSV protocol, DAO creation, testingnets, DAO fundraising, and a $50 million green fund.\n\nSSV Network\u2019s Impact on Ethereum Staking\n\nA revolutionary change in Ethereum staking has occurred due to the recent deployment of the permissionless mainnet made available by SSV Network. Within the framework of the staking paradigm, the employment of DVT technology answers issues about centralization. It is in line with the vision of decentralized validators that Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has.\n\nThrough its incentive program, which rewards users with one million SSV tokens, the SSV Network is committed to constructing a diverse ecosystem and fostering acceptance of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result of three years of concentrated development that ended in a mainnet that does not need permission, the SSV Network has emerged as a critical player dedicated to expanding Ethereum\u2019s staking environment. This is because the mainnet does not require permission.\n\nOne year ago, the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) network presented a groundbreaking Ecosystem Fund funded with fifty million dollars.\n\nSome of the parties participating in this transaction are venture capitalists, angel investors, and staking enterprises, including DCG, OKX, HashKey, NGC, Everstake, HackVC, GSR, and Chorus. Developing stake solutions for the future generation was a collaborative effort between One SevenX and 1kx.\n\nMore Adoption Is Likely\n\nA significant number of companies use the ssv.network, and they do so by using DVT. Core Development Lead Alon Muroch places significant emphasis on expanding the number of individuals who can use Ethereum\u2019s security. It is anticipated by the DVT protocol that there would be a substantial rise due to the establishment of the Eco Fund.\n\nAfter presenting the ssv.network DAO, which allocated $3 million for developer awards, firms including Blockscape, ANKR, Stader, and Moonstake were given over $1.2 million in prizes for using DVT in product development. These companies were honored for their accomplishments.\n\nIn addition, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s concept for Ethereum 2.0 involves introducing a decentralized virtual token (DVT) to improve the system\u2019s level of security. Each validator uses DVT, made possible by ssv.network, which is positioned as Ethereum\u2019s Layer 0. Ethereum is developing toward a global decentralized and censorship-resistant network. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nTo demonstrate its dedication to decentralization, innovation, and the empowerment of communities, the SSV Network will begin on a journey that will be revolutionary in the year 2024. With rising interest in blockchain, SSV is well placed to rise along with the wider market.\n\nA paradigm shift has occurred in the Ethereum staking given by the network due to the use of DVT technology, which has improved security, fault tolerance, and flexibility. As the SSV Network continues to shape the future of distributed Ethereum staking, it is projected to have a substantial impact on the blockchain technology ecosystem.\n\nThe SSV Network is a driving force in the development of Ethereum\u2019s staking environment because of its commitment to a staking landscape that is open, decentralized, and permissionless."

        "title": "Forget Solana, This Cryptocurrency Is Poised for an Incredible Run in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After rising by more than 900% last year, Solana (SOL -1.23%) might be the most deserving to hold the title of crypto's 2023 MVP. Yet, while the digital currency's monumental resurgence provided a much-needed respite after it fell to as low as $8, Solana's long-term prospects pale in comparison to one of crypto's household names: Ethereum (ETH 1.43%).\n\nHere's why investors would be remiss to overlook Ethereum's potential while the market's focus remains elsewhere.\n\nA little context first\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum arrived on the crypto scene with a bang. At the time, it was the first blockchain that allowed developers to build custom decentralized applications via smart contracts -- transactions that self-executive when certain terms are met -- making Ethereum the first programmable cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum's pioneering of smart contracts meant that the majority of innovative crypto uses initially found a home on its blockchain. Things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and much more all started on Ethereum and represented a seismic shift in the trajectory of crypto's capabilities.\n\nBut like any iteration of technology, new versions eventually arose. Enter Solana. Building off of Ethereum's efforts, Solana arrived in 2017 offering developers and users a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum.\n\nFast-forward a few years, and Solana has assumed the title of Ethereum killer, gaining significant traction in the crypto economy thanks to its blazing speeds and extremely low fees. Today, it is the fifth-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market with a total valuation of $41 billion.\n\nSolana's rapid rise to become one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies has brought a wave of hype with it. Yet even with this, Ethereum remains nearly six times as valuable and supports 20 times more value across the DeFi economy.\n\nEthereum's game-changing upgrades\n\nWhile Solana optimists might paint a different picture, the reality is that Ethereum remains the epicenter of the decentralized economy. It has the largest developer community, has a proven track record of functionality, and continues to implement upgrades that will further increase the network's capabilities.\n\nMost importantly, these upgrades are part of the reason Ethereum is poised for a run in 2024. In the second half of the year, Ethereum will launch EIP-41844, an upgrade that will lower transaction fees and increase its throughput.\n\nFor the entirety of Solana's existence, its primary advantage was that it is a cheaper and faster version than Ethereum. But what will happen if Ethereum levels the playing field?\n\nWith increased efficiency and scalability, the number of uses Ethereum can support will likely increase. Since one of the primary ways a cryptocurrency is valued lies in the utility it provides, EIP-41844 could bring new value to Ethereum's long-term prospects.\n\nBest of all, though, EIP-41844 is just one of a series of planned upgrades over the coming years. Subsequent improvements will introduce new functionality such as greater security, increasing decentralization, and further streamlining of the network.\n\nIn totality, Ethereum's future upgrades hold the potential to solidify it as the most valuable smart-contract blockchain and squash any competition.\n\nThe multichain future\n\nLike many markets in the world today, the DeFi economy will likely have several competitors. Take the smartphone market as an example. While Androids make up more than 80% of the global market, Apple's iPhone still holds a considerable portion.\n\nA similar future in crypto is likely: one where Solana and Ethereum coexist, with each offering developers and users different options. However, when deciding which of the two is poised for a significant run, Ethereum looks more promising, especially over the long haul.\n\nWhile Solana ran up more than 900% in 2023, Ethereum witnessed a measly 90% jump. As the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market and home to more decentralized applications than any other blockchain, this lack of performance suggests that Ethereum has a bit of catching up to do.\n\nFortunately, Ethereum is no stranger to significant growth. During the last bull market, it rose by nearly 2,000% when it skyrocketed from around $200 to more than $4,800 over a year and a half. Whether a similar scenario unfolds remains to be seen.\n\nBut when considering the potential that will accompany EIP-41844, as well as future upgrades, don't be surprised if Ethereum becomes one of the best performers in your portfolio for years to come."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his views on the significance of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pointing to their role in shaping the future of tokenization, in a recent interview with CNBC.\n\nWith the recent greenlight for several spot Bitcoin ETFs, the spotlight has shifted to Ethereum. Responding to this matter, Fink adopted an optimistic viewpoint, saying that he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF.\u201d Notably, he saw Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as crucial steps toward tokenization.\n\n\u201cI think ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets. Step two is gonna be the token digitalization of the assets,\u201d said Fink, \u201cThese are just stepping stones toward tokenization.\u201d\n\nTokenization is the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens, which potentially increases accessibility to investment opportunities. Last year, BlackRock participated in a live securities settlement using JPMorgan\u2019s Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN).\n\nFink suggested that the technology required for tokenization is already available. He also highlighted the benefits of using a tokenized system, stating that it could eliminate all forms of corruption.\n\nWhile discussing Bitcoin, Fink drew a comparison between Bitcoin and gold, viewing them both as enduring asset classes that offer long-term protection. However, he was skeptical about the potential for Bitcoin to become a widely accepted means of exchange.\n\n\u201cI do believe it\u2019s an alternative source of wealth holding. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever gonna be a currency. I believe it\u2019s an asset class,\u201d stated Fink. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than what gold represents over thousands of years. It\u2019s an asset class that protects you.\u201d\n\nBlackRock filed for a spot Ethereum ETF last November, with Coinbase Custody as the custodian. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a decision on an Ethereum ETF application from Ark Invest and 21Shares by May."

        "content": "Is It Too Late to Buy Ethereum Name Service? ENS Price Doubles as New Bitcoin Mining Protocol Goes Viral\n\nAs decentralized naming systems gain traction, Ethereum Name Service has seen ENS price double, leaving some FOMO investors asking is it too late to buy Ethereum name service \u2013 find out in ENS price analysis.\n\nThe bullish moves come after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin commented that ENS has layer-2 potential for DeFi applications.\n\nENS surged 96% this week \u2013 Vitalik is bullish on its application in DeFi. BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink highlights the potential value in Ethereum ETFs; I have no doubt it'll be up next.

Despite this, a potential fundamental headwind from ETF\u2019s could still push ENS higher.\n\nThis leaves ENS price targeting an upside move to $26 (a potential +7.53%).\n\nWhile downside risk could see ENS price tumble down to $20.37 (a possible -15.79%).\n\nENS price analysis therefore reveals a current risk: reward composition of 0.48 \u2013 a bad entry characterized by retracement risk, but not withstanding the potential boost of a spot Ethereum ETF, this suggests on the short-time frame it is too late to buy.\n\nBut while ENS offers an unappealing entry point, a huge opportunity is still open to early backers interested in innovation in Bitcoin Mining and network security.\n\nENS Price Analysis Alternative?

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-two (L2) blockchain Manta Pacific registered more than $850 million in total value locked (TVL) today, and it is now the 4th largest L2 by TVL, according to data aggregator L2Beat. When compared to the $35 million in TVL on December 15, 2023, this represents more than 2,300% in monthly growth.\n\nThe relevant rise in TVL can be related to Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign, which started last year on December 14 and gave rewards to users who bridged Ethereum (ETH) to Manta Pacific. The rewards are \u2018box pieces\u2019 and when a user gets 25 of them, he\u2019s eligible to open a box and get a non-fungible token (NFT). Inviting friends with referral links also boosted the rewards.\n\nManta Pacific is a blockchain ecosystem built by Manta Network on Ethereum. It leverages Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology and uses Celestia, a modular blockchain, as its data availability layer. This architecture enables Manta Pacific to function as a zero-knowledge rollup (zk rollup) for Ethereum, offering scalability and privacy benefits.\n\nSince the start of the campaign, Manta\u2019s TVL has soared and reached an $870 million peak on January 12. However, this number could sharply decline after January 18, when users will be eligible to claim their rewards after participating in the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nA blog post published by Manta\u2019s team on January 15 reveals that 50 million MANTA tokens will be distributed to New Paradigm\u2019s participants. Another 50 million MANTA will be airdropped to users who interacted with the \u2018Into the Blue\u2019 event, which was similar to New Paradigm\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe value locked growth was not accompanied by a rise in activity and could be seen as a sign that the money flowing into Manta Pacific is coming from investors only interested in the airdrop.\n\nThus, the token distribution could be seen by investors as the end of the period when it\u2019s mandatory to lock ETH in Manta Pacific. Since 2024 is seen as \u2018airdrop season\u2019 by analysts, as Crypto Briefing reported, the money could quickly flow to other protocols where staking crypto is an eligibility requirement."

It too has possible ETF approval looming and that would do wonders for the price of the altcoin. In fact, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes there is a 70% chance that the approval by the SEC will come in May of this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he expects a 70% chance of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved in May. The SEC needs to make approval decisions on multiple Ethereum spot ETF applications by the end of May, including VanEck, Ark 21Shares and Hashdex. Digital asset lawyer\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2024\n\nElsewhere, there is another very interesting Bitcoin alternative coin going through presale called Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX). This coin provides a solution to a Bitcoin mining problem that should not only make this project a great success but also help Bitcoin hit new highs. Before we get into 5 reasons why Ethereum could propel to $5,000, let\u2019s first take a look at this new token.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix- This project is not just likely to pump itself but also help Bitcoin in 2024\n\nThe presale of Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) has been a huge success and it originally took a lot of experts off guard. What seemed like a niche crypto has raised over $8.3 million already as whales are even starting to get their share of BTCMTX.\n\nThe reason for this is that Bitcoin Minetrix could provide a solution that currently plagues the Bitcoin mining sector. This means it could not only be a success itself but could be key to Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high in 2024.\n\nThe problem it aims to tackle is how exclusive the mining of Bitcoin has become. Originally an activity anyone could do from their own home with the right equipment, has really gotten out of hand. Due to its growing popularity, Bitcoin is now mined in industrial-sized data centers that use an incredible amount of energy. This costs a lot and has thus excluded most crypto enthusiasts from mining its number one token.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nImage by Bitcoin Minetrix\n\nThe key ingredients to success are cloud mining and staking\n\nCloud mining was originally put forward as the solution but it has massive issues now too. In theory, an individual enters into a cash contract with a company that can lease the capabilities to mine. This sounds fair but the companies are charging huge deposit fees and demanding a share of the yields individuals mine. The process is also full of scammers too so it has failed as an alternative to the problem.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix understands that cloud mining is a good idea but has innovatively added staking to the mix to give the people who wish to mine control over the process. How it works is fairly simple; Investors have a choice once they stake their BTCMTX. They can keep them and earn a decent APY% and they can also unstake and sell them at any time.\n\nThere is a third option with Bitcoin Minetrix that allows investors to exchange tokens for mining credits. These credits are secondary ERC-20 tokens that have one function. That is to be burned in exchange for mining time or a share of the yields. An innovative process that is both greener and cheaper than regular Bitcoin mining. It\u2019s no wonder the presale has taken off.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\n5 reasons why Ethereum could propel to $5,000 in 2024\n\nAs we mentioned in the opening, a lot of the focus for 2024 has been on Bitcoin (BTC), but Ethereum (ETF) could well outgain it. One of the main driving forces behind the Bitcoin hype is the recently approved ETFs. Later this year the Ethereum ETFs could be approved and given that ETH has already started pumping this year, that could mean the hype could continue to drive the price toward $5k.\n\nEthereum has been making big improvements to the ecosystem, and co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently announced major roadmap updates. Single Slot Finality (SSF) is perhaps the stand-out update. It will help the proof-of-stake system run more efficiently and given the emphasis put on staking lately this should help the price pump.\n\nIt's always nice to have some experts on your side when you make a crypto forecast. Despite Solana (SOL) performing so well lately, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, recently tweeted about how he was abandoning the altcoin for Ethereum. Hayes believes ETH is on its way to $5k.\n\nFam ... I have a confession to make.\n\n\n\nI received a msg from the Lord while meditating. He said dump that Sam coin POS, and profess your love for Archangel Vitalik.\n\n\n\nSo I dumped $SOL, and bot more $ETH.$ETH = $5,000 \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 22, 2023\n\nSantiment, a behavioral analytics crypto site, released a report right at the end of 2023 that made for very good reading for ETH investors. It stated that the total supply of the altcoin on exchanges was around the 8% mark. As we know scarcity is very valuable for a cryptocurrency\u2019s worth.\n\nLastly, that same study also showed that around $28.4 million ETH had been staked, as we have covered staking is becoming more and more valuable to projects and this many staked coins give Etehereum\u2019s potential future gains a nice parachute if market conditions turn bearish at any time. Over 3.8 million ETH tokens have been burnt too which also contributes to scarcity. All the above reasons point to Ethereum hitting $5k this year.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nSo there you have our analysis on two different coins at very different ends of the spectrum but both look like they will be big gainers in 2024. Both projects are worth investing in but for the largest profit, Bitcoin Minetrix is the choice. Its low presale price means it is a low-risk option but has a chance of a big return on investment."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin has stepped into the ongoing conversation about rollups, offering a fresh perspective on how they interact with external data chains. This update comes at a time when the Ethereum community is deeply engaged in discussions about the architecture and security of layer-2 solutions.\n\nRollups in new light\n\nAt the heart of Buterin's intervention is the distinction between traditional Ethereum rollups and the \"Validium\" solution.\n\nIn a nuanced take, Buterin explained that when an Ethereum rollup uses an external data chain for data availability (DA), it transitions into a validium. This represents a shift from the earlier understanding, where Ethereum's layer-2 solutions were almost exclusively equated with rollups. Central to Buterin's explanation is the concept of an \"unconditional security guarantee,\" a hallmark of rollups that ensures users' assets are retrievable under any circumstances.\n\nHowever, this level of security may not be as robust when an external DA system is in play. Nonetheless, Buterin sees a place for validiums, suggesting that with robust distributed DA systems, they can offer a significant boost to an application's practical security.\n\nDiverse views from Ethereum community\n\nThe Ethereum community has engaged in a lively debate over the nuances of this new direction. Discussions have revolved around the implications of using various external chains, such as Celestia, as DA layers, and how these choices impact the classification of a project as a layer-2 solution.\n\nSome community members pointed out that the integration of external chains adds complexity to the layer-2 landscape and could potentially overlook the unique attributes of each solution.\n\nThere is also a concern that the security of modular blockchain systems could be compromised if any component, like the DA or execution layer, is weak.\n\nDespite these concerns, others in the community believe that categorizing these solutions as \"layer 2\" remains effective for communication purposes, especially when they use Ethereum's layer 1 for security and settlement."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Will Ascending Triangle Momentum Propel ETH to $3,400? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: ETH has recently outperformed Bitcoin, marking a significant 14% increase within a fortnight. The cryptocurrency recently surpassed the $2,500 mark, a first since May 2022. This breakthrough, fueled by robust fundamentals and growing optimistic market sentiment, sets the stage for Ethereum\u2019s potential climb to the $3,400 level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Trajectory and Market Optimism\n\nAfter reaching a multi-week high near $2,716, Ethereum price experienced a slight correction, dipping below $2,600 and $2,550. Despite this, the overall momentum remains bullish. Last week\u2019s ETF approval contributed to a surge in Ethereum\u2019s price, maintaining it above the $2,500 threshold. This upward trend presents a promising outlook for Ethereum\u2019s near-term price increase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price is currently hovering around $2,514, showcasing an impressive gain of over 64% in the past year and a 10% increase in the last month. Despite a minor 1% decrease in the past day, this significant growth suggests a predominantly positive sentiment towards Ethereum. It positions the cryptocurrency as a viable option for both long and short-term investment strategies.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis and Price Movements\n\nA cryptocurrency analyst, Ali, recently highlighted Ethereum\u2019s breakout from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Ethereum\u2019s price aims for the $3,400 target. Ali predicts a potential bullish run in the upcoming days.\n\nRemember that #Ethereum broke out from an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. Despite the short-term volatility, $ETH continues to target $3,400! pic.twitter.com/kQ2ncLuFjL \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 14, 2024\n\nThe next major resistance level for Ethereum lies near $2,600. A decisive move above this level could propel Ethereum towards the $3,000 mark and potentially even higher towards the $3,400 zone. Conversely, failure to surpass the $2,500 resistance might lead to a downward trend. The initial support level is around $2,440, with further declines potentially testing the $2,300 support.\n\nThe daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates bullish momentum, with a positive crossover observed on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen above 50, entering a neutral zone. This suggests a strong buying interest but hints at the possibility of a short-term correction. Additionally, the 20-EMA currently stands above the 50-EMA, indicating ongoing bullish pressure.\n\nThe Awesome Indicator highlights a bullish trend, overcoming a slight dip as the latest up-candle engulfs the prior down-candle. This suggests strong upward momentum. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow Indicator, at 0.06, confirms a positive market sentiment, indicating a flow of capital into the market, a sign of investor confidence.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Can Ethereum flip Bitcoin by 2030? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS puts it on course to give Bitcoin a fight.\n\nA prediction said that Ethereum\u2019s revenue could hit $51 billion by 2030 while ETH may hit $11,848.\n\nDestiny cannot be denied. It can only be delayed. This statement explains the sentiment of those who believe that Ethereum [ETH] will flip Bitcoin [BTC] by 2030. However, this discussion has been going on for a long time.\n\nBut at the time of writing, Ethereum had not yet flipped Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nDespite the state of things, some Ethereum supporters argue that the flipping would happen. AMBCrypto checked if there was any time that the smart contract blockchain came close to overtaking Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to data from Blockchain Center, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance rose to 36.9% in June 2017.\n\nAt that, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance was around 44.4%. Eventually, the flipping did not happen. But between that period and now, a lot of things have changed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s new model changes Bitcoin\u2019s operation\n\nOne of the major changes was Ethereum\u2019s move away from Proof-of-Work (PoW). Up until September 2022, both Bitcoin and Ethereum utilized the PoW consensus mechanism.\n\nThe PoW mechanism allows the verification of transactions through miners. In this case, miners get rewards for adding computation power to the network. But Ethereum stopped using that method and transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) during a major upgrade called \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nWith PoS, Ethereum no longer needs miners but validators. Here, users don\u2019t have to be miners, and they also get rewarded for validating new blocks of transactions.\n\nThis \u201cease\u201d has aided Ethereum\u2019s popularity. It is also one of the reasons some predictions are confident that Bitcoin will play second-fiddle by 2030.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has not been resting on its oars. Recent developments have proven that the Satoshi Nakamoto-developed project could be ready to fight Ethereum pound for pound.\n\nCompetition escalates between the kings\n\nThis assertion could be linked to the creation of NFTs on the Bitcoin network. During the 2021 bull market, NFTs got popular, and most of them were built on the Ethereum blockchain. For this reason, demand for ETH increased.\n\nHowever, the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals in 2023 Q1 has ensured that Ethereum has intense competition in that regard. AMBCrypto looked at CryptoSlam\u2019s data and found that Bitcoin was giving its opposite number a run for its money.\n\nAt press time, NFT seven-day sales on the Ethereum blockchain were $92.39 million. Bitcoin was a close second with $90.18 million within the same period.\n\nSo, if demand for ETH rises as a result of these assets, there is a high chance that BTC also follow. Should this remain the same case, Ethereum flipping Bitcoin by 2030 would be difficult.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum dominating the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space makes a strong case for the flipping. This is major because of its smart contract functionalities.\n\nAt the peak of the bull market in 2021, Ethereum\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $97 billion.\n\nThe TVL determines the total value of digital assets locked in a protocol. So, the increase at that time implied that market participants trusted the project enough to continuously add liquidity to it.\n\n5 figures for ETH by 2030?\n\nThis DeFi dominance is why some analysts believe that the Vitalik Buterin-led project can bite into Bitcoin\u2019s market share. For example, in May 2023, VanEck predicted that the blockchain\u2019s revenue could rise as high as $51 billion by 2023.\n\nThe research also mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s dominance among smart contracts protocols could rise to 70%. The mutual fund and ETF management firm also talked about the price, noting,\n\n\u201cIn our Base Case, we assume that Ethereum will achieve $51B in annual revenue in the year ending 4/30/2030. We deduct a validator fee from this total, 1%, and a global tax rate of 15%, and we arrive at cash flows of $42.90B to Ethereum. Assuming an FCF multiple of 33x, 120.7M token, we come to a Base Case 2030 Price Target of $11,848 per token.\u201d\n\nOn an all-time basis, ETH\u2019s price has increased by 89,382.45%. BTC, on the other hand, had seen its value rise by 68,863,742%. By comparing both prices, one can assume that ETH was undervalued massively undervalued compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there have been predictions that the Bitcoin price could rise higher. One of the reasons could be linked to the recently-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nWith the ETF approval, more institutional capital is expected to flow into Bitcoin. This could also affect the price action positively. As a result of this, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that BTC could cross the $1 million mark by 2030.\n\nEthereum flips Bitcoin here\n\nIn the meantime, analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin spot ETF approval was a signal for ETH to shine. According to him, the development could force liquidity rotation into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nBut will this lead to Ethereum flipping Bitcoin? Well, that might be hard to decide, considering that an Ethereum spot ETF could be approved before or by May 2024.\n\nRegarding the number of holders, AMBCrypto analysis of Santiment showed that BTC had 52.76 million. ETH, on the other hand, had more than double that at 112.52 million.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin by 2030? Our verdict\n\nThis data indicated that Ethereum had experienced more adoption than Bitcoin. If the growth continues in this manner, then it could increase its chances of flipping Bitcoin by 2030.\n\nAnother possible impact of the flipping is the supply. For Bitcoin, it has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This is one of the reasons Ethereum might find it hard to flip it.\n\nBecause if demand for BTC increases with its fixed supply, the price and market cap will go higher.\n\nThe supply of ETH, however, is unlimited. But the project, thanks to its burning mechanism, ensures that demand matches the ETH supply.\n\nAlso, the shift to PoS had greatly impacted the tokenomics. This is also one of the reasons market participants have stuck to ETH since it became a yield-generating asset.\n\nGiven its different use cases, demand from retail and institutions alike is expected to increase.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nBut to flip Bitcoin would be a hard nut to crack. Furthermore, 2030 is a long time to predict what would happen with both projects.\n\nBut considering the recent developments, Ethereum might get very close to flipping Bitcoin. However, it is not guaranteed that the former would surpass the number one cryptocurrency by that time."

        "content": "In a move that solidifies Manta Pacific\u2019s dominance in the industry, Binance recently introduced MANTA as its 44th project on the Launchpool.\n\nIn a recent development, Manta Pacific, the native layer 2 of Manta Network, has emerged as the fourth-largest scaling solution, surpassing Coinbase\u2019s Base, according to data from L2Beat.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s Rise to Prominence\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) on Manta Pacific currently stands at an impressive $850 million, leaving Base behind at $756 million. This shift in rankings highlights the growing prominence of Manta Pacific in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Layer 2 solutions, such as Manta Pacific, are secondary blockchains built atop primary or native blockchains to mitigate congestion issues, enhance speed, and facilitate smoother transactions.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) serves as a crucial metric in gauging the popularity of DeFi protocols. It represents the notional value of tokens deposited within a protocol, reflecting user engagement and the overall health of the platform.\n\nNotably, L2Beat\u2019s TVL methodology considers the dollar value of tokens canonically bridged, externally bridged, and natively minted. In contrast, DeFiLlama, another reputable source, focuses solely on assets actively engaged in decentralized applications. According to DeFiLlama, Manta and Base are in a tight contest for the ninth spot, both boasting a TVL of approximately $420 million.\n\nLast year, Manta Pacific transitioned to a zero-knowledge rollup, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that gained prominence in 2023 for its ability to ensure rapid transaction settlement, also known as \u201cfinality.\u201d This technological advancement has contributed to Manta Pacific\u2019s success and its ascent in the scaling solution hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, Manta Pacific\u2019s paradigm bridging program, launched in December, played a pivotal role in the platform\u2019s accelerated growth. Bridging involves transferring assets from one blockchain to another, and Manta Pacific incentivizes users by offering rewards for bridging Ethereum (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC) to its network. The layer 2 solution adopts a strategy reminiscent of Ethereum layer 2 Blast, as noted by Michael Nadeau, founder of the DeFi report.\n\nUsers bridging ETH and USDC to Manta Pacific enjoy a staking yield ranging from 4% to 5%, with their coins locked for a duration of 69 days. Depositors are also eligible for future airdrops of MANTA tokens. The program further offers NFT box pieces to depositors, and staked ETH can be re-staked on the Eigen Layer protocol.\n\nBinance Embraces Manta\n\nIn a move that solidifies Manta Pacific\u2019s dominance in the industry, Binance recently introduced MANTA as its 44th project on the Launchpool.\n\nThis integration allows Binance users to earn MANTA tokens by staking their BNB and FDUSD tokens. The addition of Manta to the Binance ecosystem introduces a modular Layer 2 solution tailored for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications. The Launchpool initiative, which began on Monday spans two days and enables users to farm MANTA tokens.\n\nAs Manta Pacific continues to gain traction and secure its position in the scaling solution landscape, the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments and innovations from this project in the DeFi space."

Ethereum (ETH) has long been regarded as the pioneer, revolutionizing the blockchain space with its introduction of smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). However, in recent times, a new player has emerged on the scene \u2013 Retik Finance (RETIK), touted by many as the giant poised to deliver better returns in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) \u2013 A Trailblazer in Blockchain Technology\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer,\u201d has been a driving force behind the adoption and development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Its compatibility with the EVM has fostered a robust ecosystem of tokens and projects. Despite its success, Ethereum faces significant challenges.\n\nETH\u2019s Scalability Issues and High Gas Fees\n\nOne of the major hurdles Ethereum grapples with is scalability. As the popularity of the platform has surged, scalability issues have led to network congestion and higher transaction costs. High gas fees, the cost associated with processing transactions on the Ethereum network, have been a point of concern for users and developers alike. These challenges have prompted a search for alternative solutions within the crypto community.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) \u2013 A Rising Star in DeFi\n\nEnter Retik Finance \u2013 a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that aims to address the limitations of existing platforms. Retik Finance has quickly gained attention for its innovative approach, leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and provide a seamless user experience. At its core, Retik Finance is designed to be a community-driven platform, allowing users to actively participate in governance and decision-making processes.\n\nRetik Finance distinguishes itself by focusing on scalability solutions. In a bid to overcome the scalability challenges faced by Ethereum, Retik Finance employs innovative technologies that enhance transaction throughput. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing platforms but also positions Retik Finance as a potential disruptor in the DeFi space. Moreover, Retik Finance places a strong emphasis on community governance. Users have a significant role in shaping the direction of the platform, fostering a sense of ownership and inclusivity. This community-driven approach sets Retik Finance apart from more traditional, centralized financial systems. One of the significant draws of Retik Finance is its commitment to lowering transaction costs. By minimizing the fees associated with transactions, Retik Finance aims to make DeFi more accessible to a wider audience. This aligns with the broader goal of democratizing finance and ensuring that financial services are not only decentralized but also cost-effective for users.\n\nThe exceptional fundraising achievements of Retik Finance underscore the project\u2019s widespread appeal and investor confidence. Raising $1 million in just nine days and subsequently attracting almost $6 million in less than a month is a testament to the project\u2019s compelling value proposition and the community\u2019s belief in its success. The presale model, featuring 10 stages with incremental token prices, has created a sense of urgency and exclusivity for early investors. Starting at an attractive price of $0.03 in the first stage and gradually increasing, the presale structure incentivizes early participation, allowing supporters to secure tokens at more favorable rates. In parallel, Retik Finance\u2019s mega $333K Giveaway adds an extra layer of excitement to the project. The chance for users to become one of the 10 winners, each receiving $33,300 worth of RETIK, adds a dynamic and engaging element to the platform\u2019s community-building efforts.\n\nEthereum vs. Retik Finance \u2013 Which Will Give Better Returns in 2024?\n\nEthereum\u2019s long-standing dominance is evident. However, increasing competition from other blockchains and layer 2 solutions poses a threat to its continued supremacy. Ethereum 2.0, an upcoming upgrade, aims to address scalability concerns by shifting to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The success of this upgrade will play a crucial role in determining Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the years to come. On the other hand, Retik Finance is positioned as an emerging player with the potential to capture market share by providing innovative solutions to existing problems. Strategic partnerships and collaborations can further propel Retik Finance into the spotlight, attracting both users and developers looking for alternatives to traditional financial systems. Ethereum\u2019s historical performance has been marked by periods of significant growth, often influenced by technical developments such as network upgrades. The anticipation and reaction of the market to these upgrades play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Retik Finance, as a newer entrant, presents a different dynamic. Its potential for growth is driven by technological advancements and the support it receives from the community. However, investing in a newer project comes with inherent risks, and investors must weigh these risks against the potential rewards. As we enter into the future of cryptocurrency in 2024, Retik Finance stands as a promising project in the arena. Its commitment to addressing scalability issues, reducing transaction costs, and fostering a community-driven ecosystem positions Retik Finance as a potential giant poised to deliver superior returns. While Ethereum has solidified its place in the history of blockchain technology, the competitive landscape is evolving, and investors must carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of both Ethereum and Retik Finance to make informed decisions in this dynamic market. The journey ahead promises exciting developments, and the stage is set for Retik Finance to make a significant impact in the years to come.\n\nAbout Retik Finance\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies on Monday evening traded mixed as the long-anticipated approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) resulted in a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.75% $42,619 Ethereum ETH/USD +0.81% $2,517 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -0.11% $0.080\n\nWhat Happened: The term \u201cSell the news\u201d is commonly used in capital markets to describe the phenomenon where asset prices, leverage, and sentiment escalate leading up to a bullish event, only to experience a subsequent decline shortly after.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, BTC retraced to a low of $41,600 before rebounding, following a brief surge to a two-year high above $49,000. This surge occurred as the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. last Thursday.\n\nThe new spot BTC ETF is anticipated to attract substantial capital from various crypto products, as outlined in a recent research report by J.P. Morgan. Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) cautious approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the market\u2019s response has been relatively subdued. The attention has now turned to the potential inflow of capital into these new ETFs.\n\n\"We are skeptical of the optimism shared by many market participants at the moment that a lot of fresh capital will enter the crypto space as a result of the spot bitcoin ETF approval,\" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Flare FLR/USD +35.65% $0.023 Blur BLR/USD +14.54% $0.65 Sei SEI/USD +13.69% $0.82\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.68 trillion, showing a 0.58% decrease in the past 24 hours.\n\nStock futures declined on Monday night as investors awaited further data and bank earnings that will offer more insight into the state of the American consumer. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 50 points, equivalent to 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures decreased by more than 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.\n\nInvestors are keeping an eye on the upcoming December retail sales data, expected to be released on Wednesday, as it may spark concerns about a potential economic slowdown if U.S. consumer spending shows signs of cooling. Economists surveyed by FactSet project a modest 0.2% increase for the month, slightly below the 0.3% rise seen in November.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe has observed that the Bitcoin ETF has yielded a negative return since its inception.\n\n\"The Bitcoin ETF has provided a massive net inflow on the first few days. More than $600 million on the first day. The real impact of the ETF will be shown in the coming few years. A mega bullish event.\"\n\nTop BTC ETFs Since Inception\n\nBitcoin ETFs Gains (Since Inception) +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) -12.3% $43.86 Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) -8.7% $38.35 VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) -10.1% $49.62\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt has suggested that BTC is poised for a corrective movement after reaching the $60,000 mark, anticipating a rapid and forceful correction. Post this anticipated pullback, DonAlt foresees a subsequent surge driving BTC to potentially reach as high as $90,000.\n\n\"If you go straight up, I think $60,000 would be a really good resistance\u2026 I think that pullback would be quite aggressive, quite quick and one that you absolutely should be buying\u2026If we hit $60,000, any pullback that you get should be a buy because at that point, we have tested $60,000 three times. I think then on the next test it wouldn't hold and then you would go to $70,000, $80,000 [or] $90,000.\"\n\nSantiment, an on-chain analytical firm indicates that in anticipation of the recent Bitcoin ETF approvals, larger Bitcoin wallets were observed to be moving older coins at a heightened pace, leading to a considerable decrease in the average age of coins held in these wallets.\n\n\"There are mild signs that this continued movement of older coins is finally done for the time being. This would increase the likelihood of crypto\u2019s bull cycle finally halting for now. With this said, a few large whales could move a large number of coins, further pushing down the BTC mean dollar invested age curve and create another wave to test $45K & perhaps $50K once again.\"\n\nPhoto by FellowNeko on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "title": "Some Traders Think New Altcoin Bitcoin Minetrix Could Outperform Ethereum in 2024 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The investment community is buzzing about the new Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) project, which launched its presale in the second half of 2023 and has raised over $8.4 million so far.\n\nSome traders believe that Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s revolutionary Stake-to-Mine protocol could even allow it to outpace Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) growth once listed on centralized exchanges this year.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Seeks to Democratize BTC Mining Through Staking Model\n\nFor those unaware, Bitcoin Minetrix is an Ethereum-based project that aims to open up BTC mining to a wider audience.\n\nBy staking BTCMTX tokens in a smart contract, users can earn \u201cmining credits\u201d that can later be redeemed for cloud mining power.\n\nThis removes the need for expensive hardware and technical expertise, which has traditionally barred entry for everyday crypto users.\n\nAs Bitcoin Minetrix runs on Ethereum, all transactions are transparent and decentralized, with miners always retaining complete control of their tokens.\n\nBTCMTX staking also generates a passive income stream for token holders \u2013 with yields currently as high as 77% per year.\n\nBy combining the BTC mining yields with these staking rewards, users can potentially generate two streams of income.\n\nThis dual-income model makes Bitcoin Minetrix particularly appealing to investors seeking diversification and recurring rewards.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the project has begun to draw attention due to its unique setup, with high-profile names like Austin Hilton reviewing Bitcoin Minetrix in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix has even undergone a smart contract audit from Coinsult \u2013 further boosting trust in the platform\u2019s security.\n\nOngoing Presale Buzz Fuels $8.4 Million Funding Raise\n\nThe project is currently in the middle of a limited-time token presale to fund its ambitious roadmap.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale began in September 2023 and is structured across multiple stages where early participants can benefit from the lowest token prices.\n\nOver $8.4 million has already been raised \u2013 demonstrating the immense interest in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s features.\n\nCurrently, BTCMTX tokens are on offer for $0.0128, although this price is only scheduled to last for one more day before rising slightly.\n\nOnce the presale ends, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on various exchanges, although specific names have yet to be released.\n\nThese listings will provide access to the broader crypto community and improve liquidity for those who invest during the presale.\n\nMembers of Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Telegram channel are already looking ahead to these listings, believing that the increased trading volume could drive sharp price increases.\n\nAdditionally, the validation that these listings will bring could attract risk-averse investors who prefer to purchase exchange-based cryptos rather than presale tokens.\n\nWith the current presale momentum showing no signs of slowing, many community members believe now is a prime opportunity to gain exposure to BTCMTX while the price is low.\n\nTraders Predict Bitcoin Minetrix to Outpace Ethereum in 2024\n\nGiven the massive momentum behind the presale, some traders think that Bitcoin Minetrix could be poised to outperform Ethereum over the next year.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum has become the go-to platform for decentralized apps and Web3 projects.\n\nHowever, after years of exponential growth, ETH may struggle to maintain the same high pace in 2024.\n\nWith a market cap exceeding $300 billion, there\u2019s a belief that Ethereum lacks the room for 10x gains at this mature stage of its lifecycle.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s innovative staking and mining model presents an intriguing opportunity.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-launched project, BTCMTX offers huge upside if its ecosystem sees rapid user adoption in the coming year.\n\nThe project\u2019s Stake-to-Mine mechanism also unlocks two potential income streams for holders, with staking yields and BTC mining rewards reinforcing its value proposition.\n\nThis design could compound investors\u2019 returns over an extended period.\n\nIn many ways, Bitcoin Minetrix finds itself in a similar position to Ethereum in the late 2010s \u2013 a new project on the brink of providing a groundbreaking concept.\n\nIf even a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s explosive growth can be achieved, Bitcoin Minetrix could establish itself as a major player in the crypto market.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.\n\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nEthereum's correction is temporary\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\n\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nBitcoin's dominance not going anywhere\n\nAfter a brief breach below the 50-day EMA \u2014 a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment \u2014 Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\n\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\n\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet."

        "content": "Despite the recent challenges in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has experienced a notable surge, increasing by 70% in the past week. This remarkable growth contrasts sharply with the overall bearish trend observed throughout 2023. Investors are now questioning whether ENS could be the symbol of recovery rising from the aftermath of the crypto crash.\n\nAs of this writing, ENS is trading for $24.6,3 down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko shows. The project has a market capitalization of $761 million, with a 31 million ENS supply in circulation.\n\nEthereum Name Service: From Frozen Depths To Soaring Heights\n\nJust months ago, ENS lay buried under a blanket of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Battered by a prolonged crypto winter and regulatory chills, it slumped to a five-year low in June 2023.\n\nYet, as the new year dawned, a thaw set in. Fueled by a surge of market confidence and a 50% price increase triggered by the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, ENS began a relentless climb, shattering its previous peak and leaving investors breathless in its wake.\n\nWhat Ignited The ENS Engine?\n\nThis strong price ascent wasn\u2019t born out of thin air. Several key factors fueled the ENS inferno:\n\nLayer-2 Endorsement: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has become a vocal champion of ENS integration with layer-2 scaling solutions. This vision of faster, cheaper transactions using human-readable ENS domains resonated with users and developers alike, painting a brighter future for the project.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has become a vocal champion of ENS integration with layer-2 scaling solutions. This vision of faster, cheaper transactions using human-readable ENS domains resonated with users and developers alike, painting a brighter future for the project. DeFi Embrace: With decentralized finance (DeFi) taking center stage in the crypto revolution, the ease and security of ENS domains have become increasingly attractive. The ability to send and receive funds using simple names like \u201calice.eth\u201d instead of long, alphanumeric wallet addresses is a game-changer for user experience.\n\nWith decentralized finance (DeFi) taking center stage in the crypto revolution, the ease and security of ENS domains have become increasingly attractive. The ability to send and receive funds using simple names like \u201calice.eth\u201d instead of long, alphanumeric wallet addresses is a game-changer for user experience. Community-Driven Flight: Unlike traditional, centralized naming systems, ENS thrives on a decentralized foundation governed by smart contracts and a DAO. This democratic approach gives users a direct say in the project\u2019s future, fostering a sense of ownership and community that fuels its growth.\n\nENS currently trading at $24.67 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nChallenges On The Horizon?\n\nEthereum Name Service is a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain, for those who are unaware. It enables users to obtain names that are legible to humans, such as \u201cbob.eth,\u201d and associate them with identifiers like addresses, content hashes, and metadata.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the sun-drenched optimism, storm clouds still linger on the horizon. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification as a security or commodity could cast a shadow on ENS\u2019s future. Additionally, the broader crypto market remains susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment, making sustained growth anything but guaranteed.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe ENS rally serves as a powerful testament to its resilience and potential. However, navigating the volatile crypto landscape demands a cautious approach. As with any investment, careful research and a measured understanding of the risks involved are paramount.\n\nOne thing is certain: with its user-friendly domain names, community-driven spirit, and increasing DeFi and layer-2 integrations, ENS has carved a unique niche in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "ETH Still Bullish Despite Drop to $2.5K, What\u2019s the Next Target? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered a substantial obstacle following a significant surge last week.\n\nThe market is currently correcting, and traders are wondering whether a reversal is on the horizon.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been very bullish over the last quarter of 2023, increasing by more than $1,000. Recently, ETH has experienced an aggressive rally toward the $2,700 resistance zone. However, this level has decisively rejected the price, and a correction toward the $2,400 area has begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index still demonstrates values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish and the price is likely to continue its uptrend after the correction is done.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is clear that ETH\u2019s price has formed a double-top pattern at the $2,700 resistance level. The relative strength index also signaled that the asset is overbought in this timeframe.\n\nCurrently, the price is forming lower highs and lows, potentially targeting the $2,400 level in the short term. Yet, this level seems likely to hold the price and initiate a rebound back toward the $2,700 level afterward, as the overall market structure is still bullish.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price is still continuing its bullish trend, some worrying signs are arising from the derivatives market. It is beneficial to have a closer look to determine whether a bearish reversal can be expected or not.\n\nThis chart depicts the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, one of the most valuable metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Values over 1 indicate that the bulls are executing their orders more aggressively, while values below 1 point to the bearish selling pressure.\n\nWhile the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has never recovered above one during the recent uptrend, the price has been rallying higher. However, it is currently dropping rapidly, making a new low. This cannot be interpreted well, and the subsequent aggressive selling pressure by the futures trader can soon cause a considerable decline in price."

        "content": "EigenLayer\u2019s weekly ETH deposits doubled.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s total value locked (TVL) soared to $1.67 billion at press time.\n\nWhile spot ETFs, real-world assets (RWA), layer-2 solutions, and other popular narratives dominate crypto-related talks these days, slowly but surely a lesser-known category was catching up \u2013 Ethereum [ETH] restaking protocols.\n\nIncrease in native ETH on restaking protocols\n\nA significant increase in native ETH deposits into restaking protocols was observed over the last week, according to on-chain analytics firm TK Research.\n\nAs per the post dated 15th of January, the biggest beneficiary was EigenLayer, with a weekly boost of 168K ETH, more than doubling from the previous week.\n\nEtherFi came a distant second with an influx of 14.45K ETH, marking an increase of nearly 28%. Renzo Protocol witnessed a jump of 4.5K ETH, equating to an impressive 55% rise.\n\nCombined, the three protocols attracted around 186.5K ETH in deposits. As per prevailing market prices, this amounted more than $470 million of ETH locked into premier restaking projects.\n\nA relatively young concept, restaking allows ETH stakers to participate in validating new software modules developed on top of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPut simply, the same ETH staked on the Ethereum network can be repurposed to extend security to other applications. The security, therefore, gets shared across the ecosystem.\n\nNote that apart from staking ETH natively, validators also have an option of staking liquid derivatives (LSDs) from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase.\n\nMoreover, validators earn extra yield in return as the staked ETH is used for securing additional applications.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nEigenLayer leads the away\n\nEigenLayer, the largest restaking protocol, saw a sharp surge in deposits since its mainnet launch in June last year. However, the growth has been meteoric over the past month. Total value locked (TVL) logged a 6x jump to $1.67 billion.\n\nThe surge followed a raise in the protocol\u2019s restaking limit to 500,000 ETH from the previous 120,000 ETH."

        "title": "Ethereum Rally Begins as This ERC-20 Presale Token Explodes - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After the approval of the first U.S. traded spot bitcoin ETFs were approved on Wednesday, the price of Ethereum soared reaching its highest level since May 2022. Meanwhile, investors still have their attention on $GFOX the presale token that is causing waves as one of the best meme coins to buy.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nWhat is $GFOX?\n\n$GFOX is the native token of the Galaxy Fox project, a meme coin project designed to proliferate and transform. Although $GFOX draws inspiration from some of the best meme coins to buy such as $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE, it offers way more than a run-of-the-mill meme coin. For example, the project has immense growth potential and offers utility-focused features that set it apart from other crypto projects.\n\nOne of the most prominent features of $GFOX is its play-to-earn game. In this game, avid gamers compete for the top 20% of positions on the leaderboard. Once the gaming season is over, winners are rewarded with in-game currencies that they can exchange for $GFOX tokens.\n\nPlayers can enhance their chances of success by purchasing temporary attribute boosters that enhance their speed, agility, and strength, to give them an edge over the competition. They can also leverage NFTS which gives them unique strengths and abilities to enhance their gameplay.\n\nSpeaking of NFTs, $GFOX is set to release a collection of 3,000 NFTs that is rumored to be the coolest NFT collection yet. Upon launch, these NFTs will be available for minting on the $GFOX website. Investors can trade their NFTs on the $GFOX marketplace or third-party sites like OpenSea.\n\nAnother reason why $GFOX is quickly gaining recognition as one of the best meme coins to buy is its growth potential. Right, from the presale, the $GFOX token is designed to give loyal investors the best returns. With each presale stage, the price of the token increases slightly, allowing early investors to make up to 5 times their investment at launch.\n\nAccording to market analysts, $GFOX is a potential 100X coin that could easily surpass well-known meme coins like $PEPE. The token burn feature, which removes part of the $GFOX tokens in supply and permanently burns them, will also play a large part in the coin\u2019s growth. Burning tokens reduces its circulating supply, hence increasing its inherent value.\n\n$GFOX has already garnered a lot of support from its growing community and avid investors who recognize it as one of the best meme coins to buy now. The project has raised over $2.64 million and hopes to raise even more as it enters stage 7 of the presale.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\n$ETH Begins Rally\n\nAs investors continue to flock to the $GFOX presale, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap $ETH has begun a new rally. $ETH is currently (at the time of writing) trading at $2,618 a 24-hour uptick of over 10%. Weekly charts show a growth of about 18% while the month-to-month chart shows a 16% increase.\n\n$ETH has underperformed many of the top altcoins for most of the year, but its recent rally has a lot to do with the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. After the SEC gave the green light for the first US Traded Bitcoin ETS, $ETH shot up by 15.5% to trade at $2,606 which is the highest the cryptocurrency has reached since May 2022.\n\nAccording to a popular crypto analyst, the positive momentum of $ETH is likely to continue in the near future. If the recent breakout is confirmed, $ETH could go for as high as $3500.\n\n>>BUY $GFOX TOKENS<<\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe crypto market is in a frenzy of excitement after the SEC approved the first Bitcoin ETFs after 10 years of waiting. Investors are eager to see the impact of these ETFs on the border crypto market, but if $ETHS\u2019 recent spike is any indication, the bulls are in control. Meanwhile, investors are looking towards $GFOX for over 100X gains in the coming months.\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.\n\nFast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.\n\nETH only exists because centralised development teams who are centralised as they can change the protocol. https://t.co/6RPBmlKniX \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) January 16, 2024\n\nBitcoin v.

On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners."

        "title": "Weekly Recap: Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana...crypto news you shouldn't have missed! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 15 Jan 2024 \u25aa 9 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nWeek after week, the world of cryptocurrencies continues to captivate and redefine the boundaries of digital finance and blockchain technology. This week was no exception, bringing its share of major developments, innovations, and surprises. In our weekly round-up, we dive into the most striking and influential stories that have shaped the crypto ecosystem. From the historic SEC approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, to Standard Chartered\u2019s bold prediction on Bitcoin\u2019s price, to the resilience of Binance Pay in the face of regulatory challenges, the prospects for ETFs for Ethereum and XRP, and the explosion of development activity on Solana, we will review the highlights of the past week.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF: The SEC says Yes!\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made a historic step by finally approving Spot ETFs for Bitcoin. This decision, long awaited by investors, marks a crucial turning point in the history of Bitcoin. Financial giants such as VanEck, Fidelity, and BlackRock now have their pass to offer innovative investment opportunities in Bitcoin. This approval is the result of a change in stance by the SEC, which had previously rejected over 20 proposals for Bitcoin ETFs. A judgment by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia played a key role, challenging the SEC\u2019s previous refusals and paving the way for this new era.\n\nHowever, the impact of this approval on the Bitcoin market was not as spectacular as expected. The price of Bitcoin had already incorporated this news, having seen a steady increase in the preceding weeks. The announcement did not cause a major upheaval in the Bitcoin price but instead led to a significant rise in altcoins. Although the future of Bitcoin with Spot ETFs remains uncertain, it is undeniably promising, clearing the way for further integration into the traditional financial system.\n\nBitcoin at $200,000? Standard Chartered anticipates a big leap\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, a renowned financial institution, forecasts a dramatic increase in the price of Bitcoin, potentially reaching $100,000 this year and doubling to $200,000 by the end of 2025. This bold prediction is based on the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, an event the bank considers a decisive moment for the normalization of institutional investor participation in the Bitcoin market. Drawing a parallel to the impact of the first gold-backed ETF, the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), on the gold market, Standard Chartered examines the potential effects of Bitcoin ETFs on the crypto market. The GLD, launched in 2004, saw an influx of $88 billion in its first year.\n\nThe bank estimates that Bitcoin could see similar growth to gold following the introduction of the GLD, but at a faster pace. Their projections suggest that between 400,000 and 1.3 million bitcoins could be held by ETFs by the end of 2024, representing a value of $50 to $100 billion.\n\nBinance Pay: Triumphs amidst the regulatory storm\n\nIn 2023, Binance Pay has demonstrated impressive resilience and growth despite a challenging regulatory environment. The platform recorded a transaction volume of $77 billion, marking an increase of 71% from the previous year. This remarkable performance is accompanied by a 70% growth in its user base, showcasing the growing adoption of cryptos for payments. Binance Pay has not only successfully navigated through the complex regulatory landscape but has also redefined the possibilities in the realm of cryptocurrency payments. With innovative features and strategic partnerships, Binance Pay has extended its influence across various sectors.\n\nBinance Pay has established itself as a cornerstone of crypto adoption, revolutionizing the financial sector, including by integrating cryptocurrencies into salary payments and loyalty programs. These initiatives have contributed to wider adoption of these assets across various industries.\n\nBitcoin 2024: Between Initial Momentum and Anticipated Decline\n\nMatrixport, an expert company in crypto investment products, predicts a turbulent year for Bitcoin in 2024. In January, Bitcoin is expected to experience an impressive increase of +17%, moving from $42,265 to $49,450. However, this climb would be short-lived. As of March, a significant drop is anticipated, with a -14% depreciation, bringing Bitcoin back to about $36,350. A rapid rise followed by an abrupt decline.\n\nAt the same time, trading signals indicate a short-term weakness for Bitcoin, with an anticipated drop of -7% in the coming two weeks. The always unpredictable Bitcoin continues to capture the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts, promising an eventful year in 2024.\n\nBanking Restrictions on Bitcoin ETFs in the United States\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marked a historical record with a volume of more than $4.5 billion on the first day, involving key players such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Tempelton. However, a surprising development emerged: millions of Americans found themselves unable to buy these Bitcoin ETFs. Major American banks, such as Vanguard, have refused to offer Bitcoin ETFs to their clients, citing the high volatility of Bitcoin as contrary to their goal of generating positive real returns over the long term.\n\nThe refusal of banks to provide access to Bitcoin ETFs has created a distinct divide between wealthy customers and others. Banks like UBS and Merrill Lynch have reserved access to Bitcoin ETFs only for their wealthiest clients, with high investment thresholds. This situation has led to frustrations among ordinary customers, many of whom are choosing to close their accounts with Vanguard. Gabor Gurbacs, an advisor at Tether and Vaneck, suggested that the banks might simply need time to integrate the new ETFs, but the immediate impact of these restrictions remains significant for many American investors.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Ethereum and XRP: Next on the ETF list?\n\nSteve McClurg, the Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Funds, expressed his optimism during an interview with Bloomberg, regarding the imminent approval of Spot ETFs for Ripple and Ethereum following the Bitcoin ETF. This regulatory advance is seen as a major positive signal for the crypto sector and paves the way for broader adoption of financial vehicles directly backed by cryptos.\n\nMcClurg highlights the growing interest of investors to diversify their holdings in cryptocurrencies. He points out the example of Grayscale, which recently added Ripple to one of its publicly traded trusts. These financial vehicles, focused on the general public, make it easier for novice investors to access cryptos. However, McClurg acknowledges that the regulatory approval process remains unpredictable, and nothing is yet fully assured.\n\nSolana: Explosive Growth with 2,500 Active Developers\n\nThe Solana blockchain stands out in the crypto universe with impressive growth, recording a 50% increase in developer retention over the past three months. With over 2,500 active developers monthly, Solana demonstrates the robustness and vitality of its ecosystem. This significant increase, reflecting heightened activity on the network, is a powerful indicator of Solana\u2019s health, which is positioning itself among the biggest crypto blockchains. It\u2019s important to note that these figures focus solely on contributions to public repositories. Concurrently, this growth in developer retention coincides with a spectacular surge in activity on Solana\u2019s crypto ecosystem. The cryptocurrency SOL saw a meteoric rise of 500% between October and December, fueled by the frenzy around MEME coins based on SOL, briefly propelling SOL ahead of BNB in terms of market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite this impressive growth, Developer Report data indicates a downturn in activity on Solana for a period. As of October 1st, the number of developers was only 946, a decrease from the all-time high of 2,634 reached on December 22, 2022. In comparison, the total number of active monthly developers on Ethereum was 4,769 on October 1st, 2023, showing a 22% decrease from its peak of 7,433 reached on June 16, 2022.\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of what to remember for this week.

        "content": "What caused the Bitcoin (BTC) dump post ETF approval? Is it time to look towards Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance?\n\nIn a recent unforeseen turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a dramatic fluctuation in its price, prompting a market-wide reevaluation and a shift of focus towards Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance.\n\nThe Cause of Bitcoin\u2019s Dump: A Social Media Fiasco\n\nThe cause of the turmoil was a social media post by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The crypto community initially met the news with elation, leading to a 2.5% surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $47,900. This spike was short-lived, however, as the information proved to be false \u2013 the result of the SEC\u2019s account being compromised. Once this was realised, Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted by nearly 6% to $45,100 before later declining more to $42,816 as of writing, leaving investors in a state of confusion and uncertainty. This incident raised concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s price stability and its susceptibility to market manipulation based on unverified news. Asgard Markets\u2019 co-founder Alex Kr\u00fcger commented that this volatility indicates Bitcoin might not rally as much as anticipated, even if a real ETF approval occurs. However, if you are looking for significant gains, now might be the time to look towards Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK).\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Steadfast Contender\n\nAmidst the Bitcoin turbulence, Ethereum emerged as a more stable investment choice. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, ETH experienced a 5% increase in value, reaching $2,653.8 \u2013 its highest since May 2022. This surge was fueled by expectations that Ethereum-based ETFs might be next in line for approval. The growing interest in Ethereum can be attributed to its robust blockchain network and its recent transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This transition not only improves the network\u2019s scalability and efficiency but also positions Ethereum as a more sustainable and innovative platform in the blockchain space.\n\nRetik Finance: A Rising Star in DeFi\n\nIn the backdrop of the crypto market\u2019s volatility, Retik Finance has emerged as a formidable force, breaking records in its presale stage. Recently, Retik Finance achieved a new milestone by raising over $8 million in the fifth week of its presale, surpassing many other tokens in terms of speed and investor interest.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nWhat Makes Retik Finance Attractive?\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s appeal lies in its innovative approach to bridging the gap between traditional fiat and cryptocurrencies. Its range of services includes a DeFi debit card that allows for seamless transactions using crypto assets, akin to traditional fiat transactions. This level of integration is particularly appealing to investors looking for practical uses of cryptocurrencies in daily life. Additionally, Retik Finance offers a non-custodial wallet, providing users with complete control over their assets. This focus on security and user autonomy is crucial in a market that is increasingly concerned with data privacy and asset safety.\n\nInvestor Confidence and Future Prospects\n\nThe significant investor interest in Retik Finance\u2019s presale is a testament to the project\u2019s potential and the growing demand for innovative DeFi solutions. The platform\u2019s ability to offer a seamless bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds, coupled with its focus on security and scalability, makes it an attractive investment opportunity, especially in a time of market uncertainty. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the shift towards platforms offering practical, real-world applications for digital assets becomes increasingly apparent.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are always on the lookout for signs of a bullish trend in the market. After a period of volatility and uncertainty, three key indicators suggest a bull run is on the horizon. In this article, we will explore these indicators and why Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) are poised to lead the charge in the next crypto bull run.\n\nInstitutional Adoption on the Rise\n\nOne of the most promising indicators of a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market is the increasing adoption by institutional investors. Over the past year, major financial institutions and corporations have shown a growing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has gained significant attention from institutional investors. Companies like Grayscale, Galaxy Digital, and others have added Ethereum to their portfolios, recognizing its potential as a store of value and a platform for decentralised applications. Retik Finance, a relatively new entrant to the cryptocurrency space, has also garnered interest from institutional investors. Its innovative approach to bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies has piqued the curiosity of financial institutions looking to diversify their holdings. The influx of institutional capital into Ethereum and Retik Finance is a clear indicator of the growing acceptance and recognition of these cryptocurrencies as valuable assets. As more institutions allocate funds to these projects, it is expected to drive up demand and contribute to a bullish market sentiment.\n\nNFTs and DeFi Ecosystems Thriving\n\nThe explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystems is another strong indicator that a bull run is underway. Ethereum has been at the forefront of both NFTs and DeFi, providing the infrastructure for these groundbreaking innovations. NFTs, which represent unique digital assets, have gained mainstream attention, with high-profile sales of digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate. Ethereum\u2019s robust smart contract capabilities make it the preferred platform for creating and trading NFTs. As the NFT market continues to expand, Ethereum\u2019s value is expected to rise in tandem. Retik Finance also plays a role in this ecosystem by offering DeFi solutions and smart contracts. Its focus on making cryptocurrency transactions and spending more accessible and user-friendly positions it well to benefit from the growing DeFi trend. As DeFi protocols gain adoption and usage, the demand for Retik Finance\u2019s services is likely to increase, potentially driving up the value of its native token.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nStrong Community Support and Development\n\nA thriving cryptocurrency project requires a strong and dedicated community of supporters and developers. Both Ethereum and Retik Finance boast vibrant communities that are actively engaged in the growth and development of their respective ecosystems. Ethereum\u2019s open-source nature has attracted a global community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to its continuous improvement. The Ethereum community is known for its collaborative spirit and commitment to advancing the platform\u2019s capabilities. Recent upgrades like the London Hard Fork, the Ethereum 2.0 transition, and the upcoming Ethereum \u2018Dencun\u2019 upgrade demonstrate the project\u2019s commitment to scalability and sustainability. Retik Finance, while newer to the scene, has also cultivated a dedicated community of believers who see the project\u2019s potential to revolutionize the financial industry. The ongoing success of Retik Finance\u2019s presale stages and the completion of a Certik audit have further solidified its community\u2019s confidence. The synergy between a strong community and active development is a hallmark of successful cryptocurrency projects. Ethereum and Retik Finance have both demonstrated their ability to harness community support and drive innovation, setting the stage for further growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is showing clear signs of a bullish trend, with institutional adoption on the rise, NFTs, and DeFi ecosystems thriving, and strong community support and development. Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) are well-positioned to lead the charge in this anticipated bull run. Ethereum\u2019s status as a dominant force in the crypto space, coupled with its ongoing upgrades and institutional backing, makes it a frontrunner for significant price appreciation. Retik Finance, with its innovative approach to bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrencies and the support of its growing community, is also poised for substantial growth. Investors and enthusiasts alike should keep a close eye on these two cryptocurrencies as they navigate the exciting and dynamic landscape of the cryptocurrency market. With the indicators pointing towards a bull run, Ethereum and Retik Finance may offer promising opportunities for those looking to capitalise on the next wave of crypto momentum.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

This strategic move aligns with Chirpley\u2019s vision to broaden the reach of CHRP holders within the vibrant crypto community. While the Chirpley platform remains rooted in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as its primary hub, CHRP is now accessible and tradable on the Ethereum chain.\n\nEthereum Integration: Elevating CHRP Accessibility\n\nChirpley has officially gone live on the Ethereum chain, marking a significant milestone in the platform\u2019s evolution.

        "title": "Ethereum and ETH Classic Prices Skyrocket \u2013 Right Time to Buy? - Augusta Free Press",
        "content": "Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved the BTC spot ETFs on January 10th after almost 15 years of waiting and multiple failed applications.\n\nThe experts predicted that this will spark a bull rally across the whole crypto market, and those predictions have hit the bullseye.\n\nEvery major crypto is rallying with ETH Classic (ETC) at the front with over 50% rise in the last 24 hours and 50% in the last week. Ethereum (ETH) is also riding the bulls with an 18% price bump over the last week.\n\nHowever, experts suggest that this might be the worst time to accumulate them due to the high prices, and suggest Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) because of the low presale price and 100X potential once it hits the market.\n\nLet\u2019s check out the details.\n\nGet the Best Presale Project Now\n\nWhy Are Ethereum and ETH Classic Rising and Will the Price Retract Soon\n\nThe recent rise in Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) prices can be attributed to several factors, most notably the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nInitially, there was confusion and market excitement due to a fake post from the SEC\u2019s X account announcing the approval, which was later clarified by Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, as unauthorized.\n\nDespite the initial fake news, the SEC did eventually approve Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin spot ETF application.\n\nThis approval seemed to have a more pronounced effect on altcoins than on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin\u2019s price saw a modest increase, briefly reaching around $47,000, Ethereum experienced a more substantial rise of about 10% and was trading above $2,600, marking its highest point in 20 months since May.\n\nEven more impressive was the performance of Ethereum Classic, which saw a 50% increase in its price. Its trading volume also soared by 343%, reaching $2.5 billion.\n\nThis spike in both price and trading volume suggests further potential growth, with its market capitalization crossing the $4.5 billion mark.\n\nHowever, amidst this bullish sentiment, some industry experts caution against purchasing these assets at their current high prices.\n\nThey predict that these heightened values, especially post the BTC ETF approval hype, are likely to retract.\n\nAs an alternative, they suggest considering new derivatives like Bitcoin Minetrix, which aims to democratize the mining industry. The industry is widely accepting this new project, which is evident in the $8M funding.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Presale Explodes to Over $8M \u2013 New Era in Bitcoin Mining\n\nThe BTC ETF approval also had a massive impact on the presale market. The new BTC derivative quickly surpassed over $8 million in funding when the SEC announced the approval.\n\nThe presale\u2019s strategic price increments of 10% at each stage have also catalyzed early investments, contributing to the growing popularity of the project.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix adheres to the ERC-20 standard and offers a thoughtful distribution of its 4 billion token supply: 42.5% reserved for the presale, 35% for marketing, 12.5% for the crucial staking mechanism, and 10% for community-centric projects.\n\nThe innovative approach of Bitcoin Minetrix in its staking rewards system is one of the reasons for its exponential growth.\n\nIt uniquely offers mining power rather than direct $BTCMTX tokens, reinventing the traditional staking model and presenting a lucrative opportunity for investors seeking both staking benefits and participation in the transformative world of Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe project\u2019s $BTCMTX token, currently priced at an attractive $0.0128, is selling out sooner than expected, so we have to warn you to act fast if you want to get a chance at the predicted 100X gains.\n\nBuy the Bitcoin Minetrix Token Now\n\nHere\u2019s How Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Stake-to-Mine Mechanism Changes the Mining Industry\n\nOkay, now you\u2019re aware of the presale success that BTCMTX had in the last two months, but you might be wondering where that investor trust comes from.\n\nWell, the main reason is the groundbreaking Stake-to-Mine model, which offers a simplified and accessible approach to Bitcoin mining.\n\nUnlike traditional mining methods that require costly hardware and technical know-how, Bitcoin Minetrix democratizes the process.\n\nBy staking $BTCMTX tokens, investors gain access to cloud computing resources, enabling them to participate in Bitcoin mining effortlessly. This unique approach not only makes mining more accessible but also addresses the challenges and costs associated with conventional mining methods.\n\nWhat sets Bitcoin Minetrix apart is its transparent and decentralized system. All mining operations and credit allocations are handled on-chain, ensuring transparency and security.\n\nThis strategy is a welcome change from the notorious scams in third-party cloud mining services, offering a more reliable and user-centric approach.\n\nAs Bitcoin Minetrix gears up for its official launch, the excitement among investors continues to build.\n\nThe combination of innovative mining solutions, high staking APY, and a well-structured token distribution makes Bitcoin Minetrix a standout choice for those seeking to dive into the world of Bitcoin mining without the traditional barriers.\n\nBuy the Bitcoin Minetrix Token Now\n\nConclusion\n\nThe BTC ETF approval came sooner than expected, and it triggered a significant market upswing, affecting altcoins even more than BTC itself.\n\nEthereum and ETH Classic surged the most, and they will continue on their trajectory for the time being. However, they\u2019re now out of reach for any significant profits like 10X or more.\n\nIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, Bitcoin Minetrix might be a better option. But, don\u2019t wait for too long, as BTCMTX is selling out much faster than expected."

        "title": "2 Cryptos To Perform the Best in 2024: Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Two cryptocurrencies poised for exceptional performance are Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK). Ethereum, recognized as the pioneering force in smart contracts and decentralized applications, continues to solidify its standing with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, addressing scalability concerns and fostering sustainability. On the other hand, Retik Finance emerges as a rising star, boasting innovative features like futuristic DeFi Debit Cards and rapid fundraising success, having gained $1 million in just nine days and nearing $6 million in less than a month. As both Ethereum and Retik Finance contribute distinctive strengths and fresh perspectives to the cryptocurrency space, they stand out as promising projects for investors seeking diversified opportunities in the dynamic market of 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the \"world computer,\" has been a stalwart in the cryptocurrency space since its inception. As the first platform to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum has played a transformative role in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized application (DApp) landscapes. In 2024, Ethereum's continued prominence is driven by several key factors. Firstly, Ethereum 2.0 represents a major upgrade that addresses scalability concerns by transitioning to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This upgrade aims to enhance transaction speed and reduce energy consumption, making Ethereum a more sustainable and efficient blockchain platform. Secondly, Ethereum's thriving ecosystem remains a key driver of its success. The platform hosts a multitude of decentralized applications, from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. The versatility and adoption of Ethereum position it as a reliable and robust choice for developers and users alike.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK)\n\nRetik Finance emerges as a rising star in the cryptocurrency space, showcasing innovation and ambition in the decentralized finance sector. The project introduces a range of groundbreaking features that aim to redefine global transactions. As we look ahead to 2024, several factors contribute to Retik Finance's potential to perform exceptionally well. One of Retik Finance's standout features is its futuristic DeFi Debit Cards, which bring a new level of accessibility and security to financial transactions. The platform also offers a Smart Crypto Payment Gateway, AI-Powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending, and a Multi-Chain Non-Custodial Highly Secured DeFi Wallet, catering to a diverse set of financial needs within the crypto community. Retik Finance's rapid fundraising success further underscores its potential. Raising $1 million in just nine days and approaching $6 million in less than a month, the project has captured the attention and trust of the crypto community. The ongoing presale, structured across 10 stages, has seen significant participation, surpassing $8.34 million in total funds raised.\n\nComparative Analysis: Ethereum vs. Retik Finance\n\nWhile Ethereum and Retik Finance operate within the broader cryptocurrency space, they bring distinct features and strengths to the table. Ethereum's established reputation, widespread adoption, and ongoing upgrades position it as a reliable and foundational choice. On the other hand, Retik Finance's rapid ascent, commitment to innovation, and privacy-centric approach appeal to users seeking fresh perspectives within the DeFi landscape. As we step into 2024, Ethereum and Retik Finance emerge as compelling choices with unique strengths and innovations. Ethereum, with its proven track record and ongoing upgrades, remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency space. Meanwhile, Retik Finance's rapid ascent, innovative features, and privacy-centric approach position it as a disruptor in the DeFi landscape. Whether investors opt for the reliability of Ethereum or the potential growth of Retik Finance, both cryptocurrencies contribute to the dynamic and ever-evolving narrative of the crypto market in the coming year.\n\nAbout Retik Finance\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) project revolutionizing global transactions with its innovative suite of financial solutions.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEver wished you could run endlessly through a sewer? Soon you\u2019ll be able to\u2014again\u2014as Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs is bringing back its Dookey Dash game in a new free-to-play \u201cUnclogged\u201d edition thanks to a collaboration with game studio Faraway.\n\n\u201cLooks like Curtis needs to get the plunger out, there\u2019s something in the toilet,\u201d a post from Yuga Labs reads.\n\nThe crypto startup will bring Dookey Dash back sometime this quarter, according to the post. In the single-player original Dookey Dash, gamers had to race through a 3D sewer tunnel as an ape riding a vehicle underwater to gain as many points as possible while avoiding obstacles that, if hit, would eliminate them from the game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnlike the first release\u2014which required a Sewer Pass NFT on Ethereum, granted free to Bored Ape and Mutant Ape NFT owners\u2014anyone will be able to play the sewer-themed endless runner.\n\nToken benefits for BAYC, MAYC, Kodas, BAKC, and HV-MTL. pic.twitter.com/4RHnb2tKtN \u2014 Yuga Labs Gaming (@yugalabsgaming) January 16, 2024\n\nDookey Dash saw quite a bit of competition during its previous launch. Back in February 2023, the pro Fortnite player known as \u201cMongraal\u201d won the first version of Dookey Dash with the highest score\u2014and sold his winning NFT key to billionaire Adam Weitsman for $1.63 million.\n\nThat said, those who do hold Yuga Labs Ethereum NFTs like Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Kodas, Bored Ape Kennel Club dogs, and HV-MTL Forge NFTs will be eligible for \u201ctoken benefits,\u201d according to the company. The trailer posted to Twitter shows ApeCoin logos, suggesting the Ethereum token for Yuga\u2019s Bored Ape ecosystem will be given out as rewards. However, a Yuga Labs representative would not confirm that detail.\n\nThe new Dookey Dash: Unclogged game will be released for iOS, Android, Mac desktop, and Windows desktop users\u2014suggesting it won\u2019t be a web browser-based game like before. Mobile and desktop app-based games tend to run more smoothly and securely than browser-based games, so this is a win for fans of the stinky original.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bored Ape and gaming influencer known as The Fortnite Guy or \u201cTFG,\u201d who was part of the latest Dookey Dash playtest and Yuga Labs\u2019 gaming council, added Tuesday that the game is slated for a mid-February launch and that select Yuga NFT holders may get more NFTs via the game.\n\nTFG showed a video that displays different playable character skins, new game vehicles, a leaderboard, and purchasable in-game currencies in the new upcoming game version. Yuga Labs\u2019 official gaming account on Twitter shared TFG\u2019s video.\n\nThe new version of Dookey Dash appears to offer \u201cCoins,\u201d \u201cBoosters,\u201d \u201cEnergy,\u201d \u201cSkip-It\u201d passes, and other items available for purchase using fiat currency. TFG also stated that coins can be earned by playing the game.\n\nDOOKEY DASH IS BACK!\ud83e\udd2f I've been invited to the @YugaLabsGaming council to playtest, create content, and work alongside the Yuga team to improve the game ahead of launch!\ud83d\ude4f There is SO MUCH new information about the game and I created a full length video discussing the updates\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MLFqaEw8e0 \u2014 TFG (@TFGmykL) January 16, 2024\n\nThe video also shows a new \u201cSewer Rank\u201d system to show the game\u2019s different competitive tiers. There\u2019s Amateur at the bottom, followed by Semi-Pro, Professional, All-Star, Champion, Hall of Famer, and GOAT listed as the game\u2019s ranked tiers, each with a different respective \u201cboost\u201d percentage. Players will be able to select different boosters before the game starts, with options like a \u201cslow booster,\u201d a \u201cmagnet booster,\u201d and a \u201cpower shart,\u201d for example.\n\nPresumably, the slow booster slows down the game to make it easier to navigate the cramped tunnels, while the magnet pulls in desirable items for the player to collect, and the \u201cpower shart\u201d is\u2026 well, mostly likely Dookey Dash\u2019s version of a very putrid nitro boost through the cartoonish game world.\n\nThe game\u2019s updated version and re-release appears to be an effort to draw in the broader crypto community. Hopefully, this new version won\u2019t suffer from quite the same levels of reported cheating and boosting as its original.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The Solana developer ecosystem boasts more than 2,500 monthly active developers engaged in open-source repositories, Solana said in a report.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL has surged by over 700% since reaching its market low at the end of 2022, with activity driven by dedicated developers working on interesting projects across the ecosystem. This drew the interest of Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum.\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive\ud83e\uddbe\ud83e\uddbe \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 29, 2022\n\nAccording to Solana Foundation, there is a continual influx of professional developers joining the ecosystem, and the developer environment is progressively maturing.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n\u201cThis past year [2023], we have had a steady number of around 2500 \u2013 3000 monthly active developers building on Solana throughout the year.\n\nMoreover, throughout 2023, 3-month developer retention within the Solana ecosystem has increased from 31% to >50%, keeping more developers that join in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSolana has actively cultivated a good experience for developers by making onboarding easier and providing assistive documentation and scaffolding, making joining the ecosystem a clearer choice for developers.\n\nDespite its relatively recent establishment, with the Solana mainnet beta going live in March 2020, the developer ecosystem has rapidly expanded, positioning it as the second-largest ecosystem in terms of total monthly active developers.\n\n\u201cThrough multiple developer bootcamps that vary in focus and difficulty, there are 400 -500 senior developers graduating every 6 months with the intention of building on Solana. Data from the recent Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon shows that ~50% of the top 150 submissions and ~50% of the winners had completed one of these bootcamps.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Solana Foundation\n\nOver half of the developers entering the ecosystem possess a minimum of three years of experience, contributing to a more seasoned level of input in the development of applications on the network.\n\nThe Solana Foundation\u2019s latest hackathon, HyperDrive, witnessed the participation of representatives from 151 countries.

        "content": "Ethereum price is holding up very well at the key psychological level of $2,530 amid a volatile Bitcoin price action. However, the ETH/BTC pair had its 2nd consecutive red day as ETH lost its value against Bitcoin.\n\nIn the last 24 hrs, KLAY, FLR, BLUR, SEI and CHZ are the only digital assets with double-digit gains among the top 100 coins. Injective Protocol (INJ) price also remained bullish and had gained 6% till press time.\n\nSEI emerged as the leading smart contract asset as SEI price extended its weekly gain on Tuesday morning. At press time, the altcoin was up 1.62%. This bullish price action comes after a 15,87% surge yesterday.\n\nThe volume has fallen drastically after a massive surge in the trading volume last week due to the speculation around spot Bitcoin ETF. Nevertheless, the low time frame dip in Bitcoin price at the start of the week was still fully absorbed almost instantly. As a result, the pioneering cryptocurrency is changing hands at $42,709 at the time of writing.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nETH price outperformed BTC by 17% last week despite a double digit drop in the latter. This pointed toward a flow of capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum as the traders profited after the historic approval of spot ETF. Another reason behind this strength was the expectation of an ETH ETF approval by this summer.\n\nETH is trading sideways this week after briefly trading above $2,700 last week. The following chart shows how the price is struck within the $2,460-2,592 range. In case of a breakdown below this range, price might have another 10% drop from current levels.\n\nInjective (INJ) Price Targets $43.3\n\nDespite an 11% rise on the first trading day of the week, INJ price remains stuck within a specific range as mentioned in the following chart. The sideways chop is likely to continue, but the bullish target of $43.3 might be reached in the next few days. This will also mark a retest of the current range high.\n\nBONK Price Drops For The 2nd Day\n\nLast week\u2019s correction in Bitcoin has also affected BONK price, which was showing a significant recovery from its monthly lows of $0.00000933. The following chart reveals how the Solana memecoin is currently facing resistance from the $0.00001742 level. Bulls must flip this level into strong support to aim for a significant upside.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "After the Bitcoin ETF approval, we\u2019ve seen the market finally showing some impressive bull signs, with both BTC and ETH recording an uptick in the past few days.\n\nBut many investors are wondering \u2013 which of these two leading cryptocurrencies will dominate 2024 and outperform the other?\n\nMany believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have 2-3x potential in the upcoming months\u2026 but unfortunately, if skyrocketing your portfolio is the goal, these gains won\u2019t cut it.\n\nInstead, you should look at presale cryptos like Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX), which is making headlines left and right due to its enormous profit potential and hot presale results.\n\nLet\u2019s check out the deets.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nWhich One Is the Better Buy in 2024 \u2013 Bitcoin vs. Ethereum\n\nThe current surge in Bitcoin is primarily fueled by investor anticipation surrounding the introduction of a new spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnother pivotal factor contributing to the Bitcoin momentum is the halving event, a rare occurrence that happens once every four years. The next one is slated for April and is poised to be a focal point in the crypto market discussions this year.\n\nHistorical data from three prior halving events indicates a notable surge in Bitcoin prices, leading many investors to anticipate a similar outcome this time. Speculations are that Bitcoin might breach the $100,000 mark by the year-end.\n\nDue to all of this, we\u2019ve seen BTC rise by 8% in the last month.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nAs for Ethereum, while it might lack identical catalysts to Bitcoin, it\u2019s actively engaged in enhancing its overall blockchain architecture.\n\nEthereum aims to address the unfulfilled promises made during The Merge transition, focusing on creating a more energy-efficient network. key lies in the potential impact of improvements such as reduced fees, faster transaction speeds, and increased overall throughput.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nEthereum\u2019s versatility extends across major blockchain and crypto niches, including NFTs, DeFi, blockchain gaming, the Metaverse, and Web3.\n\nHowever, when choosing between the two, it seems likelier that Bitcoin will have a better 2024 \u2013 especially if it manages to reach the $100k mark.\n\nBut there\u2019s one more token that can outperform both of the leading cryptos \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX).\n\nWith 100x potential in the upcoming months, investors are calling $BTCMTX the next \u201cmillionaire token\u201d, so let\u2019s check out why this is the case.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Surpasses the $8M Milestone as Investor Confidence Hits All-Time High \u2013 Short Window Left to Capture the Low Price of $BTCMTX\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is currently in its presale, offering tokens at $0.0126 each.\n\nTime is of the essence for potential investors, given the impressive $8M already raised in a remarkably brief period. The token is now in the fifth phase of the presale, witnessing a 10% price increase with each stage, a strategy that significantly contributes to the project\u2019s early popularity.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s token, $BTCMTX, follows the ERC-20 standard and has a capped total supply of 4 billion tokens.\n\nAs far as distribution goes, we can see 42.5% of tokens allocated for the presale, 35% for marketing, 12.5% dedicated to staking, and the remaining 10% allocated to community projects.\n\nNotably, the $BTCMTX token plays a pivotal role in staking on the Bitcoin Minetrix platform, integral to its Bitcoin mining process. This unique staking system is designed to foster demand for the token, maintaining a balanced market scenario.\n\nAnother big feature of Bitcoin Minetrix is its approach to staking rewards. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, the rewards primarily come in the form of mining power rather than $BTCMTX tokens, offering a novel twist to the typical staking reward system. But we\u2019ll cover that in detail below.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Makes Headlines as the \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d Approach Attract Wider Industry Attention \u2013 80x Profits After the Listing?\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is generating buzz among investors for its groundbreaking \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d approach to Bitcoin mining.\n\nDeveloped on the Ethereum blockchain, this project introduces a user-friendly method, allowing individuals to passively earn Bitcoin without the need for technical expertise.\n\nThe platform aims to democratize Bitcoin mining, eliminating the necessity for expensive hardware and specialized skills. Users can engage in cloud mining by staking their $BTCMTX tokens, streamlining the mining process.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix effectively addresses common challenges associated with Bitcoin mining, including complexity and high entry costs. Its token-based system enhances decentralization and security, setting it apart from conventional cloud mining services. This approach lowers barriers for crypto enthusiasts, providing a more accessible entry point into Bitcoin mining.\n\nStaking tokens on Bitcoin Minetrix not only grants users \u201cmining credits\u201d for cloud mining power but also unlocks two income streams: potential staking rewards of up to 87% annually and a share of mining profits.\n\nThis dual-revenue model becomes a compelling attraction for individuals interested in both cryptocurrency mining and staking, offering a unique value proposition in the market.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have a good chance of doubling or even tripling their current value in the upcoming months. Though, some investors give credit to BTC as the token that will perform at least a bit better out of the two.\n\nBut are you really satisfied with 2-3x profits?\n\nWhy settle for smaller gains when presale tokens like Bitcoin Minetrix can easily bring 50-100x profits in the upcoming months, if everything goes according to plan.\n\nNot only does $BTCMTX have one of the hottest presales in the industry, but it also plans on revolutionizing its market with the innovative stake-to-mine approach.\n\nAnd the best thing is \u2013 you can still capture the low prices before the presale concludes!\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Weekend chop extends to new week amid MLK holiday vibes - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price remains below the bullish confines of the ascending parallel channel with the potential for extended fall before possible recovery.\n\nEthereum price could drop 5% with ETH bulls likely taking a breather before the next leg north.\n\nRipple price recovery rally is still intact above the ascending trendline despite a looming 5% correction.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains broadly bullish but continues to suffer in the wake of the past weekend\u2019s chop as the new week starts with a US holiday. Amid GBTC redemption woes, BTC slipped below the ascending channel, where it remains as the US market commemorates the Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) holiday.\n\nGM \u2600\ufe0f\n\n\n\n$BTC not celebrating MLK properly\n\n\n\nBack to looking like crap, still weekend chop i guess because of the holiday\u2026but 41k remains the number and those are still red dots\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KMs95We0Wb \u2014 Shardi B Trading #teamshardi (@ShardiB2) January 15, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) price suffers the wake of an overbought asset with ETH bulls looking to revitalize as Ripple (XRP) fights to sustain a recovery rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price crashes as GBTC dumps, but bullish outlook still not under threat\n\nBitcoin price endures an extended weekend with downside odds prevailing\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is holding above the $40,726 support after falling below the ascending parallel channel. While the slump threatened BTC\u2019s upside potential, the big-picture outlook remains bullish as long as $30,000 is not breached.\n\nMeanwhile, technical indicators suggest a stiff tug-of-war between the bulls and bears. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) resists the downside after crossing below the signal line (yellow band). The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator also hint at a transition from green to red, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) teases with a crossover below its signal line (orange band).\n\nIf the bears have their way, Bitcoin price could descend below $40,726, with the fall likely to extrapolate to the $37,800 range. If this level fails to hold as support, the next logical target would be the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, with both the AO and MACD still in the positive territory, the bulls still have a presence in the BTC market. The position of the RSI at 68 also shows there is more room north before consideration of an overbought asset.\n\nBitcoin price could recover, pushing back into the confines of the ascending channel. Enhanced buyer momentum could see BTC flip the midline of the channel into support above the $48,000 psychological level. Such a move would pave the way for Bitcoin price to eye the $50,000 target, 16% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF launch: A turning point or a teething stage?\n\nEthereum price risks bearish takeover as bulls take a breather\n\nEthereum (ETH) price teases with a possible correction after ETH was overbought over the weekend, indicated by the RSI trending above 70. In the aftermath, a pullback could be underway amid buyer exhaustion as the momentum indicator now appears subdued, moving horizontally.\n\nThe bears having their way could see Ethereum price descend 5% to find possible support at $2,388, levels last tested on crypto\u2019s watershed moment, January 10. A break and close below this level could see ETH descend past $2,200 to the $2,135 support level. In the dire case, the PoS token could descend to the $1,935 support, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, with the bulls still in play, evidenced by the green histogram bars of the AO and the MACD above the signal line, the Ethereum price could push north. This could see ETH clear the range high at $2,717. In a highly bullish case, the gains could see ETH record a higher high, bringing the $3,000 psychological level in sight.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum likely to steal Bitcoin's spotlight after ETFs historic win\n\nRipple price risks a 5% slump\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues to consolidate alongside an ascending trendline as part of a recovery rally. However, with the RSI below 50 and both the AO and the MACD in the negative territory, the odds favor the downside. With this, Ripple price could descend 5% to test the $0.5442 support.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, considering Ripple price recently tagged the Fair Value Gap (FVG) that extends from $0.4927 to $0.5111, the inefficiency in the XRP market has been filled. With there being no effective pull on Ripple price to the south, the bulls could push the price north.\n\nEnhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price clear the resistance due to the descending trendline, bringing the $0.6500 level in sight as XRP price collects sell-side liquidity residing above the trendline. In a highly bullish case, the payments token\u2019s market value could reach the $0.7000 psychological level, 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price eyes $0.700 despite SEC\u2019s move to subpoena Ripple\u2019s financial statements"

        "title": "Arbitrum (ARB) and Ethereum (ETH) Whales Diversify With Pullix (PLX) as Presale Nears $3.6M - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Arbitrum (ARB) is bullish on the charts, and following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum (ETH) is in a position where it could make monumental gains. The Pullix (PLX) presale has also seen monumental growth as whales are turning their attention to it. So far, it has raised over $3.6 million, and at this rate of growth, it can become one of the hottest altcoins for 2024. We will go over each one of these projects and determine which one is worth jumping into the most.\n\nPullix (PLX) Will Be Community-Driven and Combine CEX and DEX Elements\n\nPullix (PLX) will create a vast ecosystem that can solve key liquidity and transparency issues in the industry. By combining some of the most influential elements seen in CEXs and DEXs, it can be a gateway to an all-in-one platform that\u2019s driven by its community.\n\nThe platform will even leverage blockchain technology and let users access yield farming. By doing so, they can gain the capability of staking their crypto balance whilst accessing liquidity provisions.\n\nEvery user will begin trading perpetual futures, contract for differences (CFDs), and can even get access to the secure storage of their cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, they can even get access to an NFT Launchpad and a DeFi ecosystem that will provide them with additional investment opportunities.\n\n\ud83e\udd8e It\u2019s official \u2013 Pullix is now listed on CoinGecko! \ud83d\ude80 Link: https://t.co/L7cW3c1SJW Make sure to head on over and add Pullix to your watchlists! Like + Repost + Share a screenshot of $PLX on your watchlist below for a chance to win $100 in $PLX tokens!! \ud83d\udcb8 Winner will be\u2026 \u2014 Pullix (@Pullixmarkets) January 7, 2024\n\nAs one of the latest DeFi projects, it has the potential to surge the most. During Stage 6 of its blockchain ICO, it trades at $0.08. At launch, analysts expect a major rally of 100x, especially following its listing on Tier-1 exchanges.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Climbs Over 100% \u2013 Is a Value of $3 Possible?\n\nArbitrum (ARB) is one of the most notable DeFi projects as it surged by 104.6% during the past month. The 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the weekly charts suggests a compelling bullish crossover above the 50-day EMA.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, on the other hand, turned north and entered an overbought zone. The Arbitrum crypto sentiment is bullish according to the combined analysis of the technical indicators. Sellers are now active and are defending the Arbitrum price, as it broke past $2 during the week and has retained support at $2.35. Just in the past 14 days, it\u2019s up 55%, and according to the Arbitrum price prediction, it can end 2024 with a value of $3.78.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Sparks Massive Interest \u2013 Can It Move to the $4,000 Price Range?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been increasing in the past weeks, surrounding hopes that an ETH ETF might be next in line on the agenda of the SEC. Meanwhile, the probability of a bullish continuation remains high, considering the performance experienced on the charts. On the weekly time frame, the Ethereum price has been moving from $2,184.62 to $2,686,97. A bearish breakout would likely result in a decline toward the 200-day moving average (MA), located at the $1,900 level.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum crypto could see a major upswing that can pave the way above the $2,700 resistance zone in the upcoming weeks. Recently, ETH experienced choppy action, and it tested the higher and the lower boundary of the range several times. According to the Ethereum price prediction, analysts project an upswing to $3,918.36 by the end of 2024.\n\nSummary\n\nArbitrum and Ethereum are both bullish on the chart, and excitement surrounding ETFs can lead them to further gains. However, Pullix is dominating with its presale and has grabbed whale attention the most. It both innovates and solves key issues in the DeFi space that will make it one of the most exciting cryptos for 2024.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
