        "title": "Funding Wrap: Bitcoin, Ethereum-based projects see fresh capital - Blockworks",
        "content": "Developers working with the two largest cryptocurrencies capitalized on early bull market intrigue.\n\nRecently, there has been a notable increase in funding interest towards bitcoin mining companies. However, this week\u2019s most substantial investment influx was directed at projects developing practical applications for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a parallel trend, various projects focused on scaling Ethereum have also secured considerable support recently. This surge in investment comes as the network gears up for its anticipated Dencun upgrade, scheduled for next year.\n\nBabylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain and Hack VC. The company focuses on a unique protocol that allows Bitcoin to be used for staking in proof-of-stake networks. It offers a secure way for bitcoin holders to earn yields without needing third-party trust or bridging to other chains.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nElsewhere, MAP Protocol, a layer-2 chain built on Bitcoin, announced a strategic investment from Waterdrip Capital. MAP is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that seeks to enhance cross-chain interoperability. It enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other public blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different platforms.\n\nBitcoin investment firm Swan Bitcoin said Thursday that it raised and spent $205 million in 2023 via its equity, credit and hedge funds. The company also said it plans to raise an additional $150 million as it builds out an institutional offering.\n\nRead more: Institutional custody of bitcoin could kill it, cautions Hayes\n\nOn the Ethereum side, Paradigm led a $9 million seed round in on-chain data platform Shadow. The engineering company streamlines on-chain data access by enabling efficient retrieval from contracts and transactions, and optimizing indexing. Its approach of moving event logs to shadow forks reduces gas costs and contract sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for blockchain data management.\n\nTen announced a $7.5 million raise for its encryption-focused layer-2, while another startup named Versatus said it closed a $2.3 million seed round for its \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum rollup.\n\nDeFi platform shunts VC backing in favor of \u2018aligned\u2019 investors\n\nLending and borrowing app Curvance closed a $3.6 million seed round this week that was noticeably thin on venture capital investment. The protocol mostly raised funds from a group of DeFi and DAO actors, including Offchain Labs and Wormhole.\n\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder Chris Carapola said Curvance capped investment in the token sale at $250,000 per party and hopes to soon turn governance over to a DAO. By capping token sale investments, Carapola suggested Curvance was trying to prevent major voting inequality within the DAO.\n\nCurvance drew interest from venture capital, Carapola said, but decided to primarily raise funds from actors in its ecosystem instead, taking over a year to do so.\n\n\u201cI would say the consistent thing that we saw was, \u2018This sounds amazing. How much can we get, and can you increase the round, can we play with the [valuation], do you want to do a Series A,\u2019 like the more conventional route. And as soon as that really became the topic, it was like, \u2018you know you\u2019re not aligned, right?\u2019\u201d Carapola said.\n\nCurvance raised its seed round at a $56 million valuation and its private round at a $75 million valuation, Carapola said.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nAnimoca Brands raised an $11.8 million funding tranche to develop its Mocaverse \u201cFrequent Player Program\u201d with participation from Block1, OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Dapper Labs and others.\n\nWeb3 music streaming platform Sona raised $6.9 million from Polychain Capital, Haun Ventures and Rogue Capital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Solana NFTs Eclipse Ethereum in Trading Volume Amid Surge\n\nSolana (SOL) continues to experience upward momentum, with its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) witnessing considerably higher trading volume, surpassing even that of Ethereum.\n\nProjects like Mad Lads and Tensorians have seen significant price increases, multiplying several times over in recent weeks.\n\nMoreover, the collective trading volume of Solana NFTs has now surpassed that of Ethereum, which traditionally leads in trading volume and hosts the most valuable projects.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Solana NFTs have generated $14.8 million in trades, compared to approximately $13.9 million on Ethereum, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nThis surge in Solana trading volume represents a growth of about 92% in the past day.\n\nAmong the top traded projects during this period, Tensorians, associated with the Tensor NFT marketplace, leads the way with over $4 million in sales.\n\nWithin the Solana ecosystem, Tensor currently dominates with nearly 76% market share in the past 24 hours, as reported by Tiexo.\n\nPreviously, Magic Eden, the multi-chain marketplace that held a prominent position in the Solana space, now holds about 16% market share.\n\nSOL Extends Gains as Market Rally Continues\n\n\n\nOver the past couple of days, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency SOL has posted significant gains and its leading meme coin BONK reached new all-time highs.\n\nOn Friday, SOL reached a new 19-month peak, touching $73.85.\n\nAlthough still a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021, SOL has made a remarkable recovery from its low of around $8 in late 2022.\n\nCurrently trading above $73, SOL has recorded a 13% surge in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBONK, the leading meme coin on the Solana network, has been on a rapid ascent in recent weeks, setting a new all-time high price of $0.00001314 on Friday.\n\nEven with a slight dip to $0.00001283 at the time of writing, BONK has registered a 10% gain in the past 24 hours and tripled in value over the last seven days.\n\nIn the past month alone, BONK has skyrocketed by an astounding 982%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a total market cap of $747 million.\n\nIn addition to the remarkable price performance, the recipients of the Jito airdrop on the Solana DeFi platform are also reaping substantial benefits.\n\nThe JTO token distributed to early users during the airdrop has surged by 72% in the past day, reaching $3.35 per token.\n\nLast week, Jupiter, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator running on the Solana blockchain, also announced the opening of initial claims for its JUP token airdrop.\n\nThe airdrop has been designed to distribute 40% of the total JUP token supply, which amounts to four out of the 10 billion tokens."

        "content": "Ethereum new addresses stay within the 90,000 range.\n\nThe number of new depositors remains low.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price has experienced a positive trend lately, and one might have anticipated a surge in new users eager to join the excitement. Despite a steady influx of new users, there is no apparent sense of urgency or rush.\n\nMixed signals from Ethereum\u2019s new addresses\n\nA recent post from IntoTheBlock showed that Ethereum has yet to see a surge in new addresses despite the prevailing bullish market conditions.\n\nHowever, an examination of the new address metric on Glassnode showed some noteworthy trends. The chart indicated a consistent trend, aligning with the overall pattern observed throughout the year. This is despite that there has not been a recent spike.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis showed that, as of this writing, the number of new addresses was over the figures recorded at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe chart displayed intermittent spikes, yet the count of new addresses consistently was around the 90,000 mark. At the time of writing, the number of new addresses was 91,547, with a notable spike observed.\n\nEthereum new stakes declines\n\nEthereum has recently encountered a setback, particularly in the number of new depositors. According to CryptoQuant data, there has been a significant decline in the number of new depositors or stakers.\n\nThe chart indicates that, at the time of this report, the count of new depositors was around 1,300. At the beginning of the month, this number was nearly twice as high and had even surged to over 5,000 at one point.\n\nWhile not the lowest recorded daily depositor count, it signifies a notable decrease in staking activities over the past few months.\n\nETH sustains its upward trend\n\nEthereum has recently demonstrated a strong price performance, with its daily timeframe chart revealing a significant uptrend. This positive momentum has propelled its value into the $2,300 range, a level not seen in a while.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $2,370, with an increase of less than 1%. The chart showed that it was trading above both its short- and long-moving averages (yellow and blue lines), respectively.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nWhile the current trend is bullish, the surge in price has yet to be accompanied by a proportional increase in the number of new addresses.\n\nThis suggests that retail traders may be exercising caution. It appears that they are hesitating to enter the market, possibly observing from the sidelines to assess whether the current trend is sustainable or a speculative bubble."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is showing signs of a potential new era of growth amid a market that is increasingly favoring Layer-1 (L1) solutions like Solana. Ethereum's price movement has not yet shown the explosiveness the majority of the market had been expecting. However, the cryptocurrency might still show us what it's got.\n\nThe price trajectory of Ethereum has been robust, with recent trends suggesting that the momentum behind its surge is far from over. Despite lagging behind some of its L1 counterparts, Ethereum holds a unique position on the market due to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption and the significant role it plays in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications.\n\nWhile Ethereum has not experienced the same intensity in its price surge as Solana, the potential for profit on the ongoing bull market remains substantial. Ethereum continues to be an attractive investment due to its size, liquidity and status as the leading platform for smart contracts. This suggests that any further gains on the broader market could amplify ETH's price performance.\n\nTechnical analysis reveals that Ethereum is poised for growth, with key resistance levels being tested. A breakthrough above these levels could signal a continuation of the bull run, enticing both retail and institutional investors.\n\nSolana is king\n\nSolana (SOL) has been a standout on the cryptocurrency market, displaying a price momentum that far exceeds expectations, especially in the wake of the Jito airdrop. The drop injected fresh funds into the SOL ecosystem, boosting its already impressive performance.\n\nThe price movement analysis of Solana reveals a steep upward trajectory, signifying not just a recovery, but dominance in the digital asset space. The resilience and rapid growth of SOL are indicative of a robust and well-engaged network. The asset's performance is not only impressive when viewed in isolation but also when compared to other cryptocurrencies, whose surges have been less intense.\n\nThe potential for Solana to breach the symbolic $100 mark, a level not seen since its collapse in 2021, has been a topic of speculation among market watchers. Prominent figures in the cryptocurrency game, such as Arthur Hayes, have expressed belief in Solana's ability to reach this milestone. With the current price action, Solana is not just fulfilling these predictions; it is surpassing them, setting new highs and establishing a strong presence on the market.\n\nSolana's ascent is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the market. While other assets struggle to maintain momentum, SOL's surge is a testament to its underlying technology and the confidence it instills in investors. The blockchain's high throughput and low transaction fees position it as a strong competitor in the space, capable of sustaining growth even in a turbulent market.\n\nBitcoin remains neutral\n\nBitcoin's recent price reversal could be construed as a beacon of positivity for the altcoin markets. After a period of consolidation and bearish trends, Bitcoin's turnaround has begun to inject optimism into the crypto ecosystem. This shift in momentum often has a ripple effect on altcoins, which can experience amplified movements in response to Bitcoin's falling dominance.\n\nIts dominant position means that positive price action can lead to increased investor confidence, which often spills over to the altcoin markets. When Bitcoin's price stabilizes or starts to climb, it can provide the necessary reassurance for investors to start diversifying their portfolios with altcoins, hence, driving up their prices.\n\nBitcoin's reversal comes at a pivotal moment when many altcoins have been developing their ecosystems and strengthening their use cases. With the leading cryptocurrency regaining ground, it could be the catalyst that altcoins need to attract more attention and investment. A bullish Bitcoin could mean more capital flowing into the crypto market as a whole, and altcoins are well-positioned to benefit from this influx.\n\nFurthermore, when Bitcoin surges, it can lead to a reallocation of profits from Bitcoin to altcoins as investors seek to maximize returns by investing in assets with higher potential upside. This can be particularly beneficial for well-established altcoins with solid fundamentals and for emerging coins that capture the market's imagination."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe integrity of the Ethereum blockchain network is under threat after Truth Labs conducted a thorough investigation and discovered multiple fraudulent activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDriven by growing concerns about security, the investigation uncovered a startling pattern of illicit activities, such as theft, scams, and dishonest marketing.\n\nWe began our deep research into Ethereum when it became far to dangerous to participate in the ecosystem with any relevant % of my wealth. Fraud was running rampant in every Sector of the Ecosystem. Wallets, Layer 2's, Bridge's, Protocols across the board using ERC20 Standard,\u2026 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) November 14, 2023\n\nThe investigation conducted by Truth Labs showed that these illegal activities are present in many areas of the Ethereum platform. Among the areas affected are wallets, bridges, Layer 2 solutions, and protocols that use the ERC20 standard. Moreover, stablecoins, wrapped tokens, NFT-selling protocols, and both centralized and decentralized exchanges have yet to be spared.\n\nIn addition, the Truth Labs report has clouded the reputations of notable Ethereum community members. There have been allegations of pump-and-dump schemes, which has led to concerns about the moral character of these influential individuals. The discussion about these people\u2019s accountability for opposing and combating such dishonest practices has been spurred by this circumstance.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Truth Labs\u2019 findings go beyond ideas. An actor and wallet network disproportionately connected to fraudulent activity on Ethereum has been found and documented. Understanding and possibly preventing the spread of such malpractices within the ecosystem is made possible by using this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, these revelations have numerous ramifications. They have rekindled conversations about the necessity of ethics and transparency in the crypto space, particularly among Ethereum users. These days, the main worries are about the platform\u2019s overall integrity and the safety of funds.\n\nFurther raising concerns is the fact that some influential individuals involved in these schemes are anonymous. It highlights the difficulties in policing and overseeing a decentralized and frequently opaque digital environment. One of the biggest obstacles to solving the problems ailing the Ethereum ecosystem is this lack of transparency.\n\nAs such, there is a fork in the road for the Ethereum community. As a result of Truth Labs\u2019 disclosures, there is now a need for a coordinated effort to tackle the network\u2019s vulnerabilities and illegal activities. According to the report, leaders and influencers in the Ethereum community must promote a more open and moral environment."

        "content": "Recent patterns indicate that the impetus fueling Ethereum\u2019s climb is far from diminishing, and the price trajectory of the cryptocurrency has shown resilience. Ethereum may not be as advanced as some of its L1 competitors, but it stands out from the crowd thanks to its large developer community, immense acceptance, and crucial role in DeFi and other blockchain-based applications.\n\nEthereum Remains Firm At $2,347\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was able to keep a strong footing at the $2,300 level, trading at $2,347, nearly unchanged in the last 24 hours, but tallied a 10% increase in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nThere is still a lot of room for profit in the current bull market, even though Ethereum\u2019s price spike hasn\u2019t been as dramatic as other altcoin\u2019s. Size, liquidity, and being the leading platform for smart contracts all contribute to Ethereum\u2019s continued appeal as an investment.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,341.6 territory. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nThis means that ETH\u2019s price performance could be greatly enhanced by any further market increases. Ethereum, according to technical research, is about to see growth, and it is now testing key resistance levels. Both retail and institutional investors would be interested if the price breaks out above these levels, as it could indicate that the positive trend would continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June, 2022.

The accumulation patterns seen in several top addresses indicate that this new range has created a chance for persistent price increases.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Holdings And 2024 Roadmap\n\nThe most popular Ethereum addresses on exchanges and those outside of them have shown clear patterns of accumulation in the last several months, according to new data from Santiment.\n\nA large number of top non-exchange addresses have been buying Ethereum at different prices, which has caused their holding volume of ETH to rise steadily and now surpass 54 million.\n\nAt the same time, following their most recent execution layer meeting on December 8, Ethereum developers have laid out a detailed strategy for the network\u2019s future in 2024, including new suggestions, major upgrades, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is predicted to significantly outpace mega-cap tech stocks. After the Bitcoin miners\u2019 payouts are halved, investment firm VanEck thinks Ethereum will soar. In the past, this has caused a fresh spike in the price of Bitcoin, with the proceeds going into altcoins.\n\nEthereum won\u2019t surpass Bitcoin, despite surpassing large stocks, and what \u201cflippening\u201d rumors claim. It is still believed that Bitcoin will continue to lead in market capitalization even though there is a chance that ETH may gain value in daily transaction volume.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "This week\u2019s Web3 watch begins with a significant shift in the NFT marketplace. Ethereum, traditionally the frontrunner in NFT trading, has seen a downturn in sales volume, facing competition from two emerging players.\n\nThe Bitcoin network witnessed a surge in digital art collectible trading, primarily driven by ongoing interest in ordinal inscriptions. Ordinals allow users to mint NFT-like assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The past month has seen a 500% increase in sales volume for this asset class, eclipsing Ethereum\u2019s figures over the same timeframe.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin\u2019s cheap-to-mint ordinal inscriptions has led to a significant increase in demand on the network. This trend reflects a broader shift in the digital collectibles market, where novel and cost-effective methods of NFT creation and trading are gaining traction.\n\nRead more: Sotheby\u2019s announces its first Bitcoin Ordinals sale\n\nThe Solana blockchain has also stepped into the spotlight, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum on Friday. This increase in Solana\u2019s trading volume is the culmination of a banner week for the network.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s obviously interesting and different in the ordinals space versus every other popular blockchain is that your NFTs are actually stored on-chain versus in smart contracts-enabled ecosystems, [where] they\u2019re stored on some decentralized server like IPFS,\u201d Sarah Satoshi, the head of business development at ordinals marketplace Gamma.io, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the factors that attracts a lot of people.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking protocol Jito executed an airdrop on Thursday, distributing $165 million worth of its native token to users. The following day, Solana saw a spike in its NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThere was a marked increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT market, which may have been fueled by speculations of another potential airdrop.\n\nOn Friday, \u201cTensorians,\u201d a Solana-based NFT collection, topped the sales volume charts according to CryptoSlam. The collection\u2019s sales volume rose over 100% in the past week.\n\nPudgy Penguins takes up the Webkinz model\n\nThe NFT collection Pudgy Penguins debuted an online open-world game called Pudgy World Alpha at Art Basel Miami.\n\nThe game lets players control avatar lookalikes of the penguins, but users don\u2019t need to own an NFT to play.\n\nPudgy World builds on the NFT collection\u2019s partnership bringing toy versions of Pudgy Penguins to Walmart stores. Each toy comes with a QR code that claims a Pudgy Penguin character inside of Pudgy World.\n\nEvery toy corresponds to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, and holders receive licensing royalties on their corresponding toys, the project said in a press statement.\n\nOne interesting stat:\n\nInterest in Bitcoin ordinals dramatically increased the blockchain\u2019s mempool to an all-time high. Mempools collect all unconfirmed transactions waiting to be validated and added to a blockchain. When too many transactions are added, it becomes congested, leading to slower processing times and higher fees for prioritizing transactions.\n\nAlso of note:\n\nRecordpool released the Jackson 5\u2019s first ever studio recording as a digital collectible on Web3 music marketplace anotherblock.\n\nThe digital art arm of Sotheby\u2019s is auctioning off its first set of ordinal inscriptions.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Whales have been actively taking profit, and this could trigger a massive sell pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto.\n\nEthereum price volatility\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been positively impacted by the recent bullish momentum in the global crypto markets, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) surge above the $43,000 price region.\n\nETH maintains a distinctive market position attributed to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption, and pivotal role in decentralized finance (defi) and various blockchain applications.\n\nDespite the current positive momentum, there are apprehensions regarding the potential influence of selling pressure from whales on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales immediately took profits after Ethereum hit $2,300.\n\nThe impact of significant holders selling could potentially drive down the price of ETH in the coming weeks. In a bearish scenario, the cryptocurrency might retest the $1,555 support level, and sustained selling pressure could push ETH as low as $1,460 within the next two months, the analyst predicts.\n\nDespite these concerns, the overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, leaving room for potential further growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAs #Ethereum surpassed $2,300, $ETH whales began to book profits. This surge in selling pressure might soon start to impact the #ETH price. pic.twitter.com/sdrvT2vcCe \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAlthough Ether\u2019s market capitalization of $282 billion lags behind Bitcoin\u2019s $857 billion, both networks generate comparable protocol revenues.\n\nIn the last seven days, the Bitcoin network accrued $61 million in fees, while Ethereum accumulated $61.5 million.\n\nIn addition to institutional interest, the price surge is fueled by expectations of an ETF approval from the SEC. Despite the optimistic momentum, there are apprehensions, that the upswing in selling pressure might have repercussions on the ETH price in the coming days.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scaling startup Versace Labs secured another $2.3m in seed round\n\nEthereum\u2019s surging network fees\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s network fees is intricately tied to the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem and the widespread adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIncreased defi and NFT activities have driven up network fees, with more individuals engaging in intricate transactions, leading to prolonged periods of elevated fees.\n\nThe creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the associated costs can fluctuate based on network congestion and gas prices. While Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees pose challenges for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions like Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization provide optimism for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe surge in DeFi and NFT activity on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in extensive transaction activity, contributing to the persistently high gas fees.\n\nCurrently, the average gas fee for minting an NFT on Ethereum is around $100, subject to variations based on network congestion, gas prices, and smart contract complexity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,348.23, according to Data from CoinGecko.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "There is a spike in crypto on-chain activity if transaction fees lead. According to IntoTheBlock data on December 8, Bitcoin transaction fees are up by over 60%, while \u201cgas\u201d in Ethereum has climbed by nearly 50% in the past week.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Transaction Fees Rise By Double-Digits\n\nThis surge in activity can be pinned to multiple factors, mainly growing user interest and the ongoing crypto bull market. To illustrate, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are trending at 2023 highs above $43,500 and $2,300 when writing.\n\nEven so, the crypto community expects these coins to extend gains in the coming weeks and months, partly because of expected institutional capital, projected to be in their billions, flowing to the sphere.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, cumulative fees collected in Bitcoin this week stand at $43.8 million, up 61%. On the other hand, $83.3 million in fees has been accrued from Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the historical transaction fees trend, transacting on Ethereum, despite its relatively high transaction processing speeds (TPS), is more expensive than Bitcoin. This can be due to Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) minting, and more. Bitcoin is a transactional layer and doesn\u2019t inherently support smart contracts.\n\nUsually, rising on-chain transaction fees are bullish for price and indicate that their respective ecosystem is thriving from increasing adoption. With transaction fees rising in the two leading blockchain ecosystems, more people want to interact with the project. Subsequently, this could support prices since BTC or ETH is used for paying transaction fees.\n\nWill BTC Ease Past 2021 Highs Of $70,000?\n\nAs BTC is currently trading above $43,500 and ETH recently broke above $2,300, the possibility of these coins retesting and easing past their all-time highs of $70,000 and $4,800, respectively, cannot be discounted. One of the key drivers of the surge in on-chain activity is the ongoing bull market.\n\nWith crypto rising, more people are looking to position themselves, hoping to profit from further price appreciation. This wave of fear of missing out (FOMO) has pushed higher fees and prices.\n\nThe demand for liquid and SEC-recognized digital assets will likely increase once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes ahead and authorizes the first Bitcoin ETF. This derivative product will allow institutions to invest in Bitcoin confidently through a regulated solution.\n\nAs the odds of the SEC approving this product rose from early Q4 2023, BTC and ETH prices started rising in sync. Still, how prices will react once the spot Bitcoin ETF is approved remains to be seen. Once the SEC green-lights a spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market will begin looking at Ethereum and whether the agency will approve a similar solution.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Ethereum has long been the frontrunner in the NFT market, but recent data reveals Solana's ascending trajectory.\n\nEthereum's sales have dropped to $11.4 million, a stark contrast to Solana's nearly $16 million in sales.\n\nBitcoin, typically not a direct player in the NFT space, has recorded sales of $13 million. This is due to the surge of Bitcoin Ordinals, which have also contributed to the flagship cryptocurrency recently overtaking its altcoin archrival in terms of total fees.\n\nOther blockchains like Polygon and ImmutableX are also making their presence felt, albeit with lower sales volumes of $1.5 million and $942,113, respectively.\n\nSolana's NFT marketplace booms\n\nSolana's NFT marketplace has seen a robust increase in activity, with Tensor emerging as the leading platform.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is opening the floor for public input on Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Meanwhile, two projects are capturing the attention of whales \u2013 Arbitrum (ARB) and InQubeta (QUBE).\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the details of these developments shaping the crypto landscape.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF dilemma: a call for public participation\n\nFidelity, an asset management firm, filed for approval of its Ethereum Fund on Nov. 17, joining a growing list of firms vying for a spot in the competitive world of crypto ETFs in the U.S.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s call for public input is crucial in the regulatory process. It allows stakeholders and seasoned and beginner cryptocurrency enthusiasts to voice their opinions on the potential listing and trading of shares from Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum can surge to $3,100; InQubeta on bullish path\n\nThe filing emphasizes that the absence of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. exposes investors to significant risks, pushing them towards potentially riskier alternatives. With the SEC having yet to greenlight any spot cryptocurrency investment vehicles, the public has 21 days to submit comments following the filing\u2019s publication in the Federal Register.\n\nThe decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal could mark a pivotal moment in the journey toward mainstream crypto adoption, and propel Ethereum to new heights.\n\nArbitrum: riding the waves of change\n\nShifting gears from regulatory matters, let\u2019s dive into the world of Arbitrum, where recent developments have kept enthusiasts on the edge of their seats. Considered one of the top altcoins to watch, it has managed to defy expectations, showcasing stability in its price despite the volatility that often accompanies such proposals.\n\nArbitrum DAO\u2019s recent approval of a hard fork, marked by overwhelming community support with over 99% of the votes, has positioned the network for significant improvements. The proposed hard fork, including upgrades like EVM Shanghai and the PUSH0 opcode, aims to enhance the chain\u2019s infrastructure and network fees.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin\u2019s market triumph: InQubeta and Injective poised for gains\n\nDespite occasional dips, Arbitrum\u2019s ARB has maintained a steady presence above the $1.00 mark. Recent price movements, with fluctuations recovering promptly, suggest an upward trajectory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators flash bullish signals, signaling a potential surge beyond $1.10.

        "content": "The Ethereum coin price has steadily recovered since the beginning of December. Starting the month at $20246, the coin price surged to a current high of $2403, registering a 15% growth. Amid this rally, the coin price gave a decisive breakout from the resistance trendline of a long-coming wedge pattern, indicating the potential for higher recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2 Starknet Earmarks 1.8B STRK for its Mega Airdrop\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill the ETH Price Rise to $3400?\n\nThe current uncertainty in Ethereum price could trigger a minor fallback to the $2250 mark.\n\nThe ETH price could obtain suitable support at $2250 and $2130 marks.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $7.3 Billion, indicating a 34% loss\n\nThe Ethereum price recovery began in mid-October, starting with a rebound from the $1525 level. This turnaround led to a significant 58.3% increase in its value, bringing it to the current trading price of $2404.\n\nThis upward trajectory has been largely influenced by general market optimism and the formation of a rising wedge pattern. Throughout the year, under this pattern\u2019s guidance, the ETH coin has maintained a slow yet steady uptrend.\n\nA notable event in this rally occurred on December 30th, when the coin\u2019s price broke through the upper trendline of the pattern, signaling a readiness for a more dynamic rally and presenting an entry point for buyers. With an intraday gain of 0.51%, the coin price might revisit the breached trendline to confirm its sustainability.\n\nRiding on this pattern, the ETH price could potentially see a 51% surge, aiming for the $3400 mark\n\nETH vs BTC Performance\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown substantial growth in the past two months, reinforcing a recovery trend in the cryptocurrency market. However, there\u2019s a distinct difference in their price behaviors: the BTC price has shown a steady increase, while the Ethereum price has been more volatile, with occasional drops. This difference suggests that Bitcoin might offer a more reliable breakout opportunity, whereas the ETH price could be more effectively traded using pullback strategies.\n\nBollinger Band: An upswing in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator reflects the buyers leading this current rally.\n\nAverage Directional Index: the ADX slope at a 40 % high reflects that the ETH price may need a temporary correction to continue the bullish trend."

After predicting the right next upswing of Bitcoin from the $43K level to enter $44K, the analyst now eyeing a favorable rally for ETH.\n\nThis shows optimism surrounding Ethereum with experts indicating a potential upsurge in the ETH ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum To Rally Beyond $3000?\n\nCredibull indicates a potential ETH rally above $2.6k and has predicted that it can happen overnight. He further added that Ethereum will go long and has taken up the position already.\n\nIn a recent X post, replying to a comment regarding Bitcoin rally coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s, he stated that ETH will follow BTC. The analyst predicts Bitcoin to go beyond $50K by next week and Ethereum will follow the same.\n\nIn another analysis, the prominent voice behind the Altcoin Daily crypto channel, Aaron Arnold, anticipates a substantial upswing for Ethereum (ETH) in response to the potential approval of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nArnold stresses that the approval of this ETF could trigger a significant surge in demand, driving Ethereum\u2019s price to new highs. By examining historical patterns, Arnold suggests that if Ethereum mirrors its performance from the previous bullish cycle, prices could experience a surge to $4,200.

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nTLDR\n\nEthereum, FLOKI, and NuggetRush have caught the interest of smart money.\n\nNuggetRush stands out for its blend of P2E and memes.\n\nAnalysts predict its value will soar by 60x.\n\nThe smart money with a track record of success is currently accumulating Ethereum (ETH), FLOKI (FLOKI), and NuggetRush (NUGX). They probably know something we don\u2019t. Nevertheless, these cryptocurrencies have significant upside potential, so it comes as little surprise.\n\nThis article will cover the appeal of Ethereum, FLOKI, and NuggetRush, including why smart money has taken a keen interest. Let\u2019s begin.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX): Investor Favorite\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) is a top ICO (initial coin offering). The significance is that it has more upside potential as an emerging project than Ethereum and FLOKI. This makes up one of its several appeals. In addition, it also distinguishes itself for its unique approach, which has contributed to the massive token demand.\n\nUnlike many memecoins without tangible utility, NuggetRush has been hailed for its fascinating blend of memes and utility. It stands at the intersection of P2E (play-to-earn) and memes, two of the biggest narratives in the crypto landscape. As a result, it has captured the interest of investors as well as enthusiasts.\n\nAs a gaming platform, it promises fun and thrills. Gamers will enjoy an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience and will be rewarded for their time while playing the gold mining game. The in-game assets collected by players can be traded or exchanged in the marketplace.\n\nThis project is still in its early stages; hence, it has significant growth potential. The presale is in its third round, and a token costs only $0.013. According to top experts, it has a 60x upside potential, making it the best new crypto to invest in. If you wish to participate in the presale, simply follow the link below.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum (ETH): Undervalued with Substantial Growth Potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the most dominant tokens in the crypto scene. Yet, it is ridiculously undervalued. With massive upside potential, it is one of the best coins to invest in. That isn\u2019t all. Ethereum plays a critical role in the crypto space, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world.\n\nIt is a blockchain and smart contract platform. It also houses other cryptocurrencies, making it the most vibrant ecosystem in the crypto landscape. This combination of massive growth potential and practicality has resulted in smart money quietly accumulating Ethereum tokens.\n\nMoreover, the impending approval of the first spot Ethereum ETF in the US is expected to usher in a bullish wave. Hence, it is one of the best cryptos to invest in.\n\nFLOKI (FLOKI): A Promising Memecoin\n\nThe memecoin ecosystem is incomplete without mentioning FLOKI (FLOKI). Popularly called the \u201cpeople currency,\u201d it is the utility token of the FLOKI ecosystem. Although it was initially just a memecoin, it is now much more, making it a good crypto to buy.\n\nThe FLOKI ecosystem now consists of an NFT gaming metaverse and DeFi products. Its blend of memes and utility has made it a favorite in the crypto landscape. Furthermore, it has massive upside potential and is currently trading in an uptrend.\n\nGiven the above, it is a no-brainer that smart money is purchasing FLOKI in large quantities. It is, after all, one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe smart money accumulation of Ethereum, FLOKI, and NuggetRush is because of their significant role and growth potential. They appear primed for explosive gains, which makes them worthwhile investments. You can purchase ETH or FLOKI on popular exchanges.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is likely to rally to $48,000, as market participants keep up with the updates on Bitcoin Spot ETF applications.\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum, Chainlink, Arbitrum and Optimism are likely to gain from BTC\u2019s price rally.\n\nEthereum price is likely to rally alongside Bitcoin as ETH holders await Spot Ethereum ETF approval by the US SEC.\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe picked four altcoins for the ongoing bull run, in his recent video on YouTube. The analyst believes these altcoins could outperform other assets and yield gains for traders, alongside Bitcoin price rally to $48,000.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum derivatives data points at bullish start for ETH in 2024\n\nBitcoin dominance peaks, drives gains in altcoins\n\nBitcoin dominance is at 50.2%, according to data from CoinGecko. At the current level, alongside Bitcoin price rally, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) are likely to yield gains for holders.\n\nPoppe explains that Bitcoin is currently in a stage where the asset is rallying and there is a likelihood of a potential top. There is hype surrounding the speculation of approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and capital is likely to flow into altcoins. Volatility is likely to go away from Bitcoin and drive gains in altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nETH holders are awaiting an approval of Spot Ethereum ETF and this could fuel gains in the asset. Ethereum price could correct in response to a correction in BTC, however Poppe has set a target of $3,000 for ETH price this cycle.\n\nWith Bitcoin dominance peaking out, altcoins like ChainLink, Arbitrum and Optimism are likely to rally. Just as seen in 2019 and 2020, ChainLink price rallies after weeks of sideways price action. LINK is therefore on the brink of multiple bullish breakouts.\n\nPoppe identified a massive bullish divergence in Arbitrum and Optimism and notes that these two altcoins are finalizing their accumulation stage, gearing up for a breakout. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is close to the $44,000 level, ARB and OP are trading at $1.1327 and $2.1510, on Binance, respectively."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has recorded Ethereum Spot ETF filings from several institutional players. As Bloomberg reported, a total of 7 Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been filed so far.\n\nVanEck, Fidelity, Ishares, Invesco & Galaxy, Grayscale, Hashdex, and ARK & 21 Shares are the institutions behind these Ethereum filings.\n\nWhile regulators had previously recognized some of these filings in the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only recently acknowledged Fidelity\u2019s ETF Spot application.\n\nAll the aforementioned Ethereum ETF applications are currently under review by the SEC. The regulator is required to approve or deny these applications in the long term. The regulator can also postpone approval deadlines.\n\nSimilarly, leading crypto and traditional institutions have filed a handful of Bitcoin ETFs. While the U.S. is yet to approve of a Bitcoin or an Ethereum Spot ETF, market players are more optimistic than ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy design, a Cryptocurrency Spot ETF can keep account of the market price of existing crypto assets and allow investors to partake in investment without directly holding or purchasing any crypto assets.\n\nSome industry figures who recognize that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF might take much longer are convinced that Ethereum Spot ETFs stand a better chance of approval.\n\nEther is already responding positively to the recent development. The price of the second most-valued cryptocurrency by market cap has soared by 2.9% in the last hour, with prices at $2,355. In the previous 30 days, Ether has increased by more than 16%. Market cap and trading volume are also in the green zone.\n\nNear-term price predictions are also collectively bullish at this time. One analyst took to X, formerly Twitter, to make a bullish call.\n\n\u201cEthereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity! Confirms my thesis that after Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024.\u201d He wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, On-chain metrics have rolled out whale performance recorded over the past months. According to data shared by Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, big hands are transferring their Ether holdings and moving them from exchanges to self-bustody.\n\nAs the Santiment explained;\n\n\u201cThe largest Ethereum wallets continue forming an encouraging pattern, with exchange wallets now reduced to 6-month lows (8.03M ETH) and non-exchange wallets soaring to an all time high (41.03M ETH). More and more coins continue moving to self custody.\u201d"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent analysis of on-chain Ethereum transactions highlights the moves of one such investor, revealing a pattern of strategic trades that may coincide with significant price movements in the Ethereum market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transaction history of this Ethereum whale demonstrates a series of calculated swaps and liquidity moves, often involving substantial sums of Ether (ETH), stablecoins like USDC and other tokens. For example, several transactions show the investor swapping large quantities of ETH for USDC and vice versa, potentially capitalizing on market volatility. This series of swaps suggests a pattern of entering and exiting positions in alignment with market fluctuations \u2014 buying when prices are lower and selling when prices are higher.\n\nAn examination of the dates and sizes of these transactions reveals that this investor possibly operates with a keen eye on market trends, making swaps and trades that often precede or follow market price changes. For instance, large inflows or outflows of ETH from their wallet occasionally align with subsequent rises or dips in Ethereum's price, suggesting that the whale may be trading on anticipatory market insights or contributing to price momentum through their actions.\n\nReviewing the attached Ethereum price chart, one can attempt to correlate the whale's transaction dates with notable price movements. The chart shows Ethereum's price trajectory over time, marked by various technical indicators such as moving averages. By comparing the transaction timestamps with the chart's data points, we could infer whether the whale's trades were timely in relation to price rallies or corrections.\n\nFor instance, a series of large swaps from ETH to USDC might be synchronized with a local peak on the price chart, indicating the whale's strategy to secure profits before a potential downturn. Conversely, a sizable conversion from USDC to ETH might precede a bullish run, suggesting an accumulation strategy in anticipation of price appreciation."

        "content": "Ethereum, alongside the rest of the crypto market, experienced a notable resurgence in the past several weeks, with its price jumping to a 19-month peak at $2,400. This comes amid growing anticipation regarding the approval of a spot ETH ETF in the States.\n\nHowever, the second-largest blockchain network has not seen its user count increase, which leads to the question of whether ETH\u2019s price will climb further should that change.\n\nNo New Users for Ethereum\n\nAs mentioned above, the crypto market seems to have put behind the devastating 2022 crash and bear cycle as the prices of numerous assets, including ETH, have shot up to their highest levels in almost two years. The total crypto market cap has risen by over half a trillion in the past few months.\n\nEthereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is among the most popular assets, especially for users aiming for DeFi, NFTs, or other niches that employ the blockchain. However, data from IntoTheBlock shows that there hasn\u2019t been much interest from new users to come on board lately.\n\nDespite the bullish market conditions, Ethereum is not seeing a significant influx of new users. Both the number of new addresses and the new adoption rate show no significant spikes. What do you think this means?\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/gyjfRaU3C9 pic.twitter.com/jKoe7AOuCY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 8, 2023\n\nWhy Is That So Strange?\n\nThis is particularly interesting and perhaps unexpected in the current environment. Retail investors tend to follow the hype. Such hype has indeed returned to the markets \u2013 BTC and ETH in particular. This is because of the growing number of entities filing to launch spot BTC and ETH ETFs in the United States.\n\nFor example, the number of Bitcoin addresses and active users keeps climbing, with non-zero balance wallets recently surpassing the 50 million mark. So, the hype for Bitcoin is definitely here, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with Ethereum.\n\nBut then again, that can all change in an instant, especially if the US Securities and Exchange Commission does indeed approve a spot Ethereum ETF soon. Should that happen, ETH\u2019s price could skyrocket even further with the growing number of users and investors."

        "content": "The major cryptocurrencies displayed a mixed performance on Sunday evening as Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, seemed to be undergoing a correction, while some altcoins were experiencing significant gains.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD -4.37% $41,846 Ethereum ETH/USD +5.17% $2,351 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -3.88% $0.095\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin\u2019s rally experienced a temporary pause on Sunday as it briefly dropped to $41,800. This slight decline indicates that traders may have opted to secure some profits after witnessing the cryptocurrency\u2019s substantial surge from $38,000 just a week ago.\n\nETH witnessed a notable 5% surge reaching its highest price point since May 2022.\n\nData from CoinGlass shows that in the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market experienced a total liquidation value of $374.41 million and 109,015 traders were affected. The largest individual liquidation order occurred on OKX, involving BTC-USDT-SWAP with a value of $8.23 million.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Helium +14.06% $5.06 BitTorrent +11.99% $0.00000124 Injective +8.06% $20.63\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.6 trillion, marking a 1.34% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures showed a slight increase on Sunday night as investors eagerly anticipate the final Federal Reserve meeting of 2023.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 22 points, equivalent to a 0.06% increase, while S&P futures and Nasdaq 100 futures experienced smaller gains of less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closed Friday with a notable six-week winning streak, achieving gains of 0.2% and 0.7% respectively. In contrast, the Dow remained relatively flat throughout the week.\n\nDuring the upcoming Fed\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday, Chair Jerome Powell is anticipated to keep the key fed funds rate unchanged within the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, a level it has maintained since July. Market expectations, as indicated by the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, currently suggest a 45% probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate reduction by the Fed in March.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe notes that the Altcoin market capitalization has recently broken out of an 18-month sideways range. Looking ahead, \"the next potential areas for a top are going to be between $1.1-1.3T.\"\n\nEli Taranto, Executive Director at EQI Bank, in a note seen by Benzinga, said, \"As the US posted a stronger than expected employment report, Bitcoin gained over the weekend but risks remain that it will see lower territory in the coming weeks, seeing around $40K in the holiday period.\"\n\nHe added, \" Pressure on BTC will continue to mount as retail investors may choose to take profits for the holiday period. While the Santa Rally may offset this, all eyes are now on the coming ETFs, after BTC price has already factored in key US economic indicators. \"\n\nA pseudonymous crypto analyst suggests that Bitcoin may be following a pattern similar to Amazon\u2019s stock (AMZN) from over a decade ago. The analyst, known as TechDev, shares a chart on X comparing BTC\u2019s price movements over the past three years to AMZN in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\"Here's that time AMZN retested its prior all-time high with an expanded flat correction. Just as BTC did.Then here's a dissection of the structural similarities of both flats. Green line is where BTC has moved to since the chart.\"\n\nTechDev points out that both charts display double tops in the respective assets, followed by significant corrections to previous all-time highs. The analyst notes that both also experience sudden parabolic moves to new all-time highs with minimal or no dips in between.\n\n\"A rapid move to new highs from here would not be unusual for expanded flat retests of a prior ATH, if you can move past the herd narrative regarding the halving. Not a guarantee. $32,000 retest scenario still on the table. But if we are up only to new highs from here, I would not be surprised. When structural analogs work, it's because mass human speculative behavior doesn't change, regardless of asset.\"\n\nPhoto by CMP_NZ on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "content": "TLDR\n\nInvestors flock to Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) due to its impressive offers.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is expected to surge to $7 by June 2023.\n\nAnalysts forecast that Ethereum Classic (ETC) will reach $26 in the coming weeks.\n\nPolkadot and Ethereum Classic have recorded new developments in their ecosystem that could push their values up in the coming weeks. Yet, as top altcoins like DOT and ETC look to recover from a disappointing 2023, investors are slowly turning to a new entrant, Rebel Satoshi, due to its mouthwatering offers. Read more to get the latest from the experts.\n\nPolkadot Price Prediction: DOT Expected To Rally In 2024,\n\nSpanish blockchain company Freeverse revealed on December 3 its development of LAOS, a new layer 1 blockchain slated to debut as a parachain on Polkadot in 2024. This announcement coincides with the LAOS Foundation, a Swiss non-profit established to foster the blockchain\u2019s growth through ownership of LAOS tokens in the upcoming years.\n\nAs of December 2, the price of DOT was $5.57, but it dropped to $5.55 on December 3 after the Polkadot news, signifying a 0.48% dip. However, market analysts are bullish because of the recent developments in the Polkadot ecosystem. Due to this, they predict that the value of DOT will reach $7 by the start of January.\n\nOn the other hand, with the Social Volume of DOT stagnant in recent weeks, market experts are pessimistic about the future of the DeFi coin price. They predict that DOT will drop to $5.20 by the end of the month.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Set To Experience Bullish Movement In The Coming Weeks\n\nAs of November 30, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is open to receiving comments regarding Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF. The filing specifies that the SEC is seeking input on a proposed rule change by Cboe BZX. Approval of this rule change would enable the exchange to trade shares of Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund. This would affect the Ethereum ecosystem and its forks like Ethereum Classic.\n\nAs of November 30, the price of ETC was $18.64, but it rose to $19.82 on December 3, signifying a 6.33% increase. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic experts are bullish about the value of ETC because of how the massive adoption of ETH would have a ripple effect on forks like Ethereum Classic. Thus, they predict that ETC will rise to $26 by January.\n\nConversely, other analysts are bearish with the current regulatory clampdowns, which have had big effects on the crypto market in 2023. They predict that ETC will drop to $17 before the end of December.\n\nRebel Satoshi Aims To Disrupt Financial Centralization\n\nRebel Satoshi charts a visionary course for meme coins, aiming to redefine their role in the crypto landscape. Inspired by Bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the project seeks to reintegrate decentralization as a core principle in the crypto industry.\n\nWhile embracing its meme coin origins with humor and community fame, Rebel Satoshi distinguishes itself by providing substantial utilities. These include an NFT collection, an NFT marketplace, and coin staking, allowing community members to actively contribute to security and liquidity enhancement through $RBLZ token staking.\n\nAnalysts recognize Rebel Satoshi\u2019s multifaceted approach, positioning it as a formidable contender against established meme coins. The uniqueness of Rebel Satoshi in the crypto industry suggests its $RBLZ token could emerge as a top cryptocurrency to buy.\n\nHolding $RBLZ offers various benefits, with community members gaining token holder status through participation in the ongoing blockchain ICO. The ongoing Rebels Round 1 of its B$RBLZ presale offers tokens at $0.013. With surging demand, $RBLZ is poised to see a significant increase to $0.018 in the next round, marking a 38.46% growth from its initial value. Further, $RBLZ is set to be listed once its value reaches $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has long been considered a frontrunner, particularly in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, a new DeFi sensation is on the horizon, and it goes by the name of Retik Finance (RETIK). With bold forecasts for 2024 and the potential for explosive growth, RETIK is positioning itself to give Ethereum a run for its money.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll delve into the Ethereum price forecast for 2024 and explore why Retik Finance is the DeFi sensation to watch out for.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast for 2024\n\nBefore we dive into the Retik Finance phenomenon, let\u2019s take a moment to examine the Ethereum price forecast for 2024. Ethereum, often dubbed the \u201cking of DeFi,\u201d has been a cornerstone of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Analysts and experts have been closely monitoring its price movements and trends. After analysing historical data, they have arrived at some intriguing predictions for the year 2024.\n\nMinimum Price Projection: Analysts suggest that Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024 may see a minimum of approximately $1,065.86. This figure represents a baseline, and it\u2019s crucial to note that cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, meaning prices can fluctuate significantly.\n\nMaximum Price Projection: On the other end of the spectrum, the maximum expected price for Ethereum in 2024 is estimated to be around $1,891.08. This upper limit reflects a more bullish scenario, assuming favourable market conditions and increased adoption.\n\nAverage Trading Price: When we consider an average trading price, Ethereum is anticipated to hover around $2,716.30 in 2024. This middle-ground projection serves as a baseline for potential price movements during the year.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): The DeFi Sensation of 2024\n\nWhile Ethereum has undoubtedly been a dominant force in the DeFi sector, Retik Finance (RETIK) is gearing up to steal the spotlight in 2024.

Cashback Rewards and Incentives\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s cashback rewards program is a major attraction for users. With every transaction made using Retik\u2019s DeFi Debit Cards, users can earn cashback in RETIK tokens. This financial incentive encourages active engagement with the platform and further drives adoption.\n\n4. Privacy and Security\n\nRetik Finance places a strong emphasis on user privacy and security.

This comprehensive approach positions RETIK as a versatile and innovative project.\n\n2. Financial Incentives\n\nThe cashback rewards program offered by Retik Finance incentivizes users to actively engage with the platform. These rewards can foster loyalty and encourage users to make more cryptocurrency transactions, driving adoption and engagement.\n\n3. Real-World Integration\n\nThe ability to use cryptocurrencies seamlessly for everyday transactions is a significant advantage. Retik Finance\u2019s integration of DeFi Debit Cards into users\u2019 daily lives makes it a practical choice for individuals looking to bridge the gap between digital and traditional finance.\n\n4.

        "content": "Shiba Inu, commonly known as SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that emerged in August 2020. It was created by an anonymous entity known as \u201cRyoshi.\u201d Named after the Japanese dog breed and often categorized as a \u201cmeme coin,\u201d SHIB has gained significant popularity, partly riding on the wave created by Dogecoin. As an ERC-20 token, SHIB is built on the Ethereum blockchain, benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s robust and secure network. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, with a notable portion burned or removed from circulation by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who also donated a part to charity.\n\nSHIB is central to a larger ecosystem that includes other tokens like LEASH and BONE, each serving unique roles within this ecosystem. The Shiba Inu community also developed ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange platform for trading and staking tokens. While SHIB is often seen as a speculative investment with high volatility, it maintains a strong presence and community engagement in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to data from TradingView, as of 4:05 p.m. UTC on 9 December 2023, SHIB is trading at around $0.00001031, up nearly 20% in the past 24-hour period.\n\nThe Shiba Inu community, engaging in discussions on platform X, compared Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees and speed with those of Shibarium. Clifford, a user on the platform, noted that Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee, though lower than the initially claimed $31.62 at $1.33, was still much higher than Shibarium\u2019s modest fee of $0.043 per transaction.\n\nAnother community member emphasized Shibarium\u2019s economic efficiency and scalability, pointing out that while Ethereum processes around 13-14 transactions per second, Shibarium manages five times that amount within the same timeframe.\n\nAnd also ETH is handling 13-14 transactions per second and #Shibarium is probably handling 5 times more per second.\n\nEconomical and scalable. \u2014 Shib Mehta (@shib_mehta) December 7, 2023\n\nShytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, contributed to the discussion by stating that Shibarium can process up to 200 transactions per second. Echoing this, Kaal Dhairya confirmed that Shibarium\u2019s current rate of 200 transactions per second is due to the present block limit for certain transactions.\n\nDhairya also revealed that Shibarium\u2019s actual capacity far exceeds 200 transactions per second and shared plans to further increase Shibarium\u2019s processing speed in the upcoming hard fork, allowing the network to handle a larger volume of transactions.\n\nActually it\u2019s 200/ sec as per the current block limit for certain type of transactions, capacity is way higher and it will be increased with the increase in block capacity in the next hard fork \u2014 Kaal (@kaaldhairya) December 7, 2023\n\nAs of the latest report, Shibarium has processed a total of 68,185,683 (68.18 million) transactions. Remarkably, since 2 December 2023, the network has consistently processed over 7 million transactions daily. Shibariumscan data shows that the network recorded 7.89 million transactions the previous day.\n\nFeatured Image via Unsplash"

        "title": "Ethereum climbs in value despite stalled growth in user numbers - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant resurgence, with Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network by market capitalization, leading the charge. Ethereum\u2019s price has soared to a 19-month high of $2,400, marking a remarkable recovery from the 2022 market downturn. This price increase comes when the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has expanded by over half a trillion dollars in just a few months. The rise in Ethereum\u2019s value coincides with heightened anticipation of a potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States, a development that could significantly influence the market.\n\nDespite this price escalation, Ethereum has not seen a corresponding increase in its user base. This situation is peculiar, considering the general tendency of retail investors to gravitate towards trending assets. The lack of new user growth on Ethereum\u2019s network, as indicated by data from IntoTheBlock, presents a curious scenario in the context of the current market enthusiasm.\n\nDespite the bullish market conditions, Ethereum is not seeing a significant influx of new users. Both the number of new addresses and the new adoption rate show no significant spikes. What do you think this means?\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/gyjfRaU3C9 pic.twitter.com/jKoe7AOuCY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 8, 2023\n\nComparative analysis with Bitcoin\n\nThe market\u2019s enthusiasm contrasts sharply with Bitcoin\u2019s user growth. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a consistent increase in its user base. The number of Bitcoin addresses and active users has been steadily climbing, with wallets holding a non-zero balance recently surpassing the 50 million mark. This growth in Bitcoin\u2019s user base indicates the strong interest and hype surrounding it, a trend not mirrored by Ethereum despite its price rise.\n\nThis discrepancy raises questions about Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics and future potential as there is an increasing interest in spot BTC and ETH ETFs in the United States. However, it is essential to understand that Ethereum\u2019s price might experience further growth if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves a spot Ethereum ETF, potentially attracting a new wave of users and investors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s future outlook\n\nThe current state of Ethereum\u2019s market points to a complex interplay between price dynamics and user engagement. The lack of new users joining the Ethereum network despite its price rally suggests a divergence from typical market behavior. Retail investors, who often fuel market movements through their collective actions, seem to be more cautious or selective in their approach towards Ethereum.\n\nAs stated earlier, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. could alter this scenario dramatically. Such an event might not only boost Ethereum\u2019s price but could also catalyze an influx of new users and investors, broadening the network\u2019s base and reinforcing its market position.\n\nAt the time of press, Ethereum is trading at $2,350, decreasing by 0.02% in the last 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency is undeniably a topic of controversy, with smart individuals on both sides of the debate. Some view it as a disruptive force capable of enhancing the financial industry, while others see it as a bubble destined for catastrophe. Despite differing opinions, the value created by crypto is indisputable. Over the past two years, the market has surged by over 500% to nearly $1.7 trillion, even after a recent $1 trillion crash.\n\nThe prospect of significant growth in the crypto market is plausible, considering the global equity market\u2019s $120 trillion valuation. This is more than 60 times larger than the combined value of all cryptocurrencies. However, with over 17,600 cryptos in circulation, investors must conduct extensive research to navigate the landscape.\n\nFor those seeking a starting point, consider these two coins. We believe each will emerge among the two most valuable tokens by 2030. Here\u2019s why!\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK)\n\nRetik Finance is at the forefront of innovation, utilizing open-source protocols and rapid product development to construct advanced crypto-fiat bridging systems. Through decentralized smart contracts and blockchain consensus mechanisms, Retik Finance provides swift, secure, and scalable global payment solutions, seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency into the global payment landscape. The platform addresses the demand for speed, convenience, safety, and security, optimizing efficiency for merchants.\n\nHowever, Retik Finance extends its mission through DeFi debit cards, acting as a direct link to users\u2019 digital wallets and offering unprecedented versatility in both physical and virtual formats. These cards facilitate the swift conversion of crypto funds into fiat currency during transactions, removing barriers to digital asset spending. Enhanced by integration with payment systems like Visa and Mastercard, they broaden the possibilities for digital asset usage.\n\nAdditionally, Retik Pay revolutionizes online payment processing within the Retik Finance ecosystem, introducing the benefits of blockchain technology to e-commerce for seamless, secure, and cost-effective transactions. In summary, Retik Finance presents a comprehensive solution, from advanced bridging systems to innovative payment gateways, making it a notable player in reshaping the future of decentralized finance.\n\nAlso, the Retik Wallet stands out as an all-encompassing solution, consolidating decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into a unified application and providing access to diverse liquidity sources. Users can seamlessly participate in various traditional DeFi activities such as swapping, farming, mining, staking, lending, borrowing, and shorting. Going beyond, it incorporates functionalities typically found in major centralized exchanges. Security is paramount, ensuring the safeguarding of all user transactions through Retik Enclave technology, which intelligently parses call data.\n\nLastly, the recent launch of Retik Finance\u2019s presale has sparked significant interest, with the RETIK token currently valued at $0.030 and garnering an impressive $333,091 within just 48 hours. This early success has captured the attention of experts, leading to the anticipation that the RETIK token is poised for long-term prominence in the market.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum stands as a decentralized global software platform, driven by blockchain technology and is renowned for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). It serves as an open platform for crafting secure digital technologies, featuring a token facilitating blockchain support and enabling transactions for goods and services.\n\nWith scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization at its core, Ethereum is the preferred blockchain for innovators reshaping industries and daily routines. Integral to its capabilities is native support for smart contracts, a key element empowering decentralized applications, including widespread use in decentralized finance (DeFi) and various other applications.\n\nHowever, with Ethereum gaining momentum, the altcoins market picks up the pace for a new sprint till 2030 and beyond. The price of Ethereum forms a new 52-week high at $2392 and teases a trend continuation for long-term gain beyond $3000. With plans to extend the year-to-date growth of 98%, the ETH price prediction holds a bullish standpoint for the upcoming trend.\n\nIt is highly recommended to consider retaining Ethereum (ETH) with a focus on long-term rewards. Holding ETH over an extended period allows investors to potentially capitalize on the cryptocurrency\u2019s growth and value appreciation, aligning with its historical trend of delivering significant returns over time. This strategic approach not only reflects confidence in Ethereum\u2019s enduring potential but also positions investors to benefit from the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) stand out as the two tokens worth holding until 2030, with Retik Finance being the preferred choice. This preference is attributed to the impactful solutions it provides, coupled with its current low valuation of $0.030 as of the latest update.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Ethereum Could Soar to $36,800 by 2030; Polkadot and InQubeta Surge Ahead - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn preparation for the new year, investors have been looking for the best crypto investment opportunities. The state of the market has been very positive these past months, which has led to optimistic predictions for many cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum (ETH). Token Terminal, an analytics tool, has projected that Ethereum may reach $36,800 by 2030. This suggests that Ethereum\u2019s advantages over new DeFi projects and network expansion point to an 18X increase by the decade\u2019s end.\n\nAs market optimism grows, Polkadot (DOT) and InQubeta (QUBE) have exceeded expectations. DOT recently staged a recovery, surging from its $3.55 low. At the same time, QUBE continues to deliver on promised profits during its crypto ICO, pulling in investors with milestone achievements and a constant push to new highs. These performances have revived interest in Polkadot and increased investor confidence in InQubeta.\n\nLet\u2019s explore Ethereum\u2019s projection while examining Polkadot\u2019s and InQubeta\u2019s price surges.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s (QUBE) Impressive Presale Performance Pushes It To Deliver Explosive Gains\n\nWhen InQubeta launched the presale of its native token, QUBE, early this year, many thought that it was like other new DeFi projects that tried to jump on the AI trend. Surprisingly, the token went through multiple rallies as each stage ended. The platform\u2019s use of AI in a niche way, combined with its impressive presale milestone of millions of dollars raised, has earned InQubeta massive demand for the QUBE token and a rapid 130% surge.\n\nThe crypto ICO event sells QUBE for $0.0161, with the potential for investors to pocket 90% of the profit when QUBE hits $0.0308 at the end of the presale. Investors will still see serious gains when QUBE debuts on top-performing exchanges like Uniswap and trading activity skyrockets. The event has so far sold over 550 million tokens and raised $5.5 million, setting InQubeta on the path to becoming one of the most valuable DeFi companies by the decade\u2019s end.\n\nThe platform plans to create crowdfunding for AI startups by helping them list NFTs representing investment opportunities in AI technologies on InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace. When investors buy these NFTs, they\u2019re investing in the AI industry, which is expected to be worth more than a trillion dollars by the decade\u2019s end. Interest in artificial intelligence is at an all-time high, and InQubeta is the best crypto investment to get a piece of the AI sector\u2019s growth.\n\nSome things that have earned InQubeta massive demand are that its NFTs are fractionalized, meaning they\u2019re budget-friendly. The platform also has staking benefits that provide extra income for QUBE holders when they stake their tokens on the platform. Only a handful of DeFi companies offer this kind of value; they\u2019re all expensive to invest in. But InQubeta is still in its presale stage, offering investors a window to get QUBE at a discount.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) Surges Due To Strong Protocol Security\n\nPolkadot has been making smart moves towards implementing strong developments to its protocol. They recently launched anti-scam bounty initiatives to reduce the number of scams on the platform. Since the initiative\u2019s release last year, DOT has won over more investment than it previously had. Other plans for a partial migration to decentralized teams in the ecosystem have increased the long-term stability of DOT, and rewards for these initiatives are already showing. DOT has been trending since October, shooting upwards by over 60% from $3.56 to a high of 5.89, reviving investors\u2019 interest in Polkadot.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Network Development Hints At Potential Token Rally To $36,800\n\nToken Terminal recently did a deep analysis of Ethereum and found several developments that could boost the cryptocurrency to explosive heights. It was reported that the scarcity of ETH and Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to proof of stake could quicken its token\u2019s rally to $36,800. Token Terminal also observed that although Ethereum has inconsistent gas fees and shaky scalability, ETH is still on track to dominate because its first-mover advantages and network innovation give it an edge over the competition. Token Terminal added that by 2030, a large chunk of the finance sector\u2019s revenue will be circulating Ethereum\u2014 at an estimated value of $14 trillion.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe recent performance of cryptocurrencies shows this is one of the best seasons to invest in them. Investors currently in Ethereum are bound to pocket some life-changing gains if it grows to hit its expected 18X growth by 2030. At the same time, holders of DOT and QUBE have already started seeing gains as Polkadot and InQubeta rally. As the market gears up for a massive uptrend next year, new investors should consider investing in the InQubeta presale. Industry experts are optimistic that InQubeta could dominate AI cryptos in no time because of its mouthwatering benefits, and the presale is the best way to maximize earnings.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"
