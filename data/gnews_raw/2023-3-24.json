        "title": "Ethereum's ERC-4337 Standard: Explained - Ledger",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 Standard: Explained\n\nBy Jemima Conlon\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 standard makes it easier to design interoperable smart wallets.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The ERC-4337 standard is commonly misconceived as achieving account abstraction, instead, it defines a decentralized relay network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 While smart wallets already existed, this ERC-4337 standard allows for new capabilities which will improve user experience.\n\nIf you follow the latest in Ethereum news, you may have heard about the ERC-4337 standard announcement. If you haven\u2019t, let us explain.\n\nERC-4337 sets a new standard for crypto accounts using smart contracts. They may seem familiar on the surface, but this contract standard allows for something very different from the smart wallets you might know thus far. These accounts have capabilities that may affect the wider Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nBut hold on a minute. Smart wallets aren\u2019t a new thing, right?\n\n\n\nCorrect! In fact, popular smart wallets such as Argent and Gnosis Safe existed long before ERC-4337\u2019s inception. These wallets have similar capabilities, such as social recovery for those who lose access to their accounts. However ERC-4337 accounts can actually do much more.\n\nBut what is the ERC-4337 really about? Plus how do these wallets work compared to the smart wallets we are already familiar with?\n\nLet\u2019s explore, as Ledger Academy takes you through what ERC-4337 smart wallets really mean for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nERC-4337 is a Smart Wallet standard on the Ethereum Blockchain. While the concept was proposed back in 2021, Yoav Weiss, an Ethereum Foundation developer, announced its availability for use at WalletCon in Colorado on March 1, 2023. The standard can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchain and allows for a new Ethereum wallet account capable of arbitrary verification logic.\n\nIf that sounds too technical for you, in short, this innovation allows you to perform complex actions straight from your wallet. Another key feature of these kinds of wallets is: they are not solely based on private key ownership, opting for a smart contract solution instead. That said, many smart wallets use mechanisms for validation that may still require a private key.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s a way to make the user experience better, allowing users to customize how to pay transaction fees. While many have said ERC-4337 achieves account abstraction, that\u2019s not exactly the case.\n\nBut to understand that, let\u2019s first understand what account abstraction means.\n\nWhat is Account Abstraction?\n\nAccount abstraction is a way to let people use smart contracts as their primary accounts, essentially creating \u201csmart wallets\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s a bit more than that. Account abstraction aims to do a few important (and ambitious) things.\n\nFirstly, it allows you to execute functions directly from your wallet. It also gives your wallet the \u201cintelligence\u201d to determine how much to pay for a transaction fee and who will pay it. Account abstraction also allows for more advanced security features. For example, it allows you to set up transactions that require multiple signatures.\n\nFurthermore, recovery becomes a problem of the past: You can even recover your account without centralized help.\n\nPerhaps most excitingly, account abstraction allows for quantum-safe cryptography, meaning even a quantum computer wouldn\u2019t be able to hack the system.\n\nERC-4337 Vs Account Abstraction: What\u2019s the difference\n\nAlthough ERC-4337 accounts allow you to execute functions and have more flexibility over who pays transaction fees, it does not achieve true account abstraction.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin stated, \u201cThe big really valuable, and necessary thing that ERC-4337 provides for account abstraction is a decentralized fee market for user operations going into smart contract wallets.\u201d\n\nTo explain, instead of allowing for true account abstraction, ERC-4337 is like a transaction relayer: It allows you to organize transactions in an off-chain order book, and then relay the final transaction to the blockchain.\n\nTrue account abstraction will offer much more than that: It aims to change the way Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) interact with the Ethereum blockchain itself.\n\nHowever, these functionalities will require an upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s whole consensus \u2013 which is no easy feat. While the ERC-4337 standard is an important step in the right direction, Ethereum account abstraction is still a way away.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337 for?\n\nWell, now you know that ERC-4337 is one step on the path to account abstraction. But what does it actually let us do? Some of the most exciting things about this standard include;\n\nPerforming Multiple Actions in One Transaction\n\nFirstly the standard allows you to bundle multiple transactions together. This means you can set approval for, initiate and execute a trade all in one go, and it\u2019s only possible due to \u201cbundling\u201d. This is great for traders and gamers specifically, who currently must sign multiple transactions just to carry out one action.\n\nPerforming One Transaction with Multiple People\n\nThere are a couple of instances you might want to share a transaction with your friends or family and ERC-4337 makes that possible.\n\nFirstly, it allows you to set up a transaction that requires multiple signatures. So for example, you could set up a transaction that needs the signature of both you and your partner before validation.\n\nThe advancement also lets you share transactions in other ways. For example, while using ERC-4337 wallets you don\u2019t always have to pay a gas fee., That\u2019s because \u201csponsored transactions\u201d are now possible, allowing another entity, such as a dApp or wallet provider, to pick up the transaction fee for you. To make it even easier, these wallets will also let you pay transactions with arbitrary tokens, such as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nA more Seamless User Experience\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard allows for other functionalities too. For example, blockchain subscriptions will be possible, as the ERC-4337 standard can process automated and recurring payments. You can now set up a recurring payment to an online magazine or even a monthly coffee subscription using these types of accounts.\n\nAdditionally, you can set pre-approval and auto-approve transactions. This allows a more seamless experience for users, which is especially important for players of blockchain games.\n\nImproved Security Measures\n\nFinally, the ERC-4337 standard gives users more flexibility with their security. For example, it allows you to define rules regarding spending or approval. For example, you may want to limit the amount you can spend in a single transaction, within a single day, or even over a whole month. You can also use this standard to set up more complex methods to access your funds, requiring 2FA and a hardware wallet signature for transactions over a certain amount.\n\nLike many smart wallets today ERC-4337 also has the power to let you recover your wallet.\n\nIf you lose access to your account, smart wallets use a feature called Social recovery. This is not a new concept. Argent is a good example of a smart wallet that allows specific people, called guardians, to help you regain access to your assets.\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard aims to allow you to do something similar in a more decentralized way. The idea is that each thing you interact with on the blockchain can now help provide a piece of proof of who you are, instead of having to rely on a centralized validator.\n\nSo, How Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nTo explain the ERC-4337 smart wallet standard introduces a new object (a basic unit of data that contains information and allows certain functions) to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe new object introduced by the ERC-4337 standard is called \u201cUserOperation\u201d. When a user initiates a UserOperation, it\u2019s sent to the mempool \u2013 a place where transactions go to be validated. This is an entirely separate mempool from the one used for processing transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nFirstly, you must understand that all transactions on the Ethereum network must be triggered and paid for by an Externally owned Account (EOA). Using a separate mempool lets users bypass these rules without affecting Ethereum\u2019s underlying system.\n\nIt has different requirements to the mainnet, meaning you have more flexibility with the details of your transaction.\n\nFirstly, you can perform multiple transactions at once. But more importantly, anyone with an EOA, such as a wallet provider, can pay the fees on behalf of the user.\n\nTo explain, once the userOperations are bundled into an Ethereum mainnet transaction, they still require payment via an EOA. However, ERC-4337 defines a way where it doesn\u2019t actually need to be the user themselves. This makes the process more efficient and minimizes user fees.\n\nHow To Use Smart Wallets Securely\n\nWhile a smart wallet may have more functionality than a traditional wallet, it doesn\u2019t have to operate alone. It contains valuable assets, thus securing your smart wallet is very important.\n\nTo do so, it\u2019s recommended that you set up your smart wallet with a hardware wallet. In short, your hardware wallet is designed to keep your private key safe from the internet and its risks. Working in tandem with your smart wallet, your hardware wallet can act as an unhackable verification method, allowing you to sign transactions with your smart wallet with confidence.\n\nWhile web2 hardware like smartphones and laptops are subject to hacks, web3 hardware wallets are not. For this reason, using a hardware wallet with your smart wallet is still the most secure option for securing your digital assets. Ledger hardware wallets secure your keys with a secure Element chip, known to be one of the safest computer chips in existence. This means you can sign transactions with absolute confidence. For now, a Ledger Device is still the most secure option for protecting your keys- and therefore your assets."

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Polygon? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Amid all the excitement surrounding The Merge last year, the fortunes of Ethereum (ETH 1.51%) and Polygon (MATIC 1.81%) appeared to be inextricably linked. After all, Polygon was the most popular Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, so any future growth in the Ethereum ecosystem implied future growth in the Polygon ecosystem. But fast forward to 2023, and it looks like the paths of these two cryptocurrencies are starting to diverge.\n\nWhile both cryptos are up about 50% for the year, it's their performance over the past 30 days that's the most troubling. During that time, Ethereum was up about 10%, while Polygon was down 17%. Is this a short-term mispricing in the marketplace or a sign for investors that Polygon's future growth prospects are coming under pressure?\n\nWhat happened to Polygon's growth?\n\nOn the surface, the growth story for Polygon remains in place. It's arguably still the most popular Layer 2 in the Ethereum ecosystem and has some of the best technology out there for making Ethereum run faster, better, and more efficiently.\n\nMoreover, there are still plenty of top brands and companies utilizing Polygon for new Web3 initiatives. As a result, Polygon has a market capitalization of $9.8 billion, making it one of the top 10 cryptos in the world.\n\nHowever, look beneath the surface, and the picture gets a bit murkier because there's been a steep falloff in growth at Polygon since December.\n\nFor example, consider the number of new Polygon addresses being created on a daily basis. These are down 32% from mid-February levels, a warning sign that developers and users could be looking elsewhere when deciding to build on top of Ethereum. Even more troubling, Polygon recently said it was cutting of 20% of its team.\n\nThe crowded Layer 2 field\n\nWhat's going on here? The problems at Polygon could be linked to the emergence of new competition.\n\nPolygon isn't the only Layer 2 option that developers have, and it's starting to become very evident now. For example, Optimism (OP) seemingly exploded out of nowhere this year to become a super-popular Layer 2 scaling solution. For the year, it's up more than 170%.\n\nOptimism recently made headlines as the result of a high-profile partnership with crypto exchange operator Coinbase Global. If you look at key blockchain metrics such as total value locked (TVL), Optimism appears to be narrowing the gap with Polygon.\n\nMoreover, there are other Layer 2 names out there that are generating buzz. Another top Layer 2 solution is Immutable X (IMX -2.93%), which is up more than 200% this year. It now has a market cap of over $1 billion, making it the No. 53 crypto in the world.\n\nBut the name that everyone is talking about now is Arbitrum, which is about to get its own crypto token soon. According to some traders, the price of Polygon could sink as much as 15% as soon as the new Arbitrum token starts trading.\n\nLayer 1 or Layer 2?\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has shown little-to-no impact from the recent spate of bank failures and bank runs and is now being mentioned as a potential safe haven for investors thinking about moving their money into crypto. According to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, Ethereum has not \"skipped a beat\" during the recent market upheaval, and that should be very reassuring to investors.\n\nUltimately, the choice of whether to invest in Ethereum or Polygon comes down to a single question: Do you feel more comfortable investing in a Layer 1 or a Layer 2 blockchain? While there's a lot of exciting activity happening at the Layer 2 level, the field is getting so crowded now that investing in a Layer 1 looks a lot more appealing.\n\nFinally, keep in mind track records. Ethereum has a proven track record dating back to 2015 and managed to pull off The Merge in 2022 amid one of the worst crypto meltdowns ever. If you're looking for a crypto to ride out the gathering financial storm, the clear choice now is Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Potential Rivalries: Exploring the Competition among Smart Contract Platforms - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is known for its smart contract capabilities, which enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain.\n\nHowever, as blockchain technology becomes more widely used, other smart contract platforms are emerging as possible competitors to Ethereum. In this post, we will look at the competition among smart contract platforms as well as Ethereum's possible competitors.\n\nSmart Contract Platform on Ethereum\n\nEthereum's smart contract platform is one of the industry's most established and widely used. It's been used to build dApps in a variety of industries, including finance, gaming, and supply chain management.\n\nThe platform\u2019s success can be ascribed to its accessibility and the large developer community that contributes to its development and upkeep.\n\nHowever, several new competitors are challenging Ethereum\u2019s supremacy in the smart contract platform market.\n\nCompetitors to Ethereum\u2019s Smart Contract Platform\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that debuted in 2017. Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum's co-founders, invented it. The network employs a proof-of-stake consensus process, which is more energy-efficient than Ethereum's proof-of-work mechanism. Cardano also claims to be more scalable than Ethereum, with a transaction rate of up to 257 per second.\n\nPolkadot\n\nPolkadot is a multi-chain platform that began operations in 2020. It was developed by Gavin Wood, who was also a co-founder of Ethereum. The platform employs a novel sharding method that allows for parallel transaction processing, making it more scalable than Ethereum.\n\nPolkadot also enables blockchain interoperability, allowing for smooth communication and data transfer across them.\n\nBinance Smart Chain\n\nBinance Smart Chain is a blockchain technology that was introduced in 2020 by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It employs a proof-of-staked authority consensus mechanism, which is more efficient and less energy-intensive than Ethereum's proof-of-work process. Binance Smart Chain is also less expensive than Ethereum, with lower transaction gas fees.\n\nSolana\n\nSolana, which was introduced in 2020, is a high-performance blockchain platform. It employs a novel consensus technique known as Proof of History, which enables rapid and secure transaction processing. Solana promises to be one of the quickest blockchain platforms today, capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nEthereum's Rivals' Opportunities and Challenges\n\nWhile these new smart contract platforms threaten Ethereum's supremacy, they also bring substantial potential and difficulties.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAs new platforms arise, there is a potential for innovation and the development of new features and capabilities that can benefit the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.\n\nScalability: Many of these platforms are working to improve their scalability, which is a major hurdle for Ethereum. If such solutions are successfully implemented, they may attract developers and users who want rapid and efficient transaction processing.\n\nCost: Some platforms are focusing on lowering transaction costs, which may entice developers and consumers who are put off by Ethereum's high gas fees.\n\nChallenges\n\nEthereum's supremacy is due in part to the network effects that have built around its platform. Many developers and users are already familiar with Ethereum, which makes developing and deploying dApps on its platform easier. It will be difficult for new platforms to overcome the network effect and gain a large user base.\n\nSecurity: Ethereum has been through many battles and has a solid security infrastructure in place. New platforms may lack the same level of protection and be subject to cyber attacks.\n\nAdoption: Creating a successful smart contract platform necessitates not only technology but also a developer and user community. It will be difficult for new platforms to attract and retain this community, especially given that established platforms such as Ethereum already have a big and loyal community.\n\nWill Ethereum 2.0 Blow Its Competition out of the Water?\n\nEthereum 2.0 is a major upgrade that promises to deliver significant improvements in scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is expected to make the network more energy-efficient and secure.\n\nAnd, what perhaps is the key differentiating element, Ethereum 2.0 will introduce sharding, which will divide the network into smaller pieces, enabling it to process more transactions in parallel.\n\nWhen taking a closer look at how Ethereum 2.0 compares to Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, the advantage given by ETH 2.0 sharding becomes evident.\n\nETH 2.0 VS Cardano\n\nCardano is a third-generation blockchain that was created to address the scalability and sustainability issues of existing blockchains.\n\nThe Cardano platform uses a PoS consensus mechanism, which is similar to Ethereum 2.0. However, Cardano has given the PoS model a twist by using a rather unique approach called Ouroboros, which is designed to be more secure and energy-efficient than other PoS implementations.\n\nBut, while Cardano may be an impressive platform, it seems it won\u2019t be able to match the speed and efficiency of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nEthereum 2.0's sharding approach is expected to enable it to process up to 100,000 transactions per second, while Cardano's current capacity is limited to just 257 transactions per second.\n\nETH 2.0 VS Solana\n\nSolana is another third-generation blockchain that aims to address the scalability limitations of existing blockchains. The Solana platform uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH), which is designed to enable high-speed processing of transactions.\n\nSolana can process up to 65,000 transactions per second, which is significantly higher than Ethereum's current capacity but lower than what ETH 2.0 promises to deliver.\n\nThis happens because while Solana's processing speed is impressive, Ethereum 2.0's sharding capabilities are expected to give a massive boost to its transaction speed.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum 2.0's shift to PoS is expected to make the network more energy-efficient and secure than Solana's PoH consensus mechanism.\n\nETH 2.0 VS Polkadot\n\nPolkadot is a third-generation blockchain that aims to enable interoperability between different blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, the Polkadot platform uses a unique sharding approach which makes this blockchain duel much more interesting.\n\nPolkadot enables multiple chains to run in parallel, enabling interoperability between them. This feature is intended to enable different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other more seamlessly, which is currently a major limitation in the blockchain space.\n\nMoreover, Polkadot is able to provide stronger guarantees than ETH 2.0 with fewer validators per shard, which is an incredible feat many seem to overlook.\n\nBut, while Polkadot's vision of interoperability is unique and promises to deliver more TPS than ETH 2.0, one can't rule out Ethereum just yet as it has a large and active developer community which is expected to continue to drive innovation and development on the platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, new smart contract platforms are likely to emerge as possible competitors to Ethereum. While Ethereum has tremendous market domination, it is not indestructible.\n\nThe advent of new platforms opens up new avenues for innovation and advancement in the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. however, these systems present substantial hurdles, such as network effects, security, and acceptance.\n\nFinally, the ability of any smart contract platform to attract and sustain a loyal community of developers and users will determine its success. While Ethereum's competitors may have certain benefits in terms of scalability, cost, and creativity, they may find it difficult to overcome the network effects that have been built around the Ethereum platform.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the platform emerges as the dominating force in the market for smart contract platforms."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe crypto market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, appear to be poised for significant price momentum in the coming week. As we approach the end of the month, traders are eagerly anticipating a continuation of the recent upward trend in the cryptocurrency market. Over the last few weeks, these two leading cryptos showed massive gains, and investors are now waiting for an extended bullish rally to maximize their gain.\n\nVolatility is Waiting for BTC And ETH Prices\n\nAmid high banking crisis and crypto market\u2019s regulatory concerns, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are not slowing down to reach new highs. Despite overall bearish market sentiments, investors are still betting on long-term gains on BTC and ETH as there is an astronomical spike in trading volume and buying pressure, creating possibilities of a new bull run next week.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nBitcoin reached a new nine-month high by surging past $29,000 recently, but the celebration was short-lived as the asset experienced a sharp retracement in the hours that followed. Following a loss of $28,000 the previous day, weekend trading remained relatively stable as traders awaited a break before the resumption of traditional finance markets, resulting in a lack of usual volatility.\n\nBitcoin price is currently showing an inside-day candlestick pattern, signifying a state of FUD among buyers and sellers. Although the bulls aim to extend the up-move, the bears remain firm and unwilling to give in, leading to the price remaining within a narrow range.\n\nAs of writing, BTC price trades at $27.5K, with a decline of 2% in the last 24 hours. The weekly price chart indicates Bitcoin price will likely consolidate below $30K for the next few days. However, a breakout above $30K is expected next week, and the BTC will head toward the crucial resistance of $34K-$38K.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOut of all the altcoins in the cryptocurrency space, Ethereum\u2019s price closely mirrors the performance trend of Bitcoin. Multiple successful breaches of the $1,800 level have been achieved by the digital asset, resulting in increased profits and attracting more investors.\n\nEther breached the overhead resistance of $1,800, but the bulls could not maintain the breakout, as evidenced by the long wick on the candlestick.\n\nThe bears are currently attempting to reinforce their position by pushing the price towards the 20-day EMA ($1,698), which is a crucial level to monitor for potential downsides. ETH price is currently trading at $1,753, declining by 1% from yesterday.\n\nThe weekly price chart indicates a minor downward correction for ETH price next week, as the altcoin may drop below the EMA-50 trend line and reach the bottom levels of $1,500 before sparking fresh surges."

        "title": "What is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?: ETH Analysis - YouHodler.com",
        "content": "The Ethereum cryptocurrency network has a massive update due in April 2023 called the Shanghai upgrade. The Shanghai upgrade is a hard fork. It will radically change the blockchain\u2019s protocol - hopefully for the better.\n\nEthereum is no stranger to huge updates like this, seen by their switch to proof-of-stake. All signs point to The Shanghai upgrade significantly benefiting the blockchain and it comes as a result of ETH\u2019s liquid staking consensus mechanism.\n\nBut how will this affect your crypto wallet exactly?\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is a series of upgrades. The Ethereum developers will implement them at once. To understand this upgrade's significance, it's important to know Etherem's history. This upgrade is the result of several past changes to Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nThe proof-of-works(PoW) period\n\nEthereum started in 2015 as a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency, just like Bitcoin. This method involves spending time and energy to solve complex math formulas. Using sophisticated technology, miners who solve the formulas receive crypto rewards. This type of consensus mechanism has some downsides, though.\n\nPoW is energy-intensive and made scaling hard for the blockchain.\n\nSuggested reading: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: The Ultimate Guide\n\nEthereum migrates to Proof-of-stake (PoS)\n\nAfter many test runs, ETH switched to the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism in 2020. This hard fork change is now called \"the Ethereum Merge.\" This made the blockchain more secure, and eco-friendly and improved scalability.\n\nPrimary benefits of \"The Merge\"\n\nThe Merge allowed Ethereum validators to stake their crypto in the blockchain for passive income. At the time, they could not withdraw their ETH from the blockchain. The funds were locked to support the network. This method is similar to a high-yield savings account in a traditional bank. Holders with stakes in ETH could also vote on future blockchain changes.\n\nPrimary challenges of Ethereum's PoS mechanism\n\nThe PoS system still had one big negative, though - cost. To join the Beacon Chain, which coordinates staking, users had to give a minimum of 32 ETH. At the time the PoS system was rolled in, one ETH cost about $4,000. At the time of writing, it is around $1,550. This high entry point made it difficult for many to join.\n\nThe solution: The Shanghai Upgrade\n\nCrypto teams improved this issue somewhat using liquid staking. With this technique, users can stake a smaller amount of ETH in return for tokens that represent their crypto. They can then use their tokens for other transactions. The Shanghai upgrade seeks to address this issue even further and make it more accessible to join ETH.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum tested a draft version of the Shanghai upgrade, the Shangdong test network. It tried out the practicality of the upgrade proposals. The Shanghai upgrade has five proposals, with one more\n\nproposal (EIP-4844) postponed to 2024. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal.\n\nWhat improvements will Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade bring?\n\nThe five proposed changes in the current Shanghai upgrade are:\n\nEIP-3651: Warm COINBASE\n\nCoinbase payments are becoming more popular. To improve transaction execution, Coinbase addresses will be warm at their start. This will increase transaction speed but maintain security.\n\nEIP-3855: PUSH0 instruction\n\nThis introduces the PUSH0 instruction to contracts. It keeps the stack at a constant 0 value. This change will reduce contract code size and reduce the need for the DIP instruction (which solves duplicating zeroes). It also reduces the risk of contracts misusing instructions for optimization.\n\nEIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode\n\nThis EIP extends EIP-170 with a maximum size limit for the initialization code. This ensures the code is fairly charged to minimize future risk. It also provides an extendable cost system for the future.\n\nEIP-4895: Beacon Chain push withdrawals\n\nThis improvement introduces a system-level operation to support validator withdrawals. It provides a separate way for withdrawals to enter the EVM (Ethereum virtual machine). The EVM executes smart contracts on the blockchain network.\n\nThis is the most important change. It gives validators the option to withdraw their staking rewards. Since the Ethereum Merge, validators have staked over $17 million in Ether. This works out to over 22 billion USD.\n\nWhile some validators are sure to withdraw stakes, there\u2019ll be a cap of 43,200 ETH per day. The cap, and ETH\u2019s other improvements, will prevent a mass exit of validators. More people will likely become validators.\n\nEIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT\n\nThis warns against the use of the self-destruct instruction, which terminates a smart contract. However, ETH users are still discussing how best to use self-destruct. A change to this EIP is likely to come in the future.\n\nETH Analysis: Will the upgrade affect the price?\n\nAnalysts have theories about whether the Shanghai upgrade will affect Ethereum's price. Some users fear the upgrade will cause a crash, but there are some arguments against that.\n\n\u200d Withdrawal process : Validators queue up to withdraw stakes and go through a two-tier system. At maximum, only 10% of the staked ETH can leave the pool per month.\n\n\u200d \u200d\n\n: Validators queue up to withdraw stakes and go through a two-tier system. At maximum, only 10% of the staked ETH can leave the pool per month. \u200d Staking popularity will increase: Staking popularity is likely to rise after the upgrade. JPMorgan says Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio will increase post-upgrade. The number of validators could rise from half a million to 2.2 million. This will result in a massive net positive. The increased investment will appreciate the value of ETH.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade will improve the security and effectiveness of Ethereum\u2019s PoS system. It\u2019s not likely to cause any major negatives, and will probably improve prices in the long term. You can expect to see the upgrade launch in early April 2023 - but delays are expected.\n\nFor traders, expect volatility in both directions. Ethereum - and the blockchain industry on the whole - is still young and experiencing growing pains. Bullish and bearish volatility is normal. However, this volatility presents plenty of good opportunities for those prepared.\n\nDisclaimer: \u201cThe content should not be construed as investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

        "title": "Choosing Polygon over Ethereum to Build Efficient dApps - Appinventiv",
        "content": "Polygon aims to give people numerous choices when they create dApp on Polygon. Some developers keep security over speed while others compromise on security for lowered fees and speed \u2013 the technology is building multiple Ethereum-centric scaling solutions to address all these different features.\n\nEthereum has remained a pillar in the cryptocurrency space. Right from DeFi to smart contracts and even NFTs, Ethereum has remained one of the key innovations of Web3. However, inspite of the glaring success, the technology has struggled with massive network congestion, high network fees, and lowering transaction throughput \u2013 factors that have created a scope for newer crypto projects coming in to scale it. Polygon is one such project.\n\nOriginated in 2017, India-based software company Polygon Technology scales Ethereum without sacrificing on its decentralization benefits. With the number of dApps on Polygon having reached 53,000, businesses are using the technology\u2019s low fees and fast speed to build Ethereum-powered dApps.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look into the different facets of Polygon and what makes the technology better than using Ethereum for dApps development.\n\nHow does the Polygon dApp builder work?\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables developers to build dApps on Ethereum without getting stuck with Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nHow it does that is by developing a layer 2 solution using off-chain on-chain concepts and different governance models like Proof of Stake, which helps the network lower its energy footprint by 99.95% \u2013 one which Etherum has also reached after The Merge. In addition to using a PoS architecture where the network participants stake MATIC for validating the transactions, Polygon enables developers to use its open source SDK to launch their Polygon dApp at the back of multiple scaling techniques:\n\nZK-Rollups: The ethereum-based technology acquired a zero-knowledge (ZK) protocol developer, Mir, for USD 400 million. What this protocol does is it enables transaction authenticators to validate the encrypted data without actually accessing the information enabling them to generate the verification proof in under 170 milliseconds.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: It consists of bundling several off-chain transactions into massive batches before submitting them in Ethereum. This way, the fixed costs get spread across multiple transactions that reduce the end-user fees. In essence, this scaling technique assumes off-chain transactions validity without pushing out validity proofs for the on-chain transaction batches by following a fraud-proving methodology to identify transactions having discrepancies.\n\nPlasma Chains: This scaling technique builds a child-parent relationship in Ethereum\u2019s main chain. For example, the plasma chains can deploy their own dApps on Polygon which comes in handy when the other sidechains get hacked or are down. Additionally, the plasma chains tend to deliver off-chain transactions at higher efficiency levels.\n\nAt the back of these scaling methods, while the answer to how much time does it take to build dApp on Polygon is same as that on Ethereum or other blockchain technology, the transaction speed and cost difference is unmatched.\n\nFeatures of Polygon for dApp development\n\nThe technology merges the capabilities of sovereign blockchains and Ethereum into an attractive feature set that helps developers build a decentralized app on Polygon that is highly efficient, scalable, and speedy.\n\nEthereum compatibility\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon you work on a platform with complete Ethereum compatibility to tech stack, languages, standards, and tools.\n\nHigh scalability\n\nThe technology is built on dedicated blockchains, a scalable consensus algorithm, and a customized Wasm execution environment.\n\nCompetitive network Greater security\n\nPolygon dApp development is built on a modular \u201csecurity as a service\u201d facility offered either by Ethereum or a pool or validators.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe technology comes with a native support for the arbitrary messaging passing bridges for external systems and can easily connect with Ethereum main chain using the bridging SDKs polygon offers.\n\nGood user experience\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon it is very similar to one on Web2 purely at the back of a facility like instantaneous transaction finality.\n\nModularity\n\nPolygon comes with high extensibility, customization, upgradability, community collaboration, and a short time-to-market.\n\nThese features of Polygon for dApp development are designed to bring the technology at par with the adoption of Ethereum minus all the limitations of the latter. This makes it profitable for developers and enterprises alike to build a decentralized app on Polygon.\n\nAmidst these feature sets and the obvious benefits of Polygon for dApp development, is it time to let go of Ethereum? And on a technological level, what difference does Ethereum hold from Polygon dApp development?\n\nCreating dApps on Polygon vs Ethereum\n\nWhile The Merge moved Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, bringing down its 112 TWh of energy consumption down to 0.01 TWh, the technology is where Polygon already is.\n\nThe Merge however, didn\u2019t change the high variable transaction cost that Ethereum comes with \u2013 a factor that Polygon addresses on a massive extent. In addition to this, the transaction processing speed has also remained unchanged, which in case of Polygon dApps development is only 65,000 transactions per second at the back of the Layer 2 scalability solution.\n\nLet us look into the differences to understand why it makes sense to build dApps on Polygon.\n\nFactors Ethereum Polygon Foundation 2013 2017 Scalability 10 TPS 7000 Market Cap 139.56 Billion 7.698 Billion Average transaction fees 0.4876 US$0.01 Programming language Solidity Solidity, Golang, Vyper Transaction Deterministic Finality Instant 5 minutes Total dApps 2970 53,000\n\nWhile Polygon\u2019s popularity is on a fast rise, there are some issues that are still prevalent in the technology. For understanding Polygon to its entirety, it is critical to know the limitations it comes attached with. Let us give a brief look at them:\n\nEthereum Dependency: Ethereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations.\n\nEthereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations. Under Development: Presently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions. Other scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zk Rollups, Sidechains, Validum Chains, and Enterprise Chains, etc. are still in their developmental stages with an unsurety around when they would be live.\n\nPresently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions. Other scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zk Rollups, Sidechains, Validum Chains, and Enterprise Chains, etc. are still in their developmental stages with an unsurety around when they would be live. Matic Plasma Chains: Polygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma.\n\nPolygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma. Competition: There are a number of scaling solutions such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc. which are gaining steady momentum. They are making use of Ethereum and other blockchains to offer better user experience. Amidst this, we might see other solutions coming up and taking Polygon\u2019s market share.\n\nWith everything we have covered up until this point, one thing is clear \u2013 even though the technology has some limitations which need to be addressed, the benefits of Polygon for dApp development are unignorable. However, for an entrepreneur what is necessary is to know the use cases on which they can create dApp on Polygon.\n\nThe use cases to build dApp on Polygon\n\nThe biggest reason why dApp development service providers like Appinventiv choose Polygon is the fact that the end product is the same as what results from Ethereum app development but the customer experience is much greater. So while the businesses get the same Ethereum-powered app, their users get an innovative user experience, higher lowered transaction speed, and minimal transaction fees.\n\nPayments: Polygon platform is engineered to create dApps that speed up the payment process, powering almost real-time payment settlement via specialized API and SDK integration. This enables apps, users, and merchants to instantly perform transactions through multiple cryptocurrencies, usually through the ETH or ERC-20 tokens. This system is being rolled out in three distinct phases: 1. ERC-20 token payments 2. Token transfer in cross-chain 3. Fiat-based payment models.\n\nLending Platform: The next use case to consider when you build dApp on Polygon is creating a module that would enable lenders to analyze users credit ratings and building a smart contract that would automate the loan disbursement journey.\n\nGames: The Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution of Polygon makes blockchain-based gaming platform development efficient and fast. With Ethereum and Polygon working together, the platform will be able to address the lag issues that non-Polygon blockchain games face.\n\nOther Use Cases: There are a range of other use cases to consider when you build a decentralized app on Polygon such as enabling fast settlement times required for decentralized exchanges to provide faster and cheaper trading.\n\n[Also Read: How to monetize with your dApp?]\n\nAmidst these use cases, the Polygon ecosystem is fast expanding. Here\u2019s a look into some of the top applications that are a part of the network\n\nAdditionally, most of the dApps require a method to sign transactions without submitting in the users\u2019 private keys details. On the back of its scalability enhancements, the technology helps in enabling an open identity framework for the dApp, thus solving the privacy issue.\n\nThese use cases are only a surface-level explanation of why businesses should develop dApp on Polygon. There are a range of other applications that can be built on Polygon.\n\nUltimately, even though Polygon dApps are built upon Ethereum, there are some very critical differences between them, specifically in transaction speed and cost. Such costly gas fees and slow transactions can lead to poor user experience that would leave a negative impact on the platform\u2019s adoption. On this note, it makes better business sense to select Polygon, thanks to its ability to back faster transactions and lowered gas fees.\n\nAt Appinventiv, it is our constant endeavor to think about our clients\u2019 customers first and this is the reason why we make dApp on Polygon. Using the technology we have built a range of decentralized apps right from a crypto wallet app to a DeFi exchange all promising a positive customer experience.\n\nLooking to explore the technology for your next dApp project?

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been consolidating over the past week as the price is struggling to break above a key resistance area. Did ETH mark a local top?\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily time frame, ETH\u2019s price has broken above the symmetrical triangle pattern lately and above the 50-day moving average line (around the $1600 mark). However, ETH is trading inside a very tight range above the broken triangle and has yet to break with confidence above the $1800 level.\n\nIf the market fails, a pullback toward the 50-day and even the 200-day moving average located around the $1600 and $1400 levels, respectively, could be expected. On the other hand, a valid break above the $1800 level could lead to another short-term rally \u2013 first to target the $2K level for the first time in 2023, and then a further target amind the $2300 area.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the consolidation becomes more evident, as the price has been bouncing around the $1800 resistance level. The RSI indicator has been indicating a clear bearish divergence signal for a while, which could point to a pullback in the coming days.\n\nIn this case, the $1650 level could be retested as support, followed by the $1500 level. However, it is still too soon to predict whether the bullish trend will continue or reverse, as the market has yet to decide amid the $1800 resistance.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed over the last few months, following a reversal around the $1000 support mark. However, the futures market behaves quite differently from the previous few times when the market experienced short-term rallies during the recent bear market.\n\nThe open interest metric (OI) measures the daily number of open futures contracts and is a handy indicator for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Generally, rising open interests are followed by high volatility and bearish reversals. However, the open interest has remained relatively low during the recent rally.\n\nAs a result, the uptrend could still be sustained as there is a lower chance of long liquidation cascades occurring in the short term. Note \u2013 the spot market should also be considered in order to make more precise predictions."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA day after Arbitrum\u2019s public airdrop, another Ethereum scaler is launching its own offering.\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era is now open to users to begin bridging and using the layer-2 technology.\n\nIt\u2019s the final step in a phased mainnet launch that began in 2019.\n\nRollups allow Ethereum to scale by moving transactions off of the mainnet, and onto a layer-2 network like zkSync. Users can then go about their business on this second network, with transactions being batched and compressed into a small piece of data called a proof. This proof is then sent back to Ethereum and verified.\n\nToday\u2019s zkSync launch does, however, come with a word of warning.\n\n\u201cIt will definitely be an alpha version of the system,\u201d Matter Labs head of engineering Anthony Rose told Decrypt. \u201cWe're not claiming this is the system that we expect it to be either 2 or 3 years from now. There\u2019s lots and lots more engineering work to do. But this is the core skeleton of the zkEVM.\u201d\n\nA zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, or zkEVM, is another core aspect of zkSync\u2019s scaling product. The team is implementing a version of rollup technology that draws from zero-knowledge cryptography, hence the \u201czk,\u201d rather than so-called optimistic rollups. ZkSync\u2019s virtual machine thus allows for this complex cryptography to be easily integrated with Ethereum as it exists today, tried and battle-tested.\n\nzkSync\u2019s defense mechanisms\n\nThough the gates are open to permissionless onboarding, with various constraints lifted, Rose explained that there will still be a few key security measures in place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most notable will be delayed withdrawals from zkSync\u2019s bridge technology. Because zkSync is a layer-2 solution, users must bridge their funds from Ethereum to zkSync. This means using a proprietary bridge built by Matter Labs to make these transfers possible.\n\n\u201cThis is the point where, honestly, if there's one place where I felt like the most acute risk, it is probably this,\u201d said Rose. \u201cIt's really just because of what we've seen over the last few years in the ecosystem where this [bridges] has been a serious point of weakness.\u201d\n\nBridge exploits have led to some of the industry's biggest losses, with the most notable being the $622 million hack of Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge last year.\n\n\u201cThey won't be instantaneous on day one. Because we want to be in a position where if the worst happens, and there is a major security incident, we want users to know that we've got the ability to mitigate a bad actor,\u201d said Rose.\n\nUsers will instead have to wait one day to execute their withdrawals but Rose said his team would be \u201crelaxing that\u201d feature over the coming months.\n\nAfter non-instantaneous withdrawals, zkSync has also teamed up with security auditors OpenZeppelin, among others.\n\n\u201cAs part of that, we've been working a lot on a very sophisticated monitoring platform,\u201d Rose told Decrypt. \u201cMonitoring on-chain activities, monitoring off-chain activities, monitoring across on-chain and off-chain. Does the amount that you think has been breached into your system by the smart contract layer correspond to how much you see in a database?\u201d\n\nStill, nothing, especially in crypto, is foolproof.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now it's time to get the product out in the wild, he said.\n\n\"We've spent millions of dollars on audits, bug bounties, public contests, private reviews,\" said Rose. \"At some point, you do cross that competence threshold and say, 'Okay, I think we're ready.'\""

        "title": "Decentralized Identity Platform DotNames Ends the Hustle to Memorize Long Ethereum Addresses - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "DotNames\n\nDotNames puts an end to the need of remembering lengthy wallet addresses by allowing users the option of customizing usernames and using them instead of their addresses.\n\nLondon, UK, March 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite attaining new and unimaginable heights, there are many hassles in the crypto space that need to be addressed. Not just this, but many of the features and innovations being offered are complex and difficult to adopt. The crypto world needs to make its process simple and more user-oriented. Among the many problems faced by investors, memorization of the 42-character-long Ethereum address is perhaps the most problematic of all. What the sector needs right now is a solution to this hindrance. DotNames is a newbie firm in the crypto sector that caters to this issue.\n\nWhat is DotNames\n\nUsers in the crypto space have been subjected to great anguish since the advent of the Ethereum addresses in 2015. They are an absolute nuisance since remembering them is almost near impossible. Individuals who have more than one wallet do not even bother to try and memorize these long codes anymore.\n\nDotNames is a superlative cryptocurrency firm that puts an end to this problem by providing customized domains. Individuals who have trouble remembering their wallet addresses can create a user name of their choice and use it instead of their address. The DotName username can be as short or long as one wishes for and can have any character.\n\nInstant Utility\n\nThe firm has launched a mini wallet dApp which gives utility to the DotName domains. Individuals wishing to send tokens to other users simply have to enter that person\u2019s DotName domain in the transfer section of the wallet instead of the lengthy 42-character address.\n\nA similar process is followed when receiving tokens. Users simply have to share their DotName domains with the sender to experience a seamless transfer of assets at the rate of knots.\n\nStore Limitless Data\n\nAnother great use case of the DotName domain is that it can be utilized for storing almost anything. This can be bios, personal information, and specific information. The information stored is 100% secure and only the domain owner has permission to modify that data.\n\nStory continues\n\nDecentralized\n\nThe world is rapidly adopting the concept of decentralization in all spheres. DotName is no different. It employs blockchain technology to offer a decentralized environment for its users. This means that only domain owners can update or change the name and specifications of the address.\n\nCustomizable\n\nWallet addresses allotted by Ethereum are always too prolix and users have no say in what they want their addresses to be. With DotNames, this is no longer the case. Since DotName domains are a replacement for Ethereum addresses, users can thus give them any name that they want.\n\nStorage\n\nCompanies or individuals looking for a place to store important data can also make use of DotNames. The firm allows users to store any type and amount of data. This data is linked to their DotName domains.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe endurance and longevity of any cryptocurrency firm are highly dependent on how well the company manages its finances. For this reason, DotNames has laid down a well-considered Tokenomics.\n\nThe native token of the firm, $DNS has a total supply of 100 million coins. For every transaction, the firm fixes a 6% tax. The tax rates have been kept low to refrain from burdening traders.\n\nDotNames efficiently utilizes the tax collected for the benefit of the community and the firm itself. A 5% tax is used for marketing purposes. Marketing is of utmost importance for alluring new investors. The remaining 1% of the tax is used for development.\n\nThe firm uses 50% of the generated revenue for a buyback. $DNS tokens obtained via buyback are burned to reduce the circulating supply. The reduced supply together with an increased demand for the token helps to ameliorate the price of the token.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDotNames has divided its roadmap into three major parts. Ignition, Ascent, and Orbit. Ignition, the first part has been completed. Ascent is still in progress, which will be closely followed by Orbit.\n\nFinal Words\n\nDotNames offers its services on leading blockchains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The firm and its multi-utility token are bound to have a lasting impact on the crypto sector.\n\nTo learn more about the project, visit the official website, read the whitepaper, or follow DotNames on social media to become a part of the DotNames community:\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram | Medium\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe information provided in this release is not investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice. It is recommended that you practice due diligence (including consultation with a professional financial advisor) before investing or trading securities and cryptocurrency.\n\nCONTACT: Kelvin M.

        "title": "Analyst Predicts Ethereum Rival Will Explode by Over 90%, Updates Outlook on XRP, Cardano and Solana - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A top crypto analyst is mapping the path forward for four crypto assets that have witnessed bullish price action in the last seven days.\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cred tells his 49,200 YouTube subscribers that XRP could witness bullish continuation as long as it is above the previous resistance at $0.414.\n\n\u201cIf this breakout sticks and XRP does its sort of trend wiping candles where it just moons and sort of retraces weeks and weeks and weeks of selling in a much smaller number of weeks, if that is the case, I think the bigger magnet if you will, or the clearer level for price is about $0.50 to $0.60.\u201d\n\nXRP, which is up by nearly 10% in the past week, is trading at $0.425 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is smart contract protocol Cardano (ADA). Cred says the seventh largest crypto asset by market cap is \u201crespecting technicals\u201d and could revisit its 2023 high of $0.42, which it hit in February.\n\n\u201cI think as long as you\u2019re not getting daily acceptance below sort of $0.35 and this more recent flip level [of around $0.35]\u2026 I think if this reclaims sticks, the next high timeframe trouble area is this big support resistance flip range high thing at around $0.41.That makes sense to me.\n\nAnd then if that breaks, we can just carve out a range of this thing with $0.40, $0.60-ish and $0.50 is the mid. But I think in the short term, we have pretty clear trading levels between $0.35 and $0.42-ish\u201d\n\nCardano is trading at $0.361 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), the pseudonymous analyst says that the 12th-largest crypto by market cap is forming a double bottom pattern after managing to hold support at $20 According to Cred, Solana is still range bound with support at $20, range midpoint at $23 and resistance at $26.\n\n\u201cWe essentially have a double bottom forming just above a high timeframe level of support [at $20]\u2026\n\nSort of range low reclaim as long as you don\u2019t get daily closes back below $20 \u2013 $21. That looks like it\u2019s trading back within the range.\n\nWhen markets do that, we like to look at the mid and the other side of the range, which I think for this [Solana daily timeframe] chart would be something akin to $22 is the range midpoint, $24-ish is the range high.\n\nYou could be a bit more charitable and use something closer to the extremities, the sort of same range local at around $20 and then the $26 range high, giving you a $23, $24 mid.\u201d\n\nSolana is worth $20.89 at time of writing.\n\nThe last coin on the trader\u2019s radar is Ethereum (ETH) rival Fantom (FTM). According to Cred, FTM looks bullish provided it stays above its previous resistance at $0.43.\n\n\u201cAs long as that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d expect the high [around $0.65] to be traded and then the next big trouble area, if we get a really meaty rotation, is the former range high at like $0.70 to $0.90.\u201d\n\nFantom is trading at $0.46 at time of writing. A move toward the upper bounds of the analyst\u2019s target suggests a rally of over 90% for the Ethereum competitor.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "NYAG Questions Historic Classification of Ethereum\u2019s Cryptocurrency in KuCoin Lawsuit - ArentFox Schiff",
        "content": "On\n\nNew York\u2019s Martin Act[1] provides that it is unlawful for any dealer, broker, or salesman to sell, offer, or purchase securities from the public unless and until such dealer, broker or salesman files a registration with the attorney general.[2] For the suit to succeed, the NYAG will need to prove that Ether, LUNA, or TerraUSD are either \u201ccommodities\u201d[3] or \u201csecurities\u201d under the Martin Act.[4]\n\nThe complaint seeks a full accounting relating to KuCoin\u2019s New York customers, including transaction records covering the last six years, disgorgement of all revenue obtained from New York residents, and reimbursement of the NYAG\u2019s court costs.\n\nWhat is KuCoin?\n\nFounded in 2017, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency platform where individuals can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. In addition to cryptocurrency trading, KuCoin allows users to engage in spot and margin trading, trade futures contracts, and buying and selling NFTs. The platform also allows users to earn interest on and/or staking rewards with their cryptocurrency via its KuCoin Earn service. According to KuCoin, one in four cryptocurrency holders use its platform.\n\nNYAG\u2019s Complaint Against KuCoin\n\nThe KuCoin complaint asserts that Ether \u2014 the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 is a security (as opposed to a commodity) and further alleges that since KuCoin provides a platform where Ether may be traded without being registered as a securities broker or dealer, KuCoin violated the Martin Act.\n\nThe complaint is one of the first times a regulator has claimed in public court filings that Ether is a security; an assertion that would likely have significant ramifications for the blockchain, web3, and crypto industries if endorsed by the courts or other regulators.\n\nCentral to the NYAG\u2019s argument that Ether is a security is the recent shift of the Ethereum blockchain from a \u201cproof-of-work\u201d to \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d method for verifying transactions. The complaint alleges that as a result of this shift, Ether no longer needs to rely on competition between computers for verification, but rather requires Ether to rely on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake Ether and that any Ether holder may now profit from Ether by merely participating in staking. The NYAG argues that this investment-oriented approach contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s original proof-of-work framework under which computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer a \u201cmathematical puzzle\u201d to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive digital asset awards.\n\nIn addition to this proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake argument, the NYAG makes the argument, albeit obliquely, that Ether, over time, became an investment of money, in a common enterprise, for profit, derived primarily by the efforts of others; characteristics that are typically associated with securities or \u201cinvestment contracts.\u201d To support these allegations, the NYAG asserts that \u201cdevelopers of Ether promoted it as an investment that was contingent on the growth of the Ethereum network.\u201d Further, the complaint quotes the Ethereum Foundation, which notes on its website that many users of Ether \u201csee it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d The switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, per the complaint, has significantly altered the value proposition of Ether, since \u201cpossession of Ether translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Ether\u2019s development and management, per the complaint, is largely driven by a small number of developers standing to profit from the growth and related appreciation of Ether. The complaint also asserts that the revenue generated by Ether sales is reinvested to promote the development of Ethereum, thereby tying the fortunes of token holders to management. Finally, the NYAG asserts that the Ethereum Foundation retains significant influence over Ethereum, often being a catalyst behind major initiatives that impact Ether\u2019s functionality and price. As such, according to the complaint, the growth and development of the Ethereum network, as well as any promised profits for \u201cinvestors,\u201d are dependent upon the managerial efforts of the network\u2019s founders and management teams. All of which, according to the complaint, are indicative of securities.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThis KuCoin complaint, while unique in many ways, is unremarkable in its attempted broad application of securities laws to cryptocurrency and other blockchain based tokens. Given that this complaint represents the first instance in which Ether is alleged to be a security under New York law and the major repercussions such a finding could have, it is notable that the NYAG chose not to provide a more in-depth analysis of Ether\u2019s (or LUNA\u2019s or TerraUSD\u2019s) status as a security under the Martin Act.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if other states elect to commence enforcement against KuCoin and the sponsors of other crypto assets under their securities laws.\n\nOur team will be monitoring this case as well as Dapper Labs and DraftKings as they progress. Please feel free to contact your ArentFox Schiff LLP attorney or any of the authors with questions or concerns.\n\n[1] Article 23-A of New York General Business Law (GBL).\n\n[2] GBL \u00a7 359-e (3).\n\n[3] GBL \u00a7 359-e (14).\n\n[4] Under the Martin Act, investments of money in common enterprises with profits to be derived primarily from the efforts of others are considered \u201csecurities.\u201d"

Buyers have failed to fix above the important $1,800 mark once again, which means that a correction to $1,700 may happen shortly.\n\nOn the daily time frame, buyers could not keep the rise going after yesterday's bullish candle. However, it is too early to think about a decline as the price is located in the middle of the channel, which means that none of the sides has seized the initiative.\n\nBut if the drop to $1,700 continues, there is a chance to see the breakout of the support at $1,717, followed by a decline to the $1,650 zone.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the candle is about to close far from the peak at $1,841, confirming the weakness of buyers. If the situation remains the same, traders are likely to see a consolidation in the area of $1,750-$1,800 in the upcoming week.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,766 at press time."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price has shown signs of a potential downturn as it reached an exhaustion of bullish momentum, signaling a possible drop in the near future. According to analysts, ETH has produced a clear sell signal, indicating a shift in the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been on a bullish run for the past few weeks, with its price surging by more than 34% in just a matter of days, according CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe digital asset has been benefiting from a strong market sentiment, as well as the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, experts are suggesting that this could be an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate and take advantage of the potential dip.\n\nEthereum Price To Face Immediate Resistance\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum has been experiencing a bullish trend and traded above $1,800 earlier today, although it has since fallen to $1,759 at the time of writing.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) have also seen significant gains.\n\nETH/USD pair is positively biased, its upward momentum is not as strong as Bitcoin\u2019s. Ethereum is currently struggling to break through the $1,800 level and may face resistance at $1,900 if it does.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s price reaching higher highs since March 14, its relative strength index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator have produced lower highs, indicating a divergence. Divergence can lead to declining momentum and a potential reversal in price.\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrency prices, divergence refers to a situation where the price of a particular cryptocurrency moves in a different direction than that of a related asset or benchmark.\n\nETH total market cap now at $214 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nFor example, if the price of Bitcoin is rising, but the price of Ethereum is falling, this could be considered a divergence between the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis phenomenon can occur due to a variety of factors, such as differences in market sentiment, news events, or technical factors affecting each cryptocurrency.\n\nTraders and investors may use divergence as a signal to adjust their trading strategies, as it can indicate a shift in market dynamics or potential opportunities for profit.\n\nBullish Thesis At Stake\n\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s price has been on an upward trend, it is possible that it may experience a 10% drop and fall to either the psychological level of $1,600 or the monthly level of $1,677. This potential drop should be approached with caution, as it could signal a shift in market sentiment.\n\nSpecifically, if the price drops below the $1,600 level and continues to experience selling pressure, it could lead to the $1,422 level becoming a resistance level and invalidate the optimistic outlook for Ethereum.\n\n-Featured image from EthereumPrice\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

While the BTC price has increased, the trading volume has decreased in the last 24 hours.\n\nOn-chain analysis and sentiment analysis revealed Coinbase Premium Index is decreasing and Korea Premium Index is increasing. High premium values indicate strong buying pressure by U.S. and Korean investors. However, the current scenario signals a more balanced price momentum.\n\nMoreover, 4 on-chain metrics reveal potential correction in the BTC price for more upside moves in the coming days as positive sentiment rise. Analysts said Bitcoin has the potential to hit $35,000 amid the banking crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price is also witnessing an upside move, with ETH price rising 3% in the last 24 hours amid bullish sentiment. ETH price is trading at $1,710, with a 24-hour high of $1,853. Ethereum price will be volatile amid high gas fees and the Shanghai upgrade set for April 12.\n\nAlso Read: Binance CEO \u201cCZ\u201d, Nic Carter On Repercussions Of Operation Choke Point 2.0"

        "title": "Number Of Ethereum Addresses In Profit Hits 10-Month High As ETH Continues Rally - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After several spikes since the beginning of the year, up over 40% from January, Ethereum investors have profited, translating into key metrics. According to the on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, the number of Ethereum addresses in profit has now hit a 10-month high of nearly 64 million.\n\nThis comes after ETH dipped below $1,200 last year, allowing investors to accumulate more cryptocurrency. These investors are profiting from its price spike to above $1,800 on Thursday.\n\nProfitable Ethereum Addresses Increasing\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, the total number of addresses that are in profit (7D MA) has now surged to a 10-month high of approximately 63 million. Notably, this is not the first time Ethereum will push its total number of addresses in gain to a figure nearing 64 million.\n\nBefore the latest recorded number of addresses in profit, the previous 10-month high sat at around 63.9 million as of March 23, according to the same source. Meanwhile, Ethereum hasn\u2019t been the only crypto to see a spike in profitable investors.\n\nEarlier this month, Glassnode reported that the total number of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses worth a million dollars or more surged to more than 67,000, slightly higher than the amount of 65,000 in January earlier this year when BTC first crossed $20,000 in months.\n\nFurthermore, Glassnode announced earlier today that Ethereum non-zero addresses had reached a new ATH of 96 million. This data suggests that more people are buying the cryptocurrency amid the bullish price action.\n\nETH To Continue Rally?\n\nOver the past two weeks, ETH price has rallied by nearly 10%, from a low of $1,723 on March 17 to as high as trading at $1,845 on March 23. Though at the time of writing, the asset is seeing a retracement down by 3.7% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $1,775.\n\nMeanwhile, looking at the 1-day time frame, it seems as though the asset\u2019s slight retracement may not last for long as the price would still need to hit the external high just above the $2,000 region.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s trading volume hasn\u2019t made any significant move in the past 7 days. Still, the range between $12 billion indicated a possible accumulation which may result in another rally that may happen soon, given the upcoming Shanghai upgrade set to occur next month.\n\nInterestingly, the asset\u2019s market capitalization has added over $5 billion in the past week, moving from a $207 billion last week to $212 billion as of today.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Solana\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient stood at 31 as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 1.\n\nSolana was well-distributed across geographies with no country controlling 33% of the active stake.\n\nThe Solana [SOL] Foundation published its latest Validator Health Report wherein it disclosed vital stats like the number of validator nodes and their distribution across the network.\n\nAccording to the report, the network boasted more than 3,400 nodes out of which over 2,400 were nodes that participated in validating transactions on the chain, also called consensus nodes.\n\n1/ The March 2023 Validator Health Report is out. Today, @Solana is one of the largest proof of stake networks in the world by node count, and one of the most distributed by Nakamoto Coefficient. https://t.co/NlxHZqHnV5 pic.twitter.com/1AcDtQK7p2 \u2014 Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) March 23, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nSolana scores over Ethereum?\n\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient, created by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, is a widely-used measure of the decentralization of a blockchain.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient measures decentralization and represents the minimum number of nodes required to disrupt the blockchain\u2019s network.\n\nA higher Nakamoto Coefficient indicates that the network has a large number of nodes and is thus more decentralized and safe.\n\nOne of the major takeaways of the report was the reading of the Nakamoto Coefficient. For the Solana chain, it stood at 31 as compared to just 1 for the biggest proof-of-stake network, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nA look at Ethereum\u2019s validator distribution will most likely sum this up. More than 44% of the staked ETH was held by just four participants.\n\nFurthermore, the report highlighted that Solana was well-distributed across geographies with no country controlling 33% of the active stake. However, in the case of Ethereum, more than 45% of the nodes were concentrated in only one country, the U.S.\n\nSolana\u2019s safety precautions\n\nA bug in a validator client has the potential to shut an entire network down if there\u2019s no backup. Solana stated that it had two validator clients at its disposal to help during exigencies. A third client was under development.\n\nIt should be noted that the network was hit by a major outage on 25 February, which lasted for nearly 20 hours. Tech disruptions for Solana aren\u2019t a new phenomenon. It was hit by several network glitches in 2022 as well.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nIt was clear that Solana was focusing on network enhancements as indicated by the increasing development activity. The investors\u2019 sentiment stayed in the positive terrain as well, which in part was fueled by improving market conditions.\n\nThe transaction volume for SOL declined by over 50% since hitting $1.14 billion on 20 March. Consequently, the price fell by more than 8% until press time, per CoinMarketCap data."

        "title": "Commodity or Security: How This 1 Question Could Save Your Crypto Portfolio - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Before the recent surge in prices, the beginning of March was a rough time for crypto. Multiple lawsuits against crypto companies came about, and fears of coming regulation increased as investors prepared for the worst.\n\nSince then, talks of widespread regulation seem to have cooled as the recent banking fiasco has taken center stage and the crypto market has been on a tear. But there is still plenty of reason to believe that regulation of crypto will be coming to the U.S., and investors need to make sure they are prepared when this day comes. It isn't so much a matter of if, but when.\n\nThe current crypto landscape\n\nDue to the complexity and vastness of the cryptocurrency asset class, legislators have struggled to implement any sweeping regulation. Despite this, past comments from key officials have shed light on the possible path of action they will take, and it boils down to one thing: Is crypto a commodity or a security?\n\nTo answer this polarizing question, lawmakers typically summon what is known as the Howey test to define whether an asset is a security. Deriving its name from a 1946 Supreme Court case, the Howey test analyzes an asset in four ways to determine if it is a security. The Howey test says assets are considered to be securities if there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.\n\nI hate to be a buzzkill, but this sounds like most cryptocurrencies in circulation today.\n\nWhat looming regulation could look like\n\nSo why does this all matter? Well, it's relatively simple. Should legislators deem that most of crypto is a security, then that means the entire landscape will dramatically change. Just like publicly traded companies that offer shares of stock, cryptocurrencies that are considered securities will have to register and comply with rules enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This will ultimately lead to more stringent reporting to ensure cryptocurrencies are meeting transparency standards. It will also create more barriers, and subsequently create a less than ideal environment for price appreciation.\n\nOn the contrary, should a cryptocurrency not pass the Howey test and be considered a commodity, then the amount of possible regulation dwindles significantly as commodities are not held to the same standard as securities.\n\nWith this in mind, it is crucial for investors to tailor their portfolios to prioritize cryptocurrencies that are most likely to be considered commodities, as it will ensure the least amount of disruption.\n\nBy using this approach, two options come to the forefront -- Bitcoin (BTC 1.04%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.43%).\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said on multiple occasions that he views Bitcoin as a commodity. This is likely due to the fact that there is no single, well-known group or person that keeps Bitcoin running and as such, it doesn't pass the Howey test. It truly is a decentralized network, and this is the primary reason most other legislators happen to agree with Gensler.\n\nHowever, while there seems to be consensus that Bitcoin is a commodity, there is open debate as to whether or not the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, falls into security or commodity territory.\n\nSurprisingly, while Gensler claims Ethereum is a security, his counterpart at the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC) believes it meets the criteria of a commodity and thus is out of the SEC's jurisdiction.\n\nWhether this is the case or not will likely take more time to determine. But the key point is that there are split opinions. This could be viewed as a positive development for Ethereum.\n\nMaking a game plan today\n\nMoving forward, crypto investors in the U.S. should attempt to prioritize investing in cryptocurrencies that could be considered commodities. That makes the list relatively short since it likely only includes Bitcoin and Ethereum. But when taking into account that these two make up more than 60% of the value in the entire industry and most other cryptocurrencies' prices are correlated to them, it could actually come to be the most profitable strategy.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are traded internationally and not wholly subject to just the decisions made by regulators in the U.S., there is little doubt that sweeping and dramatic regulation would negatively impact the majority of cryptocurrency prices. As it seems like this reality will come to fruition sooner than later, it would be advisable for investors to keep their crypto portfolios simple and prioritize investing in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum."

From a one-year high of 6,302 on 25 February, the number of new validators plummeted to 483 as of 23 March.\n\nA similar trajectory was observed for the growth in new value staked.\n\nOne possible reason could be due to the decline in revenue collected by the validators.

        "content": "Matter Labs Wins Race To Release First zkEVM\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nZkSync Era, the second iteration of a Layer 2 network from Ethereum scaling team Matter Labs, has launched its public mainnet.\n\nEra is a zero-knowledge rollup compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine \u2014 meaning that developers won\u2019t have to make major changes to their code to deploy applications between zkSync Era and the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe launch is a major milestone for Ethereum scaling, marking the first public launch of an EVM-compatible rollup secured by zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nRollups work by bundling transactions together on Layer 2 before submitting them in batches to the Ethereum mainnet for finalization. Arbitrum and Optimism, the top Layer 2s, both leverage optimistic rollups, which offer high EVM compatibility at the expense of a seven-day delay on mainnet withdrawals for fraud detection.\n\nPast zk-rollup offerings traded improved security and fast finality for poor EVM compatibility, often requiring bespoke programming languages that prevented developers from easily porting their existing code, thereby hindering adoption.\n\nBut a new generation of \u201czkEVMs\u201d promise to deliver zero-knowledge-powered rollups supporting EVM code, with Matter Labs, Scroll, Polygon, and Consensys competing to be the first to launch a public mainnet. Indeed, Polygon is slated to unveil its zkEVM offering on March 27.\n\nZkSync Lite\n\nMatter Labs launched its first zk-rollup, now called zkSync Lite, in June 2020. The network has processed over 10M transactions and has a total value locked (TVL) of more than $73M.\n\nMarco Cora, head of business development at Matter Labs, told The Defiant that said Matter Labs was concurrently working to develop a general-purpose zkEVM from the company\u2019s inception.\n\nHe said zkSync Lite and zkSync Era will operate as two separate networks. Cora added that zkSync Lite will likely outperform its big brother for simple swaps and transfers until Ethereum\u2019s future EIP-4844 upgrade reduces the costs associated with complex transactions on rollups.\n\nLite recently enjoyed a spike in activity, with its TVL surging 52% to $88M since March 11, according to L2beat. Cora attributed the spike in activity to airdrop opportunists inspired by the launch of Arbitrum\u2019s ARB token.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

This was followed by a closed mainnet launch in October 2022, before opening to developers in February, and today\u2019s public launch.\n\nEra is now open to all developers to permissionlessly deploy code on the network.\n\nCora said many of DeFi\u2019s top dApps are gearing up to deploy on zkSync Era, including Uniswap, Curve, and MakerDAO. He added that Matter Labs is in talks with \u201ctraditional companies\u201d seeking to bring operations on-chain, including gaming firms WEMADE and XLA.\n\nHe also highlighted that zkSync Era\u2019s unique oracle design will enable decentralized exchanges to explore order book-based trade execution. He said most networks charge users every time an oracle is updated, while Era allows oracles to update as many times as desired within a single block with additional fees.\n\nEra natively supports account abstraction, meaning users can program customizable security parameters and wallet recovery options such as two-factor authentication. Cora believes account abstraction is \u201cnecessary\u201d to facilitate mass adoption by making wallet management easier for crypto newcomers.\n\nEra was also built to facilitate Layer 3 development. L3, described by Cora as \u201chyperscaling\u201d, allows teams to deploy customizable blockchains on top of Era. L3 chains could be app-specific chains akin to dYdX, or permissioned enterprise chains like Hyperledger."

        "content": "Some of the biggest names in decentralized finance, including Uniswap, Sushi, Maker and Curve, are set to launch March 24 on zero-knowledge proof roll-up zkSync Era.\n\nThe Ethereum layer 2 scaling network has finally opened to users in alpha after four years in development, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. It is the first Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible zk-Rollup to launch on mainnet (competitor StarkWare uses a bespoke language called Cairo), allowing most Ethereum DApps to simply port over with very few changes.\n\nBetween 32 to 50 projects are expected to go live on March 24 or over the weekend, including Balancer, Pyth Network, Mute, Redstone, Graph and Argent. Banxa, Yearn Finance, Celer, Chainlink, Aragon, Woo Network and Tracer DAO are also porting to the network.\n\n\u201cFriday for us is the big one, it\u2019s full launch alpha,\u201d Anthony Rose, the head of engineering for zkSync developer Matter Labs, told Cointelegraph earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cBut the systems are super complex and there's a million other things we want to do.\u201d\n\nWhile zkSync Era can provide scaling \"orders of magnitude\" greater than Ethereum\u2019s current 10 to 12 transactions per second (TPS), Rose said it would offer \u201ctens of TPS\u201d initially and scale up as demand requires.\n\nThe project launched its \u201cfair onboarding alpha\u201d on Feb. 17, allowing projects to port over and test out security and optimizations. Matter Labs said it spent $3.8 million on security testing, seven independent security audits and a bug bounty program to reduce the risk of any incidents.\n\nThe mission continues, and we\u2019ve got more exciting news to share from zkSync Era\u2019s fast-growing ecosystem. Today, we\u2019re announcing our collaboration with WEMADE, creators of @WemixNetwork, to make the future of blockchain gaming a reality. #jointhemissionhttps://t.co/UVBHE838Rr \u2014 zkSync \u220e (@zksync) March 22, 2023\n\nWhat is a zk-Rollup?\n\nZk-Rollups \u2014 which include zkSync, Scroll and solutions from Polygon, StarkWare and Consensys \u2014 compute transactions away from the Ethereum blockchain while providing a tiny cryptographic proof that is written as a single transaction back on Ethereum showing that a bundle of other transactions has been carried out correctly. zkSync also employs recursion, which generates a proof showing a batch of other proofs (each representing many transactions) have been carried out.\n\nZk-Rollups can enable virtually instant withdrawals, giving them an advantage over optimistic-rollup layer 2s such as Optimism, where withdrawals take a week. However, zkSync Era will impose a 24-hour waiting period initially as a security precaution.\n\n\u201cThe reason being is if you have some critical bug that has somehow got through the many different audits and security mechanisms and somebody completely drains the protocol, this is obviously a disaster for everybody involved,\u201d he said. The waiting period is likely to be reduced to an hour within weeks.\n\nNative account abstraction\n\nzkSync has also enabled native account abstraction, meaning every account in the network is a \u201csmart account\u201d that can utilize two-factor authentication (2FA), social recovery, autopay transactions and more via smart contract wallet providers like Argent.\n\n\"This was and probably still is my favorite feature,\u201d Rose said, explaining that it\u2019s an improvement on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337 implementation and will help remove the \u201cjankiness\u201d for new crypto users getting into the space.\n\n\"Scalability is fine, the infrastructure needs to be there. But it needs to come with a user experience that can also scale.\"\n\nAccount abstraction is a way to appeal to the next billion users \u26a1\ufe0f #Ethereum https://t.co/Ma3O0iPRhj \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 1, 2023\n\nNot decentralized yet\n\nzkSync Era will not be fully decentralized on launch, so the team can implement fast fixes for any security or technical issues. However, a time lock will later be implemented so that the Security Council and community can sign off on decisions.\n\nLike competitor StarkWare, zkSync relies on a centralized sequencer and prover, which are faster, but provide a centralized point of failure. Running a prover, however, requires the purchase of expensive hardware or renting cloud capacity at $10,000 a month, which makes decentralizing that aspect of the network tricker. Underscoring the challenge, the decentralized version of StarkWare is called StarkNet and is currently running at a paltry 0.11 TPS.\n\nRose said a new proof system was already being developed that substantially reduces hardware requirements and should be available on mainnet this year.\n\n\u201cSo the idea for us is to get through this, then start talking about how we upgrade the proof system to be such that we can be meaningfully decentralized,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere's lots of hard problems to solve to make the systems real.\u201d\n\nNFT Creator: Creating \u2018organic\u2019 generative art from robotic algorithms: Emily Xie"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and 2023 is shaping up to be a year of significant developments.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are three cryptocurrencies that have been making waves recently. In this article, we will take a closer look at these projects and what they have in store for investors in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shanghai upgrade is almost ready\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications. The platform has been around since 2015 and has grown to become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, one of the biggest issues with Ethereum has been its slow transaction times and high gas fees.\n\nThe upcoming hard fork for the Ethereum blockchain, known as the Shanghai upgrade, is set to be launched in March of 2023. In 2022, a test net called Shandong was conducted in preparation for the launch.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade aims to address these issues by making Ethereum more efficient and scalable. The upgrade will introduce several new features, including a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Stake (PoS) and sharding. These changes will help Ethereum process more transactions and reduce gas fees, making it more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade includes multiple improvements, but one of the most significant is the ability for Ethereum stakers to withdraw both their staked ETH and earned rewards. This has been a highly desired feature among Ethereum users and the wider cryptocurrency community, and it is outlined in the EIP-4895 proposal.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) making big strides in the metaverse\n\nPolygon is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that allows for faster and cheaper transactions. It is a platform for building decentralized applications and has been gaining popularity in the metaverse. Polygon\u2019s infrastructure enables seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, making it an attractive option for developers looking to create cross-chain applications.\n\nPolygon has made significant strides in the metaverse space, with several high-profile projects already using its infrastructure. One example is the virtual world Decentraland, which has integrated Polygon for faster and cheaper transactions. This partnership has helped Decentraland attract more users and increased its popularity.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) crosses the $3M milestone with ease\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized exchange that operates on multiple chains and offers non-custodial trading directly through its wallet app. Its goal is to establish a cross-chain network that enables the seamless and affordable exchange of assets between previously isolated blockchains.\n\nRenQ has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market with its impressive ongoing presale stages. In just three stages, RenQ has raised over $3 million, showing the high demand for its unique approach to interoperability and scalability.\n\nRenQ\u2019s user-friendly DeFi platform and verified security, fast and secure network, and limited token supply make it an attractive investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nAs always, investors should conduct thorough research and exercise caution before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nSummary\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is always changing, and Ethereum, Polygon, and RenQ Finance are three projects to watch out for in 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade aims to make the platform more efficient and scalable, while Polygon is making significant strides in the metaverse space. RenQ Finance\u2019s unique approach to interoperability and scalability makes it an attractive investment option for both short-term and long-term investors.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to do your research and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Despite the US Federal Reserve increasing the interest rate by another 25 basis points, Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Friday. The unrest in the banking sectors developed some interest in the digital token market. Traders lapped up some well-known blue-chip tokens.\n\n\n\nBitcoin rose more than 3 per cent to regain the $28,000 mark as the markets digested the US Fed rate hikes. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also up about 4 per cent, regaining the $1,800 level. Altcoins outperformed the headline peers, rising up to 22 per cent.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading with decent gains on Friday. Tron jumped more than 7 per cent, while Litecoin surged 6 per cent, Avalanche and Dogecoin added 4 per cent each, whereas XRP, Polkadot and Solana rose 3 per cent, each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading with big gains at $1.18 trillion, jumping more than 3 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes slumped over 19 per cent, close to $55.11 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market reacted sharply to the interest rate hike announced by the Fed in its latest FOMC meeting. Bitcoin was poised to test the $30,000 level but lost steam after the Fed continued its hawkish stance to tame soaring inflation, said Dhruvil Shah, SVP of Technology at Liminal.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin recovered from the Fed shock today and is back above the $28,000 level while Ethereum and other digital assets showed a similar upward trend. The Fed may continue its moderate rate hike to manage the health of the economy and we can expect restricted growth in the markets due to high borrowing costs,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus\n\nRecently, Ethereum (ETH) soared to new heights in 2023 after reclaiming its golden pocket resistance, owing to a substantial 20 per cent rise in just 48 hours a couple of weeks ago. Hovering around the $1,800 mark, ETH has experienced a phenomenal 50 per cent growth year-to-date.\n\n\n\nFor the past week, ETH has been trading between the Fibonacci resistance at $1,826 and its golden pocket at $1,705. The upcoming days promise to be a thrilling ride for ETH, as the crypto is primed to potentially reach a new yearly high. If Ethereum can claim the 0.78 Fibonacci resistance, the path to $2,030\u2014its highest point since August of last year\u2014will be wide open, given the absence of any strong resistance above.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, robust support of the golden pocket below serves as a safety net, instilling confidence in bulls to go all-in on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, bears should be mindful of ETH's 50 and 200-day moving averages, which stand at $1,633 and $1,433, respectively, and are considerably below the market price. This could present a window of opportunity for bears to drag ETH down. However, they should exercise caution and hold off on any long-term moves until they manage to push ETH below its golden pocket. Once this is achieved, they can set their sights on the next Fibonacci support at $1,550.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels\n\nResistance: $1,826, $2,030\n\nSupport: $1,705, $1,665, $1,550\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Will Bitcoin (BTC) reach new ATH in 2023? Here's why Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will follow the suit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has had an unprecedented year in 2021. From its low of around $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin reached its all-time high (ATH) of over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, since then, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been fluctuating, and it has failed to reach a new ATH. This has left many investors wondering if Bitcoin will ever reach new ATH in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 and how Ethereum and RenQ Finance may follow the suit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Market Cap\n\nThe first factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching a new ATH in 2023 is the Bitcoin market cap. As of writing, Bitcoin holds the top position in the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings, with a value of more than $534 billion.\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, it\u2019s important to note that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is around $1.16 trillion according to coinmarketcap. This means that Bitcoin accounts for less than half of the total cryptocurrency market cap.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors and corporations, we may see a significant increase in the Bitcoin market cap. This increase in the market cap may push Bitcoin\u2019s price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nThe second factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 is institutional adoption. Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in institutional adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nCompanies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have all invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin. In addition, we have seen the launch of Bitcoin futures on major exchanges like CME Group and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada.\n\nWith more institutions investing in Bitcoin, we may see a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit. Ethereum and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that may see significant growth in the coming years.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cworld computer.\u201d Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is used to build decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s value proposition is that it can do everything that Bitcoin can do, but it can also execute smart contracts. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the launch of Ethereum 2.0, we may see a significant increase in the demand for Ethereum, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in the crypto space. RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a one-stop solution for all kinds of traders under one platform in the DeFi world. RenQ Finance aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the unique value proposition of RenQ Finance, we may see a significant increase in the demand for RenQ Finance, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance are among the cryptocurrencies that show potential for significant growth in the coming years. As more institutional investors and corporations adopt cryptocurrencies, there is a possibility of a significant increase in their value.\n\nRenQ Finance, in particular, has been gaining attention from investors as experts predict 100x gains soon, making it an attractive option for those looking to boost their investment portfolio.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Fri 24 Mar 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe two biggest cryptos by market cap have been on a relatively upward trend since the beginning of the year. Several analysts have recently stated that this trend could continue for ether (ETH) \u2013 particularly. Santiment has actually suggested that Ethereum has the potential to climb to more than $2,000, up from around $1,800 currently. But, for analyst Benjamin Cowen, we shouldn\u2019t expect a significant rise in ETH\u2019s price anytime soon.\n\nBenjamin Cowen alerts investors to Ethereum\n\nCowen argues that Ethereum is not ready for a major rally, even though it is currently managing to overcome the turbulence. Instead, the crypto strategist expects a massive correction for the second-biggest crypto by market cap. He submitted that this decline could be seen in the short term. He did not fail to explain the origin of this bearish sentiment. Indeed, the latter was born following the crypto\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to break above a key resistance level. The crypto analyst made his prediction in a new video posted on YouTube on March 21.\n\nBenjamin Cowen said that the key resistance level being discussed is the $1,800 price. \u201cThere\u2019s so much anxiety in this level like I think it\u2019s much more likely to break down eventually\u201d the analyst explained. Cowen added that the level of apathy in the market is currently low. According to him, it is lower than it was during the 2019/2020 bear season.\n\nSpecifically, the analyst said, \u201cI will be the first to admit it\u2019s taking longer than I thought it would. But I also don\u2019t really feel that same type of apathy in the market now that I did back in 2019 and 2020.\u201d He noted that if ETH fell into triple digits, the level of apathy could increase. \u201cI imagine that if it were down here (around $700), the apathy would really set in.\u201d he said.\n\nStrategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone predicted in December that ether will overtake bitcoin in the next bull run. But, Benjamin Cowen observed that currently, it is bitcoin that is outpacing its larger rival. He noted, \u201cEthereum has been showing a lot of weakness recently and Bitcoin has continued to push up while Ethereum/Bitcoin valuation has been getting very very weak. And unfortunately, this time it doesn\u2019t really have The Merge to sort of generate hype.\u201d\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "New Meme Coin Dogetti prepares to rival Ethereum and Theta's Presale Successes - Euro Weekly News",
        "content": "By EWN \u2022 Published: 25 Mar 2023 \u2022 11:45\n\nAs we await Dogetti\u2019s (DETI) presale information, we look into past successful launches in the cryptocurrency market, particularly on the Ethereum network. As the meme coin project looks to be launched right at the top of the charts, the developers will be looking to achieve similar presale successes as Theta Network (THETA), and Ethereum (ETH) had.\n\nBoth tokens recorded about $19 million each in their presales, breaking the market barriers even before they were listed on exchanges. Here\u2019s a brief review of the tokens and Dogetti\u2019s (DETI) progress so far.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) was launched in 2015 following the successful establishment of DeFi in the financial market. The token was developed by Vitalik Buterin, founder of the Bitcoin Magazine, and it looked to provide a faster, more scalable network than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network initially ran on a proof of work protocol, incentivising the mining of tokens for the users. However, the protocol got too slow for the rapidly growing Ethereum community, and the network started experiencing lags. Also, the gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain got even more expensive, forcing the developers to create and launch sidechain networks like Polygon for users to conduct their transactions.\n\nThese developments called for an upgrade to a proof of stake protocol, which occurred late in 2022. The protocol is already functioning, and users hope the price of gas fees drops considerably even as speed on the network has improved.\n\nEthereum (ETH) thrives on the several blockchain services it offers to users and other token platforms. The network is home to several DApps, Web3 solutions, and applications that would improve blockchain experiences for users. It also hosts other tokens, saving them the costs of building another blockchain. Because of these, the Ethereum network is the most widely used interface in the cryptocurrency market, as it\u2019s even further involved in Metaverse operations and NFT craft and trade.\n\nLike every other coin, Ethereum (ETH) has been on the rise since the start of the bull run, as it now sells at $1675.88 on Coinbase.\n\nTheta Network\n\nTheta (THETA) is an innovative contribution to the blockchain, as it is the only platform to address streaming quality throughout the crypto space. The developers have managed to incentivise video and bandwidth sharing so that users can access videos and watch them with high-definition resolution. Edgecast is a key tool used for this purpose, as the users upload their videos for public access.\n\nTheta Network (THETA) originally launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2017, harnessing a collection of DApps to attain a $19 million presale event. The token has moved to a permanent blockchain but still maintains a connection with Ethereum, where it promotes its services to the vast user base.\n\nTheta Network (THETA) runs on an altered proof of stage protocol called the Byzantine Fault Tolerance, which is an even faster modification of the regular proof of stake code. With BFT, transactions get validated within seconds, as there is a smaller team of validators attached to a larger guardian group. The speedy network is an instant attraction for mobile telecom corporations like Samsung that partnered with Theta.\n\nTHETA, the official token governing the network, sells for about $1.07 on Coinbase.\n\nDogetti\n\nGiven the regular successes associated with launches on the Ethereum network, Dogetti (DETI) will have a little problem listing at a great price on the cryptocurrency market. The token intends to leverage the vast user network, extensive DApps, and security of the mother blockchain to develop into a contemporary crypto platform.\n\nA word from the developers indicates that Dogetti\u2019s (DETI) starting features will include an exchange platform, an NFT store, and a DAO structure. The protocol is uncharacteristic for the average memecoin, but Dogetti (DETI) dares to be different, thus communicating the developers\u2019 commitments to the long-term relevance of the token.\n\nThe exchange system, DogettiSwap, will provide an avenue for users to easily access DETI tokens by converting their assets from other token types on the Ethereum network. This initiative reduces the need to get to an exchange before getting DETI tokens. Also, the proximity of the exchange to Dogetti (DETI) makes it convenient for users to swap their coins anytime.\n\nThe NFT marketplace on Dogetti (DETI) is designed to allow users to access, create, and trade NFTs as artwork within and outside the network. The developers and users can create and launch their respective NFT projects on the site to allow more participation within the NFT market.\n\nDogetti (DETI) will soon hit the markets with its presale and launch events. Stay tuned for more updates from the developers.\n\nTo find out more about Dogetti, follow these links:\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nSponsored\n\nWARNING: The investment in crypto assets is not regulated, it may not be suitable for retail investors and the total amount invested could be lost\n\nAVISO IMPORTANTE: La inversi\u00f3n en criptoactivos no est\u00e1 regulada, puede no ser adecuada para inversores minoristas y perderse la totalidad del importe invertido"

The advent of Bitcoin and the crypto world as a whole changed the narrative of the global economy and how investments are perceived. This revolutionary concept paved the way for many more cryptos to surface which led to multiplicity and with multiplicity came diversity. Today, the crypto world is not just limited to Bitcoin or Ethereum; instead, it has many more interesting investment options like NFTs, DAOs, meme coins, etc. The genre of meme coins particularly has gained much traction as investors are loving the collaborative concept of entertainment and investment. One particular meme coin that\u2019s currently trending for the right reasons is Dogetti; a dog-based meme coin, and investors are hoarding this new crypto coin. Let\u2019s learn more about Dogetti and how it is following the footsteps of the crypto king and queen; Bitcoin & Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 All Hail The Crypto King\n\nBitcoin\u2019s birth was a revolutionary moment in the history of global economics. As aforementioned, the crypto world owes its existence to Bitcoin. Initially, no one believed in the concept of digital currency so naturally many eyebrows were raised and this newly born concept faced immense backlash. However, hardships are exactly what turn a cadet into a warrior and Bitcoin soon proved everyone wrong by showing its true worth. Today, Bitcoin sits at the top of the crypto chain and holds a value of over $1 trillion! Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to secure its transactions and since it is decentralised, it is independent of all external controlling authorities which makes it a dream come true for all investors!\n\nEthereum \u2013 The Crypto Queen!\n\nJust like every king needs a queen, Bitcoin also needed a companion to support it in the cause of revolutionising the global economy. That is when Ethereum came into existence \u2013 not as a companion though, more like a sweet competitor. Ethereum quickly gained a market cap of $250 billion and soon became the second-strongest cryptocurrency in the entire crypto ecosystem. Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is also decentralised, however, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not merely a currency. Instead, it is a platform that\u2019s built to create dapps and create the path for other cryptos to come!\n\nDogetti \u2013 The Upcoming Meme Coin Sensation\n\nAlthough Dogetti is not the first crypto that\u2019s based on a dog, it certainly is the first one to gain massive love even before its official release in the crypto-verse. Dogetti is a Shiba Inu dog breed-based meme coin that has a spicy touch to its attire. This innocent-looking dog is draped in a mafia getup which makes him super distinctive and adorable at the same time. The purpose of creating this gangster-themed coin is not to intimidate investors but to let them know that the top dog has finally arrived! If there was an award for being the most community-centred crypto, Dogetti would definitely win it.\n\nDogetti aka Don Eloni likes to call his community his family just to give them a sense of belonging and to let them know that they are valued. Dogetti is extremely cautious about his family and takes great pride in treating them now and then. Dogetti recently launched a 50% bonus code for its family members just so they get to make the most of their money! As a result of Dogetti\u2019s generosity, its family has already managed to generate a 300% ROI! Since this coin is still in its presale stage and is already generating massive ROIs, it is only fair to say that this coin will certainly do wonders once it is officially launched. The Dogetti family is growing by leaps and bounds which is a sign that this coin is off to a great start and based on its current presale progress, it can be said that Dogetti might achieve the greatness that Bitcoin and Ethereum achieved in the crypto-verse!\n\nTo know more about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Why are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pumping? Why is it good for projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. In recent weeks, both coins have been experiencing an upward trend. The question on everyone\u2019s minds is, why are these coins pumping?\n\nAccording to the report, which aimed to explain the sudden surge in the values of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the influx of capital from institutional investors has been the driving force behind the price pump. Since February 2023, these investors have injected approximately $1.6 billion into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as the king of cryptocurrencies, and for good reason. It is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of over 40%. BTC has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Bitcoin is currently pumping. One major factor is institutional adoption. Large companies and financial institutions are starting to invest in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This has led to a surge in demand for BTC, which in turn drives up its price.\n\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s rise is the limited supply of cryptocurrency. Only 21 million BTC will ever exist, and with a growing number of people wanting to own it, the supply-demand dynamics come into play, causing the price to increase.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it is often referred to as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps). ETH has also been experiencing significant growth, with its price increasing steadily over the past few weeks.\n\nOne reason for Ethereum\u2019s recent rise is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and they allow users to lend, borrow, and trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized intermediary. As DeFi continues to gain traction, demand for ETH will likely increase, driving up its price.\n\nAnother reason for ETH\u2019s rise is the recent launch of Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade to the Ethereum network promises to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making it more attractive to developers and users. This has led to increased optimism and interest in the platform, which in turn drives up the price of ETH.\n\nWhat is RenQ Finance?\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to bring new and innovative financial services to the blockchain ecosystem. It is a community-driven project that provides users with a suite of tools and products that enable them to participate in the emerging DeFi economy. The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and supports a wide range of assets, including ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nRenQ Finance offers a variety of services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, lending and borrowing, and more. The platform\u2019s primary product is the RenQ Vault, which allows users to earn high yields on their crypto assets by automatically investing them in a variety of DeFi protocols.\n\nThe RenQ Finance platform is governed by its community, with proposals and decisions made through a voting process. RenQ token holders can participate in governance and propose changes to the platform. This ensures that the platform is transparent, democratic, and driven by the community.\n\nWhy is it Good for Projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)?\n\nThe recent price surges of BTC and ETH have had a positive impact on the entire cryptocurrency market. As the two largest cryptocurrencies, they set the tone for the rest of the market. When BTC and ETH are doing well, it typically signals a bullish sentiment in the market, which can lead to increased demand for other cryptocurrencies, including RENQ.\n\nAdditionally, the growing popularity of DeFi applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, such as Uniswap and Aave, has created a demand for interoperability between different blockchain networks. This is where projects like RenQ Finance come in. RenQ Finance is a multi-chain DeFi platform that allows users to access liquidity across different blockchain networks. As the demand for interoperability increases, platforms like RenQ Finance are well-positioned to benefit.\n\nFurthermore, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a signal of the maturing cryptocurrency market. As more large companies and financial institutions start investing in cryptocurrencies, it brings more legitimacy to the industry and increases the chances of regulatory clarity. This can lead to a more stable and predictable market, which is good for all projects in the long run, including RenQ Finance.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Two of the world\u2019s largest investment funds, Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, embrace cryptocurrency. Are they eyeing a bull run?\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are now trading far below their all-time high since late 2022. Bitcoin investors saw their investment drop by more than 60%. However, the news of trillion-dollar giants like Blackrock and Fidelity offering top cryptocurrencies is definitely a sign of something big.\n\nAfter all, they have access to information that is not available to commoners.\n\nNow, the million-dollar question: Is it the right time to invest in cryptos, and what to invest in? Here, we discuss the best cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC). Ethereum (ETH) and Dogetti (DETI).\n\nBitcoin \u2013 Invest in the World\u2019s Largest Digital Currency\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was in a bad shape at the beginning of the year, and the cryptocurrency market witnessed bankruptcies, company scandals, and a huge blood bath. But in the last three months, Bitcoin has regained its lost luster, has outperformed several asset classes this year with more than 70% gains, and was trading close to its highest level in the past nine months.\n\nThe first and largest cryptocurrency has been through this before; over its 15-year history, it has experienced both dizzying price surges and losses. Interest rates are driving the increases. Another reason for the recent price hike can be pointed to the Bitcoin halving event that is scheduled for early 2024. Throughout the history of Bitcoin, the post-halving money flows have always led the price to recover, even though the dollar worth of mined BTC originally decreased after each halving.\n\nInvesting in top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in 2023 will likely double your investment in a year.\n\nDogetti \u2013 A Meme Coin You Should Know About in 2023\n\nMeme coins are considered a joke across the crypto industry. But even these so-called jokes returned 1,000 times for average investors during their peak in 2021. Those early investors in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are now multi-millionaires.\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a refined approach to meme coin investing. The DETI creators have a community-first approach \u2013 they prioritize the Dogetti family over anything and the whole token is built in such a way that the community members earn well. With reflection protocols and NFT breeding mechanisms embedded, the coin promises huge future potential.\n\nMaking the news consistently in the meme coin ecosystem is a tough job however this mafia-themed coin seems to have cracked the matrix with its style and charisma. Dogetti is making rounds across social media now for its recent bonus that welcomes new members with a bonus code \u2013 DON50.\n\nIt is wise to invest in meme coins during their presale season to truly unlock their potential. Dogetti promises a return of 900% when the coin launches in the next few months.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Circling the $2000 Skies\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) has also been shattering records and reaching new heights. The largest altcoin has increased by about 15% during the past week. In reality, ETH reached highs of approximately $1841. ( 7-month high)\n\nMoreover, Ethereum has been able to convert its downtrend resistance into a support level on the daily timescale chart. In reality, ETH quickly rose and registered a 30% inclination after breaking above the downtrend.\n\nInterestingly, Microsoft testing an Ethereum-based non-custodial wallet for its Edge browser is another reason for the price soar. Screenshots from various sources indicate functionality for NFTs and crypto swaps, even if the project is still in its early testing stages and is confidential.\n\nTakeaway\n\nInteresting times await the world of crypto. Early adopters are likely to get multifold returns on their investments. Jump into the crypto pool before mammoth institutional investors enter the market and drive the prices to the moon.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_x\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "ARB buyers on Uniswap might be at risk of losing funds to fake ARB.\n\nUNI might be headed for some more upside as whale demand picks.\n\nThough Arbitrum [ARB] has finally been AirDropped successfully, the initial hype has already led to some risk for Uniswap [UNI] users. A fake ETH/ARB pool has already been created, and was out to get unsuspecting users.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Uniswap Profit Calculator\n\nInitial reports revealed that the fake ETH/ARB had over 95 million fake ARB and over 400 WETH on Uniswap V3 at press time. The pool ranked on top, making the situation worse as far as risk exposure was concerned. Uniswap users trying to access ARB can avoid this scam by confirming the official contract addresses for ARB through the Arbitrum foundation\u2019s official documents.\n\nWhen searching for ARB directly on Uniswap, the fake ETH/ARB Pool is at the top. 0x64\u20269545 added a fake ETH/ARB Pool consisting of 400 WETH and more than 95 million fake ARBs on Arbitrum Uniswap V3. Users need to pay attention. H/T @levels_crypto \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 23, 2023\n\nThe risk is only on the ETH/ARB pool, as far as initial reports are concerned. The scam incident was limited to the aforementioned pool; hence it would not affect all Uniswap users. On the plus side of things, Uniswap joined the list of the top 10 tokens by trading volume among the 500 largest Ethereum [ETH] whales.\n\nThe high trading volume by ETH whales was a sign of bullish or bearish activity, thus the need to explore further. Some of Uniswap\u2019s metrics may offer some clarity regarding direction. For example, the age consumed metric registered significant activity in the last two days. Meanwhile, UNI\u2019s MVRV ratio achieved a sizable pivot in favor of the upside.\n\nUNI exhibits readiness for a bullish move\n\nThe pivot confirmed that the bulls were overwhelmingly dominant during the last two days. UNI\u2019s exchange flows revealed that there were higher exchange outflows than inflows. The same point was particularly evident by the large spike in exchange outflows in the last 24 hours at press time.\n\nUNI\u2019s price action reflected the above observations. It exchanged hands at $6.19 at the time of writing, after some upside in the last 24 hours. This may contradict the expectations of a strong bullish performance based on the metrics\u2019 observations.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 UNIs worth today?\n\nA closer look at UNI\u2019s price action revealed that the buying pressure highlighted in the metrics cut short a previous bearish trend. UNI tanked by 11% from its peak on 19 March to its mid-week low.\n\nUNI\u2019s chart alone highlighted multiple signs that may have forecasted the current pivot. For example, the bearish performance in the first half of the week resulted in an interaction with the 200-day moving average. The price has also been hovering within the 50% RSI level, where a pivot is likely to happen. A larger upside might be on the cards if the whales continued buying."

Dan Gambardello has once again used Ethereum data to predict ADA price.\n\nAccording to his analysis, Ethereum hit 4 million wallets in 2017 at a market cap of $21 billion and Cardano reached the 4 million wallet milestone at a $12 billion market cap. In the bull run, Ethereum went on to hit 125 billion market cap and Cardano hit a $91 billion market cap.\n\nHe predicts ADA price will hit a high of $15 in the next bull market, with the market cap reaching nearly $500 billion.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Dan Gambardello has predicted Cardano ADA\u2019s price will touch $15. This is after the Cardano network hit the historic 4 million milestone. Gambardello explained in a recent YouTube video why this crucial wallet number prompted him to set the ultra-bullish price target for ADA.\n\nCardano Wallets Rip Past 4 Million\n\nFounder of Crypto Capital Ventures, Dan Gambardello, has highlighted solid data that is strengthening his bullish stance. Specifically, he noted why he believes realistically that a $15 ADA price is plausible.\n\nGambardello correctly predicted in June 2020 the ADA all-time high of $3 back when the token was valued at around $0.09. At the time, Gambardello\u2019s prediction hinged on Ethereum events. He is once again relying on Ethereum data to predict the future price of ADA.\n\nIn a March 25 video, the YouTuber observed that Ethereum reached 4 million wallets in 2017 at a market capitalization of $21 billion, while Cardano hit the 4 million wallet milestone with a $12 billion market cap. Ether went on to smash $125 billion market cap during the bull market, and Cardano reached $91 billion.\n\nGambardello expects ADA to hit $15 in the next bull market, with its market cap rising to a staggering $500 billion. He is of the opinion that developments within the Cardano ecosystem are in line with Ethereum, though he deems the former a better blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even discussing the fundamentals here. I\u2019m not even discussing what Cardano as a blockchain is doing. When I did this video last time, Shelly wasn\u2019t even here, the staking mechanism for Cardano wasn\u2019t even here yet, the Mary hard fork was not even here yet, multi-asset Ledger, Alonzo, and smart contracts,\u201d Gambardello postulated.\n\nHe further indicated that Cardano is more scalable and has great projects after undergoing the Vasil hard fork, which has been said to make smart contract deployment more efficient and allow decentralized applications (dApps) to run at much lower costs. Gambardello believes more groundbreaking Cardano innovations are on the horizon.\n\nCardano is now awaiting to transition to the fifth and final stage in development, the Voltaire era. Per Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson, Voltaire will teach the rest of the cryptosphere a lesson on how to execute decentralized governance.\n\nADA is currently trading hands at $0.3630, which is roughly 88% off the cryptocurrency\u2019s historic high of $3.09 seen in September 2021. The seventh-placed Cardano has a long way to go in order to achieve Gambardello\u2019s target."

        "content": "ZKSync, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, debuts its alpha mainnet to reduce congestion and improve transaction throughput.\n\nThe ethereum ecosystem witnesses a significant development as the alpha mainnet of ZKSync, a Layer 2 scaling solution, is officially launched. ZKSync aims to alleviate network congestion and bolster transaction throughput on ethereum by employing zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that ensures transaction privacy.\n\nEthereum\u2019s blockchain has encountered several obstacles concerning its ability to scale and elevated transaction costs, which have become more pronounced due to the increasing adoption of DeFi and NFTs. In response to these challenges, Layer 2 solutions like ZKSYNC have emerged to improve the network\u2019s performance and overall efficiency.\n\nZKSync\u2019s alpha mainnet release marks an important milestone in the roadmap. The launch showcases the successful integration of the first version of zkEVM, a zero-knowledge EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible engine. This compatibility allows developers to deploy their ethereum smart contracts on ZKSync without making significant changes to the code. As a result, ZKSync aims to offer seamless adoption for existing projects within the ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCryptography is the most important technology protecting the world\u2019s freedom today \u2014 because it\u2019s the only protection that a single individual can have against mighty adversaries. Cryptography led to permissionless blockchains which made radical self-sovereignty possible for anyone, for the first time in history.\n\nThere\u2019s one big caveat: not everyone can access it yet.\n\nThe innate values of crypto will only succeed with its mass adoption; when blockchains meet the demands of millions of users. But trustlessness \u2014 the very same thing that makes blockchains so valuable \u2014 makes them very hard to scale. The principle \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d means that every node must verify every single transaction on the network.\n\nBut how can a single server possibly verify all of the transactions on the Internet? Turns out it can \u2014 with some magic. Enter succinct zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs: the only protocol capable of enforcing the integrity of arbitrarily large computations, verifiable by anyone with no more than the power of a smartphone, ZKSYNC wrote in a medium post.\n\nThe project team behind ZKSync has expressed their confidence in the technology\u2019s potential to scale ethereum transactions, emphasizing that the alpha mainnet launch is just the beginning. The future development plans include introducing more features, tools, and services to support developers and users while further improving the network\u2019s scalability and security.\n\nSeveral prominent players in the ethereum community, such as Aave and Curve, have already shown interest in adopting ZKSync to boost their platforms\u2019 performance. This integration promises a more efficient, secure, and cost-effective environment for Ethereum-based projects, reducing barriers to entry for developers and users alike.\n\nLaunching ZKSync\u2019s alpha mainnet is a significant step towards solving ethereum\u2019s scalability issues. As the technology continues to evolve and gain adoptions, ethereum\u2019s network capacity and efficiency are expected to improve, making it a more attractive option for various decentralized applications and use cases.\n\nPositioning for Crypto Airdrops Is a Lucrative Strategy\n\nAirdrop is one of the most lucrative ways of making a profit in the Crypto space. However, it is crucial to be aware of risks such as interacting with suspicious smart contracts and hacks.\n\nAirdrop is the distribution of free crypto tokens or coins to digital wallets of people to promote a project. It is in fact one of the most commonly used marketing strategies used by crypto companies or smaller crypto projects to quickly gain community attention.\n\nAn airdrop helps a crypto project gain attention and makes people trade the token after its initial coin offering (ICO). Users can drop a request to receive tokens in the airdrop after following instructions on the company\u2019s social media accounts, websites, online forums, etc.\n\nUsers will receive tokens or coins in their wallets on the scheduled date of the airdrop. Sometimes, users must hold a minimum quantity of tokens in their wallets to be eligible for the airdrop. In addition, eligibility may also depend on the completion of certain tasks. It may include posting on social media channels, writing a blog post, and connecting to an influencer.\n\nSome of the most successful airdrops include an airdrop by El Salvador to promote Bitcoin adoption after the country made it a legal tender. Anyone who installed the government-built wallet received $30 worth of BTC.\n\nOther successful airdrops include Uniswap (UNI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Prominent in 2021 was the ENS airdrop for only registering a custom ethereum domain name. Aptos, Samo in 2022 and Blur, Arbitrum ARB in the first quarter of 2023 with users benefiting turns of returns with literally just participating on chain tasks.\n\nPosition for ZKSYNC, SUI Blockchain, LayerZero Chain, Shardeum and a few others who might at the long run issue out a governance token hence airdrop to the community.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "Pros:\n\n$3,750 welcome offer\n\nSportsbook on the side\n\nReputable casino brand\n\nMore than 300 games\n\nCons:\n\nHigh credit card fees\n\nSimple website design\n\nNot many online casinos offer this many sports betting markets. Bovada has the perfect combo of both areas for online gambling sites in many regards, making it the best all-in-one site.\n\nCrypto Game Selection: 4.4/5\n\nThe best thing about online crypto gambling at Bovada is the sports betting markets it has to offer.\n\nIt covers all sports in great detail and has strong odds to match. Plus, you can cash out in-play bets and bet on games that have already begun.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s not one of the best Ethereum casinos when it comes to its games, though.\n\nThere are over 300 of them in total, which is pretty cool in itself, but it is lacking some big names for software providers.\n\nEthereum Bonuses: 4.8/5\n\nOut of the many available Bovada bonus codes, the best new customer offer here is the one for the casino.\n\nNew players who deposit using crypto and use the BTCCWB1250 promo code will get up to $3,750 in crypto bonuses.\n\nThis bonus comes with very reasonable wagering requirements as well. They\u2019re only 25x, and it\u2019s rare to see below average wagering for a bonus with this much potential value.\n\nUser Experience: 4.6/5\n\nThe Bovada website is pretty easy to use.\n\nThe aesthetic is pretty minimal overall, and a lot of people are going to like that.\n\nEven without an app, everything runs smoothly on mobile, and most of the titles are available on the go, so you can play your favorite BTC games whenever you like.\n\nOverall Score: 4.6/5\n\nEven without having the most games in the world, Bovada is absolutely one of our favorite Ethereum casinos right now.\n\nTop ETH Gambling Casinos: Our Selection Criteria\n\nCrypto Game Selection\n\nPerhaps the most important thing for any Ethereum casino to have is a good choice of games.\n\nAs players, we\u2019re probably going to want to see a wide range of slots as well as some alternative games like live roulette or video poker.\n\nEthereum Bonuses\n\nIn this category, we\u2019re looking at the bonuses available to those depositing with Ethereum.\n\nGenerally, these are matched deposits but can also contain free spins. It\u2019s also important to consider the terms and conditions for these Ethereum casino bonuses, as these can ruin them!\n\nUser Experience\n\nOutside of games and bonuses, a good user experience for us consists of good quality websites, strong mobile compatibility, and responsive customer support for any issues that may arise.\n\nQuick Sign-Up Process\n\nThe best Ethereum casinos we selected prioritize user convenience, one aspect of which is a seamless sign-up process. An Ethereum casino that is easy to sign up for means getting started with Ethereum gambling quickly, allowing users to dive into their favorite games with minimal delay.\n\nAnonymity\n\nOur Ethereum casino reviews also prioritize platforms that uphold users' privacy. Anonymity is a key advantage of blockchain-based Ethereum casinos, and we've ensured the ETH casino platforms listed here respect this principle.\n\nFast Deposits and Withdrawals\n\nA key advantage of an Ethereum online casino is speedy transactions. The best Ethereum casinos should provide fast deposits and withdrawals, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain's speed and efficiency.\n\nWhy is Thunderpick the Best ETH Casino Online?\n\nThunderpick has been all the rage in the crypto casino world, and topping our list is the latest of those, but how has it got there?\n\nNotoriety in the business: Thunderpick is a very reputable casino in that a lot of people are big fans. We can tell this from all the positive reviews and the awards they\u2019ve won, and that makes them very trustworthy.\n\nIncredible games: The 2000+ games at Thunderpick is one of the most impressive curations we\u2019ve ever seen at any Ethereum casino.\n\nVery generous bonus: A total welcome bonus package of up to 5 BTC is a pretty incredible thing for any Ethereum casino to be able to offer. And the terms and conditions for this particular bonus aren\u2019t too tricky at all either.\n\nResponsible gaming tools: While many ETH casinos bury helpful responsible gaming tools in hard to reach places, Thunderpick lays it all out front. Whether you want to reign in spending with deposit limits or limit the amount of play on the site, it can be done in a matter of clicks.\n\nIs Ethereum Gambling Better than FIAT Currency Gambling?\n\nThe ability to deposit and withdraw with Ethereum has a few key benefits that beat betting with USD:\n\nBetter bonuses: Generally, Ethereum casinos offer more lucrative bonuses for crypto deposits than deposits with regular fiat currencies.\n\nFaster withdrawals: Casino crypto withdrawals can take just a few seconds to end up in your coin wallet, and at most, should take around 10 minutes to a few hours, thanks to the blockchain.\n\nAnonymous gambling: Some Ethereum casinos will let you sign up without requesting many details from you. And because you don\u2019t need to provide any billing details with crypto, you can stay relatively anonymous.\n\nMore volatile: Part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies in the first place is the gamble of buying them and boosting their value. The value of Ethereum changes so much, and this can be a lot of fun, but at the same time, we do recommend proceeding with caution.\n\nBest Ethereum Casino Bonuses\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at some fantastic Ethereum casino bonus offers today, so let\u2019s remind ourselves of the best bits.\n\nThunderpick \u2013 Up to $500 Welcome Offer\n\nThe amount of bonus available at our number one overall Ethereum casino isn\u2019t as impressive as some of our other top picks, but we know that a lot of players are actually going to rate this bonus more than others as the wagering requirements for it are super relaxed.\n\nmBit \u2013 Up to 5 BTC and 300 Free Spins\n\nOne of the best Ethereum casino bonuses is the welcome offer at mBit.

It\u2019s best to minimize your risk of losing money.\n\nStay Safe While Online Gambling\n\nWe strongly encourage the practice of responsible online gambling at all times. By this, we mean never spending any more than you can afford to lose, both in terms of time and money.\n\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to make use of any responsible gambling tools that the best online casinos have to offer. This could be deposit limits per day, week, or month.\n\nOr, it could be time limits that \u2018check in\u2019 with you to ensure you know how long you\u2019ve been playing.\n\nSo, What Are the Best Ethereum Casinos?\n\nWe\u2019re confident that Thunderpick is the best Ethereum casino out there right now, and we know that many people agree with us thanks to its elite games providers and big first deposit bonus.\n\nBut it\u2019s not perfect in every category, and if your preferences lie elsewhere, then another of our top crypto casinos might be a better option. The live dealer games at Ignition are an example.\n\nAll these casinos are safe, but it\u2019s important to make sure that you\u2019re also safe by gambling responsibly at all times.\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: While online gambling can come as an entertainment form, you should never prioritize gambling to solve financial problems. When you're thinking of placing wagers exceeding your bankroll, the \"house always wins\" phrase should be a guiding principle.\n\nDo you have problems with gambling, or do you know someone that does? Regardless of what party it might be, it's crucial to quickly get a hold of this situation by calling the National Gambling Helpline at 1-800-522-4700. When you call, you're immediately transferred to an advisor on hand to give you the desired help needed to make gambling safer for you and your loved ones. That said, it's crucial to remember that all gambling sites and guides are for those who are 18+ only.\n\nRemember, casino sites listed in our reviews might not be accessible in your region. As a result, it\u2019s necessary to check local laws and regulations to see whether online gambling is legal or not.\n\nFor resources free gambling addiction resources, visit these organizations:"
