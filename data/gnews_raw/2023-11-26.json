        "content": "Ethereum transaction fees would be five times more expensive if not for layer-2 rollup networks like Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a recent report from blockchain infrastructure unit Chainstack. Aside from fees between 360% and 419% higher, transactions themselves would take nearly twice as long on average, Chainstack found.\n\nWait times would even stretch to 114 seconds compared to a block time of about 12 seconds (the minimum wait time if transactions are sent between blocks).\n\nRollups are designed to solve the blockchain trilemma \u2014 a tradeoff layer-1 networks must make between security, scalability and decentralization. Blockchains can only offer two of those elements at any one time, says Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who popularized the concept laid out in 2016.\n\nEthereum, for example, is built with security and decentralization in mind. But it\u2019s not totally scalable \u2014 transaction fees generally rise alongside user activity and can grow exponentially at times of peak demand.\n\nWith rollups, Ethereum is able to offload some of the pressure. There are two popular rollup solutions today: Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, process transactions off-chain and then post the data of the transaction back onto Ethereum as \u201ccalldata.\u201d ZK rollups, such as Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era, post all data on-chain but use cryptography to validate whether transactions are accurate without revealing the information itself.\n\nUsage of rollups has grown considerably over the past two years, with Arbitrium and Optimism often together handling more daily transactions than Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s clear how roll-up transactions have gone from representing a minor fraction of the network\u2019s activity in 2021 to playing a vital part in Ethereum\u2019s functioning by 2023,\u201d Chainstack wrote.\n\nThe report added that the growing number of transactions illustrated the crucial functioning of rollups to Ethereum\u2019s overall network efficiency.\n\nAlthough, Ethereum gas fees (currently about $1 on average) have seen a constant uptrend between 2021 and 2023 despite the popularity of rollups. But Chainstack reasoned that L2 networks have still served as a necessary and useful counterbalance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nETH has underperformed compared to the general market.\n\nIt\u2019s still on a lower high compared to April\u2019s high.\n\nA reversal is in sight, but this can be bullish in the long run.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been surrounded by bullish sentiment from the start of the year, and we saw triple-digit growth all across the space. Bitcoin paved the way, and many altcoins followed, later surpassing it, especially recently from September, making explosive and parabolic rises.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the largest altcoin \u2013 Ethereum, has been underperforming compared to many cryptocurrencies. It, too, saw a price appreciation but only 84% since the start of the year. Unlike many that have made new yearly highs, it stayed within its previous, completed in April of $2,150, and now, in November, it came just shy of it.\n\nFrom November 9, when it came to $2,124, we saw a choppy price action lasting 18 days. As the price struggles at these levels, is this an indication of a looming reversal?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Ethereum fell to $920 on June 18 last year. This was the completion of the downtrend from the all-time high of $4,852, resulting in 82% depreciation. A recovery started as it did across the whole cryptocurrency market, but unlike many cryptocurrencies, the price of ETH didn\u2019t make a lower low.\n\nInstead, it was on a continuous incline, initially coming to $2,000 on August 14 and later making a slightly higher high to around $2,150 on April 16, 2023. Its support level was ascending; the horizontal resistance around $2,100 formed an ascending flat triangle.\n\nThe last rise from October 11 was made from this ascending support at $1,530, but the price still found resistance at the same horizontal area instead of making another higher high. The flat zone proved to be strong, but if this whole ascending triangle structure was the starting formation of the larger bull phase, can we see a breakout to the upside?\n\nETH Price Prediction\n\nLooking at the wave structure, there is a possibility that the whole ascending triangle is the starting impulse wave from the next bull phase for Ethereum\u2019s price. This is known as the leading diagonal pattern in the Elliott Wave theory.\n\nIf this count is correct, the price increase ended for now on the last interaction with the horizontal resistance around the $2,100 area. In that case, we are ready to see a first bull market correction that will establish the first macro higher low.\n\nMeasuring with the Fibonacci retracement tool at its optimal level, we have a price target of $1,380. This corresponds to the horizontal support area, but the price can fall even further until this possibility is invalidated.\n\nAll in all, the price of Ethereum has most likely ended its last uptrend from mid-October and will now make a reversal. If this turns out to be the correction we are expecting, it would mark the completion of the first two bullish waves and indicate the start of a larger uptrend at the beginning of 2024.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Ethereum price falls as regulatory worries and pause in DApp use impact investor sentiment - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is struggling to maintain the $2,000 support as of Nov. 27, following its third unsuccessful attempt in 15 days to surpass the $2,100 mark. This downturn in Ether\u2019s performance comes as the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment deteriorates.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that recent developments, such as the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) signaling potential severe repercussions for Binance founder Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, have contributed to the negative outlook.\n\nIn a filing on Nov. 22 to a Seattle federal court, U.S. prosecutors sought a review and reversal of a judge\u2019s decision permitting CZ to return to the United Arab Emirates on a $175 million bond. The DOJ argues that Zhao poses an \u201cunacceptable risk of flight and nonappearance\u201d if allowed to leave the U.S. pending sentencing.\n\nEthereum DApps and DeFi face new challenges\n\nThe recent $46 million KyberSwap exploit on Nov. 23 has further dampened demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum. Despite being previously audited by security experts, including a couple in 2023, the incident has heightened concerns about the safety of the overall DeFi industry. Fortunately for investors, the attacker expressed willingness to return some of the funds, yet the event underscored the sector\u2019s vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditionally, investor confidence was shaken by a Nov. 21 blog post from Tether, the firm behind the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. The post announced the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s recent integration into its platform and hinted at forthcoming involvement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe lack of details in the announcement has led to speculation about an increasingly stringent regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially with Binance facing heightened scrutiny and Tether\u2019s closer collaboration with authorities. These factors are likely contributing to Ether\u2019s underperformance, with various on-chain and market indicators suggesting a decline in ETH demand.\n\nInvestors become cautious as ETH on-chain data reflects weakness\n\nEther exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw only $34 million of inflows in the last week, according to CoinShares. This figure is a modest 10% of the inflow seen by equivalent Bitcoin (BTC) crypto funds during the same period. The competition between the two assets for spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S. makes this disparity particularly noteworthy.\n\nMoreover, the current seven-day average annualized yield of 4.2% on Ethereum staking is less appealing than the 5.25% return offered by traditional fixed-income assets. This disparity led to significant outflows of $349 million from Ethereum staking in the previous week, as reported by StakingRewards.\n\nHigh transaction costs continue to be challenging, with the seven-day average transaction fee at $7.40. This expense has adversely affected the demand for decentralized applications (DApps), leading to a 21.8% decline in DApps volume on the network in the last week, as per DappRadar.\n\nTop Ethereum Dapps by volume. Source: DappRadar\n\nNotably, while most Ethereum DeFi applications saw a significant drop in activity, competing chains like BNB Chain and Solana experienced an 11% increase and stable activity, respectively.\n\nRelated: Changpeng Zhao may not leave the US pending court review, says judge\n\nConsequently, Ethereum network protocol fees have decreased for four consecutive days, amounting to $5.4 million on Nov. 26, compared to a daily average of $10 million between Nov. 20 and Nov. 23, as reported by DefiLlama. This trend could potentially create a negative spiral, driving users toward competing chains in search of better yields.\n\nEther\u2019s current price pullback on Nov. 27 reflects growing concerns over regulatory challenges and the potential impact of exploits and sanctions on stablecoins used in DeFi applications.\n\nThe increasing involvement of the DOJ and FBI with Tether elevates the systemic risk for liquidity pools and the entire oracle-based pricing mechanism. While there\u2019s no immediate cause for panic selling or fears of a drop to $1,800, the lackluster demand from institutional investors, as indicated by ETP flows, is certainly not a positive sign for the market.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This increased accumulation has resulted in a notable amount of ETH being withdrawn from exchanges.\n\nEthereum whales increase accumulation\n\nA look at addresses holding around 10,000 Ethereum or more revealed a recent rise in their numbers.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the Glassnode chart showed that these addresses started to grow towards the end of October. The chart showed a rise after a notable decline that brought the count down from around 1,090 to 1,063.\n\nAs of this writing, the number of such addresses has risen to around 1,077. This suggests a rise in whale accumulation. How has the movement of Ethereum on exchanges responded to this increased accumulation?\n\nExchange netflow mountains negative trend\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s exchange activity for November showed a higher outflow than inflow. This implied that more ETH was leaving exchanges than entering them.\n\nThe statistics suggest a decrease in sell pressure and an uptick in scarcity. Additionally, this reduction in availability tends to increase its value.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s exchange netflow data, over 47,000 ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges.\n\nThe chart has consistently shown negative values over the past few days, further emphasizing the trend of ETH moving away from exchange platforms.\n\nEthereum supply off exchanges mount\n\nAccording to an analysis of a Santiment chart, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has experienced a decrease. This indicated a reduction in the available volume of ETH on these platforms.\n\nThe chart showed that this decline started around 14th November, with the volume falling from around 10.6 million to about 10.58 million.\n\nCurrently, the supply on exchanges is around 10.5 million. Interestingly, as the supply on exchanges reduced, the supply off-exchanges rose, reaching over 118 million.\n\nAt the beginning of the current month, the off-exchange volume was around 117 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nETH continues slight uptrends\n\nAt the time of this update, Ethereum was experiencing a positive price trend on a daily timeframe chart. Over the past two days, a consistent, albeit slight, price increase could be seen.\n\nNotably, Ethereum was still trading above the $2,000 price range. The positive trend has persisted since the golden cross on the daily timeframe, further confirming the current trend\u2019s strength."

Buckle up as we navigate through the intricacies of Layer 2 scaling solutions, including chains, airdrop, protocol, and arb.\n\nUnraveling Arbitrum\u2019s Functionality\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are two prominent Layer-2 scaling solutions that aim to address the scalability issues of the Ethereum network. These solutions have their own pros and cons, but they both offer significant improvements in terms of scalability and efficiency. Additionally, they introduce their own token, which plays a crucial role in the functioning of the network.\n\nHow does Arbitrum work?\n\nArbitrum, built on Optimistic Rollups technology, has its pros and cons. It bundles multiple transactions together and submits them to the Ethereum mainnet in a compressed format. The pros of this approach are a significant reduction in gas fees and increased transaction throughput, while the cons are not mentioned. Overall, this method offers an op solution for improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nArbitrum achieves scalability by employing a technique called \u201coptimistic execution.\u201d This means that instead of executing every transaction on-chain, it assumes that all transactions are valid unless proven otherwise. One of the cons of this approach is that it may lead to potential security risks. By using op, it can op process transactions off-chain op more quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe role of validators\n\nValidators play a crucial role in Arbitrum\u2019s functionality. They are responsible for verifying the correctness of op transactions submitted to the system. Validators op monitor disputes and ensure that any invalid or fraudulent activity is detected and resolved.\n\nValidators also participate in consensus mechanisms to ensure agreement on the state of the op system. They validate blocks produced by other participants and propose their own blocks when necessary. Through this collaborative effort, validators maintain the integrity and security of the Arbitrum network.\n\nCross-chain compatibility\n\nOne notable feature of Arbitrum is its cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum. Users can seamlessly transfer their assets between both networks through a process called bridging. This interoperability enables users to take advantage of Arbitrum\u2019s scalability benefits while still being able to interact with Ethereum\u2019s vibrant ecosystem.\n\nBenefits and limitations\n\nArbitrum offers several advantages over traditional Layer-1 solutions like Ethereum:\n\nScalability: By processing most transactions off-chain, Arbitrum significantly improves throughput and reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLower fees: Gas fees have been a major pain point for Ethereum users, but with Arbitrum\u2019s Optimistic Rollups, transaction costs are minimized.\n\nCompatibility: The ability to bridge assets between Ethereum and Arbitrum allows users to tap into the benefits of both networks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Arbitrum also has its limitations:\n\nLatency: Due to the optimistic execution approach, there may be a delay in confirming transactions on the mainnet. While this delay is typically minimal, it can still impact real-time applications.\n\nCentralization concerns: Validators play a key role in the functioning of Arbitrum. As such, there are concerns about centralization if a small group of validators gain significant control over the network.\n\nExploring Optimism\u2019s Mechanisms\n\nOptimism is a popular layer 2 scaling solution that aims to improve the scalability and efficiency of Ethereum. Let\u2019s dive into how Optimism achieves this and explore its mechanisms in more detail.\n\nRollup Technology\n\nOne of the key mechanisms behind Optimism is its use of rollup technology. Rollups allow for the processing and verification of transactions off-chain, reducing the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. This means that instead of every transaction being processed directly on Ethereum, they are bundled together and verified in batches, significantly increasing the network\u2019s throughput.\n\nBy utilizing rollups, Optimism can achieve faster transaction times and lower fees compared to conducting transactions solely on the Ethereum mainnet. This scalability improvement is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) that often face congestion issues due to high demand.\n\nFraud Proof\n\nAnother important mechanism employed by Optimism is fraud proof. Fraud proof ensures the security and integrity of transactions processed on layer 2 by allowing users to challenge any fraudulent or incorrect information submitted to the network. In case of a dispute, users have the ability to provide evidence proving that a transaction was invalid or maliciously executed.\n\nThis mechanism acts as a safeguard against potential attacks or fraudulent activities within the system, providing an additional layer of trust for users interacting with dApps built on top of Optimism.\n\nDecentralized Verification\n\nOptimism also incorporates decentralized verification into its framework. Instead of relying on a single centralized entity for transaction validation, multiple validators are involved in verifying transactions within each rollup batch. These validators work collectively to ensure consensus and validate the correctness of all transactions before they are committed back to Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDecentralized verification not only enhances security but also prevents any single point of failure from impacting the entire network. It distributes responsibility among multiple participants, making it more resilient against attacks or manipulation attempts.\n\nSeamless Interoperability\n\nOptimism is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing Ethereum infrastructure, making it easier for developers to adopt and migrate their dApps onto layer 2. This interoperability allows developers to take advantage of Optimism\u2019s scalability benefits without having to rewrite or significantly modify their smart contracts.\n\nBy providing a smooth transition path, Optimism aims to encourage widespread adoption of layer 2 solutions and contribute to the overall growth and scalability of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nComparing Arbitrum vs Optimism Architectures\n\nBoth these Layer 2 scaling solutions aim to address the scalability issues faced by Ethereum. Let\u2019s explore their similarities and differences.\n\nSimilarities between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nEthereum Compatibility: Both Arbitrum and Optimism are designed to be compatible with the Ethereum network. They leverage Ethereum\u2019s security model and infrastructure, allowing developers to seamlessly port their existing smart contracts onto these Layer 2 solutions. Optimistic Rollups: Both architectures employ an optimistic rollup approach, which means that most transactions are processed off-chain while maintaining a high level of security through periodic checkpoints on the Ethereum mainnet. This enables faster transaction processing times and significantly reduces gas fees compared to conducting transactions directly on the Ethereum network. Decentralization: Both Arbitrum and Optimism prioritize decentralization by relying on a network of validators who ensure the correctness of off-chain transactions before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet for final settlement. This distributed validation process ensures that no single entity has complete control over the system.\n\nDifferences between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nDesign Philosophy: While both solutions share similar goals, they adopt different design philosophies. Arbitrum focuses on minimizing changes to existing smart contracts, making it easier for developers to migrate their applications without significant modifications. On the other hand, Optimism takes a more opinionated approach by requiring certain code optimizations for better performance. Security Trade-offs: In terms of security trade-offs, Arbitrum prioritizes speed by allowing users to immediately withdraw funds from Layer 2 back to Layer 1 without waiting for any challenge periods or dispute resolutions. However, this comes at the cost of potentially higher fraud risk if malicious actors attempt to submit invalid transactions during this withdrawal period. Developer Experience: Optimism offers a more developer-friendly experience by providing an extensive set of developer tools and documentation. It also supports a wider range of programming languages, making it easier for developers to build on top of the platform. Arbitrum, while still user-friendly, may require additional effort from developers due to its focus on maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum contracts. Deployment Status: As of now, Optimism has been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is available for public use. On the other hand, Arbitrum is currently in a testnet phase but is expected to launch on the mainnet soon.\n\nAnalyzing Account Abstraction in Arbitrum vs Optimism\n\nAccount abstraction is a critical aspect of layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nAccount Abstraction in Arbitrum:\n\nArbitrum utilizes a technique called \u201caccount abstraction\u201d to enable efficient execution of smart contracts. With account abstraction, users can interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network without having to hold Ether (ETH) directly. Instead, they can use other assets as collateral, such as ERC-20 tokens or stablecoins.\n\nThis approach offers several advantages. First, it reduces the need for users to hold ETH solely for transaction fees, making it more convenient for them to participate in decentralized applications (DApps). Second, it allows developers to design DApps that accept multiple types of collateral, increasing flexibility for users.\n\nAccount Abstraction in Optimism:\n\nSimilarly, Optimism also employs account abstraction to enhance scalability and usability. Users can interact with smart contracts on the Optimistic Ethereum network without needing ETH directly. Instead, they can use Wrapped Ether (WETH), which is an ERC-20 representation of ETH that can be used as collateral.\n\nBy abstracting away the requirement for direct ETH holdings, Optimism enables a seamless user experience while reducing friction associated with gas fees. This makes it easier for users to engage with DApps on the platform and encourages broader adoption.\n\nSimilarities between Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s Account Abstraction:\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism share a common goal of improving scalability and usability through account abstraction. By allowing users to utilize alternative assets as collateral instead of requiring direct ETH holdings, both platforms aim to make interacting with smart contracts more accessible and cost-effective.\n\nBoth solutions leverage existing standards like ERC-20 tokens (Arbitrum) and Wrapped Ether (Optimism) to facilitate account abstraction. This approach ensures compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem and simplifies integration for developers.\n\nDifferences between Arbitrum and Optimism\u2019s Account Abstraction:\n\nWhile both platforms employ account abstraction, there are some differences in how they implement this mechanism. For instance, Arbitrum supports a wide range of ERC-20 tokens as collateral, providing users with greater flexibility in choosing their preferred assets. On the other hand, Optimism currently only accepts Wrapped Ether (WETH) as collateral.\n\nMoreover, the underlying technologies used by Arbitrum and Optimism differ. Arbitrum utilizes a rollup-based solution that aggregates transactions off-chain before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum Scaling Battle: Arbitrum vs Optimism\n\nThe Ethereum network has been facing scalability issues for quite some time now, with high transaction fees and slow confirmation times becoming major pain points. In response to this challenge, several Layer 2 scaling solutions have emerged, including Arbitrum and Optimism. These two platforms aim to enhance the scalability of Ethereum by offloading transactions onto secondary chains while still maintaining a strong connection to the main Ethereum network.\n\nSpeed and Throughput\n\nArbitrum and Optimism both offer significant improvements in terms of speed and throughput compared to the main Ethereum network. Transactions on these Layer 2 solutions can be processed much faster, thanks to their use of a sidechain or rollup technology. This allows for a higher number of transactions per second (TPS), enabling users to carry out their transactions quickly and efficiently.\n\nSecurity and Decentralization\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism prioritize these aspects in their design. They leverage the underlying security of the Ethereum network by anchoring data on-chain at regular intervals, ensuring that any malicious activity can be detected and mitigated effectively.\n\nArbitrum employs an optimistic rollup approach that relies on fraud proofs. In this model, transactions are initially assumed valid unless proven otherwise through fraud proofs submitted by users or validators. On the other hand, Optimism utilizes a similar mechanism called optimistic rollups but with a different implementation known as OVM (Optimistic Virtual Machine). The OVM executes smart contracts off-chain while providing dispute resolution capabilities on-chain if necessary.\n\nUser Experience\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism aim to provide a seamless user experience by allowing users to interact with Layer 2 applications using their existing Ethereum addresses without any additional setup or migration process required. This means that users can continue using their favorite wallets or dapps without any disruption while enjoying improved scalability and lower fees.\n\nAdoption and Ecosystem Support\n\nIn terms of adoption and ecosystem support, both Arbitrum and Optimism have gained significant traction. They have attracted a wide range of projects and developers who are eager to leverage the benefits of Layer 2 scaling. Many popular decentralized applications (dapps) and protocols have already integrated with these platforms, showcasing their potential for widespread adoption in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nTrade-Offs\n\nWhile Arbitrum and Optimism offer compelling solutions to Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges, there are trade-offs to consider. Both platforms require users to wait for a certain period before they can withdraw their funds from Layer 2 back to the main Ethereum network.\n\nKey Similarities and Differences\n\nSimilarities between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nArbitrum and Optimism are both Layer 2 scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They aim to address the scalability issues of Ethereum by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. These solutions utilize a technique called optimistic rollups, which allows them to process a large number of transactions off-chain while still maintaining the security of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBoth Arbitrum and Optimism offer significant improvements in transaction speed compared to the Ethereum mainnet. By processing transactions off-chain and only submitting a summary of those transactions to the mainnet, they can achieve much higher throughput. This means that users can experience faster confirmation times and lower fees when using applications built on these scaling solutions.\n\nDifferences between Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nWhile Arbitrum and Optimism share similarities, there are also some key differences between them.\n\nOne major difference lies in their approach to achieving scalability. Arbitrum uses a technology called \u201cTruebit\u201d to verify the correctness of off-chain computations before submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet. This additional verification step adds an extra layer of security but may result in slightly slower transaction speeds compared to Optimism.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism takes a different approach by utilizing a technique known as \u201coptimistic execution.\u201d Instead of verifying each off-chain computation individually, it assumes that all computations are correct unless proven otherwise. This allows for faster transaction speeds but introduces some level of risk if malicious actors attempt to manipulate or submit fraudulent transactions.\n\nAnother difference is in their development progress and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem. While both projects have gained significant attention and support, Optimism was launched earlier than Arbitrum, which has given it a head start in terms of deployment and integration with existing applications. However, this does not necessarily mean that one solution is superior to the other; it simply reflects differences in timing and implementation strategies.\n\nIn terms of user experience, the two solutions may also have slight variations. The way users interact with applications built on Arbitrum and Optimism could differ due to differences in how they handle transaction finality and dispute resolution. It\u2019s important for developers and users to understand these nuances when choosing which solution to utilize.\n\nThe Future Roadmap: Developments and Catalysts\n\nLayer 2 Scaling Solutions\n\nThe future roadmap for both Arbitrum and Optimism involves continuous development and improvement of their respective layer 2 scaling solutions.

        "title": "\u2018Decision Time\u2019 for Ethereum Imminent, Says Crypto Analyst Benjamin Cowen \u2013 Here\u2019s What He Means - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) is fast approaching a major turning point that could see it collapse against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 788,000 YouTube subscribers that the ETH/BTC ratio will reach a \u201cdecision time\u201d as soon as early next week.\n\n\u201cDecision time is soon, in my opinion, for the Ether/Bitcoin ratio. I think that within the next few weeks, it could be as early as next week, but I think within the next few weeks, we should have a major decision on which way the Ether/Bitcoin ratio is going to break.\u201d\n\nCowen lays out what he believes will happen to the ETH/BTC ratio, which is currently sitting at 0.05498 BTC ($2,049) at time of writing.\n\n\u201cMy base view has been that Ethereum\u2019s Bitcoin valuation is ultimately heading to about 0.03 BTC to 0.04 BTC, eventually. And from that level, it can potentially start to go back into an uptrend against Bitcoin. Now again not a popular view, but there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s been in a downtrend at least since the merge\u2026\n\nI anticipated that this is likely going to drop down even though technically it\u2019s a descending wedge and a lot of descending wedges actually break up to the upside, but I said that it\u2019s more likely to break to the downside because this is where the Bitcoin dominance goes higher, and a lot of the altcoin market just basically systematically bleeds back to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCowen goes on to explain why the next few weeks are crucial for the second-largest digital asset by market cap.\n\n\u201cSo why is the next few weeks such a decision time for Ethereum against Bitcoin? Oftentimes [with] Ethereum, there\u2019s this seasonality that can come but it doesn\u2019t tend to occur until like mid-December or early January, where it\u2019ll often gain some ground against Bitcoin, so we\u2019re still a few weeks away from that.\n\nSo my argument is that we\u2019re within a window of weakness for the Ether/Bitcoin pair that could last for the next, let\u2019s call it three to five weeks. A window of weakness doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t climb back up to 0.057 BTC or 0.058 BTC or even higher. I mean if you look at the bull market support band [it is] all the way up at 0.059 BTC, almost 0.06 BTC, so it\u2019s certainly possible that it could climb back up to those levels.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to suggest that it can\u2019t, it certainly could, but the window of weakness I think will be over the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Taiko's David Weisiger on revolutionizing Ethereum scalability [Q&A] - TNGlobal - TechNode Global",
        "content": "In this TNGlobal Q&A, Taiko\u2019s Head of Developer Relations, David Weisiger, offers deep insights into innovative approaches to scaling Ethereum via Layer 2 solutions. Weisiger, a seasoned software engineer with a rich history at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace, brings a unique perspective to Taiko\u2019s mission. He elaborates on his decision to join the company, particularly driven its vision of minimal yet highly ambitious scaling of Ethereum. His commitment to contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in Taiko\u2019s efforts to maintain a \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d approach with their scaling solutions, highlighting their dedication to open-source development and collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s PSE team.\n\nThe conversation delves into the technical aspects of Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain technologies, clarifying their roles in the Ethereum network. Weisiger explains how Layer 2, particularly in the wake of network congestion and high transaction costs experienced in 2020 and 2021, has emerged as a crucial element in Ethereum\u2019s scalability roadmap, known as \u201cThe Surge.\u201d He discusses the company\u2019s approach to Layer 2 security, embracing multi-proofs and a minimal-change protocol to enhance auditability and reliability. Additionally, Weisiger touches on the broader implications of blockchain technology in the context of the global economy and geopolitical tensions, predicting significant developments in blockchain adoption and Ethereum scaling by 2024.\n\nTell us about your decision to join the Taiko team, and please describe how the company contributes to the ETH ecosystem.\n\nI already knew one of the co-founders from my time at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace as an engineer. Frankly, I joined because of the co-founders I interviewed, and I was sold on the highly ambitious and minimal scaling vision they had for Ethereum. To change as little as possible, and to simply scale Ethereum itself, no other changes\u2013just \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d. Additionally, I wanted to work on technology that would benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, from our contributions to the EF\u2019s PSE team to our completely open-source codebase.\n\nWhat is a Layer 1 and 2? And why is Layer 2 becoming more popular in recent years?\n\nEthereum is a Layer 1, it is the original blockchain we come to know as Ethereum which persists data and executes smart contracts. Layer 2 is a way of achieving scalability for Ethereum by representing more computation which happens off-chain into a compressed format, tapping into Ethereum as a permissionless data availability layer. This is because the cost of data storage on Ethereum is really expensive.\n\nL2s may scale the Ethereum L1 capacity by around 1,000 times and lower the transaction cost by a few 100 times. With the network congestion on the Ethereum network in 2020/2021 and high transaction costs during that period of time, it becomes very clear that L2 is the most important Ethereum scaling solution (Layer 2\u2019s has been a central part of the Ethereum roadmap as part of \u201cThe Surge\u201d). The concept of Layer 2 is always changing. We are challenging the traditional notion of what Layer 2 / Layer 3 is in our research and development of booster rollups.\n\nETH security is becoming an increasingly important topic so what has Taiko done to contribute and improve Layer 2?\n\nThere are several dimensions to security for Layer 2. One dimension is the proof system\u2013in this case, we have agreed with Vitalik\u2019s idea of utilizing multi-proofs. This means that we assume there is a bug in one implementation of a proof system so it\u2019s best to rely on multiple systems instead of just one. Additionally, we strive to make a minimal amount of changes in our protocol and client, both to be fully Ethereum-equivalent and also to make it more auditable.\n\nAnother dimension (in the spirit of minimalism) is reducing trust assumptions wherever we can. The first area that comes to mind is the fully permissionless proposing (this is referred to as a \u201cbased rollup\u201d) and fully permissionless proving.\n\nTaiko has contributed to the open-source development of the halo2 circuits along with others (mainly the EF\u2019s PSE team) and also contributes by open-sourcing our entire stack. Developers can use our client, protocol, etc. easily as it\u2019s all available and well-documented on GitHub.\n\nHow do you differentiate Taiko from other L2s?\n\nThe primary difference between Taiko and other L2s is that it is a based rollup, and fully permissionless to participate in. Anyone can propose a block or prove a block on our test net. Additionally, Taiko is Ethereum-equivalent, which means that we do not make any changes whatsoever to the developer environment\u2013put more technically, Taiko fully implements the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications (on the execution layer). Another difference is our innovative idea of utilizing booster rollups to natively scale Ethereum. Check out our CTO Brecht\u2019s EthResearch post on it!\n\nWhat are some examples of how your company helps its community and partners with its scaling solutions?\n\nWe develop our code totally in the open and also do many discussions and educational sessions publicly as well. We also love chatting with teams in the space that are very related to our protocol such as MEV, re-staking, block building, ZK proving, DAOs, etc. We enjoy participating in discussions about this and offering our insights!\n\nThe best example is definitely our research and development though. We believe we have great scaling ideas for Ethereum that others can use in their rollups or however they see fit.\n\nWhere do you see the broader crypto market going into 2024?\n\n2024 will be a very interesting year. There is a lot of risk in the global economy, and the geopolitical tension adds more uncertainty to it. There are always two sides to a coin, on one side the risk would affect the amount of capital coming into the crypto market, on the flip side blockchain and crypto are created trying to solve this exact problem and there\u2019ll be more use cases and demand for an alternative infrastructure to address the deglobalization. But one thing is sure, for the blockchain world to fulfill its mission and purpose, scaling is a must. And 2024 will be the year when Ethereum scaling becomes a reality and comes to fruition. I believe that no matter how the broader market is going to be, we\u2019ll see major adoption of blockchain technology."

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently gave a sarcastic response to the plans to redesign Ethereum staking structure by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs two protocols that offer similar value propositions, Charles Hoskinson\u2019s latest reaction to Ethereum\u2019s grand staking plans proves the Cardano founder still believes in the former\u2019s design flaws.\n\nDespite ranking below Ethereum in market capitalization, Cardano\u2019s founder often touts the protocol\u2019s liquid staking offering as the de facto standard for judging a decentralized system.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ethereum Staking Plans\n\nSpeaking at an event in Turkey, Vitalik Buterin admitted that the centralized nature of Ethereum is not ideal. Notably, he called out the multiple staking pools model and acknowledged Ethereum\u2019s \u201csolo staking being hard.\u201d According to Vitalik Buterin, there is a need to tackle these challenges via the unspent transaction (UTxO) approach.\n\nStaking in the crypto ecosystem is a volatile concept in relation to regulatory allowance. Earlier this year, Kraken paid $30 million to settle a legal case with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for offering staking as an unregistered investment contract.\n\nSince then, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols started exploring how to change the nature of their Staking features. The plan to redesign the Staking service came as soon as Ethereum transitioned from its Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to PoS.\n\nThough the SEC has not flagged the protocol in this regard, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposition to decentralize the offering could make it less susceptible to falling under the regulator\u2019s radar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCardano Founder and Community\u2019s Position\n\nDesigned as an Ethereum killer with a mission to help cut on cost and speed of transactions, Charles Hoskinson takes every opportunity to sing Cardano\u2019s praises.\n\nNotably, his simple response to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposition reads: \u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d\n\nEthereum 1 is generally denoted as the PoW era and Ethereum 2.0 is the current stage with a PoS consensus mechanism. Neither Vitalik Buterin nor the Ethereum Foundation has hinted at any potential Ethereum 3 in the future.\n\nThe fight for dominance continues and though Cardano seems ahead in most of the innovations Ethereum plans to implement, as community members pointed out, the DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) of both protocols shows Cardano has a long way to go before catching up with Ethereum."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCardano\u2019s Charles Hoskinson has taken aim at Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t giving Cardano enough credit, says Hoskinson.\n\nFans of the rival chains had only just argued about their competing scalability solutions.\n\nThe rivalry between Cardano and Ethereum continues to simmer as Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson took a sarcastic jab at Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin over staking innovations.\n\nIn a recent interview with DeFi news outlet The Defiant, Buterin proposed redesigning Ethereum\u2019s staking system to address centralization issues plaguing the network. The two camps and their supporters have only recently argued about blockchain scaling solutions, and whether Ethereum had copied Cardano\u2019s Hydra.\n\nHoskinson Thinks Cardano Deserves Some Credit\n\nEthereum\u2019s suggested changes involve adopting an unspent transaction output (UTXO) model similar to the one used by Cardano (and Bitcoin) for years. Yet Buterin did not acknowledge Cardano as a source of inspiration.\n\nThis omission did not sit well with Hoskinson, who has consistently championed Cardano\u2019s staking architecture as superior. He posted on X sarcastically: \u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d His biting remark implies that while Ethereum scrambles to upgrade its staking design, Cardano already has a robust decentralized solution working for years.\n\nHoskinson later clarified that he was not trying to stoke hostilities, but expressed bewilderment that Cardano rarely gets recognition as an innovative ecosystem from Ethereum developers. \u201cI am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem over on team E.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Vitalik] is rediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation,\u201d he stated on X .\n\nA Longstanding Rivalry\n\nThe rivalry is fueled by both projects\u2019 ambitions to lead the blockchain space as the preeminent smart contract platform. While Ethereum dominates in decentralized finance (DeFi) currently with over $25 billion locked , Cardano has been steadily gaining ground with its focus on scalability, efficiency, and decentralization.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nWhile both Cardano and Ethereum use proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus to achieve greater energy efficiency and scalability, their implementations differ significantly. Cardano\u2019s Ouroboros PoS mechanism has been operational since the network launched in 2017. It utilizes peer-reviewed academic research to provide mathematical security guarantees, rivaling the assurances of Bitcoin\u2019s power-hungry proof-of-work.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum\u2019s PoS beacon chain only went live in 2020 and its consensus layer merge was just completed in September 2022. Where Ethereum falls short (for many) is decentralization. Cardano engineered Ouroboros deliberately for decentralization, using mechanisms like stake pools that allow smaller players to participate in block production.\n\nThe two giants of crypto have had a long-standing rivalry since working together on Ethereum in its early days. Buterin and Hoskinson were both founders of Ethereum back in 2013 along with several others.\n\nHowever, creative differences soon emerged. Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 over disagreements on whether the platform should be a for-profit company. While Buterin envisioned a non-profit open ecosystem. Hoskinson went on to found IOHK and eventually launched Cardano as a competing smart contract platform."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain sleuth @lookonchain reported that approximately an hour ago it spotted that the Ethereum Foundation had made a large crypto transfer, moving $2 million worth of ETH. This move was also noticed by another DLT tracker, @OnchainDataNerd, which reported it on its X app page.\n\nThis transaction happened right after the ETH price showed a marginal rise, which followed a recent drop of 4.23%. Still, Ethereum continues to hold above the key $2,000 level so far.\n\nEthereum Foundation moves 1,000 ETH\n\nIn its recent X post, Lookonchain stated that 1,000 ETH worth an impressive $2 million was moved by the Ethereum Foundation to a Safe multi-signature wallet \"0x4e6b.\" Safe is a type of wallet based on Ethereum chain.\n\nEarlier this year, according to data shared by @lookonchain, the Ethereum Foundation also transferred several similar lumps of ETH to the same multi-signature wallet \u2013 1,000 ETH nearly three months ago and another 1,000 ETH almost half a year ago. The goal of these transactions remains unclear and has not been commented on by any Ethereum rep so far.\n\nHowever, the ETH community started jumping to conclusions. Today\u2019s ETH transfer sparked a heated discussion under the @lookonchain post as ETH holders became intrigued as to the goal of this large Ethereum transaction.\n\nSome commentators believe the Ethereum team spearheaded by Vitalik Buterin is gradually selling its corporate ETH stash as they sent critiques to the Ethereum Foundation and its frontman, Vitalik. Several people in the comments wondered if the ETH price is going to fall further because of this.\n\nCardano founder criticizes Buterin and ETH staking redesign plan\n\nAs reported by U.Today over the weekend, Buterin recently gave an interview in Turkey, answering questions of the local ETH community. When asked about the road map for Ethereum, Buterin stated that something needs to be done about ETH staking since many users find its mechanism not so easy or convenient to use, pouring a lot of technical details on his audience.\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson (who was also on the team who founded Ethereum together with Buterin) commented on that in a sarcastic tone, stating, \"No worries, Ethereum 3.0 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nEarlier, the Ethereum staking model was heavily criticized by Hoskinson since before the actual launch of updates that comprise Ethereum 2.0 and ensure the blockchain's shift from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, users were unable to unlock their ETH for several years.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge upgrade that allowed the chain to begin running on proof-of-stake was launched in September last year, and ETH was not allowed to be unstaked until the next upgrade, called Shanghai, at the start of this year.\n\nBack then, several times Hoskinson emphasized on X app that Cardano stakers are allowed to unstake their coins at any time they want, and even in order to stake their ADA, they do not have to move it from their wallets, unlike in the case of Ethereum. The Cardano founder, back then, called this a fundamental difference between the Cardano and Ethereum blockchains."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEIP 4844 or \"Proto-Danksharding\" is known as the most anticipated upgrade for Ethereum (ETH), the largest smart contracts blockchain. Besides being a game-changer in transaction fees economy, it is set to significantly increase the transactional capacity of L2s on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEIP 4844 to lower L2 fees by 7x, Ryan Berckmans says\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs are expected to kick off in three months to greatly reduce L2 fees, Ethereum (ETH) veteran Ryan Berckmans stated on X. The drop in L2 transactional commissions will be accompanied by advanced bandwidth on the network.\n\nEthereum's EIP 4844 data blobs launch in ~3 months to greatly reduce L2 fees\n\n\n\nBy now, many people know that blobs initially give us ~7x data bandwidth (iirc), which is huge but not enough for global ubiquity.\n\n\n\nWhat's less well known may be that\n\n\n\n1) blob gas doesn't compete with\u2026 \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) November 25, 2023\n\nOnce launched, blob gas will not be competing with L1 execution gas, so the entire blob market should clear at substantially lower fees even if every blob is always sold. As a result, both cost-efficiency and throughput of Ethereum (ETH) will be increased by 600%.\n\nWith the EIP 4844 activation, L2 solutions of various types will scale Ethereum (ETH) in a novel way. Both solutions with ZK-secured validity proofs (Polygon zkEVM, Starknet) and hybrid optimistic rollups (Arbitrum Nova) will benefit from the upgrade and contribute to Ethereum (ETH) scaling.\n\nThis will be the next big thing for usability and accessibility of Ethereum (ETH), the investor says:\n\nEthereum's most accessible days are coming soon. In time for the bull!\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the Ethereum (ETH) community is expecting the EIP 4844 activation to make all of its L2s faster and cheaper.\n\nMore advances for Ethereum L2 rollups\n\nThe hotly anticipated upgrade is set to be confirmed in Q1, 2024, after a series of shadow forks and testnet updates.\n\nMeanwhile, one more game-changing upgrade might unlock new opportunities for Ethereum (ETH) L2s. As U.Today reported, a proposal to add native account abstraction to Layer 2 solutions was released by developers the previous week.\n\nRIP-7560: Native Account Abstraction is the first-ever rollup-specific performance upgrade proposal.\n\nThe implementation of AA in rollups would require three changes in smart contract accounts: EntryPoint address adjustment, validateUserOp function rewrite and some minor updates to transaction logics."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Amidst the recent downturn in the crypto market, the Ethereum price recovery took a breather after surging to a high of $2,137, experiencing a temporary drop to $1,900. Analyzing the daily chart, it appears this pullback might be part of a 4th wave correction within the Elliott Wave Theory, potentially setting the stage for a forthcoming 5th wave impulse.\n\nAlso Read: This Whale Astonishingly Becomes Largest Depositor On Ethereum L2 Blast Bridge\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will $ETH Surpass $2500?\n\nA rising wedge pattern governs the current recovery trend\n\nA post-correction rally could set the ETH price for 18% surge\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.3 Billion, indicating a 66% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe Elliott Wave Theory is a method used in technical analysis to predict future price movements by identifying patterns in market cycles.\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the Ethereum coin, kicking off in mid-October, aligns neatly with the Elliott Wave Theory\u2019s framework. The first wave saw the ETH price peak at $1,656, followed by a second wave correction to $1,543.\n\nWith the broader market\u2019s recovery, the altcoin surged in a third wave and reached a 7-month high at $2,137. Furthermore, the ETH price experienced a 4th wave correction in the third week of November, marked by a downward-sloping resistance trendline. This pullback assisted buyers in recuperating the exhausted bullish momentum for the next leap/\n\nOn November 22nd, while major altcoins attempted to recover from recent sell-offs, the Ethereum price notably broke out from the overhead trendline, potentially signaling the initiation of a 5th wave impulse.\n\nUsing the Fibonacci extension tool to project the 5th wave, it could potentially reach around 0.618 or $1.618 times (wave 1 + wave 3) against the wave 4 correction, implying a potential target of $2,380 or $2900 for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nIs ETH Poised for Further Correction?\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nWith an intraday 2% loss, the Ether price currently stands at $2,070. This dip raises questions about whether the price has genuinely entered the fifth wave. However, should the aforementioned bullish thesis hold true, a climb to $2,800 could spark a bullish breakout from a long-standing rising wedge pattern. Such a breakout might indicate a significant trend reversal, potentially strengthening the recovery outlook and aiming for an extended rally toward $3,400.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The formation of a higher low in the Ethereum price despite a lower low drop in RSI suggests a reverse bullish divergence in this momentum indicator. This accentuates sellers\u2019 attempts but highlights the potential neglect of their influence .\n\nExponential Moving Average: The slopes of the 20 and 50-day EMA might provide initial support during intermittent pullbacks in the price"

        "content": "The Ethereum price has been trading more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,800 for the better part of a year now with no sign of returning to its previous all-time high. However, this slow trend may not continue for much longer as a crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could trigger a rally to its previous highs.\n\nEthereum Stuck Inside A Bullish Triangle\n\nIn an analysis that was posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading identified a unique pattern that the Ethereum price has been trading in for almost two years. This pattern is a bullish triangle pattern and it has persisted for more than one and a half years.\n\nLooking at the chart, the Ethereum price has not deviated from this bullish triangle and has not had any success breaking out of it. The triangle began toward mid-2022 when the Terra Network collapse triggered a crypto market-wide crash. Then even with multiple major recoveries since then, the altcoin\u2019s price remains inside this triangle.\n\nThe lower end of this bullish triangle is at $887 which is the cycle low, and the upper end has been tracked at just above $2,100. Given this range, it suggests that for Ethereum to break out of this bullish triangle, it would have to clear the $2,200 resistance.\n\nWhat Happens If ETH Breaks Out Of This Pattern?\n\nAs the crypto analyst highlights, a breakout of this pattern would lead to a massive rally. The top of this breakout rally could eventually see the Ethereum price return to its 2021 all-time high levels, reaching above $4,800.\n\nETH price at $2,047 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\n\u201cIn my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH, since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses which will be forced to buy back their positions,\u201d FieryTrading said. A move to $4,800 would translate to a 130% increase from its current price levels.\n\nHowever, the crypto analyst explains that this could be more of a long-term performance, so it is possible that the cryptocurrency will not complete this move until at least the year 2024. But it paints a good, bullish picture for the altcoin going forward.\n\nOn its own this year, the Ethereum price has performed quite well, especially over the last 30 days. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ETH\u2019s price has risen 16.53% in one month to break above the $2,000 resistance which has now turned into support.\n\nEthereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $250 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The increased bullish sentiment has led to an approximately 15% increase in the price of Ether within a 30-day period. The fact that Ethereum is now trading above $2,000 suggests a growing focus on the asset, and this renewed optimism has propelled the year-to-date gain in ETH price to almost 70%.\n\nNew data suggest a surge in institutional holdings in the crypto asset.\n\nSurge in Institutional Ethereum Holdings\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant, there has been a notable uptick in institutional holdings of Ethereum, both through direct ownership and indirect channels such as trusts, ETFs, and funds, in November. This increase coincided with ETH\u2019s price finding stability in the range of $1.8k to $1.9k.\n\nSuch a heightened institutional interest suggests a growing confidence among investors in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the promising prospects for market expansion, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cIt reflects their strong belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the market\u2019s potential for growth.\u201d\n\nThe latest analysis also suggested that the growing appeal of Ethereum to institutional investors is reinforced by its ongoing technical advancements. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and the enhancement of smart contract functionalities have played a significant role in attracting institutional attention, underscoring the crypto-asset\u2019s attractiveness as a long-term investment opportunity.\n\nEthereum ETF Hype\n\nThe buzz among institutional investors kicked off at the beginning of the month when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale Investment\u2019s bid to transform its Ethereum trust into an ETF.\n\nThis SEC action stems from a specific court mandate instructing a review of Grayscale\u2019s pending ETF applications. As of now, there is no official confirmation regarding the approval of a spot cryptocurrency ETF.\n\nMarket optimism surged when BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, formally submitted an application for a spot Ether ETF on November 9. This confirmation led to the Ether price breaking through the $2,000 resistance, marking a six-month high on the same date. BlackRock officially lodged the S-1 form with the SEC on November 16.\n\nExperts predict the SEC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024, and following this, approval for a spot Ether ETF is widely expected to follow quickly, according to various crypto analysts."

Discover SCENE\n\nRecently announced Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast, led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has pulled in over half a billion dollars worth of locked funds from users seeking yield and rewards\u2014but also faced substantial criticism over its rollout. And now early investor Paradigm has joined the list of parties with issues over the launch.\n\nOn Sunday, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson shared a post on X (aka Twitter) that took Blast\u2019s launch to task, attributing his comments to \u201cwe at Paradigm,\u201d suggesting it conveyed the prominent crypto-centric venture capital firm\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cThat said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on.

For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast is billed as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers \u201cnative yield for Ethereum and stablecoins,\u201d letting users stake (or lock up) their funds in the network to earn an interest-like return.\n\nThe network also promises Blur-like \u201crewards\u201d ahead for users, enticing early adopters to lock up their funds ahead of a potential airdrop ahead. Blur has already awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, catapulting the marketplace ahead of former leader OpenSea in the process, and that historical example may be enticing for crypto users.\n\nHowever, while users have been excitedly locking up their funds ahead of Blast\u2019s network launch in 2024\u2014bringing Blast\u2019s total value locked (TVL) to about $535 million at present, per data from DeFi Llama\u2014the team has also faced significant criticism in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEssentially, early users are locking their funds into a bridge that will eventually connect from Ethereum to Blast\u2014but the Blast network isn\u2019t actually live yet. And those funds cannot be withdrawn until the expected mainnet rollout in February, drawing security concerns due to the industry\u2019s history of network bridges being exploited for vast sums of crypto. Some traders and industry builders have also called Blast a Ponzi scheme, given its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre has rebuked such complaints, writing in a Twitter thread on Friday that there were \u201ca number of misunderstandings\u201d around Blast and attempting to address them.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nHe also said Friday that Paradigm\u2014which was one of the investors in Blast\u2019s $20 million seed round\u2014had no role in Blast\u2019s rollout plans. In fact, Pacman revealed then that Paradigm asked the Blast team to \u201cmake changes\u201d to the launch and that Blast was considering them, but that it would ultimately make any decisions in-house.\n\nRobinson on Sunday praised Pacman and his team for the launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users in the process. However, Robinson ultimately said that Paradigm and Blast weren\u2019t aligned on certain elements of the rollout, and he felt a need on Paradigm\u2019s behalf to try and advocate for \u201cbest practices\u201d in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing our concerns with the team and appreciate their willingness to engage with us, but there are still many points of disagreement,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cWe invest in strong, independent founders who we don\u2019t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,\u201d Robinson concluded.\n\nDecrypt reached out to both Paradigm and Blast for comment, but did not immediately hear back from either side.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been on the rise for the past few months, breaking above several resistance levels. Yet, the market is currently consolidating around the $2,000 mark, failing to continue its bullish momentum.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been consolidating around the $2,000 level after getting rejected from the $2,150 area once earlier.\n\nYet, the $2,150 level has rejected the price once again, and the market is currently testing the $2,000 level, which has turned into a support now. If it is broken down, it would be likely that a double-top pattern forms and a deeper decline occurs.\n\nConsidering the fact that the relative strength index is still showing values above 50%, which means that the momentum is in favor of the buyers, a bearish reversal seems improbable.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, the recent price range becomes more clear. The price has been forming a triangle which is a classical continuation pattern.\n\nTherefore, in case a breakout occurs to the upside, the market will likely begin another bullish wave. Yet, the relative strength index is demonstrating a bearish momentum at the moment, showing values below 50%. Therefore, a drop to the lower boundary of the pattern is expected first.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nOpen Interest\n\nAnalyzing the futures market sentiment could provide beneficial insight for the short term.\n\nThis chart represents the Ethereum open interest, which measures the number of open perpetual futures contracts on a daily basis. Higher values typically result in high volatility and probable bearish reversals, while lower values indicate a more sustainable trend.\n\nCurrently, it is evident that the open interest has been on the rise. But, it has yet to reach the values last seen during the all-time highs range. As a result, while corrections are always possible, the futures market is still far from overheating, and the current bullish trend is likely to continue in the coming weeks."

The aggregate amount of funds staked in the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract has experienced a notable surge, reaching a commendable sum of $32 million.\n\nThe current increase in value is indicative of a larger pattern in which investors are consistently and proactively investing in ETH, thereby propelling the Ethereum ecosystem to unprecedented levels of growth.\n\nIn the broader context of the year 2023, Ethereum\u2019s exceptional performance is clearly observable, as it has contributed a significant $74.5 billion to its market value thus far this year.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe jump in market capitalization recorded at the beginning of the year on January 1 marks a significant gain of 51% from the initial value of $146 billion.\n\nThe latest data trends from on-chain sources also reveal a significant rise in the number of new user addresses for Ethereum. This demonstrates the platform\u2019s ability to withstand the unexpected departure of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and the consequent minor decline in cryptocurrency markets that occurred last Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, Ethereum (ETH) demonstrated a noteworthy resurgence as it successfully regained the price level of $2,100.

The mobile app could come into fruition as soon as early 2024, Lu shared.\n\nThe wallet will be compatible with the four blockchains that Magic Eden currently supports on its NFT marketplace: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe initial Magic Eden wallet will be self-custodied, meaning users will have full control over their crypto assets and will have to keep a seed phrase\u2014a lengthy passphrase consisting of many words\u2014secure.\n\nBut if downloading three different crypto wallets to buy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin is frustrating and cumbersome for users, why still make them deal with seed phrases at all? Why not offer a Magic Eden-custodied wallet with a one-click email solution instead?\n\nLu said that holding your own crypto and NFTs is crucial to \u201cthe ethos of Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIntroducing Magic Eden Wallet, a wallet made for Magic Eden users and cross-chain collectors. Beta version is now live and only available to a small group of early testers! Want to give it a try? You can get on the waiting list by downloading the extension and entering your\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5DsS5qhdlQ \u2014 Magic Eden \ud83e\ude84 (@MagicEden) November 27, 2023\n\n\u201cWe very much want to live up to that,\u201d Lu said of Magic Eden\u2019s belief in Web3, a term which refers to a hypothesized next iteration of the internet that offers users decentralized ownership through crypto. \u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to stick to something self-custodial.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s wallet promises a more user-friendly, cross-chain solution for crypto fans, allowing them to avoid bridging (transferring crypto from one chain to another) by doing cross-chain token swaps through the wallet.\n\nLu is also very much aware of the common issues that afflict crypto browser extensions. For instance, when users have multiple wallets installed\u2014like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, or the Ronin Wallet, for example\u2014they can occasionally \u201cfight\u201d each other to connect to a website, simultaneously popping up at once and creating connection issues and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe're actually working pretty deeply right now to make sure that the wallets don't fight each other as much,\u201d Lu said, citing Magic Eden\u2019s work on its wallet with crypto tech firm Exodus.\n\nIn addition to cross-chain swaps, the Magic Eden wallet will also offer users the ability to buy crypto with fiat currency from within the wallet through a MoonPay integration, Lu said. The wallet will include NFT-focused features like cross-chain portfolio tracking, Bitcoin Ordinals support, and simultaneous connection to multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cI think self-custody and email login\u2014and those seamless implementations\u2014they're not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lu told Decrypt of the wallet\u2019s potential future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very exciting technologies that we're looking to tap into to make that onboarding experience much more smooth, much more familiar to the mainstream user.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist believes that two altcoins running on the Ethereum (ETH) network are gearing up for a burst to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 606,600 followers on the social media platform X that he\u2019s bullish on ApeCoin (APE), the digital asset associated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) collection.\n\nThe analyst shares a chart that suggests APE is taking out a diagonal resistance that has kept the altcoin in a downtrend for over a year and a half.\n\n\u201cNot fading this APE breakout. Up until the last month, BLUR and LOOKS have both traded in lockstep with APE. NFTs are starting to pick up some momentum. I see it as only a matter of time before APE catches up.\n\nJust for reference: \u2013 BLUR is up 320% from the lows \u2013 LOOKS is up 235% from the lows \u2013 APE is up 65% from the lows.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, APE is trading for $1.69, up over 12% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe analyst is also keeping a close watch on the move-to-earn crypto project STEPN (GMT). According to Kaleo, GMT has been trading within an ascending channel after moving above its high time frame diagonal resistance.\n\n\u201cAfter seeing BLUR send a post airdrop from the announcement of infinite Ponzi mechanics, I\u2019m open to the idea of it being infinite Ponzi season.\n\nSo, I longed GMT.\n\nDespite the bleed over the past 18 months, STEPN has remained active, and considering how everything in the Solana ecosystem that\u2019s maintained a decent level of activity has been popping off lately \u2013 I think STEPN could run.\n\nThe chart looks great retesting July highs after a high time frame breakout; could easily see a squeeze out of the channel to $0.60 \u2013 $1.00.\u201d\n\nKaleo also says that GMT appears to be following the price action of the smart contract protocol Avalanche (AVAX) when it traded within an ascending channel last month before breaking out.\n\nDropping a comparison of $AVAX trending in an ascending channel after its HTF breakout (first picture) to show how $GMT could accelerate out of its current channel (second picture) pic.twitter.com/3IXHVh7TnM \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) November 24, 2023\n\nAt time of writing, GMT is worth $0.346, up over 20% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), the analyst thinks that the crypto king is poised to soar above $40,000.\n\n\u201cSniped the bottom down to the minute. Run it to $40,000.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $37,756.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Blast, a recently launched Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, experienced an unusual surge in assets with an inflow of over $500 million a few days after its introduction on November 212023.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. We\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more. Details on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nLayer 2 networks are the hottest projects in crypto in 2023. These networks, which operate on top of layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, address issues related to speed, cost, and scalability. Blast utilizes bridges, blockchain-based tools that facilitate the transfer of tokens between different networks.\n\nBlast incorporates a native staking feature that aims to generate returns by combining Ethereum staking with real-world assets, providing users with a unique opportunity for investment growth. Depositors start earning yields on the transferred Ether alongside BLAST points.\n\n\u201cBlast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2\u2019s users and dapps,\u201d the team said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time, it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically.\u201d\n\nOut of the total funds bridged, more than $500 million in Ether has been staked on Lido, as of this writing, offering an annualized yield of up to 4%. Additionally, there\u2019s $63 million on Maker, and $468k held in its wallets.\n\nUsers are required to wait until the mainnet launch in February 2024 before being able to withdraw funds from the network or engage in on-chain activities. Blast Bridge is currently invite-only, with access granted through a code from invited users. Additionally, the redemption of BLAST points is set to commence in May 2024.\n\nBlast secured over $20 million in a funding round led by Paradigm and Standard Crypto. The project is led by the pseudonymous @PacmanBlur, who is also one of the co-founders of the NFT marketplace, Blur.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_______________________________________\n\n_______________________________________"

        "content": "Not long after sharing the details regarding the decentralization of the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of its blockchain development firm Input Output Global (IOG), has criticized Ethereum (ETH) plans for staking structure redesign shared by the platform\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs it happens, Hoskinson took a jab at Ethereum as he commented on a video of Buterin admitting to the overly centralized nature of current staking on the platform and describing plans to redesign its staking operations in an X post shared by user Stake with Pride on November 24.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nFurthermore, responding to the comment noting that he was \u201cfuelling hostility\u201d with Ethereum, Hoskinson refuted such observations, arguing that Vitalik was \u201crediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation,\u201d adding that it was \u201cextraordinary that we never get a shout-out.\u201d\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum decentralization\n\nAs a reminder, the Cardano founder had poked fun at Buterin and his ideas before as well, like in early October, when the Ethereum pioneer shared a post listing the advantages of suggested changes in staking design for users who do not have enough resources to stake on their own.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson recently revealed Cardano\u2019s upcoming moves toward the \u201cfull-blown\u201d decentralized governance structure as it enters the Voltaire era in its roadmap, including through the movements of all repositories to a community-run project called Intersect, as Finbold reported on November 17.\n\nElsewhere, Cardano\u2019s ADA token was at press time trading at the price of $0.381, which shows a decline of 2.50% on the day and a loss of 2.83% across the previous week while it still holds onto the gain of 30.08% on its monthly chart, according to the data on November 27.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "TLDR\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium layer-2 network has recorded a sharp increase in network activity.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has reacted negatively to news of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) could become the next main meme coin project following its grand plans for creating wealth for its ecosystem.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) community is celebrating the rising network activity on its layer-2 network, Shibarium. Elsewhere, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) volatility has risen sharply amid calls for Spot Ethereum ETF approvals. Yet, analysts wonder if Ethereum Classic\u2019s growing network could spur a rally.\n\nStill, unconvinced investors have turned to Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) after it revealed a reward-filled ecosystem where decentralization is one of its core values. $RBLZ would grow by 30% by the next round of its presale. Yet, can it become a top ICO project? Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nShibarium Makes Surprise Comeback\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) popular layer-2 network, Shibarium, has recorded high transaction activity despite its recent decline. On November 21, Shibarium recorded 34,690 transactions, rising by 231% from $14,980 on November 20. The increase comes amid Shiba Inu\u2019s continued token burns, which have failed to protect SHIB\u2019s price.\n\nSHIB was trading at $0.000007954 on November 1. By November 20, SHIB\u2019s value had jumped by 6.2% to $0.000008449.\n\nSince the launch of Shibarium, Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) team has embarked on more token burn events. Shiba Inu has also increased the burn rate significantly. Between November 20 and November 21, Shiba Inu burned 28.12 million tokens, a 47,872% increase from the previous day.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) team has already hinted at a possible price increase due to increased token burns. Yet, SHIB\u2019s value has barely risen since the launch of Shbiarium. Analysts pin Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) recent performance on the expectation that spot Bitcoin ETFs will be approved soon. This could push SHIB up by 13.0% to $0.000009549.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s Volatility Rises By Mid-November\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) started the month of November on a bullish note. The excitement around possible spot Bitcoin ETFs was high, so investors increased their bullish holdings. This increased investor sentiment for projects like Ethereum Classic.\n\nAnalysts expected Ethereum Classic to capitalize on the growth, leading to an ETC rally. Yet, ETC\u2019s value has steadily declined. ETC cost $17.78 on November 1. By November 10, ETC\u2019s value rose by 16.8% to $20.78. However, ETC\u2019s volatility skyrocketed, causing it to fall by 12.6% to $18.15.\n\nLike other popular network hard forks, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) value tends to shoot up when Ethereum rallies. Furthermore, analysts expect Ethereum Classic\u2019s price to rise after BlackRock unveiled its partnership with Ethereum. Still, analysts say Ethereum Classic will likely face increased competition from other top altcoins. This means ETC could fall by 8.8% to $16.54.\n\nRebel Satoshi Wows Investors with a Potential 30% Increase\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto built Bitcoin with a dream of a decentralized financial world. Yet, since 2008, many crypto projects have strayed far from this ideal. However, RebelSatoshi ($RBLZ) is leading the drive back to the foundational principles of blockchain technology.\n\nThe network is building an ecosystem that creates wealth easily and distributes it fairly through its community. Wealth generation on RebelSatoshi will happen through different means, including an NFT marketplace for trading valuable assets, coin staking, and a play-to-earn game.\n\n$RBLZ is the governance and membership token of Rebel Satoshi. It offers users special access to discounts, private events, and exclusive projects within the RebelSatoshi ecosystem. $RBLZ\u2019s total supply is 250 million tokens. The network uses token burns to increase $RBLZ\u2019s value via scarcity. RebelSatoshi aims to unite the silent majority to challenge centralization within the crypto community.\n\nSince the launch of its blockchain ICO, RebelSatoshi ($RBLZ) has sold over 10 million tokens. It is now in the Early Bird phase of its presale. $RBLZ current value is $0.010. By the next round, titled the \u201cRebel Round,\u201d $RBLZ would rise to $0.013, jumping by 30%. $RBLZ would set the stage for further gains once it reaches $0.025 and is listed on decentralized exchanges.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the ringleader of top-performing altcoins, recently made waves by experiencing a notable 10% surge in its price, sparking keen investor interest. However, the market is also seeing another noteworthy contender that has been gaining prominence amid Ethereum\u2019s impressive performance. Let\u2019s delve into the reasons behind this growing attention!\n\n>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nETH Price Prediction: Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF Application Sparks ETH Price Rally\n\nIn a significant development on November 18, Bitcoinsistemi.com reported that Fidelity, overseeing a colossal $4.5 trillion in assets, has applied for an Ethereum Spot ETF. This move elevates the total count of Ethereum Spot ETFs awaiting SEC review to seven.\n\nFollowing Fidelity\u2019s move, the Ethereum token, ETH, witnessed a significant price pump. Between November 18 and November 28, ETH\u2019s price rose by 10%, from $1,927 to $2,121. This performance has left investors pondering, \u201cShould I buy Ethereum?\u201d Investors are closely watching the ETH price prediction to gain insights into potential impacts on the value of Ethereum.\n\nBloomberg analysts predict SEC approval for Bitcoin Spot ETFs will significantly boost chances for ETH Spot ETF approvals. Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart confidently predicts a 90% chance of SEC approving Bitcoin Spot ETFs by January 10, 2024. Looking ahead to Ethereum, the potential approval timelines for Ethereum Spot ETFs, if materialized, seem to converge around Q1 of 2024.\n\nAmong several things, Ethereum Spot ETFs would increase institutional investment, improve liquidity, and accelerate the development of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. If approved, Ethereum (ETH) will experience a notable price surge. Based on this, the ETH price prediction shows that Ethereum\u2019s price is likely to hit $3,582 by Q1 of 2024.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Surges to Top of DeFi Crypto List with Remarkable 862.5% Increase\n\nAmidst Ethereum\u2019s growing momentum, VC Spectra (SPCT) has swiftly ascended as a standout performer, captivating investors with its promising trajectory. Since its presale debut in July 2023, VC Spectra (SPCT) has solidified its position among the top DeFi coins, beckoning enthusiasts with the allure of substantial returns.\n\nFunctioning as a decentralized hedge fund, VC Spectra (SPCT) strategically allocates investments to high-quality blockchain projects. Token holders are rewarded with quarterly dividends directly correlated to the quantity of VC Spectra (SPCT) tokens they possess.\n\nThe current buzz surrounds VC Spectra (SPCT)\u2019s Stage 5 presale, where tokens are being offered at an attractive $0.077. This marks a remarkable 862.5% surge from the initial launch price of $0.008. This meteoric price surge during its presale has positioned VC Spectra (SPCT) as one of the best DeFi tokens to watch out for.\n\nMore so, with VC Spectra (SPCT) gearing up to officially start trading on major exchanges in Q1 of 2024, market analysts predict a possible 100x increase in the token\u2019s price.\n\nTo learn more about VC Spectra (SPCT) and its presale, visit:\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.vcspectra.io/login\n\nWebsite: https://vcspectra.io\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/VCSpectra\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/spectravcfund\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Ethereum Dominance Indicator: Key Barometer of Trends in the Crypto Sector - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "From its early days, Ethereum has distinguished itself as a hub of groundbreaking developments in blockchain technology. As the originator of smart contracts, Ethereum has redefined the scope of blockchain applications, paving the way for a diverse range of DApps, innovative DeFi platforms, and the rapidly expanding universe of NFTs. These strides have solidified Ethereum dominance in the blockchain space and have also been instrumental in its market dominance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey and commanding market position intertwine with its core ethos of decentralization. This principle has garnered both acclaim and debate within the crypto community. As Ethereum continues to adapt and upgrade in response to the industry\u2019s challenges, its market dominance remains a key barometer of the evolving trends in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe Rise of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began as a vision in the mind of Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Dissatisfied with Bitcoin\u2019s limitations, Buterin proposed a new platform in late 2013, one that would go beyond the financial use cases of Bitcoin. Ethereum\u2019s official launch in 2015 marked a pivotal moment in the history of blockchain technology. It wasn\u2019t just another cryptocurrency but a revolutionary platform designed to leverage blockchain technology for many applications far beyond digital currencies.\n\nThe true game-changer for Ethereum was the introduction of smart contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts operate autonomously and are immutable once deployed, ensuring high trust and security in digital transactions. This innovation opened the door to endless possibilities, allowing developers to create sophisticated DApps without intermediaries.\n\nBeing the first to market with such a versatile technology, Ethereum quickly established itself as the de facto platform for blockchain development. This first-mover advantage was crucial. It allowed Ethereum to build a strong community of developers and enthusiasts eager to explore and expand the capabilities of blockchain technology. This early start also meant that Ethereum became the standard for measuring other blockchain platforms.\n\nExpansion of Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem saw exponential growth with the rise of DApps. These applications, from games to social networks, operate on a peer-to-peer network free from central control. Ethereum\u2019s flexible platform enabled developers to build a wide array of DApps, attracting a diverse user base to the Ethereum network.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem has been the emergence of DeFi. These financial services, like lending, borrowing, and trading, operate on the blockchain without traditional financial intermediaries. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality made it an ideal platform for DeFi applications, leading to a surge in innovation and investment in this sector.\n\nThe NFT boom further underscored Ethereum\u2019s dominance. NFTs are unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology, and Ethereum\u2019s blockchain has been the primary platform for minting, buying, and selling NFTs. The popularity of NFTs brought mainstream attention to Ethereum and highlighted its capability to support a wide range of digital asset transactions.\n\nCalculating Ethereum Dominance\n\nIn the digital currency landscape, \u2018market capitalization\u2019 or \u2018market cap\u2019 is critical. It represents the aggregate value of all available units of a specific cryptocurrency. To calculate this, one multiplies the current price of a single unit by the total number of units in circulation. This metric is pivotal for comparing cryptocurrencies\u2019 relative size and value, offering a snapshot of their financial footprint in the digital economy.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to juxtapose its market cap with the cumulative market cap of the global cryptocurrency market to grasp the extent of Ethereum\u2019s influence. This total market cap encompasses the combined value of all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included. This comparison sheds light on Ethereum\u2019s financial stature and role in the expansive crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market dominance has a simple yet revealing formula:\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Share (%) = (Ethereum\u2019s Market Cap / Combined Market Cap of All Cryptocurrencies) * 100\n\nThis calculation presents Ethereum\u2019s market share as a percentage, illustrating its portion of the cryptocurrency market. For example, if Ethereum\u2019s market cap stands at $300 billion against a $1 trillion total market cap for all cryptocurrencies, its market share would be 30%. This figure is dynamic, fluctuating with the changing market values of Ethereum and crypto counterparts.\n\nEthereum Dominance on a monthly time frame.\n\nMore than just a numerical value, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance is a barometer of its market strength and stability compared to other digital currencies. A higher percentage signifies Ethereum\u2019s commanding presence and influence in the market. In contrast, a lower figure might indicate a more diverse and competitive cryptocurrency landscape. For investors and market analysts, Ethereum\u2019s dominance is a key indicator, offering insights into market trends, investor confidence, and the overall vitality of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFactors Contributing to Ethereum Dominance\n\nDecentralization as a Core Principle\n\nAt the heart of Ethereum\u2019s philosophy and architecture is the principle of decentralization. This foundational aspect differentiates Ethereum from traditional centralized systems. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain operates on a global network of computers, ensuring that no single entity has complete control over the entire network. This commitment to decentralization is evident in Ethereum\u2019s open-source nature, allowing developers worldwide to contribute to its ecosystem enhancing security, transparency, and trust.\n\nDespite its strong stance on decentralization, Ethereum has faced its share of criticism and debate. Some critics argue that Ethereum\u2019s decentralization is not as robust as it claims, pointing to issues such as the concentration of power among a few large mining pools or validators and concerns over potential centralization in decision-making processes. These debates highlight the ongoing challenges Ethereum faces in maintaining a truly decentralized network while scaling and evolving.\n\nValidator Count and Network Security\n\nThe security and integrity of the Ethereum network are paramount, and a critical factor in this is the number of validators. Validators are responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks in the blockchain. Post-transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, the number of validators has become a critical metric for network security. A higher number of validators means a more decentralized and secure network, as it becomes increasingly difficult for any single entity to gain control over the network.\n\nContinuous Development and Upgrades\n\nOne of the most significant developments in Ethereum\u2019s history is its transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as \u201cThe Merge.\u201d This shift changed how Ethereum validates transactions and secures its network. The PoS model dramatically reduces energy consumption and is crucial for a more sustainable, scalable, and secure blockchain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey has continuous improvement and upgrades. These include protocol enhancements to increase scalability, reduce transaction fees, and improve network efficiency. Notable upgrades, such as the Constantinople and Istanbul hard forks, have introduced significant network infrastructure changes, demonstrating Ethereum\u2019s commitment to innovation and adaptation in the fast-evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Rival Blockchains\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC)\n\nBinance Smart Chain is a formidable competitor known for its high throughput and low transaction fees. BSC operates parallel to Binance Chain and offers smart contract functionality and compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, making it an attractive alternative for developers and users seeking efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano distinguishes itself through its research-driven approach and emphasis on sustainability and scalability. It utilizes a unique proof-of-stake algorithm called Ouroboros. It aims to provide more advanced features than any protocol previously developed, making it a strong contender in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana\n\nSolana has gained attention for its swift transaction processing capabilities and low fees. It employs a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (PoH), which contributes to its high throughput, positioning it as a highly efficient blockchain platform.\n\nAvalanche\n\nAvalanche stands out with its unique consensus mechanism, which allows for high transaction output without compromising scalability. Its design simultaneously addresses the blockchain trilemma of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nComparison with Ethereum\n\nTrade-offs in Scalability and Decentralization\n\nWhile these rival blockchains offer various advantages, particularly scalability and transaction speed, they often face trade-offs, especially in decentralization. For instance, networks like BSC and Tron, while faster and more cost-effective, have faced criticism for being more centralized compared to Ethereum. This centralization can lead to concerns over security and censorship resistance.\n\nMarket Position and Innovations\n\nEthereum maintains a strong market position despite the competition due to its first-mover advantage, extensive developer community, and continuous innovations. While competitors like Cardano and Solana bring novel features and improvements, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing upgrades and the shift to a Proof-of-Stake model with The Merge aim to address its scalability and efficiency issues, keeping it at the forefront of blockchain innovation.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Influence\n\nPioneering the ICO Revolution\n\nEthereum\u2019s introduction marked a turning point in fundraising within the digital realm, particularly with the advent of ICOs. This innovative fundraising method, which gained immense traction in 2017 and 2018, was fueled mainly by Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities. Startups and new ventures found a streamlined, accessible path to raise funds through token issuance on Ethereum\u2019s platform, bypassing traditional funding routes. This era highlighted Ethereum\u2019s technological prowess and ushered in a new era of investment and interest in the blockchain domain.\n\nLeading the Charge in the NFT Marketplace\n\nIn the burgeoning world of NFTs, Ethereum\u2019s role has been nothing short of foundational. As the primary platform for creating and exchanging NFTs, Ethereum has become synonymous with this novel digital asset class. Its ability to authenticate and secure unique digital items has positioned it as the preferred choice for a diverse array of artists, digital creators, and collectors. The meteoric rise of NFTs, especially in 2021, further cemented Ethereum\u2019s standing as an innovator in blockchain applications.\n\nShaping the DeFi Landscape\n\nEthereum\u2019s influence is profoundly evident in the DeFi sector. As the backbone for many DeFi applications, Ethereum has been instrumental in reshaping financial services. It has enabled a new, more open, inclusive financial ecosystem that operates independently of traditional financial intermediaries. This revolution in finance, driven by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, has opened new avenues for financial interaction and redefined the concept of value exchange.\n\nCultivating a Robust Network and Developer Ecosystem\n\nA critical factor in Ethereum\u2019s enduring market influence is its expansive network effect and the dynamic developer community it has fostered. The platform\u2019s value has exponentially increased as more users and developers engage, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and innovation. Ethereum boasts one of the most active and dedicated developer communities in the blockchain arena, a community that has been instrumental in driving the platform\u2019s continuous evolution and adaptability. This collective effort has fortified Ethereum\u2019s position in the face of new challenges and has also been pivotal in maintaining its edge in the competitive blockchain landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe supremacy of Ethereum in the digital currency realm reflects its groundbreaking technology, expansive network, and visionary approach of its creators. Ethereum has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, from its pioneering role in smart contract technology to its significant contributions in ICOs, NFTs, and DeFi. Despite the rise of new competitors, Ethereum\u2019s dedication to ongoing development and its vibrant, engaged developer community solidify its pivotal role in the cryptocurrency universe. As Ethereum continues to evolve, its influence and leadership are poised to continue shaping the trajectory of blockchain technology and the future of digital finance."

        "content": "A new player has entered the crypto scene with enticing features and good potential. That player is Meme Moguls (MGLS). The token which is just in the presale stage has surpassed the performance of great giants like Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shows Sell Signal, Says Ali Martinez\n\nEthereum (ETH) started this week on a bullish note rising above the $2,000 mark as high as $2,128. Unfortunately, Ethereum\u2019s price has dipped to $2,000. Currently, various indicators suggest the likelihood of further declines in the coming days.\n\nEven crypto traders like Ali Martinez share this opinion. According to Ali, Ethereum\u2019s \u201cTD Sequential\u201d indicator is signaling a sell on the three-day Ethereum price chart. This comes as the asset tests a significant resistance range ranging from $2,000 to $2,150.\n\nThe analyst pointed at a possible price dump to $1,700. Currently, the price of Ethereum is showing mixed sentiment. It had dropped 2% on the daily chart while holding on to gains of 6.5% and 27.3% on the weekly and monthly Ethereum chart.\n\nRipple (XRP) Loses Gains After Recent XRP ETF Rumour\n\nRipple holders\u2019 positive outlook has grown immensely since Ripple\u2019s partial win against the US SEC in July. Ripple\u2019s price increased by over 80% and reached the $0.8 level. Unfortunately, the bearish market led to high selling pressure as Ripple cryptocurrency lost its gains.\n\nThe Ripple crypto dropped as low as $0.5 before picking pace during the Uptober market rally. So far, Ripple coin\u2019s November performance has been poor compared to other cryptocurrencies. Per CoinMarketCap, Ripple XRP price has dipped 3.4% to $0.6387.\n\nBoth its market cap and trading volume have dropped significantly, due to the recent fake BlackRock XRP ETF Trust filing. Still, Ripple\u2019s technical indicators point towards a price recovery in the coming months to the $0.7 region.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS), Bringing New Utility To the Meme Coin Sector\n\nWhile Ethereum and XRP are losing gains, meme coins continue to take over the crypto space. The meme-based asset industry has gained significant recognition in recent years. According to Statistics, the meme coin sector has a market capitalization of over $17.5 billion.\n\nThe interesting part is that these meme coins have little to no utility. In response to this, Meme Moguls has emerged as a solution, as it seeks to launch a meme-backed stock market. The project\u2019s objective is to unite the meme industry to foster a community for meme coin enthusiasts.\n\nUsers will gain access to memes-backed assets. The ecosystem will also encompass a wide range of services, all drawing inspiration from memes. A metaverse platform named Mogul Land will be introduced. This will enable meme traders to interact and mine tokens to enhance their returns.\n\nAnalysts have predicted significant growth for the MGLS token. Currently, Meme lovers have the opportunity to buy MGLS tokens at just $0.0019. Market experts are optimistic about the project and foresee a 1,000% increase in the coming months. Plus, joining the presale gives you a chance to earn up to $10,000 in giveaways at the end of the presale stage.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\n."
