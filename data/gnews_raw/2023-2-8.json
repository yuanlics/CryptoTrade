        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin says no chance ETH is classed as security - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder and crypto entrepreneur Joseph Lubin is confident that Ether (ETH) won\u2019t be classified as a security in the United States.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and founder of blockchain tech firm ConsenSys, in Tel Aviv at the Web3 event, Building Blocks 23.\n\nAsked if ETH could be classed as a security in the U.S. after Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model, Lubin said:\n\n\u201cI think it's as likely, and would have the same impact, as if Uber was made illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be a tremendous outcry from not just the crypto community but different politicians and certain regulators,\u201d he added.\n\nIn September, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler suggested that the blockchain\u2019s transition to PoS might have brought ETH under the regulators\u2019 beat.\n\nGensler believed staking coins gave \u201cthe investing public\u201d anticipation of \u201cprofits based on the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nLubin said he was privy to discussions with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u201cfor many years.\u201d\n\nJoseph Lubin speaking with Cointelegraph at Building Blocks 23 in Tel Aviv, Israel in February.\n\nHe said around five years ago the regulators were \u201cjust trying to wrap their heads around what tokens were.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey thought back then that everything was a security. We \u2014 I think \u2014 helped them significantly understand lots of tokens are not securities, and then they went away and Gary and team now think almost everything's a security.\u201d\n\nLubin, however, believes that ETH continues to be \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d and pointed to its \u201cmany use cases that don\u2019t implicate it as a security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no centralized set of promoters or builders that is specifically trying to raise the value of Ether and enrich investors,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere's a court system in the United States of America that I think would be supportive of arguments that would be made that it is not.\u201d\n\nLubin said that regulators appear to be more focused on another aspect of Ethereum at the moment, noting that people he knows close to the action in Washington D.C. say \u201cmost of the focus is on stablecoins right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody's talking about it, freaking out. Calling for things to be done.\u201d\n\nIn a Feb. 9 Twitter thread, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong responded to \u201crumors\u201d that the SEC was thinking to ban retail consumers from staking crypto.\n\nRelated: CFTC head looks to new Congress for action on crypto regulation\n\n\u201cStaking is not a security,\u201d he said, adding it would be a \u201cterrible path for the U.S.\u201d if a staking ban was passed noting it was \u201ca really important innovation in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully we can work together to publish clear rules for the industry, and come up with sensible solutions that protect consumers while preserving innovation,\u201d Armstrong said."

        "content": "Marc Andreessen, best known for co-founding web browser Netscape and Silicon Valley venture capital fund a16z, is still invested in the crypto industry, even though his expectations around Bitcoin didn\u2019t pan out.\n\nIn 2014, Andreessen predicted that the world would be talking about Bitcoin the same way they did about the internet. The tech investor may have now changed his mind somewhat, but is still heavy on the industry as a whole.\n\nHe told Reason Magazine in an interview published Wednesday that, back then, he thought Bitcoin was a tech innovation that would develop to support several other applications just like the internet, but that it \u201cbasically stopped evolving.\u201d He now has his sights set on Ethereum being at the core of transformation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was a bunch of other projects emerged and took that place, and the big one right now is Ethereum. I would either say Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, or I would just say crypto or Web3 instead of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the early Facebook investor, Web3 has all the features of the internet that people knew they wanted to have when the internet was originally built.\n\n\u201c[Web3] is all the aspects of basically being able to do business and be able to have money and be able to do transactions and have trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not know how to use the internet to do that in the 90s. And now, with this technological breakthrough of the blockchain, we now know how to do that, we have the technological foundation to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nA16Z launched a $4.5 billion crypto fund in 2022, which was touted as the largest-ever crypto-venture fund. The firm\u2019s flagship crypto fund, launched in 2018, lost 40% in the first half of 2022 as they faced a battering. The VC\u2019s portfolio counts projects like Alchemy, Aptos, Avalanche, Chia, Compound, Coinbase, Lido, Mysten Labs and Yuga Labs.\n\nAndreessen didn\u2019t touch upon the bear market that lasted most of 2022, but said the potential of the industry is \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and that there are \u201ctonnes of really smart entrepreneurs\u201d pursuing various opportunities.\n\n\u201cA lot of those things have worked, some of those things haven\u2019t worked yet, but I think that they\u2019re going to work,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network's Shanghai update is one of the most highly anticipated events on the crypto market. It promises to bring increased liquidity to the leading altcoin by unlocking ETH staked in the Beacon Chain. The expected release date for the Shanghai update is March 2023, marking the end of the Merge era.\n\nWhile the crypto community has some concerns about the potential selling pressure that could result from the update, it is important to note that the ETH release will occur gradually through a queue, potentially reducing the impact on the market.\n\nThe launch of the Beacon Chain enabled stakeholders to validate blocks and secure the ETH network while maintaining the predictability of security during The Merge, the biggest update on the cryptocurrency market in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the Q1 hard fork, the ETH network will also undergo two major upgrades later in 2023. These updates will further enhance the leading altcoin's position on the market.\n\nThe Surge\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has stated that the primary focus of the upcoming update is to address the scalability challenges faced by the smart contract platform. The update will accomplish this by fragmenting the ETH database, enabling the network to scale while maintaining its decentralization.\n\nTo achieve this, the ETH network's information will be split horizontally, allowing it to distribute the load and reduce storage costs and hardware requirements. It is important to note that this update will not immediately result in a scalable Ethereum blockchain. Instead, EIP 4844 will create a separate blockchain for Layer 2, which will aid scalability solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism in lowering their transaction fees and becoming truly competitive with other ETH competitors with lower transfer fees.\n\nEOF\n\nThe upcoming EOF (EVM Object Format) update will bring improvements to Ethereum's code execution environment, making the cryptocurrency platform more efficient and streamlining the process of creating smart contracts. EOF will also facilitate updates to the EVM and create a system to track resource usage of new contracts.\n\nThese upgrades bring Ethereum closer to its goal of becoming a large, decentralized computer that supports dApps with a user-friendly interface, low fees and a secure network for daily transactions.\n\nIt is important to note that updates in the cryptocurrency world are made through proposed improvements that are subject to change at any time."

        "title": "Ordinals: A common ground for Ethereum and Bitcoin maximalists? - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "Representing real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain is nothing new.\n\nOver a decade ago, projects like the Colored Coin protocol and Counterparty exchange proved Bitcoin could track items, not just units of currency, in a decentralized way.\n\nHowever, consensus issues prevented either project from gaining widespread adoption in the market. Ethereum quickly took over as the go-to platform for minting and deploying unique digital artifacts. This preference led to the rise of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs as they\u2019re more commonly known today.\n\nBut, things appear to have come full circle as one Bitcoin developer looks to reinvent tokenized assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Even the Ethereum community seems to be encouraging this new venture. The move suggests a potential unity between what many see as two of the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s longest-standing rivals.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals use an open-source protocol that assigns unique identities to individual satoshis (sats). Named after Bitcoin\u2019s creator(s), Satoshi Nakamoto, satoshis are the smallest units of bitcoin. Using the Ord software, the protocol adds data to these sats and allows software users to track them based on a system called ordinal numbers.\n\nAt a high level, this involves assigning a numerical value to each satoshi based on several factors. These factors include the time when that satoshi entered into circulation through mining as well as the specific block height where the satoshi appears.\n\nUsers can use software called Ord to track each satoshi. The system also inscribes them with content to create bitcoin-native digital artifacts.\n\nUsers can trade and transfer these uniquely-identified satoshis just like any normal bitcoin unit. But unlike Colored Coins or most Ethereum NFTs, the digital item itself is stored entirely on-chain \u2014 not elsewhere on the internet.\n\nThis functionality wouldn\u2019t be possible on Bitcoin without implementing SegWit and Taproot \u2014 two soft fork upgrades that helped to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block capacity.\n\nWho created Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinal protocol on January 21, 2023. Rodarmor set out to create a system for numbering satoshis that would give each a unique serial number. This unique identifier would then allow users to track each satoshi across the blockchain. He wanted to be able to accomplish this in a way that was entirely Bitcoin native, without using sidechains or separate tokens.\n\nRodarmor earned a degree in Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley. Most recently he worked as a software engineer for Agora, an open-source app that improves upon the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nRodarmor\u2019s idea isn\u2019t the first time a numbering system has been proposed to assign unique identifiers to individual satoshis. In fact, a BitcoinTalk user by the name of jl2012 published an almost identical proposal for Ordinals in October 2012. At the time, another Bitcoin developer discredited the post as an \u201cold idea.\u201d\n\nRodarmor has since acknowledged jl2012\u2019s work in the last section of a mailing list post announcing Ordinals.\n\nHow do Ordinals work?\n\nThe Ordinal protocol consists of two main parts:\n\nOrdinal theory : The method of numbering satoshis for tracking, transfer, and value assigning purposes.\n\nInscription: The process of using the Ord software to associate content with a satoshi based on the number the software assigns. The Ord software associates content with real satoshis, but does so according to a numbering scheme unique to the Ord software.\n\nOrdinal theory\n\nOrdinals offer a method for assigning a unique identifier value to each of the 2.1 quadrillion satoshis that will ever be created.\n\nThe numerical value assigned to each satoshi acts as a serial number. The system creates this serial number based on how that satoshi relates to different periodic events that happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, including:\n\nBlocks : Batches of transactions that are committed to the Bitcoin blockchain roughly every 10 minutes. Blocks are the most common event Ordinals use to derive their numerical value.\n\nDifficulty adjustment periods : After every 2,016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), the Bitcoin protocol adjusts its mining difficulty target based on the amount of computational power being used to maintain the network. We call this the hashrate.\n\nHalvings epochs : After every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), the system halves the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation. There have been three halvings since the launch of Bitcoin.\n\nCycles: After every six halvings, a difficulty adjustment and halving take place simultaneously, resulting in an event known as a conjunction. Because halvings only take place every four years, conjunctions only take place every 24 years. Conjunctions are the least common event that Ordinals track, and the time frame between conjunctions is called a cycle.\n\nOrdinals use these events to create a process for tracking the comparative rarity of satoshis. The Ordinal Theory Handbook breaks down how satoshis relate to each of these events using the following rarity levels:\n\nRarity level Condition Amount (in total BTC supply) Common Any sat that is not the first sat of its block 2,099,999,990,756,525 Uncommon The first sat of each block 6,929,999 Rare The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period 3,437 Epic The first sat of each halving epoch 32 Legendary The first sat of each cycle 5 Mythic The very first sat of the genesis block 1\n\nBy assigning a unique identifier to each satoshi, Ordinals open a way of making inherently fungible satoshis into non-fungible objects. This identifier makes them completely unique, just like NFTs.\n\nOrdinal inscription\n\nWe refer to the committing of a piece of content to a satoshi as \u201cinscription.\u201d This process is accomplished using Ord, and you can see inscriptions with the ordinals explorer.\n\nThe system identifies the content by its MIME type (whether it\u2019s a JPEG, an MP3 file, HTML code, etc) and a byte string (the content itself). Inscriptions don\u2019t necessarily have to represent a non-fungible token. Users can also create Bitcoin-based security tokens and other assets.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are entirely on-chain and stored within the script of a taproot transaction. This process is different from many of the most prevalent NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain. Usually, the Ethereum blockchain stores NFT media content off-chain, while keeping only a record of the NFT on the blockchain.\n\nOnly a select few NFT collections, the most prominent of which are CryptoPunks, store both the media and the NFT directly on-chain.\n\nThrough this inscription process, the blockchain stores content alongside a specific satoshi. The process turns the satoshi into a unique digital artifact that users can track, transfer, hold, buy, and sell.\n\nHow Bitcoin Ordinals (may) impact Ethereum NFTs\n\nThe Ordinals protocol has resurrected the vast potential of tokenizing assets on Bitcoin\u2019s highly secure, decentralized blockchain. Not only that, it also serves as a means of permanently storing digital content directly on-chain \u2014 something rarely seen in the NFT space.\n\nThis innovation has already spurred the interest of existing Ethereum-based NFT creators, including Tom W, a co-founder of Cool Cats. On the official Ordinals Discord server, they commented, \u201cHey all, Im Tom, one of the co-founders of Cool Cats NFT. Here to experiment with some cool shit. https://twitter.com/coolcats.\u201d\n\nWith renewed capabilities for launching existing popular collections on the Bitcoin blockchain, Ordinals may help to combat the long-standing problem of lost NFTs. These prevent external file storage issues and could open up potential new revenue streams for NFT creators.\n\nInterestingly, Ordinals are actually gaining traction. For example, Bitcoin Rocks from the Ethereum-based original collection have already sold for 0.2 BTC, while a blue check-verified Twitter user with the handle \u201cbusinessman.eth\u201d posted, \u201cWOW!!! 0.42 BTC sale for an @OrdinalPunks #Bitcoin Ordinals are starting to gain steam.\u201d\n\nWhile the true impact of Ordinals is still emerging, one thing is clear: maximalists from both Bitcoin and Ethereum camps are excited about the new opportunities these digital artifacts present.\n\nFollow blog.kraken.com and our Twitter account @KrakenFX for all the latest developments shaping the crypto industry.\n\nWant to see an Ordinal for yourself?\n\nClick here to see one of the latest Ordinals to be inscribed, brought to you by Kraken.\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any digital asset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

        "title": "What is Optimism (OP): Guide to One of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-Two Scaling Solutions - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry, in general, became a lot more popular in the past couple of years. This saw the development and launch of hundreds, if not thousands, of decentralized applications (dApps) in various fields, such as DeFi, gaming, learning, trading, investing, and whatnot.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, including but not limited to the massive bull run in 2021, the rise of non-fungible tokens, the popularity of memecoins, and more. This saw hundreds of thousands of users flocking to whatever the next trend may be.\n\nUnlike previous cycles, however, this time, we also saw regular users take advantage of on-chain availabilities and interact with various dApps such as Uniswap, OpenSea, and so forth. And while this had a massively beneficial effect on the industry\u2019s growth and valuation, it also highlighted some very critical issues.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum \u2013 where the lion\u2019s share of dApp activity takes place \u2013 struggled in terms of affordability, scalability, and even accessibility. Layer one alternatives like Solana also proved to be insufficiently effective in handling the massive load of user requests.\n\nThis brought up a topic that\u2019s been largely discussed in the cryptocurrency community for years \u2013 scalability. Now that scaling solutions became essentially imperative for the future growth of the industry, projects like Optimism saw the light of day.\n\nBeing one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions, Optimism aims to solve some of the underlying issues with the network with a particular focus on scaling.\n\nQuick Facts About Optimism\n\nOptimism\u2019s mainnet went live on December 2021\n\nOptimism launched its native token (OP) on May 31st, 2022.\n\nA total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum scaling solution. In essence, its purpose is to help the main network run smoothly by taking some of its transactional load. In technical terms, Optimism is an \u201cOptimistic rollup,\u201d and it\u2019s important to understand what rollups do before diving deeper.\n\nWhat is a Rollup?\n\nRollups are one of the multiple scaling solutions intended to help Ethereum achieve a higher transaction throughput.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation explains that they \u201cperform transaction execution outside layer 1, and then the data is posted to layer 1 where consensus is reached.\u201d\n\nThe main benefit of this is that it reduces the load on the main network while also guaranteeing the broadcasted information by its native security.\n\nThere are two main types of rollups, mainly differentiated by their security models:\n\nZero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups \u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain.\n\n\u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain. Optimistic rollups \u2013 these assume that transactions are valid by default and only run computation through fraud-proof if there\u2019s a challenge.\n\nOptimism falls within the second category, and, as you may have probably guessed already, its parent chain is Ethereum.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nThe big idea that makes Optimism interesting to most is the Optimistic Rollup. The following is a brief explanation of the fundamental principles of the concept.\n\nHowever, the TLDR of it is that an Optimistic Rollup is another way of calling a blockchain that\u2019s designed to take advantage of the security of another network that acts as a parent one.\n\nBlock Storage\n\nAll of the blocks on Optimism are stored within a specific smart contract that\u2019s built on Ethereum and is called CannonicalTransactionChain \u2013 CTC to make it easier. They are helped within a list that\u2019s inside of the CTC, and it\u2019s append-only.\n\nThe CTC contains code that guarantees that the current list of blocks can\u2019t be altered by newer transactions on Ethereum. This guarantee can be broken if the Ethereum network itself goes through a reorganization (reorg) and the order is changed.\n\nBlock Production\n\nThe \u2018sequencer\u2019 is the single party that manages block production on Optimism. It helps with the network by delivering the following:\n\nInstant transaction confirmations and state updates;\n\nConstructing and executing layer-two blocks;\n\nSubmitting user transactions to layer one.\n\nIt has no mempool, which means that the transactions are accepted (or rejected) immediately. This happens in the order they are received. When someone sends a transaction, the sequencer will check if it\u2019s valid (pays a sufficient fee) and apply it to the local state as a block that\u2019s pending. These pending blocks are then batched and periodically submitted to Ethereum\u2019s network for finalization.\n\nThe main goal of this batching is to reduce the overall transaction fees by spreading certain fixed costs over all of the transactions within a single batch. Of course, this fee may vary depending on the network load at the time when the transactions were sent to the sequencer.\n\nBlock Execution\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that Ethereum nodes download blocks from Ethereum\u2019s network that\u2019s peer-to-peer. Optimism nodes, on the other hand, download blocks directly from the CTC append-only contract.\n\nThere are two primary components that make Optimism nodes. These are the Ethereum Data Indexer and the Optimism Client Software.\n\nEthereum Data Indexer\n\nIt\u2019s designed to reconstruct the optimism blockchain from blocks that are published to the CTC contract. It\u2019s also called the data transport layer.\n\nOptimism Client Software\n\nThis one closely resembles Geth, which means that Optimism, overall, is very close in its design to Ethereum. This is also because Optimism shares the same Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), as well as the same account and state structure and the metering mechanism for gas, and the fee schedule.\n\nFault Proofs\n\nUsing an Optimistic Rollup means that the state commitments are published to Ethereum\u2019s network in a way that\u2019s direct without requesting any proof of the validity of these commitments. Fault proofs are requested when a state commitment is challenged. If it\u2019s challenged successfully, it would be then removed and eventually replaced by another one.\n\nThis document provides a more in-depth and technical explanation of the terms and overall process described above.\n\nHow to Bridge Assets Between Layers\n\nWith layer-two scaling solutions such as Optimism, being able to swap assets between different layers is obviously of paramount importance.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can go about it. First and foremost, you can hop on the official website and use the bridge provided there. This would only require you to have a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask.\n\nFrom there, you have to select the network that you want to bridge tokens from. This is the supported list:\n\nThere are also options to bridge from centralized exchanges, but it\u2019s critical to note that these happen through providers that Optimism has simply linked to \u2013 meaning there\u2019s no endorsement, and you should proceed with caution and after making thorough due diligence.\n\nFrom there, the process is particularly simple, as all you need to do is confirm the amount and sign the transaction in your wallet.\n\nTo bridge assets from Optimism, there are a couple of options. You can use a third-party bridge or use the official bridge instead. The following is an example of the latter, but keep in mind that bridging from Optimism to Ethereum takes seven days.\n\nAll you need to do is click the arrow in between the value boxes, and this will switch the above transaction. If you haven\u2019t added Optimism to MetaMask, this will also handle it for you. From there, you only have to confirm the amount and sign the transaction:\n\nGovernance: Optimism\u2019s Model\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Optimism ecosystem is the OP token.\n\nOptimism is governed by the so-called Optimism Collective. According to the official website, the collective is:\n\n\u201c\u2026 a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThat said, the governance of the Optimism Collective itself will consist of two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe Token House\n\nThe launch of the OP token and the Token House set forth the beginning of the governance of Optimism. OP itself was distributed to hundreds of thousands of addresses, who engaged in community-oriented behavior through the first airdrop (more on that later.)\n\nIn any case, members of the Token House are responsible for deliberating, submitting, and voting on various proposals. To do so, OP holders can either vote directly o choose to delegate their voting power to a third party.\n\nIn essence, the Token House votes on proposals of the following types:\n\nProtocol u grades\n\nInflation adjustment\n\nTreasury appropriations\n\nRights protection\n\nGovernance fund grants\n\nThe Citizens\u2019 House\n\nAt its core, the Citizens\u2019 house is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model. It is responsible for retroactive public goods funding.\n\nThe above brings us to our next point, which is the OP token.\n\nIntroducing the OP Token\n\nThe OP token was launched through an airdrop which distributed a total of 5% of the total supply.\n\nThat said, qualifying users included:\n\nDAO voters\n\nMulti-Sig signers\n\nRepeat Optimism users\n\nGitrcoin donors\n\nIf you suspect you are eligible, you can check out any associated wallets on the official claim page.\n\nMany wonder if there will be a new airdrop, and the short answer is \u2013 yes. The team has made it clear that it plans to allocate a total of 19% of the supply for this purpose. Here\u2019s what the overall tokenomics of OP look like:\n\nFor a more complete look at the economics behind the Optimism ecosystem, please make sure to visit the official website.\n\nConclusion\n\nOptimism has quickly become one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions. Most recently, the Optimism Foundation released a proposal to upgrade the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, which is a new generation of decentralized Rollup architecture developed by Optimism Labs. Speaking on the matter, the team said:\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the post-Bedrock experience will be a positive change for developers in the Optimism ecosystem and have received consistent excitement for the upgrade from our partners. We are committed to making this upgrade a success and are eager to see the results in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to monitor how the different layer-twos fare in the coming years as the battle between optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups continues."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is said to be considering a ban on crypto-staking services. In response, Charles Hoskinson of Cardano voiced his opinion on the subject, training his eyes on Ethereum, whose staking model he said is problematic.\n\nHoskinson: The locked stakes are a red flag\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, the fact that ethereum coins are locked in staking smart contracts that are completely inaccessible gives the impression that they are controlled goods.\n\nHoskinson asserts that staking ethereum also presents many challenges. The temporary transfer of one\u2019s assets to another party in exchange for compensation from that party resembles the sale of a regulated financial product. Charles believes cutting and bonding could be more effective instead of this system.\n\nIn the response tweet to Armstrong\u2019s first article, he further explained that non-custodial liquid staking is analogous to the mining pools that the bitcoin community has been using for the last 13 years.\n\nEthereum staking is problematic. Temporarily giving up your assets to someone else to have them get a return looks a lot like regulated products. Slashing and bonds not so good. Non-custodial liquid staking on the other hand is like the mining pools we've used for 13 years \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 9, 2023\n\nAccording to the head of Cardano, his team tackled the issue of staking on the protocol to a model mostly governed by the community rather than a select group of users.\n\nShibetoshi, the doge founder, another renowned crypto personnel who remarked on Armstrong\u2019s thread, seemed somehow unsupportive of the ban and wondered why the government would let slip such a taxation opportunity bringing more weight and questions into the SEC\u2019s alleged move.\n\nwhy don\u2019t they want more easy tax money\n\n\n\nthe government is so weird \u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) February 9, 2023\n\nWhat could this mean to the ecosystem?\n\nEven if the information is still considered a rumor, many involved in the business are noticeably getting ready for a real ban to be imposed by the market regulator.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, the \u201cbasic misunderstanding about the real facts of operation and design\u201d will cause the SEC to classify all staking products under the same umbrella even though they each have unique characteristics.\n\nHe added that although most staking protocols have opted to construct centralized rather than decentralized systems, it is a move that will ultimately be detrimental to the industry.\n\nThe SEC has been given the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies pending a change in the regulatory landscape in the United States. As a result, the commission has initiated several enforcement actions against many companies, including Ripple Labs Inc. and LBRY.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Staking on Ethereum, for example, requires users to deposit 32 Ethereum to join. There are also alternative services that let users earn rewards for staking less, like Lido Finance and Rocket Pool.\n\nIndex Coop Launches New Staked Ethereum Index for the LSD-Curious\n\nRevout says users can earn up to 11.65% return in crypto rewards on certain tokens, though this varies and is subject to change depending on the token staked.\n\nPokadot, for example, offers the highest available yield, while Cardano offers the lowest at 2.79%. Ethereum and Tezos sit somewhere in the middle at 3.88% and 4.59%, respectively.\n\nThe new service will only be available in the UK and in select EEA markets initially.\n\nRevolut told Decrypt it intends to make more cryptocurrencies available for staking but didn\u2019t say exactly which tokens or what countries are next on the list for expanding the service.\n\nAnnouncing new additions to our crypto family!

The Commission\u2019s chairman Gary Gensler previously said crypto exchanges offering staking services offer services similar to lending even if there are changes in the labeling.\n\nThe comment generated several heated responses from the crypto community over the Commission\u2019s understanding of crypto staking. Hoskinson said:\n\n\u201cAll proof of stake protocols might get lumped together due to a fundamental misunderstanding about the actual facts of operation and design [of staking].\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, this is not the first time Hoskinson criticized Ethereum\u2019s staking.

I don\u2019t like these very nicely stacked trendline-esque higher lows. So if there\u2019s going to be any visible rejection from this monthly level [$1,678], I wouldn\u2019t be terribly shocked if we saw some trading through those lows [below $1,600], especially given this pre-breakout consolidation has rather been messy.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,673, still below Cred\u2019s monthly resistance area.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), Cred explains why he believes the king crypto\u2019s rally has stalled.\n\n\u201cYou can see on the daily timeframe that momentum has changed to a decent extent. Here [$18,000 to $21,000] you had impulse, very short consolidation, another strong impulse. Here [$23,000] you just had consolidation, attempt to break out, but you did not get continuation.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because here [$21,000], we just reclaimed the big level [$18,000], and we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. Whereas where we are now, we are into a big level so you can\u2019t expect the same type of price action necessarily.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $23,304.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As investors took notice, the long-awaited price corrections had a significant reaction, showcased through on-chain activities on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccording to a data report from Analytex, Ethereum\u2019s average gas price \u2014 calculated in terms of the smallest Ether (ETH) denomination, gwei \u2014 increased by 29.27% in January 2023. The report compares gas prices from January to December 2022, noting an increase in user activity as a key indicator for the rise in average gas price from 19.2 gwei to 24.82 gwei month-on-month.\n\nEthereum average gas price per month. Source: app.analytex.today\n\nThe report also notes that the average number of unique active Ethereum wallets per day decreased by around 10% to 387,475, the lowest figure over the past six months. Meanwhile, the average number of unique active smart contracts increased by 6.74%.\n\nEthereum transactions peak, January 2023. Source: app.analytex.today\n\nAs shown above, other important metrics measured include daily Ethereum transaction data, which showed a slight decrease of 0.8% from December to January. The report notes that the average number of Ethereum transactions per day has declined for eight months.\n\nRelated: \u2018Decentralized Infura\u2019 may help prevent Ethereum app crashes: Interview\n\nEthereum block statistics show that the average number of blocks mined each day showed little to no change, while the total block size per month increased by 7%. Following the Merge, daily average block data has been stable at around 0.01% monthly. The total Ethereum block size per month for January was 17.24 GB, up 7.08% from December\u2019s 16.1GB total.\n\nEthereum average number of blocks per day. Source: app.analytex.today\n\nThe report highlights contrasting data metrics across the board. The number of transactions and unique active wallets was down from December. The Ethereum activity index also showed that the number of active smart contracts and average gas cost prices have increased.\n\nAnalytex suggests that this indicates \u201cincreased interest of both current blockchain users, as well as smart contracts developers.\u201c\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols saw an increase in total value locked across different staking pools in January, per a report from DappRadar. The market hit $74.6 billion worth of staked assets, increasing by 26% from December 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s looming Shanghai upgrade is also driving staking in DeFi due to the expected opening of withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts. Lido Finance flipped Maker DAO as the largest DeFi protocol in January, driven by the popularity of liquid staking derivative protocols."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a leading figure on the cryptocurrency market, Michael Saylor is widely recognized for his strong advocacy of Bitcoin (BTC) technology. In 2020, amid the global economic impacts of the pandemic, Saylor's company, MicroStrategy, began purchasing large amounts of Bitcoin. Under Saylor's direction, MicroStrategy acquired 21,454 BTCs in August 2020 and has continued to accumulate the cryptocurrency, positioning Saylor as a significant player on the BTC market.\n\nIn addition to his role in leading MicroStrategy's Bitcoin purchases, Saylor has also made private investments into the cryptocurrency and publicly voiced his support for it, particularly in comparison to other digital assets. He holds the belief that Bitcoin is the most mature and robust cryptocurrency and offers the best investment opportunities for both investors and users.\n\nIn 2022, when asked by the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex via Twitter to name the three cryptocurrencies they would choose to invest $100 million in, Saylor quickly responded with: Bitcoin, Bitcoin and Bitcoin. He confidently stated that BTC will \"be worth millions\" even after the correction it experienced in the previous year.\n\nWhat does Saylor think about Ethereum?\n\nMichael Saylor is known for his critical stance toward Ethereum (ETH) and its capabilities as a cryptocurrency. He believes that ETH has yet to prove its technical and ethical stability and thus needs to be monitored for five to ten years before it can be considered reliable. Saylor also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the protocol cannot be altered by anyone, including Vitalik Buterin, if ETH is to have a chance of becoming a global currency.\n\nSaylor views Ethereum as a financial asset issued by a company, rather than a commodity, due to its origin through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and the existence of a management team responsible for its administration. He argues that the presence of an issuer negates the possibility of a cryptocurrency being considered a commodity.\n\nThe former CEO of MicroStrategy has also criticized the centralization of ETH, arguing that its frequent hard forks make it vulnerable to changes by the development team. Saylor claims that such significant changes to the protocol mean that the development team is making decisions, and if the monetary protocol can be altered, Ethereum may fall under the classification of an investment contract under securities law.\n\nIs Saylor no longer a Bitcoin maximalist?\n\nRecently, an audio recording that purports to feature Michael Saylor has gained attention on the internet. In the audio, Saylor is alleged to have stated that he is tired of Bitcoin and wishes to sell it but is waiting for a breakeven point. He is also reported to have expressed his dislike for the maximalists of the primary cryptocurrency and regret for not investing in Ethereum instead.\n\nThis alleged change of stance from someone who has historically been critical of Ethereum, raises questions about the authenticity of the recording and whether it may be a hoax created using artificial intelligence, a trend that is becoming more prevalent in 2023.\n\nSaylor's strong preference for Bitcoin can be seen in his public statements and tweets, and if his opinions are important to Ethereum holders (which does not appear to be the case), they may need to wait until the executive takes a closer look at the altcoin."

        "content": "Ethereum is entering its fourth consecutive week of deflationary issuance as activity on the network grows.\n\nA deflationary issuance rate for cryptocurrencies means that the number of tokens being burnt is greater than the number of tokens being minted. This implies that the token is limited in supply compared to demand, giving the currency greater purchasing power.\n\nGrowing activity in decentralized platforms could indicate more people turning to DeFi after the collapse of its centralized competitors last year, Michael Bentley, CEO and co-founder of DeFi lending protocol Euler, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cFollowing protocol upgrades last year, Ethereum has an in-built fee burning mechanism that ensures that the more people transact on the network, the more ETH gets burned,\u201d Bentley said.\n\nAt the time of writing, the annualized inflation rate for Ethereum currently sits at -0.01% according to information from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much activity on Ethereum in early 2023 that ETH itself is becoming more and more scarce, and has even recently become a deflationary asset,\u201d Bentley said.\n\nOver the past seven days, Uniswap\u2019s universal router has burned almost 2,500 ETH, taking the top spot in the burn leaderboard previously occupied by OpenSea.\n\nUniswap is the second-largest decentralized exchange in DeFi today in terms of total value locked, at $4.03 billion, behind Curve Finance. But Uniswap is the clear leader when measuring 24-hour trading volume with \u200b\u200b$1.78 billion, information on DefiLama shows. That volume is what\u2019s driving Ethereum fees.\n\nAccording to Blockworks Research analyst Matt Fiebach, \u201cEthereum gas fees hover around 40 gwei and a 7-day moving average over 25 gwei, the highest seen since July of last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Uniswap leading the pack as the largest gas guzzler by a mile over the last 7 days, it is clear that crypto market participants are risk-on and actively trading high beta bets,\u201d Fiebach said.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Umee, a Web3 bond-market platform for building DeFi utility, who told Blockworks that the increase in network activity on Ethereum is the primary reason that we see a deflationary issuance on the chain.\n\n\u201cThis is a good sign. It means that Ethereum is doing well \u2014 notably since daily network fees are up substantially since their December lows,\u201d Xu said.\n\nXu also notes that user activity is increasing not only on Ethereum but on other blockchains as well.\n\n\u201cMore broadly, all this is indicative of positive signs for the broader crypto ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The move comes less than two years after the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol launched its mainnet on Nov. 9, 2021. Dubbed a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, Rocket Pool allows users to join an Ethereum decentralized node operator or run their own node.\n\nUnlike conventional staking solutions, the capital requirements are far less, as users can run their own node with just 16 Ether (ETH) as opposed to the network specified 32 ETH, with another 16 ETH coming from a pool of users who join a decentralized node operator. For the latter, the deposit requirement is only 0.01 ETH. Depositors receive liquid staking token rETH in exchange for their ETH, which proves the user is entitled to staking rewards over time and accrues yield.\n\nIn exchange for validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, Rocket Pool node operators receive up to 7.26% per year, while stakers receive 4.68%. Both rates are variable and are subject to node demand and supply as well as transaction volume on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, rewards may also be nullified or amplified by changes in the market price of ETH.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s TVL has steadily increased in value despite ETH\u2019s declining market price. Source: DefiLlama\n\nCurrently, the protocol has 385,344 ETH staked and 2,068 node operators. Rocket Pool\u2019s smart contracts have been audited by Sigma Prime, ConsenSys and Trail of Bits. The project also has a bug bounty program facilitated by Immunefi. According to Ethereum\u2019s developers, the blockchain\u2019s Shanghai upgrade is scheduled to come online in March. It will allow users to withdraw their staked ETH and accrued rewards since the network\u2019s successful transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022."

In a recent statement, Burniske suggested that Ethereum will lead investors to Valhalla next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe analyst believes that the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market will soon experience a volatility spike that will send ETH to new highs that they have not been seen before. This prediction is based on Burniske's extensive analysis of the Ethereum network and its potential for growth.\n\nBurniske is particularly optimistic about the upcoming Shanghai update implementation. He believes that this upgrade will be a turning point for Ethereum, as it will bring a significant improvement to the network's scalability, security and overall performance. He expects a breakout of the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair after the update is implemented, which will drive the price of ETH to new heights.\n\n$ETH looking like it wants to lead us to Valhalla next \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) February 8, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone shares Burniske's optimism. Some analysts believe that ETH may face unprecedented selling pressure after the Shanghai update, due to stacking funds being unlocked. The argument is that investors who have been stacking their funds for a long time may want to cash out after the update, which could cause a significant drop in the price of ETH.\n\nDespite these opposing views, Burniske remains confident in his prediction. He believes that Ethereum has the potential to become the leading cryptocurrency on the market and that it will lead investors to Valhalla, the mythical Norse hall of the slain, where heroes feast for eternity. This is his way of saying that Ethereum will deliver a substantial return on investment for investors who are brave enough to take the risk."

        "title": "6 best cross-chain bridges in 2023 - TechTarget",
        "content": "As the demand for different blockchain-based Web 3.0 technologies continues to grow, so too does the need to enable interoperability. This is something that is enabled with cross-chain bridge services.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses cryptography to provide assurance and integrity to data and transactions. Blockchain networks enable many types of services, including secured databases, immutable ledgers, decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are many blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use different blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Solana and Arbitrum. Enabling interoperability and exchange across different blockchain networks is an area where cross-chain bridges -- sometimes also referred to as blockchain bridges -- play an increasingly important role.\n\nWhat is a cross-chain bridge? A cross-chain bridge enables an exchange of information, cryptocurrency or NFTs from one blockchain network to another. It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains. With fiat currency there are many established ways for individuals and businesses to exchange money, creating a globally available and interoperable system of financial payments. Those systems include financial institutions, banks and credit cards that handle foreign exchange. In the world of blockchains, a cross-chain bridge serves an analogous purpose. Exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge, but it is expensive and more time-consuming. Without the use of a cross-chain bridge, users must first convert a cryptocurrency token into a fiat currency, which often involves fees. They then use currency to get the other desired type of cryptocurrency, incurring more fees and taking time. One characteristic of a cross-chain bridge is that it enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without first changing it to fiat currency. Cross-chain bridges aren't limited to just cryptocurrency value transfer either. An effective cross-chain bridge can also enable the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain environment to another. There are several approaches to enabling transfers with a cross-chain bridge. One common approach is using a wrapped token issued by the cross-chain bridge provider platform. With a wrapped token, the value of one token from a specific blockchain network can be encapsulated inside another token. Wrapped tokens are typically based on the ERC-20 technical specification for an Ethereum network. For example, WBTC is a Bitcoin token wrapped with an ERC-20 Ethereum smart contract. Another approach to enabling cross-chain bridge transfers is by using a liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, a cross-chain bridge provider holds inventory -- or pools -- of various coins where one can be exchanged for another. Cross-chain bridges can also be a lucrative target for hackers. One of the largest attacks occurred in February 2022, when cross-chain bridge platform Wormhole was the victim of an attack in which the threat actor stole 120,000 wrapped Ethereum tokens -- worth an estimated $320 million at the time of the theft. BNB Chain, also known as Binance Smart Chain, was the victim of an attack in October 2022 that resulted in losses estimated at $570 million. Blockchain bridge analysis vendor Chainalyis has estimated that 69% of cryptocurrency funds stolen in 2022 have been attributed to attacks on cross-chain bridges.

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has been showing great strength during this market recovery. Since the beginning of 2023, ETH has been up by more than 40% and is currently within a strong demand zone.\n\nAs of press time, ETH is trading 2.9% down at a price of $1627 and a market cap of $199 billion. The recent activity shows that $1600 could serve as strong support for ETH going ahead. Citing data from IntoTheBlock, popular crypto market analyst Ali Martinez reported:\n\nadvertisement\n\nNote that the $1,600-$1,650 level represents a significant area of support for #Ethereum. Onchain data shows that 1.94 million addresses purchased 8 million $ETH between $1,600 \u2013 $1,650. As long as this important demand wall holds, #ETH has a good chance of advancing further.\n\nETH has been currently facing strong resistance at $1,700. However, any breakout above these levels could help in pushing the ETH rally further.\n\nEthereum On-Chain User Activity Jumps\n\nAs per a data report from Analytex, user activity on the Ethereum platform surged significantly in the last month of January 2023. This has ultimately translated into the surge of average gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nCalculated in gwei, the smallest Ethereum denomination, the average gas price jumped by 29.27% in January 2023, in comparison to its previous month. The report also adds that the average number of unique Ethereum active wallets per day dropped by 10% to 387,475.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s a drop in the daily Ethereum transaction data by 0.8% from December to January. The average ETH transactions per day have been on a decline for eight months now.\n\nThe recent surge in user activity on Ethereum could also be due to an uptick in the DeFi activity recently. The total value locked (TVL) across different decentralized finance protocols surged during the last month of January 2023.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Shanghai hardfork is also driving staking in DeFi due to the expected opening of withdrawals from the Ethereum staking contracts in March 2023. It will be interesting to see if ETH can surge to $2,000 by the time of the Shanghai hardfork."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO, the decentralized community that oversees the domain project on Ethereum, ENS, has sold 10,000 ethereum (ETH) for $16.2m in USDC stablecoin.\n\nThe sale is the latest effort by a DAO to limit its exposure to volatile crypto by diversifying its treasury reserves into stablecoins.\n\nEthereum Name Service DAO sells ETH for USDC\n\nENS DAO swapped 10,000 ETH for USDC on Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023. The sale occurred on CoWSwap at 10:26 AM UTC. ENS DAO realized $16.2 million from the swap, according to on-chain transaction data.\n\nToday\u2019s trade comes after the DAO previously voted to sell 10,000 ETH. ETH sold came from the DAO\u2019s spendable treasury and amounted to 25% of its ETH reserves.\n\nDuring the vote, ENS DAO delegates agreed to sell coins on CoWSwap. Gnosis Co-Founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann revealed that the sale incurred minimal slippage of 0.5%. Slippage refers to the loss incurred when swapping assets, the difference between the quoted price and settlement price of a token swap.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1623614547595517953\n\nK\u00f6ppelmann argued that the sale would have been a victim of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) extraction worth $80,000 if it had been done on a normal decentralized exchange like Uniswap.\n\nENS DAO will use the funds realized to support the project for the next 18 to 24 months. Over half of the money will go to ENS Labs, the developer behind the project. ENS Labs reportedly requires about $11,500 daily to fund operations, amounting to $8.4m over two years.\n\nAnother bulk spending from the funds will go toward ENS DAO working groups. The DAO has three core working groups tasked with handling specific functions for the community.\n\nTreasury diversification for DAOs\n\nThe sale reduces the ENS DAO exposure to ether. It is also another treasury diversification route taken by the community. The DAO is currently looking to fund an endowment fund that will be used to attempt to earn yield from its reserve assets.\n\nDAOs faced their first bear market in 2022 and saw firsthand how their reserves could become devalued during sustained price downturns. It is because many DAOs keep the bulk of their assets in their native tokens.\n\nCurrently, communities are advocating significant treasury diversification. This can come in the form of holding stablecoins or investing in real-world assets like in the case of MakerDAO.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW) in Blockchain? - Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Proof of Work (PoW)?\n\nProof of work (PoW) describes a consensus mechanism that requires a significant amount of computing effort from a network of devices. The concept was adapted digital tokens by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of \"reusable proof of work\" using the 160-bit secure hash algorithm 1 (SHA-1).\n\nFollowing its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin became the first widely adopted application of Finney's PoW idea (Finney was also the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction). Proof of work forms the basis of many other cryptocurrencies, allowing for secure consensus.\n\nKey Takeaways Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires network members to expend effort in solving an encrypted hexadecimal number.\n\nProof of work is also called mining, in reference to receiving a reward for work done.\n\nProof of work allows for secure peer-to-peer transaction processing without needing a trusted third party.\n\nProof of work at scale requires vast amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.\n\nUnderstanding Proof of Work\n\nThis explanation will focus on proof of work as it functions in the Bitcoin network. Commonly called a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is technically a token\u2014a representation of ownership of value on the Bitcoin blockchain. The ownership of the token can be exchanged for something of equal value, much like how you hand someone a dollar for a candy bar\u2014they now have the dollar and you have the candy bar.\n\nProof of Work Blockchains\n\nBlockchains are distributed ledgers that record all bitcoin transactions, similarly to how you would enter transactions in a spreadsheet. Each block is similar to a cell. Information such as transaction amounts, wallet addresses, time, and date are recorded and encrypted into a block header\u2014a hexadecimal number created through the blockchain's hashing function.\n\nThe hash from each block is used in the block that follows it when its hash is created. This creates a ledger of chained blocks that cannot be altered because the information from every block is included in the newest block's hash.\n\nHashes\n\nWhen a block is closed, the hash must be verified before a new block can be opened. This is where proof of work comes in. The hash is a 64-digit encrypted hexadecimal number. With modern technology, a hash can be generated in milliseconds for a large amount of data. However, miners try to guess that hash, which takes a very long time in computing terms.\n\nMining is the process of validating transactions by solving the hash and receiving a reward.\n\nNonce\n\nThe hash includes a series of numbers called the nonce, short for \"number used once.\" When a miner\u2014the program on a node that works to solve the hash\u2014begins mining, it generates a hash from publicly available information using a nonce equal to zero.\n\nSolving the Hash\n\nIf the hash is lower than the current network target, the miner has successfully solved the hash. The network target is a mathematical result of a formula converted to a hexadecimal number that dictates the mining difficulty.\n\nIf the hash is greater than the target, the mining program adds a value of 1 to the nonce and generates a hash again. The entire network of miners tries to solve the hash this way. On the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner that solves the hash is given the current reward for the work done.\n\nProof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nThe two most popular consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake. Bitcoin's top competitor Ethereum used proof of work on its blockchain until September 2022, when the highly-anticipated transition to proof of stake was made. Here are some of the key differences between the two.\n\nProof of Work Validation is done by a network of miners\n\nBitcoin paid as a reward and for transaction fees\n\nCompetitive nature uses lots of energy and computational power Proof of Stake Validation is done by participants who offer ether as collateral\n\nEther is paid for transaction fees only\n\nLess computational power and energy used\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nMining is a competitive process, so it has become a race between those with the most computational power. So, miners join pools to increase their chances of receiving a reward because it takes an enormous amount of computing work to be competitive.\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2023, the mining pool FoundryUSA accounted for nearly 32% of the Bitcoin network's three-day hashrate\u2014the number of hashes a network can perform per second. FoundryUSA hashed 89.81 exa hashes per second (EH/s)\u2014the pool generated nearly 90 quintillion (90 x 1018) hashes per second.\n\nSingle or individual PoW miners are not able to compete with pools for rewards.\n\nProof of work is also known for its energy consumption. The University of Cambridge tracks the Bitcoin network energy demand and uses a \"best guess estimate\" to determine its usage. The network uses as much energy as some small countries; however, it's important to note that industrial data networks and data centers use far more energy than the Bitcoin network.\n\nProof of work is also a much slower validation method than other mechanisms. For example, more transactions are taking place than the Bitcoin network can handle. Transactions are stored in a mempool waiting for validation, with average confirmation times between Jan. 1 and Feb. 9, 2023, ranged from seven to 91 minutes (confirmation is when your transaction is confirmed). Bitcoin keeps its block times at an average of 10 minutes\u2014compare this with block times on the Ethereum PoS network, which have averaged 12 seconds since September 2022.\n\nExample of Proof of Work\n\nProof of work requires a computer to randomly engage in hashing functions until it arrives at an output with the correct minimum amount of leading zeroes. For example, the hash for block #775,771, mined on Feb. 9, 2023, is:\n\n00000000000000000003aa2696b1b7248db53a5a7f72d1fd98916c761e954354\n\nThe block reward for that successful hash was 6.25 BTC and 0.1360 BTC in fees.\n\nThe nonce was 2,881,347,934, there were 1,519 transactions in the block, and the total value of the block was 1,665.9645 BTC. Remembering that a hash is generated and the nonce starts at zero, this block was hashed by a miner 2.8 billion times before reaching a number less than the target.\n\nWhat Does Proof of Work Mean? PoW requires nodes on a network to provide evidence that they have expended computational power (i.e., work) to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner and to prevent bad actors from overtaking the network.\n\nWhy Do Cryptocurrencies Need Proof of Work? Because they are decentralized and peer-to-peer by design, blockchains such as cryptocurrency networks require some way of achieving both consensus and security. Proof of work is one method that makes it too resource-intensive to overtake the network. Other proof mechanisms also exist that are less resource-intensive. Without a proof mechanism, the network and the data stored within it would be vulnerable to attack or theft.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Use Proof of Work? Yes. It uses a PoW algorithm based on the SHA-256 hashing function to validate and confirm transactions and issue new bitcoins.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nProof of work is a consensus mechanism used by many cryptocurrencies to validate transactions on their blockchains and award tokens for participating in the network. Proof of work is a competitive process that uses publicly available transaction information to attempt to generate a hexadecimal number less than the network target for that mining period. Under PoW consensus, thousands of mining programs work on one block until the hash is solved, then move to the next block.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "A Deep Dive Into Consensus on Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana and Avalanche\n\nBy: Alberto Guerrero Montilla and Pablo Larguia \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi Research\n\nEver since Ethereum executed The Merge in September, there\u2019s been a lot of debate around the ramifications of Proof of Stake.\n\nNow with regulators and lawmakers poised to introduce a slate of potential rules on cryptocurrencies, analyzing the blockchain infrastructure of Proof of Stake-based consensus is more important than ever.\n\nWe can assess a number of risks and key data points to understand the state of decentralization. These include:\n\nPercentage of Staked Tokens\n\nDistribution of Token Holders\n\nNumber of Validators\n\nGeographical Distribution of Nodes\n\nDiversification on Cloud Providers\n\nDecentralized vs Centralized Staking\n\nEthereum compared to Polkadot, Solana & Avalanche:\n\nPercentage of staked tokens & Distribution of token holders\n\nLet\u2019s start by checking basic supply and token distribution data among the ecosystems.\n\nEthereum is the No. 2 blockchain by market capitalization ($200B) with a total circulating supply of 120 Million ETH.\n\nAbout 88M ETH are held in accounts, 16M ETH are locked in smart contracts, and 16.3M ETH are staked in validator nodes participating in the consensus.\n\nPolkadot, the No. 12 cryptocurrency, is next with 898.5M in circulation DOT out of a total supply of 1.27 Billion DOT. More than 638M DOT, or half of the total supply, is staked.\n\nSolana is No. 11 with a total supply of 539M SOL. According to staking metrics, there are 377.8M SOL in stake, out of 372M SOL in circulation.\n\nAvalanche, No. 15, has a circulating supply of 314.9 Million AVAX out of a total supply of 720M AVAX, and 60% of the coins are staked, with over 264M AVAX in active validation.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Validators\n\nOn the infrastructure side, the Ethereum blockchain currently has more than 508,400 validator nodes as part of the new Proof of Stake consensus, securing over $20B USD worth of ETH.\n\nPolkadot functions with only 297 active validators in the consensus, and another 641 in standby, participating in the consensus on a rotation basis.\n\nSolana counts 1,847 active validators out of the 3,011 connected nodes, and Avalanche presents a similar number with 1,118 validators. The overwhelming difference between the hundreds of thousands nodes versus a couple thousand or even less, gives Ethereum a considerable lead on this matter.\n\nGeographical Distribution of Nodes\n\nThe resilience of a network can be linked to the geographical distribution of its nodes, due to the ability to avoid jurisdictional concentration risks. This topic is especially important for fostering uncensorable ecosystems. Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana and Avalanche have a visible concentration of their infrastructure in Europe and North America, with more than half of the total nodes located in these regions. Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom are the top locations for the our protocols.\n\nDiversification on Cloud Providers\n\nAccording to ethernodes, on the Ethereum mainnet charts, more than half of the nodes surveyed are running on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing division of the giant online retailer, with over 65% of Ethereum third-party hosted nodes. There is no public data available for this metric on Polkadot validators so far.\n\nThere is no on-chain data available for these metrics on Solana either. A report by the Solana foundation published in 2022 shows the level of distribution by Autonomous System number (ASN). It is a network of servers with a single routing number, and Amazon Web Services accounts for 14% of hosted infrastructure, while Hetzner Online, a German company, has 20%.\n\nIn the case of the Avalanche blockchain, AWS supports almost 21% of the infrastructure deployed, but more than half of the network is diversified on independent providers. This makes it less dependent on centralized infrastructure by cloud providers.\n\nDecentralized vs Centralized Staking\n\nPool distribution can be seen as the concentration of ETH on different staking platforms, where Lido has over 25% of the pie, then Coinbase 11.5%, Kraken 7% and Binance 5.29%. If we sum the centralized staking services by exchanges amounts over 25% of total Ethereum staking.\n\nPolkadot is slightly different with nomination pools. This can be seen as points of centralized staking behavior, where currently only 64 of them represent a great part of the stake delegations.\n\nAccording to the Network Health Report 2022 by the Solana Foundation, 1,688, or 88% of its consensus-producing validators are run by independent entities. There is no public on-chain data for both Solana and Polkadot.\n\nFor AVAX staking we could find only the top 10 stake managers. Two infrastructure providers appeared to have a significant amount of 7M AVAX under control; this is almost 21% of the 34M AVAX under delegation.\n\nThe state of decentralization on Proof of Stake networks varies among different models and experiences. Ethereum, the largest and most well-known PoS network, has the lead in number of nodes and a relatively balanced distribution of token holders.\n\nPolkadot, Avalanche, and Solana are newer blockchains that are growing at a good clip. All three networks have a high percentage of staked tokens due to the size of their supply, yet their distribution of token holders and infrastructure is less balanced. Additionally, the extent to which staking is decentralized or centralized on these networks is not yet clear.\n\nWell-Balanced\n\nOverall, the four blockchains fail to have a well-balanced distribution of their infrastructure around the globe, even more noticeable in the large use of cloud providers such as AWS that are concentrated in North America and Europe.\n\nIt is clear that decentralization is an important factor, and there is still work to do on the matter. Participants, users, and builders must focus on making adjustments to ensure the resilience of these ecosystems.\n\nAlberto Guerrero Montilla is the head of growth at SenseiNode, and Pablo Larguia is the CEO of SenseiNode, a blockchain infrastructure provider in Latin America."

        "title": "Ethereum Instead of Bitcoin, says Marc Andreessen - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Marc Andreessen \u2013 founding partner of the tech-focused VC giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) \u2013 is now more bullish on Ethereum and Web 3 than he is on Bitcoin, contrary to his outlook in 2014.\n\nDuring an interview with ReasonTV published on Wednesday, the venture capitalist discussed the future of crypto adoption and regulation, alongside the role of Bitcoin as money.\n\nCrypto, Not Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Andreessen, crypto and Web3 represent \u201cthe other half of the internet,\u201d containing all of the functions people wanted the internet to have until now. This includes the ability to do business across the world on a financial layer of trust, in the form of blockchain technology.\n\nUsing that layer of trust, a host of financial assets can be represented: money, claims of ownership, house titles, car titles, assurance contracts, loans, internet art, and more.\n\n\u201cYou can build on top of the untrusted internet all of the capabilities you would need to have a full economy,\u201d Andreessen explained. \u201cThat\u2019s a giant idea \u2013 the potential there is extraordinarily high.\u201d\n\nSuch ideas aren\u2019t entirely new, coming from the entrepreneur. In a Washington Post article published in 2014, he predicted a new generation of the internet with wide-ranging applications forming on a platform of \u201cdistributed trust.\u201d At the time, he thought that specific platform would be Bitcoin \u2013 but now believes the premiere network has \u201cstalled out\u201d and \u201cstopped evolving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I wrote that thing today, I would either say its Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, or I would just say crypto or Web3 instead of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum currently has the most active fee marketplace, stemming from its active DeFi and NFT economy. It also has more active developers than Bitcoin, which BitMEX Research credits to its more flexible programming language and welcoming culture for use cases besides just money.\n\nIn a16z\u2019s 2022 State of Crypto Report, the firm outlined how certain web 3 platforms do a beet job of rewarding their creators that legacy web 2 giants like Facebook. Notably, the document contained no mention of the word \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\n\nThough unimpressed by Bitcoin\u2019s number of features, Andreessen believes Bitcoin can help increase economic freedom throughout the world as a form of money. Unlike some critics, he acknowledges that money can take various forms, so long as it\u2019s a tool used for trade.\n\nBanning Bitcoin, he added, is likely impossible. \u201cThe source code for it is available for free,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a government to ban Bitcoin, they\u2019re literally putting themselves in a position where they\u2019re banning math.\u201d\n\nCritics of A16z\n\nIn late 2021, Twitter co-founder and Bitcoin believer Jack Dorsey made an enemy of Andreessen, who blocked Dorsey on Twitter after being criticized for secretly owning the Web3 ecosystem. Dorsey has even mocked Web3 and its related VCs by launching his own decentralized identity application on Bitcoin, called \u201cWeb 5.\u201d\n\nA16z is one of the largest venture capital firms in crypto, pouring billions into token purchases \u2013 like Solana \u2013 and other forms of Web3 tech. Earlier this week, the crypto community expressed concern after the VC giant \u2013 which owns 4% of Uniswap\u2019s governance token, UNI \u2013 exerted its power to singlehandedly stonewall a new governance proposal."

        "content": "A survey of 81 nonfungible token (NFT) collections on the Ethereum blockchain showed a sharp overall loss in market capitalization in 2022, according to a report from DappRadar released Feb. 9. Losses were not evenly distributed, however.\n\nThe Ethereum NFT market was worth $9.3 billion at the beginning of 2022, according to DappRadar\u2019s valuation, and that figure dropped to $3.7 billion by year-end \u2014 a loss of 59.6%. The price of Ether (ETH) impacted the valuations:\n\n\u201cIt is also important to consider that ETH lost 60% of its value last year, which had a strong influence on the value of the NFTs.\u201d\n\nThe NFT market peaked in February 2022 at $19.1 billion, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether until the Terra collapse in May. By the following month, NFTs had lost 88% of their value. The market hit its year low at $2.2 billion at the end of November, the month of the FTX collapse. The market finished the year up 68% from that low. The report notes:\n\n\u201cThis retraction of the NFT market was not a reflection of NFT\u2019s utility, but rather a result of bad actors and market manipulations.\u201d\n\nYuga Labs accounted for two-thirds of the market in 2022, with its CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club collections holding 46.7% of the market by themselves. The Otherdeed collection was Yuga Labs\u2019 loss leader, falling 86.15%.\n\nRelated: Should Bored Ape buyers be legally entitled to refunds?\n\nThe Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and Degen Toonz collections were the only ones \u201claunched in 2021 or early 2022 to experience significant market cap growth,\u201d rising 113.89%, 260% and 204%, respectively.\n\nNFT collections launched after the Terra collapse fared better. The report cites Potatoz (+134.68%), Renga (+211.63%), DigiDaigaku (+209.88%) and God Hates NFTees (+1,653.28%) as examples.\n\nThe report also traced the declining share of collectibles in the NFT market share. Collectibles started 2022 with over 90% of the market but held well below 75% of it in January 2023. Trading volume for NFTs in January 2023 amounted to $870 million."

Discover SCENE\n\nAave Companies, the firm behind the eponymously-named lending and borrowing protocol, are launching its native stablecoin GHO on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.\n\nPronounced \u201cGO,\u201d the stablecoin is fully decentralized and over-collateralized. Its design ensures the GHO oracle price is always fixed one-to-one with the U.S. dollar, as minting will be through assets supplied as collateral in the Aave Protocol.\n\nAave is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that uses over-collateralization as a mechanism for ensuring the safety of deposited funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this system, borrowers must pledge more collateral than the amount they borrow, which acts as a security for the lender in case the borrower is unable to repay the loan.\n\nThis creates a capital-efficient way to mint stablecoins while maintaining over-collateralized backing by a diversified set of cryptocurrencies supplied by those who deposit on Aave.\n\nFounder and CEO of Aave Companies Stani Kulechov said, \u201cWith the support and management of the Aave community, GHO\u2019s decentralized stablecoin can power a payment layer that can easily, securely, and efficiently transfer value across DeFi and TradFi ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAave DAO takes over\n\nThe GHO codebase is now available on Github for developers to examine and test before its expected release on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHowever, the actual launch is dependent on the approval of the Aave DAO, the governing body of both the Aave Protocol and GHO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the stablecoin will be managed by the Aave DAO, anyone who holds AAVE, the platform\u2019s governance token, will have a voice in determining GHO\u2019s supply, interest rate, and risk parameters.\n\nThe Aave DAO will also be responsible for approving facilitators that can mint and burn GHO tokens. The Aave Companies recommended the Ethereum V3 market to be the first facilitator due to its extensive risk-mitigation features.\n\nUnlike other attempts at a decentralized stablecoin, the interest repaid by borrowers will go to the Aave DAO treasury rather than the asset suppliers\u2014as the asset suppliers are already earning interest on their supplied collateral.\n\nPer the press release, the stablecoin has already been audited by Open Zeppelin, SigmaPrime, and ABDK, and it is currently under audit by Certora. The code repository is also part of Aave\u2019s bug bounty program, rewarding those who find and report any vulnerabilities."

        "content": "Based on on-chain data, one mysterious crypto fund could be directly behind the recent Bitcoin, Ethereum, and digital asset rally.\n\nMysterious Fund Might Be Behind The Recent ETH Crypto Rally\n\nAccording to Lookonchain data streams, an unknown fund started strategizing its entry into crypto in early December 2022. Then, it was observed that they converted large chunks to USDC, a stablecoin, from its issuer, Circle.\n\nAfter that, the funds were converted to USDT, the world\u2019s most liquid stablecoin issued by Tether Holding, in five different addresses before being moved to exchanges.\n\n1/ A mysterious fund started pouring money into the crypto market ahead of this year's small #BullMarket. The fund started withdrawing $USDC from #Circle on Dec 7, 2022 and has over 10B $USDC as of today. Then exchanged for $USDT via 5 addresses, and deposited to exchanges. pic.twitter.com/n4UiVWSbHe \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 9, 2023\n\nSpecifically, on-chain data shows that whenever the fund minted USDC from Circle and converted to USDT before being moved to Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, the Ethereum (ETH) price began increasing.\n\nBased on this correlation, analysts are convinced that the \u201crise in cryptocurrency prices has something to do with this fund.\u201d\n\nAs of February 9, the mysterious crypto fund has $1 billion USDC.\n\nBy shifting huge sums of USDT to exchanges whose order books are open to the public, the fund could have triggered a pump in Ethereum prices. From late December 2022, Ethereum and crypto prices began recovering from the lows registered in 2022. ETH prices have increased roughly 40% from December 2022 lows.\n\nEthereum is trading at over $1,600. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin is above $22,000.\n\nThe improvement of asset valuation follows a price slump that saw BTC drop to as low as $15,300 at the height of the FTX-induced fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, months after 3AC, a crypto hedge fund, went under. Both events triggered a crash in the market.\n\nIs There A Case For Ethereum Demand?\n\nWhy the crypto fund prefers Ethereum is yet to be known. However, Ethereum has shifted to a proof of stake system and is thought to be more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin, which still uses a proof of work consensus algorithm system that is more energy intensive. There are arguments that by using a staking system, the smart contracting platform stands to attract more investors.\n\nEthereum also dominates as the home of DeFi and NFTs. DeFiLlama shows that DeFi protocols in the network manage over $28 billion of assets. Lido Finance, a liquidity staking provider, currently dominates, managing over $8.3 billion.\n\nThe block utilization rate in Ethereum is consistently above 95%, pointing to the high level of demand. By attracting activity, there is demand for ETH, which is used to pay for gas, leading to more coins being destroyed, making it more inflationary. Ultrasound Money on February 9 indicates that 70,547.33 ETH had been burnt in the last month.\n\nFeature image from Flickr, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, the bank\u2019s staking services are only available in the UK and select EEA (European Economic Area) markets.\n\nAccording to Revout, customers may receive up to 11.65% back in cryptocurrency rewards for particular tokens. However, based on the staked token, returns might differ and be subjected to change. Polkadot (DOT) currently has the highest return, while Cardano (ADA) offers the lowest yield at 2.79%, and at 3.88% and 4.59%, respectively, Ethereum (ETH) and Tezos (XTZ) are in the center.\n\nMore coins will be made available for staking by the bank. However, it did not specify which tokens or nations will be included next to expand the service.\n\nWill Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos staking attract new users?\n\nRevolut has more than 25 million customers globally and is one of Europe\u2019s most valued fintech companies. In addition, it received a $33 billion valuation in its most recent investment round in July 2021. Revolut has dramatically increased the number of digital assets it supports, offering more than 90 tokens today. In 2021, it also permitted the withdrawal of Bitcoin (BTC) to individual wallets.\n\nThe CEO of Revolut, Nikolay Storonsky, stated in November that while cryptocurrency made up 30% to 35% of the company\u2019s overall income in 2021, it accounted for only around 5% in 2020.\n\nNow staking has taken a hit over the past year. A majority of Ethereum stakers are currently at a loss. However, many expect the market to pick up steam once the global financial troubles are dealt with. Moreover, staking is a lucrative way to earn constant rewards when the market is right. Hence, Revolut could see an uptick in users, thanks to its new staking service.\n\nWith inflation slowing down in the U.S., interest rates are expected to cool over the year. Once inflation is controlled, an influx of funds into risky assets such as cryptocurrencies should be a reality."

        "title": "Gary Gensler hits Kraken with $30 million settlement, prompting outcry of \u2018regulation by enforcement\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had reached a settlement with Kraken, the California-based cryptocurrency exchange, related to a staking feature offered to the company\u2019s customers. Kraken agreed to pay a fine of $30 million and end the product in the U.S.\n\nAfter SEC Chair Gary Gensler threatened crypto companies that \u201cthe runway is getting shorter\u201d for firms to register with his agency, the latest action increases his influence over the industry by penalizing Kraken, one of the largest global crypto firms. The move will also likely further accusations that Gensler is taking an approach of \u201cregulation by enforcement,\u201d rather than creating new rules to govern the crypto ecosystem.\n\nStaking has emerged as a key element of the crypto ecosystem, with users locking up their crypto tokens as part of the blockchain data validation process and receiving new tokens as a reward. Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, moved to a \u201cproof of stake\u201d model in September.\n\nBecause of its complexity, many companies in the space like Kraken and its competitor Coinbase offer staking as a service, where customers can custody assets with the exchanges, which in turn pool the assets and stake them on the investors\u2019 behalf.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was investigating whether Kraken\u2019s staking services broke U.S. securities rules. Under a stipulation called the Howey Test from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, a transaction qualifies as a \u201csecurity\u201d if there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derives from the efforts of others.\n\nIn September, as Ethereum prepared to move to a \u201cproof of stake\u201d model, Gensler said that the updated blockchain validation system may pass the Howey Test. Thursday\u2019s SEC settlement is the first indication that the agency will begin to enforce staking services as securities.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection,\u201d Gensler said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs part of the settlement, Kraken has neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s allegations,\u201d said a Kraken spokesperson, pointing to a company blog post laying out the agreement.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s charges, along with Kraken\u2019s willingness to settle and end its staking program, will threaten a key offering of many crypto companies, as well as the Ethereum ecosystem. Prices for the decentralized Lido token, which is used for staking and could fall out of the SEC\u2019s remit, surged on the news.\n\nIn seeming anticipation of the announcement, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted on Wednesday that the SEC ending crypto staking for retail customers would be a terrible path for the U.S.\n\n\u201cRegulation by enforcement doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt encourages companies to operate offshore, which is what happened with FTX.\u201d\n\n1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 8, 2023\n\nAfter CoinDesk reported the settlement before it was officially announced, Kraken founder Jesse Powell took to Twitter to offer a clarification: Kraken would continue to offer staking outside of the U.S.\n\nWhile Kraken has largely adhered to regulation in an industry known for rogue companies, this is not the exchange\u2019s first brush with regulators. In November 2022, the company agreed to pay a fine to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control related to Iran sanctions violations.\n\nA Wyoming banking subsidiary of Kraken also has an open application with the Federal Reserve to receive a master account, which would provide it access to Fed payment services. After the Federal Reserve denied crypto bank Custodia\u2019s application to become a member in late January, the fate of Kraken\u2019s petition is in flux."

        "content": "Nine figures worth of Solana (SOL) are on the move following a massive crypto whale transfer between two unknown wallets as the Ethereum (ETH) rival secures a partnership with software giant Brave.\n\nFirst reported by blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, an unknown whale on the Solana blockchain transferred 7,981,517 SOL tokens worth $184,488,088 at the time of the transfer.\n\nThe transfer left the first Solana address virtually empty with only 0.002 SOL still sitting in the wallet.\n\nThe big whale move comes as Solana announces a partnership with Brave to bring Solana DApp (decentralized application) support on iOS and Android versions of the Brave browser. According to the announcement, Brave users can now connect to Solana DApps through Brave\u2019s built-in crypto wallet without leaving the browser.\n\nAmelia Daly, head of partnerships at Solana Foundation, said that the new integration is important because it gives users browser-based connections to Solana programs, optimized for mobile use.\n\n\u201cAdvances in UX and mobile are among the most important ways to onboard new users.\u201d\n\nBrave CEO and co-founder Brendan Eich says,\n\n\u201cBrave is increasingly the browser of choice for the Web3 world, and with the addition of Solana DApp support on mobile, we\u2019re expanding that reach to another key group that is seeking fast and friendly ways to use their crypto on the go.\u201d\n\nBrave first revealed a plan to integrate with Solana in late 2021 but held back on details.\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is up nearly 200% from its lows early last month, currently trading for $23.35.

        "content": "Kraken will end its crypto staking program in the US and pay $30 million in penalties as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator charged the company with selling unregistered securities through its \u201ccrypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\u201d It\u2019s been clear for a while now that the SEC was planning to clamp down on crypto yield programs. In 2021, it got into a spat with Coinbase over the exchange\u2019s plans to launch a lending feature in the US, and last year, it (and several states) settled with BlockFi for $100 million over the company\u2019s interest accounts.\n\nKraken will continue to offer staking outside the US via a separate subsidiary\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted concern about \u201crumors\u201d the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the US, claiming it\u2019s \u201cimportant innovation\u201d and \u201cnot a security\u201d \u2014 important since labeling it that way makes these businesses and potentially proof-of-stake blockchain operations like Ethereum 2.0 \u2014 subject to much stricter laws.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler appears to disagree, which could be bad news for others offering staking to customers in the US. This agreement should \u201cmake clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection,\u201d Gensler said in a press release.\n\nWhen news of the settlement broke via a report on CoinDesk at 2:30PM ET, the price of Ethereum dropped sharply, falling over 4 percent in 30 minutes.\n\nAccording to the SEC, Kraken took investors\u2019 crypto and put it into a staking pool with the hopes of earning rewards. (Those rewards are meted out for being part of the validation process used by some blockchains.) In return for having their crypto locked up, Kraken\u2019s customers would, in theory, earn interest on that crypto. But the regulator says that the returns Kraken promised were \u201cuntethered to any economic realities\u201d and that the exchange provided \u201czero insight into, among other things, its financial condition and whether it even had the means of paying the marketed returns in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe SEC also takes issue with the lack of consumer protections available for Kraken\u2019s staking service, saying that the exchange \u201cretained the right to pay them no returns at all.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted on its blog, Kraken says it\u2019ll continue offering its staking services outside the US. It also says that its clients in the US will automatically have their non-Ethereum crypto unstaked and that their Ethereum stakes will be removed as soon as possible."

        "title": "A Brief History of DeFi - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecentralized finance, often referred to as DeFi, is a movement in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces that can be difficult to pin down exactly. It is both a large-scale vision for a new way of conducting financial transactions\u2014free from intermediaries, central authorities, and done exclusively in a peer-to-peer modality\u2014as well as an umbrella term for scores of non-custodial financial products and services known as protocols.\n\nDeFi is inextricably linked to the rise of cryptocurrencies, but it is not solely about crypto tokens. Below, we take a closer look at the history of DeFi and how it got to where it is today.\n\n2015: Launch of Ethereum\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYes, one could point to the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 as the beginning of the DeFi movement. This is true insofar as Bitcoin was responsible for the rise of cryptocurrencies more broadly as an industry. Bitcoin popularized the idea of decentralized tokens and related services like exchanges. However, the Bitcoin ecosystem is not built to enable DeFi protocols. Those rely instead on Ethereum (which was of course also indebted to Bitcoin for its own existence).\n\nOne of the key developments of Ethereum was the use of smart contracts which allow developers to create a wide variety of decentralized apps, including those related to DeFi. To this day, most DeFi protocols exist in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNotably, the concepts of some of the most well-known DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, predate the launch of Ethereum. Maker is a lending protocol that allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies instantaneously, or to earn interest from lending out crypto tokens, and it also provides its own stablecoin. Maker was created in 2014, though it officially launched in 2017.\n\n2017: MakerDAO and Decentralized Exchanges\n\nBesides MakerDAO, a number of other popular DeFi protocols launched in 2017. Among them were some of the earliest decentralized exchanges, automated market makers that utilize liquidity pools to provide users access to trades with any ERC-20 token.\n\nEtherDelta was one of the first decentralized exchanges and a pioneer in allowing traders to exchange tokens without the use of a centralized authority. It remained significantly popular through the initial coin offerings of 2017 and beyond, but ran into difficulties when it suffered a major hack in 2017 and when its founder Zachary Coburn was charged with operating an unlicenced exchange in 2018.\n\n2017: ICOs\n\nSpeaking of ICOs, these offerings surged in popularity in 2017 and represent another step in the development of DeFi. ICOs allow non-institutional organizations and even individuals to participate in the funding of a new financial project. In this sense, they are a textbook example of the goals of DeFi. Again, Ethereum was key to the launch of many ICOs, as new token projects typically exchanged their crypto offerings for ETH. As with many popular and lucrative ventures in the cryptocurrency space, however, ICOs quickly began to draw bad actors and others searching for a quick payday without delivering much by way of useful tokens or developments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, the ICO era led to the launch of some DeFi protocols which remain popular to this day, including lending and borrowing system Aave and peer-to-peer asset exchange network 0x.\n\n2017 and beyond: Shift toward pooled funds\n\nAt the same time that the ICO craze took off, protocol developers began to adapt the peer-to-peer focus of the DeFi movement to one relying more on pooled funds. This might be thought of as a \u201cuser-to-contract\u201d approach, since users would no longer directly interact with other users but rather would engage with smart contracts themselves.\n\nOne of the most popular protocols to utilize this approach was Uniswap, which launched in 2018. It utilizes liquidity pools and automated market makers to facilitate the exchange of any ERC-20 token and to offer users an incentive reward by adding liquidity to the market for those tokens. Uniswap remains one of the major DeFi protocols today.\n\nCompound was another protocol to emerge in 2018 and which helped to build the lending protocol space. However, it could be argued that Compound became most influential for the broader DeFi movement only in 2020, as we\u2019ll see below.\n\n2020: Market crash\n\nEarly in the COVID pandemic in March 2020, the price of ETH crashed, plunging by about a third in just a day. The dramatic price volatility led to a rapid increase in gas fees and liquidations, which in turn led to shortfalls for Maker. Maker created and auctioned additional native tokens in response.\n\nDeFi saw some of its earliest stress tests with the start of the pandemic in 2020, as values plunged.\n\n2020: Rapid growth\n\nLater in 2020, a number of factors led to the rapid growth of the DeFi space. First, Compound launched COMP tokens mid-year, providing an additional incentive for users to borrow and lend through this system and helping to bring about the controversial but popular practice of yield farming, in which users rapidly borrow and lend different tokens in an effort to achieve the best yields.\n\nCOMP also allowed users the ability to participate in governance of the Compound protocol, further decentralizing authority and inspiring many subsequent protocols to adopt similar rules.\n\nOther crucial developments for DeFi in 2020 include the advent of Yearn, which switches between different DeFi lending protocols to achieve gains, and SushiSwap, which attempts to gain liquidity from other protocols by incentivizing providers of liquidity with its own native tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter 2020: Rising and falling\n\nSince 2020, new protocols have continued to launch, and the DeFi space has seen interest and values rise and fall along with the larger crypto industry. More and more DeFi protocols are launching on non-Ethereum blockchains, attempting to take advantage of improvements that have been made to the preexisting smart contracts format. While it remains to be seen how successful DeFi will be going forward, interest in this movement has climbed rapidly in just a few short years.\n\nCheat Sheet\n\nDeFi owes its existence to the launch of the Ethereum blockchain in 2015 and the rise of smart contracts.\n\nSome DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, were in development as early as 2014.\n\nDecentralized exchanges like EtherDelta emerged in 2017 alongside ICOs.\n\nCompound launched in 2018, setting the stage for new approaches to protocol governance and new incentive systems with the release of the COMP token in 2020.\n\nDeFi saw some of its earliest stress tests with the start of the pandemic in 2020, as values plunged.\n\nIn the last two to three years, new protocols have continued to launch, particularly on non-Ethereum blockchains."

Bitcoin and Ethereum, two leading digital assets of the cryptocurrency market, have always been the center of attraction for crypto traders. So, it\u2019s quite understandable when someone wants to choose between Bitcoin vs Ethereum for the long-term investment option.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum: Let\u2019s put their performance in perspective\n\nAre you looking to start your long-term crypto journey and curious about the future of bitcoin vs Ethereum? You are at the right place, here is a quick rundown of some of the biggest considerations regarding the investment outlook for each cryptocurrency.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin: BTC price eyeing $25K\n\nBitcoin price is currently valued at $22,953.15 and has a $24,117,660,098 24-hour trading volume. With a live market worth $442 billion, BTC has gained over 38% in the past four weeks.\n\nThe recent price surge might expose BTC to levels as high as $23,900 and $25,150 in the forthcoming months. Now, talking about whether Bitcoin is a good long-term investment or not. So, many crypto experts believe that for the next one to three years, BTC prices will be bullish and may touch new heights soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Holds Steady at $1.6k\n\nThe price of Ethereum in the last 24 hours was $1,633.93, with a trading volume of $6,700,985,956. On the upside, ETH is anticipated to face a bullish crossover that might expose ETH to $1,750. In the past 30 days, Ethereum has risen nearly to 36%.\n\nEthereum has remarkable long-term staying power in terms of utility and real-world use cases. From being the pioneer of the concept of smart contracts to an innovation leader when it comes to decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, Ethereum has shown its dominance in the world.\n\nBitcoin vs Ethereum: Conclusion\n\nBoth the leading cryptocurrencies have strong growth potential, but at the same time, they are extremely volatile. That means investing in cryptocurrencies for the long term involves carefully considering factors such as technology, adoption, regulation, market demand, and detailed research.\n\nAlso Read: First Golden Crossover Of 2023 Sets Bitcoin Price To Cross Above $40000"

        "content": "While Ethereum has been an attractive asset to whales given its potential, altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) have joined in on the whales\u2019 favorite tokens list. Earlier today, Whalestats, an account that monitors whales\u2019 transactions and discloses them, revealed that two blue whales were seen purchasing a massive amount of MATIC.\n\nPer the account, the whale reportedly bought 2,061,476 MATIC worth around $2.6 billion. The purchase had some notable impact on MATIC\u2019S price. Of the top ten cryptocurrencies with the largest market share, only MATIC gained the most in the last 24 hours.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Surges Nearly 20%\n\nSince the whale activity to the time of writing, MATIC has spiked in price by 4%, cumulating bullish momentum in the past seven days and recording a profit of nearly 20%. Among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, MATIC is still the only asset trending to the upside.\n\nNotably, the past few weeks have seen MATIC moving upward before the whales\u2019 intervention, especially since the beginning of the year. MATIC has moved from the $0.75 price tag seen late last year to $1.28 at the time of writing.\n\nThe Polygon token still ranks steadily as the tenth most valuable by market capitalization according to data aggregators \u2014 CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap. Polygon records a market cap of $11.5 billion, higher than Solana with $8.6 billion but below Dogecoin, which holds a $12.4 billion market cap.\n\nWhile the Polygon token has climbed multiple highs since the beginning of the year, it is still down 56% from its all-time high of $2.92, seen in December 2021. If the crypto market continues the current rally, MATIC and other altcoins could retake previously lost territory.\n\nMATIC Attracts Ethereum Investors\n\nWhaleStats\u2019 leadership board shows that the top 100 massive ETH holders hold roughly $100 million in MATIC. Other altcoins on the list include meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), with whales holding less than 700 million SHIB tokens. Over the past seven days, SHIB has surged by more than 16%, with a market cap of over $8.1 billion.\n\nSHIB currently outshines Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC), and Avalanche (AVAX) and holds the 12th position as the most significant crypto by market cap. SHIB\u2019s previous rally was not surprising for some traders following the development of the Layer 2 solution Shibarium which is expected to play a big part in the token\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nChiliz, the crypto startup behind fan token platform Socios, today launched its new layer-1 blockchain, shifting away from the current chain running on Ethereum.\n\nThe launch of Chiliz Chain 2.0 comes as the project marks its fifth anniversary, with a logo rebrand as another key aspect of the celebrations.\n\nChiliz Chain 2.0, which was launched on testnet in March last year, is a fork of the BNB Chain operating on a proof-of-stake authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism that supports shorter block time, lower fees, and less energy usage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain, Chiliz Chain 2.0 will still be compatible with Ethereum tooling though.\n\n\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c - celebrating our 5th anniversary with a new look! \ud83e\udd29 #NewProfilePic We are proud to share with the Chiliz community that the genesis block of our new EVM- compatible Layer 1 blockchain has been validated.#ChilizAnniversary \u26a1\ufe0f $CHZ pic.twitter.com/yEVhSoU1BN \u2014 Chiliz ($CHZ) - Powering Socios.com \u26a1 (@Chiliz) February 8, 2023\n\nThe new chain saw its genesis block validated today and will feature a system of 11 active validators.\n\nWeb3-native experience for fan communities\n\nWith the launch of Chiliz Chain 2.0, the project will also allow sports and entertainment brands as well as developers to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, or play-to-earn games.\n\nThe launch of @chiliz chain 2.0 will allow us to launch the initiative \"Fan Tokens Everywhere\" for 2023. Web3 wallets, Clubs in-app integration, Proof-of-Attendance (POAP), Ticketing integration, ... $CHZ x Fan Tokens. https://t.co/aVvafqQvnp pic.twitter.com/JK0afB3zj7 \u2014 Alexandre Dreyfus \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 (@alex_dreyfus) February 8, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother area where Chiliz sees the application of its technology is in-stadia engagement experiences, Web3-native ticketing and payments, as well as bringing the traditional fan experience of collecting memorabilia into the Web3 environment.\n\n\u201cIt was really important for us how we go from just being a token to a blockchain ecosystem. The Chiliz chain technically existed since 2019, except that it wasn\u2019t a cross-system. Now, as we are launching our \u2018Fan Token Everywhere\u2019 initiative, it\u2019s going to become more open,\" Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus told Decrypt. \"Until now fan tokens were mostly run by us as a utility provider, but with Chiliz Chain 2.0 third-party providers and developers will be able to add utility on top of us.\u201d\n\nThis way, according to Dreyfus, the utility of fan tokens will be increased significantly.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that when choosing Chiliz you already have access to APIs, the user base, and the massive network effect, and that\u2019s the value that Chiliz as a Web3 platform for sports and entertainment brings,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the company, in the coming months, it will announce up to ten enterprise-level projects that will utilize the Chiliz blockchain, ranging from NFT ticketing pilots, third-party athlete-focused fan tokens, and Web3 infrastructure partners.\n\nNews: To support the launch of the @chiliz layer-1 protocol, we will organize a Chiliz World Tour series of Hackathons in stadiums & sports arenas globally. This will help grow the dev community but also grow the exposure of Web3 x Sports in mainstream media. $CHZ pic.twitter.com/8XRWrPW5QI \u2014 Alexandre Dreyfus \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 (@alex_dreyfus) February 8, 2023\n\nChiliz native token CHZ will power the entire ecosystem, exactly the same way ETH runs on Ethereum, including all the decentralized applications (dApps) that will be built on top of the Chiliz blockchain. It\u2019ll be used to pay gas fees to deploy smart contracts and perform cross-chain operations, such as transferring token assets across Chiliz Chain 2.0 and Ethereum, while the token holders will also be able to receive rewards for securing the network via staking.\n\nTo boost the adoption of its blockchain, Chiliz is also organizing a series of global hackathons for developers that will be hosted across stadiums and sports arenas around the world throughout 2023 and 2024.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Cardano News: Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong\u2019s recent comment over banning crypto staking has taken the digital asset market by storm. The recovering crypto market went on to register a sharp decline. However, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson has a problem with the Ethereum staking.\n\nIs Cardano founder going against staking?\n\nCardano Founder in a statement stated that Ethereum Staking is problematic. He said that giving your asset to someone else in order to get a return looks like a regulated product. Hoskinson mentioned that slashing and bonds are not so good while noncustodial liquid staking, on the other hand, is like the mining pools which have been used for around 13 years.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe added that there has been discussion over what makes sense for sustainability. This included proof of stake protocol that promotes control by the many instead of the few. While it also creates a large decentralized environment.\n\nMeanwhile, locking funds and then encouraging centralization with poor protocol design directly impacts the crypto industry. All proof of stakes protocol might get lumped just because of fundamental misunderstandings around operation and design. Read More Cardano News Here\u2026\n\nHowever, this is not the first time that the ADA founder has made such comments about a crypto project or watchdog\u2019s activity.\n\nSEC to ban crypto staking?\n\nBrian Armstrong stated that they have got some inside news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to get rid of crypto staking. He called it a terrible decision if this happens.\n\nHe believes that staking is a very crucial innovation in the digital asset market. This has allowed customers to jump directly into open networks. However, staking is bringing in positive improvements to the crypto space which includes scalability with increased security. While it reduces carbon footprints."

        "content": "Buzz around Bitcoin-based NFTs\u2014via the recently-launched Ordinals protocol\u2014keeps growing by the day, with record-setting mints on Thursday and high-value sales over the past day. And one established Ethereum NFT collection is reaping the benefits of going multi-chain, seeing its prices surge after revealing Bitcoin-based counterparts.\n\nOnChain Monkey, a collection of 10,000 Ethereum NFT profile pictures (PFPs) minted in 2021, used Ordinals to \u201cinscribe\u201d all of its existing artwork on Bitcoin over the past day. Now the NFT holders on Ethereum can also say that their respective collectibles live on Bitcoin, as well.\n\nPrices for the Ethereum NFTs have almost tripled since the announcement, with the floor price\u2014that is, the cheapest listed NFT on a marketplace\u2014for the project jumping from 0.79 ETH at the start of the day (per NFT Price Floor) to a peak of 1.75 ETH before settling to about 1.5 ETH (nearly $2,500) as of this writing.\n\nOnChainMonkey is the first 10K collection to be inscribed on Bitcoin via Ordinals!

The analytics platform reports about $1.1 million in sales over the past day for a project with lifetime secondary sales totaling almost $39 million.\n\nMetagood, the startup behind OnChain Monkey, said it put all 10,000 NFTs onto Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol using a single transaction, much as it did for the original Ethereum collection back in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Hottest Bitcoin NFTs Right Now Are CryptoPunks Clones\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces today, Metagood co-founder Danny Yang said that enabling trading was the next step for the team but suggested that other tooling needs to be created around Ordinals to facilitate that feature. He also noted that Metagood plans to build a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin to let NFT holders switch between the two versions.\n\n\u201cThey are the same on both chains,\u201d an OnChain Monkey Discord moderator wrote earlier today. \u201cBuy on ETH and you will have access to the BTC version when the tools catch up.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s Discord server is filling up with users who claim to have purchased one of the Ethereum NFTs following the Bitcoin announcement and are asking for details on how it will work.\n\nOnChain Monkey is part of Metagood\u2019s push to use Web3 initiatives to fund programs that benefit communities. These include efforts to fund coral restoration and provide aid to Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. Metagood, co-founded by venture capitalist Bill Tai alongside Yang and Amanda Terry, raised $5 million in December.\n\nMetagood says that it minted the first 10,000 NFT project on Ordinals\u2014a claim that the creators of Bitcoin Punks, a clone of popular Ethereum project CryptoPunks, have also made.\n\nBitcoin Punks began inscribing its NFTs via Ordinals before OnChain Monkey, but opted to put each Punk as a separate inscription\u2014a process that stretched from Wednesday into Thursday. OnChain Monkey, on the other hand, committed its entire collection to Ordinals via a single transaction late Wednesday.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify when OnChain Monkey and Bitcoin Punks were inscribed via Ordinals."

The biggest NFT sale on the Solana blockchain was the $85K USD purchase of BOOGLE #021 on January 14th, 2023.\n\nSimilarly to Cardano, Solana recorded a 6.93% decrease in transaction volumes.\n\nConsidering these statistics, the Ethereum ecosystem has enjoyed a greater increase in sales and transaction volumes compared to other prominent blockchains. The segmented success of the NFT sector risks limiting its long-term prospects."

        "content": "Su Zhu, one of the co-founders of the failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) on Thursday, confirmed on Twitter the news of the launch of Open Exchange (OPNX), whose offerings scope entails trapped user crypto funds. The disgraced crypto-preneur added in the post accompanying the official announcement from the platform that the waitlist is currently open, giving access to an avenue for claims trading and derivatives. The newly unveiled exchange will use the FLEX token to realize its tokenomics model. Zhu said plans to build the platform arose following consultation with creditors and other key figures, including Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb, who endorsed the idea.\n\n3AC execs launch crypto claims exchange as LocalBitcoins winds down operations\n\nThe OPNX platform \u2013 the first public marketplace for crypto claims \u2013 is backed by Kyle Davies, the other co-founder of Singapore-based 3AC, which declared bankruptcy last year. As reported earlier, the trio previously sought to raise as much as $25 million to launch a new exchange dubbed GTX, targeting the crypto claims market estimated to be worth over $20 billion. The idea drew heavy backlash from the crypto community, who expressed their disapproval of the move.\n\nIn other exchange news today, Finland-based Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins notified users that it is shutting down after a decade of facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. The exchange cited the harsh conditions bred by the bear market as the reason for halting services after a ten-year run which the team behind said it was proud to have been in operation. Though it primarily focused on Bitcoin in its initial days, the platform started introducing support for other alts in 2021. Along with the closure announcement, the company shared a timeline for the progressive suspension of exchange activities, with trading being halted by Feb 16. Users will still be allowed to withdraw their assets after the date until February 2024.\n\nThe P2P trading platform's shutdown is the latest blow to the crypto sector on the back of mounting regulatory pressure in several jurisdictions around the world.\n\nBinance suspends USD withdrawals and deposits via banks\n\nEarlier this week, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, notified users that it had paused all deposits and withdrawals in USD via bank transfers. The crypto exchange said it is working to reinstate the feature as soon as possible. The pause doesn't affect alternative funding methods, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, credit cards, and bank transfers in other fiat currencies such as Euros. The Binance.US team separately confirmed that its customers remained unaffected by the interruption of dollar withdrawals and deposits.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao said via Twitter that only a small section of Binance customers, the 0.01% of monthly active users who leverage the cash transfer option, were impacted. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that this situation presented a bad experience. Zhao noted that while some banks are stepping back from supporting crypto, others are entering the market, insisting on the need to continue developing for the long term, despite the setbacks from last year's events.\n\nSignature Bank is retreating from the crypto scene\n\nThe dicey landscape ensuing the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange compelled Signature Bank to reduce its crypto exposure and shed off as much as $10 billion in customer deposits. Banking groups have lately been hesitant to conduct business with crypto firms amid warnings from regulators who pledged to monitor institutions that choose to work with these firms. Market regulatory bodies have especially shown keenness to prevent any potential risks posed by crypto from affecting the traditional banking system. The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have all warned of significant risks in engaging with crypto.\n\nCoinbase CEO remarks rekindle staking conversation as a means of preserving innovation\n\nIn a lengthy post shared on Twitter late Wednesday, Coinbase exchange CEO Brian Armstrong expressed concerns about the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to scrap crypto staking to retailers. Armstrong went into detail on how a \u2018rumored' move to abolish centralized Ethereum staking providers would stifle innovation, adding that the current approach to regulation is flawed. Ethereum staking has been a trending subject in the lead-up to the Shanghai upgrade, with liquid staking tokens like Lido benefiting the most from the narrative.\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson also offered his views on the matter, specifically describing Ethereum staking as \u2018problematic'.\n\n\u201d Temporarily giving up your assets to someone else to have them get a return looks a lot like regulated products [\u2026] It's sad that all proof of stake protocols might get lumped together due to a fundamental misunderstanding about the actual facts of operation and design. It's like comparing three-mile Island to a modern 4th generation nuclear reactor because they both use the word fission,\u201c the Cardano founder wrote.\n\nHoskinson's response came as no surprise, given the mathematician and programmer has a track record of taking jabs at Ethereum. Following the Merge completion, which saw the mainnet switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Hoskinson said that Ethereum shouldn't be viewed as the \u2018standard' PoS blockchain ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about the two networks, check out our Ethereum vs. Cardano guide\n\nCoinbase NFT pauses artist drops to focus on other areas within the project\n\nLast week in a separate development, the NFT marketplace of Coinbase exchange shared an update notifying artists it has halted drops. Coinbase NFT shared in a clarification tweet that it was pausing new drops by artists on the platform. The platform denied claims that it was shutting down following news first flagged by Jessica Yatrofsky, a then Coinbase Partner who said she had received communication from the platform to indicate she could no longer release her XX GEN project.\n\nResponding to the alert, Coinbase NFT said it was refocusing efforts on other areas within its project and not closing shop entirely. While NFT trading has taken a hit over the past several months, the Coinbase NFT marketplace has particularly been dry. From more than 1,000 daily NFT sales during the peak days of June and nearly 600 daily unique users, Coinbase NFT now averages less than 20 NFT sales each day, and the number of unique buyers has not been more than 50 on any day this year.\n\nWeTransfer stages foray into NFT space following a partnership with Minima\n\nIn other NFT news, File hosting giant WeTransfer conveyed this week that it has delved into Web3 in an announcement also revealing a partnership with layer one blockchain platform Minima to introduce NFTs to its digital file-sharing network. This collaboration will allow users to mint digital collectibles directly from their mobile devices as Minima's blockchain peer-to-peer network is optimized for mobile use \u2013 a Minima node can run autonomously in the background. With the offering currently in its testnet phase, the NFT capabilities will be available in 180 countries when it launches next month.\n\nTesting the potential of NFTs\n\nMinima utilizes its native Minima token for peer-to-peer transfers on its lightweight layer one platform without the need for intermediaries. The partnership with the freemium model file-sharing platform will enable consumers to share digital assets and earn revenue in a more streamlined manner. The collaboration also aims to demonstrate the potential of NFT technology and its practical use within the crypto industry and other digital applications.\n\nMinima CEO Hugo Feiler termed the collaboration as one that gives the layer one chain an immediate presence in the digital art industry, attracting NFT artists who can earn royalties from selling their digital artwork. Feiler added that the partnership aims to support the growth and progression of creativity in a digital era increasingly focused on ensuring individuals maintain ownership and control over their creations.\n\nFeiler contends the partnership will also serve as a pilot to exhibit the viability of widespread adoption of NFT technology. WeTransfer now joins the ranks of other hosting providers like Google and AWS in powering blockchain-based operations on the cloud. The platform facilitates the transfer of large files, and recipients do not necessarily need an account to access the document. This likely means the platform is set up with the necessary infrastructure to seamlessly integrate to offer users the privacy they expect from blockchain technology.\n\nRevolut Bank customers can now stake Ether and ADA in their crypto wallets\n\nConcerns around staking in the US have made the subject a heated debate. It doesn't help that financial institutions in the US, like BankProv and Signature Bank, have been taking measures geared towards reducing their exposure to crypto. Meanwhile, Revolut Bank wants to give its European customers enhanced utilities for their crypto assets. The neo-banking platform, which gained full approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer crypto services last September, has announced plans to empower its customers in the country and the European Economic Area with the ability to stake their crypto.\n\nCustomers could earn yields as high as 11.65% or as low as 2.99%, but the rewards are not guaranteed. The official announcement further detailed that the digital bank would support the locking of crypto in wallets for specific assets, including Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano, and Tezos, with the minimum staking period varying per token. The staking functionality will debut this week in an initial soft testing phase, a rollout that will enable Revolut app users to earn passive income from their crypto holdings.\n\nTo learn more about Polkadot or Tezos, check out our Investing in Polkadot and Investing in Tezos guides.\n\nDeeper into crypto\n\nCrypto General Manager at Revolut Emil Urmanshin explained that staking is a crucial first step in the bank's 2023 roadmap, explaining that it means enhanced usability of users' crypto assets beyond just support for deposit and withdrawal transactions. Revolut's adoption of crypto has been a gradual evolution, starting with the introduction of trading capabilities for its user base in November 2017 \u2013 it has since provided trading services for nearly 100 various crypto tokens and assets.\n\nLater in 2021, the London-based fintech firm started allowing customers to transfer their crypto assets to external wallets and platforms. Since October last year, they have been able to spend their crypto using their Revolut debit cards. To further support its user base, Revolut has been running an educational program focused on the fundamental principles of blockchain and cryptocurrencies and incentivized by free crypto. The program rolled out in July 2022 and received a remarkable response, with over a million users completing the course in its inaugural month."

        "content": "Investors in cryptocurrencies are attempting to predict the timing of the next cryptocurrency boom, after a turbulent 2022. Lots of investors can fondly remember the era considered the best cryptocurrency era of all time, when Bitcoin reached an all-time high. November 2021 won\u2019t be forgotten in a hurry, as Bitcoin traded at around $68,000. At the time of writing, the price of BTC now stands a little over $22,000.\n\nBe that as it may, it was anticipated that Bitcoin would continue to fluctuate, trade within a range, and be susceptible to macroeconomic factors like rising interest rates. Another school of thought believes however, that, going by how cryptocurrency has shown promise at the start of the year, 2023 could be the time for that much anticipated \u2018bullish run\u2019.\n\nBitcoin: Will The \u2018Bull\u2019 Run Yet Again?\n\nSince the 2021 cryptocurrency boom that saw Bitcoin selling around $68,000, BTC investors have been waiting for another bull run that will see the cryptocurrency selling for a fee that high. Bitcoin has seen a modest increase at the start of the year; however, according to experts, the price of Bitcoin may have bottomed out and is unlikely to retest its all-time high of little less than $69,000.\n\nAccording to Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, Bitcoin is likely to trade in a range, between $15,000 and $20,000 on the low end and $25,000 to $30,000 on the high end. She claimed that while much of the \u201cforced selling\u201d that occurred in 2022 as a result of market falls has ended, little fresh capital is still entering the Bitcoin market.\n\nEthereum: Still Banking On The Merge?\n\nThe Merge, the cryptocurrency\u2019s eagerly awaited switch from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain, was meant to be the catalyst that would send Ethereum\u2019s price soaring in the year. The Merge technically proceeded as expected, but from an investing standpoint, it didn\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll never really know what might have been because the crypto exchange FTX (FTT -0.18%) crashed around two months after The Merge happened. However, we do know what actually occurred: since September 15, when The Merge took place, Ethereum has decreased by around 25%.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Making History At Presale\n\nThe most talked about cryptocurrency, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has taken another giant step towards going live. The meme coin has now raised a staggering USD 23.71 million in presale and is closer to launch than ever before.\n\nDue to popular demand, BIG has now extended its 200% bonus offer date, until Monday the 20th of January, 2023.

Meanwhile, LongDuck, who previously owned the domain, bought it for 0.043 ETH. At press time, the value of the asset was close to $10,000 when compared to the market price of Ethereum.\n\nFollowing the sale, ENS\u2019 collection volume rose 46% in the last 24 hours. Although the major sale may have played a role, the spike meant that there were other assets traded under the collection. This helped ENS remain top of the domain sales standings despite a 335% volume increase from another collection.\n\nThis sale also strengthened the impact ChatGPT has had on the crypto space. For example, tokens, Fetch. Ai [FET] and SingularityNET [AGIX] have recorded tremendous value increases since the AI tool gained widespread popularity.\n\nAt one point, ENS gathered so much registration that it recorded an extra one million domains in less than two months.\n\nHowever, this was in the third quarter (Q3) of 2022. But since then, the domain attention has only been Month-on-Month (MoM), according to Dune Analytics. At the time of writing, the domain registration count for February was 10,248.\n\nBut there is a chance that it could edge closer to the ones in December 2022 and January 2023, which was a slight difference.\n\nENS price rises as ChatGPT is one step ahead\n\nFurther, CoinMarketCap data revealed that ENS\u2019 token price picked up a 2.15% increase in the last 24 hours. The trading volume within the same period also increased by 20.26%. A simplification of the hike more tokens has been transacted than the day before, regardless of profit or loss accrued.\n\nInterestingly, it was possible that the crypto ecosystem would continue to see the effect of the increased AI adoption. This was due to the actions taken by Microsoft.\n\nRead Ethereum Name Service\u2019s [ENS] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nA few days back, the company invested in OpenAI, the firm who invented the ChatGPT tool. However, the technology firm went a step further by adding the tool to its search engine Bing.\n\nHence, this significant sale could propel a hike in ENS regulations provided the crypt community is interested."

        "content": "Five years from its inception, fan token platform Chiliz has launched its own layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain ecosystem to support its growth.\n\nChiliz\u2019s fan token ecosystem has long been powered by Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, but the validation of the Chiliz 2.0 blockchain genesis block sees the ecosystem shift to its own layer 1.\n\nThe new blockchain uses a system of 11 active validators with proof-of-stake authority consensus, which is touted to provide faster block times, lower fees and energy usage.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s documentation, Chiliz Chain 2.0 is a hard fork of BNB Chain, a go-to Ethereum fork. This means that the new layer-1 is EVM compatible, which is aimed to attract decentralized application developers to build within the environment.\n\nChiliz has made waves in the sports and entertainment space through its fan token app, Socios. The platform works with some of the biggest teams and brands in the sporting world, with major football teams like Barcelona, PSG, Manchester City, Arsenal and Juventus making use of its fan token platform.\n\nRelated: Socios boss\u2019 goal? To knock crypto out of the park\n\nThe platform allows brands, teams and individuals to mint nonfungible tokens (NFTs), fan tokens and Web3-ready tickets, as well as develop DApps and Web3-based experiences and products.\n\nCointelegraph spoke to Socios CEO Alexandre Dreyfus back in November 2022 at Web Summit in Lisbon about the upcoming launch of the Chiliz \u20182.0\u2019 Blockchain. As he explained back then, the Chiliz chain already existed but was deliberately kept as a private ecosystem to protect intellectual property. At the time of that conversation, it had over 1.7 million wallets that participated in the issuance, minting and trading of fan tokens.\n\nDreyfus also pointed out the importance of Ethereum in providing the basis of its current ecosystem in correspondence on Feb. 9, highlighting both iterations of the Chiliz blockchain being forks of Ethereum:\n\n\u201cWe use the technology as a foundation, but we adjust it and enhance it for our needs, which is the protection of the IP and the sports property we are working with.\u201d\n\nThe launch of Chiliz 2.0 marks the transition to a \u201creal open layer 1,\u201c Dreyfus told Cointelegraph, with on-chain governance holding the power to whitelist certain nodes and developers to issue assets.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean? It means that you cannot have a fake NFT, a fake fan token or whatever.\u201d\n\nThe CEO said that a patient approach, which allowed brands and franchises to maintain control of their image and property rights, was an important factor in the growth of its ecosystem over the past five years. The launch of the Chiliz blockchain is also aimed at handing back value to ecosystem participants:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chain where mainly sports brands are going to govern, let\u2019s say Barcelona or PSG, are going to become a node and stake their CHZ to get rewards and participate in the growth of the network.\u201d\n\nThe sports industry continues to see synergies with blockchain-based firms. In January 2023, blockchain fantasy sports firm Sorare sealed a deal with the English Premier League to mint Ethereum-based digital player cards on its platform."

        "content": "Summary:\n\nThe blockchain-powered sports fan token launched its own layer 1 decentralized network on Tuesday.\n\nChiliz\u2019s L1 chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine program, allowing developers to broadcast smart contract codes on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s token CHZ pumped as high as 20% on the news.\n\nBlockchain sports coin Chiliz announced the launch of its brand new layer 1 decentralized chain aimed at driving growth around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and on-chain gaming tied to reach world sports franchises.\n\nA blog post released on Tuesday noted that Chiliz validated the genesis block of its blockchain to mark the company\u2019s fifth (5th) anniversary. The new chain functions as a layer 1 network using Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus. There are currently 11 validators on the blockchain and they are all allowed to deploy smart contracts on the network.\n\nAlso, the PoSA blockchain from Chiliz supports a popular program known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM. EVM acts as a run-time development area that allows on-chain builders to design decentralized applications (dapps) and launch these dapps on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain as smart contracts.\n\nThis means that CHZ developers will able to build and run dapps on Ethereum since the Chiliz blockchain is EVM-compatible. The CHZ token will power interaction on the blockchain and provider holders with staking rewards via the Socios platform, the blog post said.\n\nChiliz native token $CHZ will be the fuel for the entire Chiliz Blockchain ecosystem, including all the dApps that will be built on top of it. $CHZ token holders will also be able to receive rewards for staking (delegating) on the network.\n\nChiliz Token Pumps On L1 Blockchain Announcement\n\nThe CHZ token which will reportedly fuel the new blockchain, soared as high as 20% following the announcement. CHZ traded around $0.1656 per data from TradingView.\n\nCHZ\u2019s market cap was over $1.1 billion when this report was written. The Chiliz token also had a daily trading volume above $683 million across available markets.\n\nSince launching in 2018, the blockchain-based company has sought to bridge the gap between on-chain technology and sports fan interaction. The CHZ token allows sports fans to hold assets linked to real-world teams across sports industries like the major European football leagues in Spain, France, and Italy to name a few.\n\nAs part of its latest rebrand and new blockchain, Chiliz will onboard as many as 10 start-ups. These entities will head ventures like NFT ticketing, Watch2Earn sports events, and Play2Earn games."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin NFTs are the talk of the Web3 world right now, thanks to a new way to \u201cmint\u201d media and assets on the layer-1 blockchain through the Ordinals project. And, as with many past NFT network launches, cloned versions of Ethereum\u2019s early and influential CryptoPunks are dominating the early buzz around Ordinals.\n\nCryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs in 2017, is a seminal NFT project that set the template for the modern profile picture (PFP) trend. The 10,000 Ethereum assets were initially released via a free mint, well before there was a thriving NFT market, but have gone on to generate almost $2.5 billion worth of trading volume in the years since.\n\nOrdinals just launched on the Bitcoin blockchain in late January, but there are already multiple CryptoPunks-inspired projects gaining steam on the platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most prominent so far is Ordinal Punks, which spans 100-pixel avatars that have been \u201cinscribed\u201d on Bitcoin through the Ordinals project and can be traded. Unlike some Punks clones seen in the past, however, they're not direct clones of the original CryptoPunks collection.\n\nSome on Crypto Twitter believe that Ordinal Punks is based on a derivative Ethereum collection called Mutant Punks\u2014in other words, a derivative of a derivative. However, a person connected to the project clarified to Decrypt that Ordinal Punks \"used an open-source algorithm and CC0 Punk sprite sheet to generate new Punks.\"\n\nOne Ordinal Punk sold for 9.5 BTC late Wednesday, or nearly $215,000. While that\u2019s about double the entry-level price for a real CryptoPunk\u2014about 64 ETH right now, or nearly $106,000\u2014that particular Ordinal Punk is based on the very rare alien CryptoPunks, which have sold for as much as nearly $24 million worth of ETH in the past.\n\n12 years ago I was mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC in my parent's basement. Today, we just minted out the first 10k NFT collection on Bitcoin. Thanks to everyone, but most importantly the @cryptopunksnfts. \u2764\ufe0f@Bitcoin_Punks_ + https://t.co/3O4wIo0OYC pic.twitter.com/BV0a6KmrWj \u2014 Robert Clarke (@robertjfclarke) February 9, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn another example, pseudonymous NFT collector and investor dingaling tweeted that he purchased a bundle of seven Ordinal Punks for 15.2 BTC on Wednesday\u2014about $349,000 worth at the time.\n\nHowever, because Ordinals just launched and they function differently than typical NFTs on other platforms (like Ethereum and Solana), there isn\u2019t much infrastructure to support buying and selling the assets once they\u2019ve been described. In other words, there aren\u2019t Bitcoin NFT marketplaces for Ordinals just yet.\n\nIn fact, such trades are currently taking place over the counter (OTC) directly between users or through escrow services, with asking prices and bids being tracked via online spreadsheets. It\u2019s all being facilitated through Twitter and Discord as collectors vie for these Punk clones, as some expect these early Bitcoin \u201cinscriptions\u201d to prove more and more valuable over time.\n\nnew opensea competitor lookin sharp pic.twitter.com/pJH0fuRnYm \u2014 113 \u2656\u2656\u2656 (@0x113d) February 8, 2023\n\n\u201cThere's [a] real moment behind Ordinals and things are still very very early. There are opportunities everywhere,\u201d dingaling tweeted. \u201cOrderbooks are currently updated on shared spreadsheets and sales are only done via OTC/escrow. But there's lots of building being done behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nHowever, the lack of infrastructure means that the current trading model is susceptible to scams, and some Crypto Twitter users have raised the alarm. One viral thread from pseudonymous NFT collector TheNorwegian called out various perceived issues with the collection, and asked whether it's the \"biggest NFT scam of all time.\"\n\nAnother notable Ordinals project is Bitcoin Punks, which puts replicas of all 10,000 original CryptoPunks on Bitcoin. It\u2019s billed as the first 10,000-piece NFT project launched through Ordinals, and all of the assets have already been minted for free by collectors.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how much trading demand there is for the larger Bitcoin Punks collection at this point, however, and a moderator on the project\u2019s official Discord server warned holders today to \u201cbe careful trading\u201d before a code audit can be completed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrdinals use has surged over the last few days, with data platform Dune showing over 17,000 mints on the platform already today\u2014double yesterday\u2019s total, continuing a trend that has exploded over the last week-plus. More than 39,000 assets have now been inscribed as Ordinals, including other knockoffs and a playable clone of the classic video game Doom.\n\nHowever, the project has proven controversial with some Bitcoin maximalists and enthusiasts, some of whom have argued that it\u2019s a waste of network space or that it goes against Bitcoin\u2019s original focus on financial assets. Bitcoin transaction fees have surged over the last week and a half since Ordinals started gaining steam.\n\nCryptoPunks clones are common on NFT protocols that have emerged after Ethereum, and you can find them all over the place\u2014on Solana, Polygon, Cardano, Algorand, and even Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d network built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the origins of the Ordinal Punks designs."

        "title": "How to Setup RPC on Metamask \u2013 Easy Guide - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Metamask is one of the well-known decentralized wallets. It allows users to easily store tokens, NFTs, and other DeFi belongings. Everyone can easily download the app or extension, create an account, and start using it. However, there are ways to make your Metamask a little bit better, faster, and more reliable. That\u2019s why in this article, we\u2019re going to go over the basics, then look into how to setup RPC on Metamask.\n\nWhat is a Metamask?\n\nMETAMASK is a mobile app and browser extension that lets users connect their wallets to decentralized apps (DApps). There are several DEXs available, including Aave, OpenSea, and Kava. You would need to be able to communicate with their protocols in order to access those DEXs. To do so, you simply connect to the network which the DEXs are utilizing using Metamask. This is technically your gateway into the Web3.0 space.\n\nIs METAMASK a wallet?\n\nTechnically yes, METAMASK has two functions, the first being a bridge to decentralized apps (smart-contracts friendly), and the second, being a decentralized wallet. So yes, you can say that Metamask is a Wallet that allows you to:\n\nSend Tokens\n\nReceive Tokens\n\nStore NFTs\n\nLogin to DApps privately\n\nStake Tokens\n\nAre METAMASK wallets SAFE?\n\nTotally! Think about it this way\u2026Blockchain is a technology that takes pride in both anonymity and security. Blockchain technology has so far been regarded as very safe that major companies have chosen to adopt it internally. If Amazon Managed Blockchain is now supporting the Ethereum blockchain, why wouldn\u2019t YOU, mister secure dude? Just make sure to keep your seed phrase in a safe place, and beware of phishing scams.\n\nWhy is Metamask Slow?\n\nIn order to understand why Metamask might feel slow, it is crucial to understand what nodes are.\n\nWhat are Nodes in Blockchain?\n\nWhen Metamask connects to a blockchain, it basically connects to a node on that blockchain. It does so to read and write information based on your activities. Usually, Metamask connects to a default node provider which all Metamask users share. This allows users to easily start using Metamask on the go without the hassle of connecting to any node.\n\nHowever, this is not a perfect solution, as the default node might become overcrowded with requests. That\u2019s why transaction processing becomes slower, users might see irregular block data, and worse, the default node might shut down unexpectedly.\n\nWhat is RPC Metamask?\n\nA Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a way to communicate with other servers remotely. It provides the ability to run programs in a separate location. For Metamask, RPCs allow users to access a server node on a specified network. When you first create an account, you will be linked to a specific blockchain (ex. Ethereum blockchain) through a default RPC.\n\nIf you want to enhance your Metamask experience, you might want to add a custom RPC to your Metamask. This will detach you from the \u201coverloaded\u201d node which all default users are using and plug you into another \u201cless-busy\u201d node.\n\nDefault node for Ethereum on Metamask\n\nWhat are Ethereum Layer 2s?\n\nAn Ethereum layer 2 is a different network that works with the Ethereum network (mainnet) and are sidechains to it. There are many different variants to those L2 networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Loopring, and Immutable X.\n\nLayer 2 solutions carry the weight off the main chain by processing data that will cause it to experience issues. A typical example is carrying out transactions away from the main chain. Doing this paves the way for the main blockchain to be able to carry out a massive number of transactions. Asides from that, the security of the solutions is always optimum in the sense that the same security covers it as the main chain. This is mainly because the solution is always built on top of the main blockchain. They are also regarded as off-chains.\n\nHow to setup RPC on Metamask?\n\nIn order to choose a different node, you need to first decide which network you want to go for. In this example, we\u2019ll choose to use the Polygon PoS mainnet.\n\nFirst, go to the official website on Polygon. In their official documentation, they\u2019ll provide you with all the details which you\u2019ll need to fill in. Same thing goes out to other networks.\n\nSecond, you\u2019ll go to your Metamask wallet and click on \u201cAdd Network\u201d from the Mainnets dropdown.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be redirected to the \u201cAdd a Network\u201d page. From there, you\u2019ll need 5 important infos which you\u2019ll copy/paste from the official documentation we saw previously:\n\nNetwork Name : Polygon\n\n: Polygon New RPC URL (Node endpoint): wss://rpc-mainnet.matic.network/\n\nwss://rpc-mainnet.matic.network/ Chain ID (chainId): 137\n\n137 Currency Symbol (Gas Token) : MATIC\n\n: MATIC Block Explorer URL (Block explorer): https://polygonscan.com/\n\nOnce done, click on the \u201csave\u201d button. The new network will be added to your Metamask, and you\u2019ll be able to select this new network from the networks dropdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Blockchain Companies"

        "title": "Proof-of-Stake VS Proof-of-Work - Which Crypto Giant Out Of Ethereum and Bitcoin Hosts The Better Consensus? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The consensus a cryptocurrency uses determines how transactions are formed on the blockchain. If a cryptocurrency uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, transactions are confirmed by trusted validators on the network. However, for Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, the crypto miner has to generate a target hash that is less than or equal to that of the block. Miners use devices that generate computations quickly to achieve this.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the blockchain industry pioneer, utilizes the PoW consensus. However, Ethereum (ETH), the altcoin leader, has recently switched to a PoS consensus. Each mode of consensus has its merits and its downfalls, and this editorial piece will examine each crypto ecosystem and determine which is better.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Solving Scalability With PoS\n\nEthereum is undoubtedly one of the most prolific figures in the blockchain industry. The crypto giant has provided explosive returns for its users and recently switched to a PoS consensus to heighten its performance.\n\nPoW was Ethereum\u2019s initial consensus. However, in September 2022, Ethereum switched to a PoS consensus to combat its high energy consumption and low performance. The switch allowed Ethereum to increase its transaction speed to 100,000 per second, improving its scalability!\n\nAnother benefit that came from the switch to a PoS consensus was its reduction in energy consumption. The Ethereum platform reduced its carbon footprint by 99.95%, increasing its sustainability and the sustainability of the dApps built on the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum\u2019s PoS consensus could have contributed to its recent positive market trend. The platform has increased its market capitalization by 6.16% in the past seven days at the time of writing. This positive trend has brought Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization to an eye-watering $204 billion, showcasing its importance in the crypto market.\n\nThe Pioneer Of The Crypto Market \u2013 Bitcoin\n\nAs many know, Bitcoin is the crypto market powerhouse. The platform has created many millionaires through its explosive growth from its inception. In July 2010, Bitcoin began trading at $0.0008. However, at the time of writing, the coin is worth $23,186.66, with an all-time high of $68,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance is apparent because it was the first cryptocurrency in existence. The platform has survived each bear market that has destroyed other cryptocurrencies, even while utilising a consensus that limits its performance.\n\nIt is reported that Bitcoin uses the same energy annually as multiple countries! However, the PoW consensus that Bitcoin utilizes ensures a high level of security for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhile PoS blockchains require validators to process transactions, PoW blockchains use miners to add new blocks to the blockchain. Although this method of consensus takes longer, it allows miners to earn crypto rewards in the mining process.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs mentioned above, each mode of consensus has its merits and downfalls. PoS blockchains focus on scalability, sustainability, and overall performance. On the other hand, PoW blockchains focus on security, crypto rewards, and providing a decentralized method of verifying transactions\n\nSo, which crypto giant out of Bitcoin and Ethereum hosts the better consensus? In the current state of the world, sustainability is now a priority. This is one of the main reasons why Ethereum has switched to a PoS consensus and why it is now the preferred mode of consensus within the blockchain industry.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Another day, another record for the daring Big Eyes Coin project, which is on its way to reaching the $50 million presale mark any time now. Against all odds, this project proved haters wrong and, in a year, managed to unite a massive fan base and rally support behind its brand. If the current pacing continues, little will stop this project from going down as one of the best presales in recent history. Today\u2019s editorial will consider reasons why Big Eyes is on the rise and look into why Bitcoin and Ethereum are finally ready to travel up north.\n\nBitcoin: The OG Crypto\n\nIt is no secret that Bitcoin will always occupy an exceptional place in the heart of crypto aficionados. Being the first cryptocurrency ever created, it has paved the way for blockchain technology to flourish on a large scale. Before Satoshi Nakamoto dropped Bitcoin\u2019s white paper, centralised banks ruled the world, preventing competition from challenging their solidified status quo.\n\nHowever, everything changed when Bitcoin came onto the stage, enabling permissionless peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary to control the process. Operating on the proof-of-work mechanism, Bitcoin became a symbol of the free Internet and, to this day, is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization by a long shot. When Bitcoin travels north, the crypt flock follows its movement, and its upward trajectory became imminent in the past month.\n\nEthereum: Supercomputer In Action\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin initially created Ethereum in 2014, a handful of people believed this project would skyrocket into the stratosphere. Fast forward to the present moment, and Ethereum comfortably occupies second place among the top cryptos by market capitalisation. What made Ethereum stand out from the competition was its holistic design, enabling anyone to build virtually anything on top of this blockchain.\n\nAs a result, most DeFi applications and NFTs are currently utilising the benefits Ethereum blockchain offers, making it arguably one of the best cryptos out there. And while in terms of market capitalisation, it is still behind its main rival, in terms of the use case applications, Ethereum by far exceeds any other blockchain out there. With the current market U-turn, there is a good chance that Ethereum might break the $2000 support level, finally indicating the bull run that most of the crypto flock has long anticipated.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: 10th Stage Is Selling Fast\n\nAfter the vast majority of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s loyal fanbase requested to extend the launch code for a 200% bonus, the team finally agreed to proceed with this request. Understandably, this news generated a lot of buzz on Twitter, with more and more people jumping onto this crypto bandwagon to reap some hefty benefits after the project is finally launched.\n\nOn paper, Big Eyes Coin is a win-win for everyone involved. Those who wish to sell NFTs would get this chance soon enough, while if you are a liquidity mercenary, then there will be options to stake the project\u2019s native token BIG. Moreover, if you are into charity and protecting our planet, then Big Eyes Coin is a perfect place, as this project pledged to preserve marine and ocean life. Use this promo code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 for a 200% bonus before it runs out on the 20th of February.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed key positions in 2023 with assistance from the overall market rally and increasing network development activity. Indeed, the crypto community is looking forward to how ETH\u2019s price will play out in the coming days amid lingering crucial network milestones.\n\nTherefore, the community has fronted possible ETH price trajectory scenarios. In particular, a crypto community at CoinMarketCap, through the price estimate feature, projects that Ethereum is likely to trade at an average price of $1,542 on February 28, 2023.\n\nAs per the data obtained by Finbold on February 8, the community projection is based on votes by 1,754 members, with the price representing a correction of over 7% from the ETH\u2019s price at the time of publishing.\n\nEthereum community price prediction. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nIndeed, the community prediction points to consolidation compared to a forecast by a machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions. Per the projection, ETH was to trade at $1,582 on February 1, 2023.\n\nThe community accounts for a sixth-month average accuracy rate of 82.53% by factoring in past predictions. The latest accuracy rate for January 2023 stood at 89.879%.\n\nEthereum community price predication estimated accuracy: Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish catalyst\n\nAs the community expresses bearishness for ETH\u2019s price movement, the asset seeks to build on the possible bullish sentiments from last year\u2019s Merge upgrade that transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Currently, Ethereum investors are aiming to start withdrawing their staked ETH in March when the Shanghai hard fork is expected to go live.\n\nIn the meantime, stakers are trialing the withdrawals feature following the Zhejiang testnet activation. Overall, some of the implications of the Shanghai upgrade will be the start of a possible boom in the popularity of staking among investors looking to earn yield and likely impact the value of ETH.\n\nAlthough the full impact of the upgrade is yet to be determined, Ethereum is witnessing increased network activity. Interestingly, the activity has not been weighed down by the network\u2019s gas fees, which have spiked steadily since the Merge.\n\nEthereum gas fees chart. Source: Hilldobby\n\nAway from the network upgrades, Etheruem will aim to build momentum from the institutional adoption of its services. Finbold reported that the latest ETH developments involving institutions would see Russia\u2019s Sberbank launch and Ethereum-based DeFi platform mid-year.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nEthereum is changing hands at $1,674, having rallied by almost 3% in 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, ETH is up over 5%.\n\nEthereum seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold.\n\nElsewhere, Ethereum one-day technical analysis remains bullish, with the summary opting for the \u2018buy\u2019 sentiment at 14. Moving averages are for \u2018strong buy\u2019 gauging at 14, while oscillators are for \u2018sell\u2019 at 2.\n\nEthereum technical analysis.

        "title": "Ethereum upgrade moving on track to implement super important update for ETH ecosystem - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Ethereum testnet Zhejiang has successfully processed staked ETH withdrawals.\n\nThe testnet is the first of three dress rehearsals towards the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is another step closer to its historic transition to a fully-featured proof-of-stake network as a testnet, Zhejiang, processed its first withdrawals of staked ETH. Developers\u2019 and users\u2019 test code changed to their application with testnets, which are duplicates of the main blockchain. Following the first testnet upgrade are the Sepolia and Goerli updates.\n\nEthereum Testnet Zhejiang Conducts Staked ETH Withdrawals\n\nAccording to an explorer website that tracks transactions on the system, the Ethereum testnet performed the withdrawal process early Tuesday. This happened after it launched last week. Also, the upgrade was triggered at epoch 1350 at 15:00 UTC and concluded at 15:13 UTC.\n\nThe Zhejiang upgrade is designed as a dress rehearsal in preparation for the Shanghai update. The Shanghai update is expected to occur in March, and it is the blockchain\u2019s first major upgrade since its transition to POS in September last year. Following the transition, Ethereum became more energy-efficient compared to the proof-of-work protocol.\n\nAfter the hard fork, the network validators will have access to withdraw 16 million staked ETH. Ethereum began to use validators in place of miners after the Merge. The validators were required to stake 32 ETH with the chain to be able to participate in the block validation princess. The more the ether staked, the more the validators are likely to be selected to \u201cpropose\u201d the next block of Ethereum transactions. They were also open to certain network rewards.\n\nValidators at the Brink of Cashin Out\n\nNotably, the Ethereum ecosystem informed validators that the accrued rewards, as well as their staked ETH would be locked till another update happens to the chain. These participants have been staking ETH and gathering rewards since the release of the proof-of-stake \u201cBeacon Chain\u201d in December 2020. The launch of the Beacon Chain was the first move in aspiration for the Merge. After years of staking ETH, validators can finally cash out their portions.\n\nSpeaking to CoinDesk on the recent Ethereum testnet, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation stated:\n\nOn the Zhejiang testnet, partial and full withdrawals as well as BLS changes are included in the execution payload. We have a successful fork.\n\nFingers are crossed on the possible impact of the update on the Ethereum ecosystem. While some believe that the Shanghai upgrade may encourage more staking, others say the price of ETH may decline due to pressure from stakers who may rush to withdraw their funds when the hard fork is over.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "content": "The report discloses that there are fears that consumers may hoard or shift their wealth instantly between accounts due to the frictionless nature of digital money.\n\nAccording to reports, consumers would be under strict limitations by transferring just a few amounts of pounds into their accounts.\n\nThe United Kingdom is working around the clock to introduce a digital pound issued by the Central Bank of England. Based on the idea of producing a more stable alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both the central bank and the UK Treasury believe that this could offer a financial advantage that could be needed in the future. According to them, the decision to introduce a digital pound could be made around the middle of the decade.\n\nThe report discloses that there are fears that consumers may hoard or shift their wealth instantly between accounts due to the frictionless nature of digital money. This could collapse banks as they may be under severe stress in such situations. A consultation paper that suggests a new form of money could be introduced by 2030 has suggested that authorities could bring it under control by blocking consumers from hoarding the digital pound. Governor Andrew Bailey and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt released a roadmap for creating this digital currency. According to reports, consumers would be under strict limitations by transferring just a few amounts of pounds into their accounts. The idea is to prevent the rapid outflow of large amounts of money from traditional high street banks.\n\nThe Treasury said:\n\nA limit on individuals\u2019 holdings would apply at least in the introductory phase. This would strike a balance between both encouraging use and managing risks, such as the potential for large and rapid outflows from banking deposits into digital pounds. These limits could be amended in the future.\n\nThe digital pound would bear no interest\n\nAccording to Mr. Hunt, protecting financial stability is their top priority. Having emphasized that cash is here to stay, Mr. Hunt and Mr. Bailey explained that CBDC offers a new payment method for consumers. UK is far advanced in researching the economic benefits of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and millions of pounds have already been spent on this course as claimed by the Bank\u2019s annual report.\n\nSome key figures including Former Bank of England governor Lord King have strongly disagreed with the implementation of the digital pounds. In his statement, Lord King mentioned that CBDC has no obvious benefits but offers risk. He further said that the public does not need it, and its consideration is mere because it has a \u201d sexy name of a digital currency.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that there will be a consultation to invite comments from businesses and the wider public in the next four months. However, decisions on its implementation will not happen until 2025.\n\nMr. Bailey said:\n\nThis consultation and the further work the Bank will now do will be the foundation for what would be a profound decision for the country on the way we use money.\n\nThe Digital pound would not bear any interest and would be risk-free according to the authorities. It would also be equivalent in value to the physical pound. \u00a310 of a digital pound would be worth \u00a310 in cash in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction - - Blockzeit",
        "content": "The Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH) is nowadays one of the most popular altcoins of the current generation. In 2022, this crypt became the second most popular, right after the master of cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin.\n\nA distinctive feature of Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is its usefulness as a software network that allows developers to create and launch new tools, applications, and NFT. Blockchain-based software network has many applications and applications in the world of technology, especially for games, music, entertainment, and decentralized finance (DeFi), which makes it one of the most popular and widely used cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat happened to ETH?\n\nEthereum was founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, and by 2022 has become one of the most popular coins and platforms for cryptocurrency transactions at the same time. ETN does not position itself as an alternative to Bitcoin. It is precise that, because, for a long time, it was this coin that was second in reliability and demand among users.\n\nJust a few months ago, Ethereum could be called the most reliable and profitable altcoin in existence. But as you may know, the world of cryptocurrency is so unpredictable and changeable.\n\nFrom its foundation until September 2022, Ethereum worked on the Proof of Work mechanism, which meant receiving a reward for solving complex mining tasks. Simply put, it is on this system that the mining process of almost any cryptocurrency works, and it began with the founding of Bitcoin. But on September 15 of this year, I will not be afraid of this word, a historic event occurred in the crypto industry \u2015 Ethereum announced the \u201cMerger\u201d project and switched to the Proof of Stake system. What could it mean and how it will affect Ethereum Classic price prediction? Let\u2019s discuss this.\n\nIf in the first case, every miner who has at least some capacities and resources has a chance to get a reward for the extracted block, then in the second case the system automatically selects the users who have enough cryptocurrency in their wallets, that is, there is a certain share of crypts in use.\n\nAnd now Ethereum switches completely to this algorithm of work, which terrifies the crypto community. Critics are shouting with might and main that it will not be at all soon, ETH lovers are anxiously eyeing the price drop, and newcomers do not know whether it is worth trying to mine a coin in 2022.\n\nIn general, the situation seems to be a stalemate. But even here, experts\u2019 opinions on the future of cryptocurrencies vary. So I would like to learn more about all possible predictions.\n\nForecasts for the future of ETH\n\nNow Ethereum is proudly called Ethereum 2.0 and opens a new era of the digital world before our eyes.\n\nImmediately after the procedure of switching to PoS, Ethereum dropped significantly in price and capitalization. Apparently, at this point, many users completely stopped believing in it. But after a little more than a month, the indicators gradually began to grow \u2013 the capitalization increased by more than $ 31 billion, and the exchange rate rose by $ 200.\n\nJudging by this situation, everything is okay with the Ether. And what do analysts think about this? Every expert claims that it is almost impossible to give a precise forecast, however, there are several opinions on this.\n\nSome experts bet that despite fluctuations, in 2023 the average price of one ETH will be about $ 2,000, while at first, it may fall to a minimum of $ 1,300, and in December it will rise to a maximum of $ 2,400.\n\nOther experts believe miners can get much more benefits from the transition than it seems. But the main thing is the opportunity to save on purchasing expensive mining equipment. They also believe that the negative reaction of miners to the changes is not entirely justified, because if you look at the coin in the long term, PoS opens up much more opportunities to users than PoW.\n\nAccording to the most negative scenario, ETN may break through the bottom with a rate of $ 330 in 2023, and this may happen approximately in May. But at the same time, by November, ETH will update its maximum \u2013 $ 2,500.\n\nAs for long-term forecasts, analysts are confident in the further growth of Ether. It is assumed that by the end of the decade, the cryptocurrency could reach $ 50,000 (to be precise, $50,788).\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s competition and other elements that contribute to its ongoing volatility, \u0435here is a general feeling of enthusiasm that the original smart contract blockchain will endure these difficulties."
