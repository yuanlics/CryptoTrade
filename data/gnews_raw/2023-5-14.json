        "title": "Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital currencies, have been all the rage over the last couple of years. Coins like bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent years, and financial institutions are starting to get on board. Two of the largest and most popular coins are ethereum and bitcoin. This article explores and compares both currencies and will help you understand the pros and cons of each so you can determine which one might be right for you.\n\nRead: Looking To Diversify In A Bear Market? Consider These 6 Alternative Investments\n\nAbout Cryptocurrencies\n\nA cryptocurrency is a secure, virtual currency that is nearly impossible to counterfeit. These digital coins are assets that exist on distributed networks. The networks\u2019 decentralized nature means that governments and other central authorities can\u2019t control them.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is a technology based on a distributed ledger database, underpins cryptocurrencies. Cryptography and encryption techniques secure the network and prevent tampering. Every transaction is stored as a separate block on the chain, and those records are guaranteed to be accurate and immutable.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are arguably the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today. They certainly are the largest by market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $363 billion, while ethereum\u2019s market cap is around $161 billion.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by a crypto architect known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea for this digital currency was simple yet revolutionary. It promised an alternative to traditional currency, called fiat currency, via a decentralized and transparent financial system accessible to all.\n\nBitcoin works on a blockchain network. Transactions happen between bitcoin wallets using private keys, which provide mathematical proof of their authenticity. Cryptography ensures both the integrity and the chronological order of transactions, and a distributed consensus system confirms pending transactions.\n\nBitcoin has capped the number of coins that can be minted at 21 million. Once that number has been reached, the coins can still be traded but no more can be introduced.\n\nThe following stats from CoinMarketCap are current as of Sept. 27:\n\nBitcoin Quick Stats Price $18,973.12 Market cap $363.56 billion Market dominance 39.17%\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s white paper was released in 2013, and the project officially launched in 2015. Ethereum is an open-source, community-driven project and has seen quite a bit of evolution since its inception.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that snubs censorship and surveillance. The focus of the project is to enable access to financial services and commerce for everyone. It does this by allowing for the development of other cryptos as well as the execution of smart contracts on its platform, CoinMarketCap explained.\n\nIBM describes smart contracts as programs stored on a blockchain that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. These functionalities make Ethereum a more versatile platform than Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows for an unlimited number of tokens.\n\nGood To Know The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Ethereum is programmable. That feature broadens the scope of Ethereum, making it more than just a digital currency. It makes Ethereum a marketplace for financial services, games and apps.\n\nEthereum Quick Stats Price $1,316.21 Market cap $161.30 billion Market dominance 17.39%\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both blockchains, but they serve different purposes, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a narrow purpose: provide an alternative to fiat currency and a system for processing transactions.\n\nPros\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe coin has the best brand recognition and most liquidity, which has made it the most widely accepted cryptocurrency.\n\nThere\u2019s still huge potential growth for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin uses blockchain technology designed to protect against fraud or identity theft.\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand, not political interference.\n\nBitcoin has a faster transaction speed than fiat currency.\n\nThe 21 million cap on bitcoins could drive prices higher by making the coin more scarce.\n\nCons\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin has limited functionality.\n\nBitcoin uses an extreme amount of energy, which is bad for climate change.\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t provide 100% anonymity.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum\n\nWhereas the purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain is to process transactions and store value, Ethereum is a platform that also supports the development of other projects.\n\nPros\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology for its decentralized, transparent system.\n\nThe technology enables functionality beyond digital currency, such as decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe developer community is one of the largest.\n\nThe Ethereum platform processes transactions faster than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum recently completed an upgrade that reduced its carbon footprint 99.95%.\n\nCons\n\nThe coin is not bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nbitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. The transaction fees are potentially higher than on the Bitcoin platform.\n\nEthereum is slow compared to alternative platforms, referred to as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d like Solana, although the recent upgrade could improve Ethereum\u2019s speed exponentially.\n\nUnlimited supply could dampen demand for ethereum tokens.\n\nKnow the Risks of Investing In Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAll cryptocurrency investments are speculative. The more aware you are of the risks, the better you can mitigate them if you decide to invest.\n\nHype and FOMO Risks\n\nThe fear of missing out is a powerful driver for people to buy cryptocurrencies. With bitcoin\u2019s explosion in value over the past few years, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype. No one wants to lose out on the chance of getting rich from cryptocurrency, especially when it has already made many people extremely rich.\n\nHowever, regulators continue to warn the public that you could lose all your money in crypto. For example, bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped about 60% since the beginning of the year, and ethereum is down significantly, too.\n\nSecurity Risks\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they\u2019re potentially vulnerable to hackers. The first month of 2022 saw several notable hacks. Hackers stole $80 million worth of crypto from Quibit, a decentralized platform. And the Crypto.com exchange reported the theft of about $35 million in cryptocurrency, most of which was ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts also warn that quantum computers could hack crypto wallets, even though the technology isn\u2019t mainstream yet.\n\nTax Risks\n\nThe IRS wants to know about gains from crypto investments you\u2019ve sold. There\u2019s a tax question on Form 1040 specifically regarding cryptocurrencies. Failing to disclose this information could lead to stiff penalties or possible criminal investigation.\n\nRegulatory Risks\n\nGovernment-imposed regulations could make cryptocurrency safer and more secure, but they might also affect your access, the ways you use it and how it\u2019s taxed.\n\nWhich Investment Is Right for You?\n\nBoth bitcoin and ethereum have increased in value by staggering percentages since their release. But they\u2019re still experimental, and with innovation comes problems that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns haven\u2019t been resolved. For example, the decentralized nature of blockchains means there\u2019s no one to turn to if things go wrong. In addition, transactions can be much more expensive on a blockchain than through a bank or debit or credit card.\n\nIf you decide that investing in a blockchain is the way to go, it makes sense to consider the top two. Determining which one\u2019s right for you depends on your needs and goals.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has the most support commercially. If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currency, bitcoin seems to be a good choice, as long as you\u2019re prepared to weather the volatility.\n\nTechnically speaking, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum network acts as a marketplace for users to buy and sell goods and decentralized applications. If you\u2019re interested in more than a cryptocurrency, ethereum might be a good choice for you.\n\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of Sept. 27 2022, and subject to change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Here's why the SEC never classified ether as a security - Protos",
        "content": "Listen to this article.\n\nIn 2018, former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) director William Hinman famously opined that Ethereum \u2014 as it existed then \u2014 wasn\u2019t a security. For years, that speech caused confusion about the securities classification of thousands of other ICOs.\n\nLegions of securities lawyers were shocked at Hinman\u2019s conclusion. The New York Attorney General believes ETH is a security. Even SEC chair Gary Gensler disagreed.\n\nEventually, the truth came out: Hinman had a financial conflict of interest when he gave that speech. He was making millions of dollars from a pro-Ethereum entity at the time.\n\nBefore he became chairman of the SEC, professor Gary Gensler explained to students in a 2018 MIT course, \u201cIn my opinion, Ethereum passed the Howey Test and that means that it would be considered a security.\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t even think there\u2019s much doubt what this was in 2014 when they raised the $18 million.\u201d\n\nStill, industry insiders accused the SEC of failing to provide clear guidance or send fair notice to issuers of digital assets that they might qualify as securities. Instead of categorizing thousands of ICOs explicitly, the SEC has chosen to explain its determinations in civil lawsuits, slowly, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAlthough the SEC has classified some of the largest ICOs as securities offerings like XRP, TRX, and TON, it has avoided classifying ETH.\n\nNo financial harm, no reason to sue\n\nNot only is there no basis for financial harm from ICO investors, Ethereum also enjoys one of the most populous fan bases in the crypto industry. Millions of US constituents support Ethereum.\n\nNevertheless, some aspects of Ethereum are worryingly similar to an investment contract \u2014 a type of security. For example, Vitalik Buterin explicitly told investors that he was hoping for the price of ETH to quintuple during an interview at the 2014 Texas Bitcoin Conference (Ethereum\u2019s ICO raised approximately $18 million worth of BTC in 2014).\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping is something like what happened with Mastercoin (MSC), so if that slice is something like 20%, and then the value of ether goes up by five, then we basically have the entire initial BTC that we got all over again.\u201d \u2014Vitalik Buterin, March 6, 2014\n\nPromising investment returns is a hallmark of a securities offering. After Mastercoin\u2019s (MSC) initial rally, its price eventually collapsed to nearly $0. In contrast, ether has rallied consistently over the years. So, because Ethereum ICO investors haven\u2019t experienced financial harm as a result of their investment, no one has successfully challenged the securities classification of Ethereum\u2019s ICO in a civil lawsuit.\n\nSimilarly, Congress charged the SEC with protecting investors. With no harm involved with Ethereum\u2019s ICO, commissioners chose to focus on other enforcement targets. As the years passed and the price of ETH increased, the statute of limitations expired.\n\nRead more: What did Gary Gensler really say when he promoted Algorand?\n\nNevertheless, questions about Ethereum\u2019s present-day securities classification remain. In particular, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has loudly warned of the risks of Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake as heightening its securities likeness. On a related matter, all five commissioners have agreed to sue Ethereum staking services like Kraken.\n\nNYAG believes ETH is a security\n\nAlthough not a securities regulator, the NYAG oversees conduct in Wall Street, the world\u2019s largest financial center. In her lawsuit against KuCoin, NYAG Letitia James explained her designation of ETH as a security.\n\nNew York\u2019s chief lawyer alleged KuCoin failed to register as a broker-dealer in securities like ETH and falsely represented itself as a compliant exchange.\n\nNYAG classified ETH, LUNA, and UST as alleged securities.\n\nThe SEC agrees with at least two of those three designations, LUNA and UST, and hasn\u2019t classified ETH.\n\nThe NYAG explicitly acknowledged that her lawsuit is the first time a major regulator had classified ETH as a security in court. She called ether \u201ca speculative asset that relies on the efforts of third-party developers in order to provide profit to the holders of ETH.\u201d\n\nRead more: Gary Gensler can\u2019t say if ETH is a security because of the SEC\n\nJames also alleged KuCoin sold unregistered securities through KuCoin Earn, a product that allowed users to earn interest on digital asset deposits. She alleged KuCoin failed to register as a securities and commodities broker in New York before launching its earn product.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block KuCoin from operating in New York until it can comply with state regulations. It also asks that KuCoin stop misrepresenting that it\u2019s an exchange and implement geo-blocking based on IP address and GPS-based location.\n\nEven if the ICO passed Howey, would ETH today pass Howey?\n\nWhether ETH is a security has been a matter of debate that hinges on whether its promoters have passed the four prongs of the US Supreme Court\u2019s Howey Test. It specifies that an offering is likely a type of securities offering, known as an investment contract, if purchasers:\n\nInvest money, into a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit, to be derived from the efforts of others.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Ethereum\u2019s ICO passed the Howey Test, but the statute of limitations for an SEC lawsuit has expired on 2014 events. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that ETH today, with its proof-of-stake yield and various other financial qualities, could pass the Howey Test. Only a US court ruling on an SEC lawsuit would settle this question.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) blockchain had a technical issue on May 12 that led to a stoppage of finalizing blocks for over an hour. The incident followed a previous technical problem on May 11, making it the second one in 24 hours.\n\nA bug could have attacked Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum Beacon Chain failed to finalize transactions for an unclear reason, causing major security concerns for users. Steven Zheng, the Block research director, mentioned that people speculate that the reason was bugs in staking clients or MEV infrastructures.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation stated that the unfinalized blocks could lead to the re-ordering or dropping of pending transactions from the network.\n\nThe recent attack was the second one in 24 hours, with the same issue on May 11 when finality paused for about 25 minutes.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain experiences temporary halt in finalization, raising alarms\n\nAccording to an Ethereum staker, they found a production incident where all four sets of CL+EL deployed in their system were simultaneously rebooted, which is a rare phenomenon. It was then discovered that these BeaconNode Prysm suddenly doubled their memory usage, which drove the memory limit and triggered OOM.\n\nA self-proclaimed Ethereum Beacon Chain community health consultant, Superphiz.eth, clarified that transactions do not stop due to finality issues like those on Ethereum. In addition, he noted that the lack of finality had no impact on on-chain activity.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1656977820315254786?s=20\n\nAs of the time of writing, the network has fixed the issue and restored the block finalization.\n\nChanges need to be implemented on network\n\nSome services built on Ethereum may need to modify operations due to finality issues. DYdX, for example, paused deposits temporarily due to the incident and continues to investigate the matter and monitor it.\n\nSuperphiz.eth noted that he expects a third even with the second wave over. He further advised validators on the network to increase their hardware spec if they can and switch to a minority client if possible. However, he noted not to worry too much about it, even if it looks terrible. The chain keeps going and will eventually finalize.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1657106474131136512\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s clear that questions about Ethereum\u2019s stability remain and could stain its credibility in the builder\u2019s eyes. The reliability of a network is essential for blockchains that would like to attract capital and grow users. That is important because Ethereum is historically viewed as among the most stable networks on the market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Crypto News: Coinbase\u2019s Wrapped Staked ETH, or more commonly known as cbETH, has gained significant momentum since its launch. However, Coinbase recently received more than 53,400 ETH, out of which the majority were moved from the Coinbase\u2019s cbETH deposit address \u2014 that may be related to the fact that ETH staking was terminated.\n\nCoinbase Witnesses Massive ETH Inflow\n\nOn Monday, the cbETH deposit address 0xc7\u2026a019 saw a massive withdrawal of 44,000 ETH to the Coinbase 10 wallet address, as per the data obtained from CryptoQuant. This suggests that people have been terminating their ETH staking contract, which further indicates a building sell pressure for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA wrapped cryptocurrency, such as cbETH, is a crypto token that symbolizes another cryptocurrency that has been \u201cwrapped\u201d or \u201clocked up\u201d in a digital smart contract. Coinbase developed the ERC-20 utility token to serve as a representation of Ethereum 2.0 (ETH2) which could be obtained by staking ETH tokens on the platform.\n\nRead More: Over 1 Billion Hedera Tokens Set To Unlock On June 1, Major HBAR Price Drop Ahead?\n\nMoreover, because cbETH is a liquid token, there is no lock-up time and the token may be used for additional DeFi operations such as lending, swapping, and providing liquidity \u2014 all of which can be done directly from the Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStakers Withdraw Rewards, Not Principal\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade made it possible for Ethereum speculators to finally withdraw their funds from the mainnet. Some individuals have been holding off on doing so ever since the staking option was initially made available in December 2020.\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, most stakers and entities who have staked Ether have withdrawn incentives rather than their principal. According to TokenUnlocks, staking incentives accounted for more than 172,000 Ether, or more than 95% of withdrawals. Users who had completely stopped staking and would no longer take part in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism \u2014 which is used to arrange and confirm transactions \u2014 made up the remaining 5%, which was their initial stake.\n\nIn the wake of this crypto news, the price of ETH is currently exchanging hands at $1,826.91, which represents a gain of 1.31% over the past 24 hours, compared to a drop of 1.92% recorded over the preceding seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin-Ether Correlation Dips Below 80% For First Time In 2 Years, What It Means?"

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash will introduce a major upgrade to its blockchain.\n\nNew CashTokens will enable developers to run smart contracts on its network.\n\nOne core developer claims the network will be 100x more efficient than Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAmid major congestion on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, traders are begging for upgrades to boost scalability. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), one of the more successful Bitcoin hard forks, could soon deliver an upgrade to outshine both.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is gearing up for its own hard fork, set for Monday, May 15. The upgrade will introduce \u2018CashTokens,\u2019 an ERC-20-like standard for the network. These tokens will enable Bitcoin Cash to run smart contracts.\n\nAccording to core developers, this decentralized Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain will be more scalable and efficient than Ethereum.\n\nHow Will Bitcoin Cash Change After the Hard Fork?\n\nScheduled for May 15, the \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019 is a hard fork on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network. This means that this change to the network protocol will not be compatible with previous chain versions.\n\nThe primary feature of the latest Bitcoin Cash hard fork is the introduction of \u2018CashTokens,\u2019 which are similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. Their introduction is a game-changer for Bitcoin Cash. The upgrade will allow developers to issue tokens directly on the BCH network.\n\nIssuing tokens (and memecoins) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is not the most exciting feature of the upgrade. More importantly, CashTokens will enable the blockchain to run smart contracts. This feature will allow developers to build dApps directly on Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWill Bitcoin Cash Be the Ethereum Killer?\n\nSo far, Ethereum has remained the most significant smart contract blockchain network. However, congestion issues, high fees, and other issues have led to a series of competing networks. With its latest upgrade, Bitcoin Cash will be one of them.\n\nThe hard fork will not just enable Bitcoin Cash to power smart contracts. It will also enable it to harness the built-in scalability of the network, making its smart contracts run efficiently and at a low cost. In particular, one core developer says that dApps on Bitcoin Cash will be 100x cheaper than Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Cash developer Jason Dreyzehner claims the network owes its performance to the UTXO accounting model. UTXO stands for \u201cunspent transaction output,\u201d and differs from the account/balance model used by cryptos like Ethereum.\n\nTo start with the basics \u2013 Bitcoin Cash owes its performance, scalability, and privacy to the \"UTXO model\": funds are sent to a new contract in every transaction output, so the system never reuses \"accounts\", even if you re-use an address. \u2014 Jason Dreyzehner (@bitjson) June 30, 2022\n\nThe UTXO model has several features that make it potentially better than the alternative. Each transaction creates a new UTXO, making coins harder to track and boosting privacy. On the other hand, this model also enables parallel transaction processing, allowing for greater scalability.\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash becomes a scalable solution for dApps, this could help significantly boost its utility. Rather than just being a decentralized currency, BCH will power an ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash developers boast of its scalability, the network has still not seen a substantial test of its performance.\n\nDespite its similarities to BCH, including its use of the UTXO model, Bitcoin still suffers from network congestion since the creation of ordinals.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nA decentralized and scalable smart contract network would enable developers to create better dApps, boosting blockchain adoption. This would have a significant impact on the decentralized finance space.\n\nRead more about Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent congestion issues:\n\nBitcoin Core Dev Insists on Ordinals Ban, Starts Civil War Instead\n\nRead about the latest trends in crypto venture capital:\n\nVenture Investment in Crypto Drops to New Low: Report"

For perspective, ETH\u2019s weekly loss was about 5% at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIn the same period, BTC depreciated by about 7%; thus, the king coin was hammered more than the ETH \u2013 further reinforcing ETH\u2019s decoupling from BTC. But Binance Coin [BNB] outperformed both assets on the weekly front.\n\nDespite the corrections, the Crypto Greed and Fear index was \u201cneutral\u201d with a value of 48 at press time, compared to the \u201cgreed\u201d position last week (7-14 May).\n\nWill bulls continue defending $1800?\n\nA short-term downside couldn\u2019t be overruled with price action below the 50-EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and the RSI hovering below the 50-mark.\n\nNotably, short-term holders could panic-sell their ETH holdings if market sentiment deteriorates in the coming days/weeks.\n\nETH\u2019s market structure\u2019s first sign of weakness will be a breach and daily session close below the 100-EMA of $1764 (yellow line). Such a downswing could sink ETH to $1700. The second telltale sign of weakness will be a close below $1700, which could depreciate ETH to $1500.\n\nOn the upside, bulls could feel relieved if they push ETH above the 50-EMA of $1845 (blue line). Such a move could fuel hopes of reclaiming the $2000 psychological level and dent any prevailing bearish sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) hovered near zero after retreating from the negative zone \u2013 capital inflows improved but wavered in the past few days. Similarly, the OBV was also flat, meaning demand wavered \u2013 suggesting a likely short-term consolidation.\n\nPositive aggregated CVD means \u2026\n\nAccording to Coinalyze, the aggregated CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) spot, which tracks buyer/seller activities alongside overall sentiment, was positive.\n\nThe metric has been negative since 3 May, but flipped to positive on 12 May after the price hit the $1800 support level. It shows buyers have been in charge for the past two days.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOn the liquidation side, long positions worth $2.5 million were wrecked in the past 24 hours, compared to $1.9 million in short positions. This development depicts a mild bearish sentiment that could undermine a strong ETH recovery.\n\nMacro traders following ETH/USDT would want to watch out for the US debt ceiling woes alongside the US Retail Sales data scheduled for Tuesday (16 May), which will affect all USD/USDT pegged assets/pairs."

        "title": "US strips Ethereum dev Virgil Griffith of export privileges for 10 years - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States Department of Commerce has imposed a 10-year export privilege ban on Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer serving a five-year prison sentence. The ban restricts him from enjoying export privileges until April 12, 2032.\n\nThe export privilege ban affects his ability to participate in international trade and business. On April 12, 2022, Virgil Griffith was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for breaching the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Griffith was found guilty of unauthorized export of services to North Korea and circumventing U.S. sanctions imposed on the country.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman accused Griffith of knowingly sharing technical information with North Korea that could aid in money laundering and evading sanctions, according to a statement. As a result of his conviction, Griffith was sentenced to 63 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He is also obligated to pay a $100 assessment and a criminal fine of $100,000.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Export Control Reform Act, individuals convicted of specific offenses, such as violating the IEEPA, may face a denial of export privileges for up to 10 years. This denial can lead to the revocation of licenses or authorizations previously granted by the Bureau of Industry and Security \u2014 an agency of the Commerce Department.\n\nAs a result of the bar, Virgil Griffith will be restricted from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any transactions involving commodities, software or technology that fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. export regulations. This effectively entails the denial of his export privileges as a U.S. citizen.\n\nRelated: Two more charged with teaching North Koreans to evade US sanctions with crypto\n\nHe was initially denied bail but was finally granted a bond order for $1 million at the end of December 2019. In October 2020, Griffith filed a motion to dismiss the conspiracy charges, claiming that his April 2019 conference presentation consisted of widely available public information; therefore, he was not providing a \u201cservice\u201d to North Korean officials.\n\nMagazine: North Korean crypto hacking: Separating fact from fiction"

        "title": "Ethereum stumbles with settlements as validators go missing - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has experienced two glitches in the past week with settling transactions on its Beacon Chain. The two delays occurred late last week after validators failed to confirm valid blocks, causing some exchange services to pause deposits. Developers are still looking for the cause.\n\nThose working to fix the problem downplayed the seriousness of the issue, noting there were no cases of transactions being lost or remaining unsettled for long. However, they did admit it was something that required fixing and that developers faced technical challenges in ensuring the network didn\u2019t suffer longer-term and more severe settlement delays in the future.\n\nWhile glitches have occurred on all blockchains of all types, Ethereum is a constantly-shifting ocean of complexity with new rules and definitions. Even some of its closest followers confess they struggle to keep up with the latest terminology. While the technical inner circle might not consider an issue serious, they may be potentially so, leading to problems explaining Ethereum\u2019s security to potential users.\n\nThis ever-changing technical environment leads to Ethereum being called \u201cexperimental\u201d and even a \u201chobby platform\u201d that isn\u2019t ready for large-scale applications where billions of dollars in money and asset value could be at risk.\n\nLast week\u2019s issues affected Ethereum\u2019s on-chain \u201cfinalization,\u201d an explicit settlement concept and \u201ccheckpointing\u201d technique that has existed in Ethereum since its recent switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) processing algorithm. Designed to prevent blockchain \u201cre-orgs\u201d (re-organizations), it determines that a transaction is considered officially \u201cfinalized\u201d if at least 2/3 of all validators vote (or \u201cattest\u201d) for consensus after a defined period has passed. Ethereum has unique names for these processes, and finalization occurs following consensus over two \u201cepochs\u201d (one epoch is 32 12-second \u201cslots,\u201d meaning a transaction should be officially final after about 12.8 minutes).\n\nIn other words, to most ordinary users, transactions would have appeared to proceed as normal, but the blockchain itself delayed in considering them permanent and unalterable. This caused some exchange services to pause deposits. While the first delay lasted just a few minutes, the second lasted over an hour, reportedly due to 60% of validator nodes appearing absent.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Ethereum client developer at ConsenSys Ben Edgington said Ethereum was still functionally working, maybe with degraded performance for a short time, but not one that stopped the network itself. The root cause, he said in a video interview, was \u201cstill under analysis,\u201d and no developer intervention was required to fix the delay. However, once the cause is determined, they will likely issue patches to prevent future incidents.\n\nHe described it as a panic situation only on the technical back-end, as validators worked to rebuild older network \u201cstates\u201d to check past attestations while new slots continued to pour in every 12 seconds. Old attestations are discarded so they don\u2019t clog up space, but the challenge was working out which ones were important for finalizations and which weren\u2019t. Different validators have their own ways of performing these processes, so it was more of a crisis for some than others.\n\nIn theory, a chain re-org is possible within the two-epoch period or before finalization if enough validators vote/attest with their stakes to do so.\n\nIn \u201cprobabilistic\u201d blockchain networks such as Bitcoin (and Ethereum when it still ran on proof-of-work), there are recommendations on how many additional transaction blocks must pass (if any) before a previous one is considered \u201cfinal,\u201d but the protocol itself does not define this.\n\nEthereum completely changed its protocol rules and economic incentives when it switched to proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validation late in 2022. Though this nominally more \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d move has generated favorable media attention, it also injected a lot of uncertainty over whether Ethereum could remain \u201csafe\u201d or trustworthy in the longer term.\n\nApplication developers, especially enterprise-tier ones, don\u2019t want to administer their own systems under rule uncertainty or ongoing technical experiments; they want stable systems that are proven to work. This is why BSV retains Bitcoin\u2019s original, \u201cset in stone\u201d protocol rules and proof-of-work (PoW) based confirmations and economic incentives. On a global scale, this is by far the more trustworthy option for blockchain.\n\nWatch The Bitcoin MasterClasses: Party-to-party is revolutionary, and that\u2019s because Bitcoin is traceable\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has resumed staking Ethereum (ETH), according to data shared by Arkham Intelligence.\n\nArkham reported that the bankrupt lender staked 30,800 ETH \u2014 $56.9 million \u2014 via staking solutions provider Figment during the past week. A research analyst at 21Co, Tom Wan, corroborated the Arkham report.\n\nAccording to Wan, Celsius deposited over 40,000 Ethereum through Figment between May 10 and May 12.\n\nThe reason behind this deposit is currently unknown, considering Celsius withdrew part of its staked ETH in April. At the time, industry players interpreted this as a move that the bankrupt firm was consolidating its assets.\n\nCelsius remains one of the biggest firms with a staked ETH portfolio. According to the Arkham Intelligence dashboard, the lender holds 410,378 staked ETH worth $749.37 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Celsius transactions are not altogether surprising given that several entities that withdrew their staked ETH have begun re-staking them. Liquid staking derivatives protocol Lido has led the charts in staked ETH withdrawals and deposits over the past few weeks, according to Nansen\u2019s dashboard.\n\nTotal ETH staking deposits soar above withdrawals.\n\nThe total number of staked ETH reached a new all-time high of 21.62 million worth $39.5 billion \u2014 as staking deposits have surpassed withdrawals \u2014 according to Etherscan data.\n\nSince withdrawals were enabled on April 12, the total number of ETH withdrawn stands at 2.67 million, while ETH deposited is at 3.46 million. This means there is a net staking balance of 785,000 ETH, according to Token Unlocks data.\n\nNansen\u2019s data corroborates the above. According to its dashboard, several crypto entities like Kraken and other centralized exchanges led the initial wave of withdrawals in compliance with the regulatory pressure they faced from U.S. financial regulators.\n\nHowever, as these entities\u2019 withdrawals began to subside, liquid staking protocols like Frax Ether and Rocket Pool have seen the total value of assets locked on their platforms increase by double digits within the past month, according to DeFillama data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s Yield Farming May Be The Most Exciting Thing In Crypto Right Now - NewsBTC",
        "content": "As the world of cryptocurrencies evolves, Ethereum (ETH) investors are beginning to take notice of the power of yields and their potential impact on the crypto space. Yields, in essence, are the payments investors receive for holding cryptocurrencies, and they can come in many shapes and forms.\n\nHow ETH Yields Could Revolutionize The Space\n\nOne of the most important things to understand about yields is that they exist on a risk curve. This means that the percentage of yield paid out to investors is a function of supply and demand, as well as the perceived risk associated with the cryptocurrency in question.\n\nRelated Reading: Only 1,032 Addresses Control Over 60% Of All Litecoin (LTC) In Circulation\n\nFor example, a cryptocurrency with a limited supply and high demand is likely to have a higher yield than one with a larger supply and lower demand. Similarly, a cryptocurrency that is perceived as less risky is likely to have a higher yield than one that is perceived as more risky.\n\nAccording to the crypto analyst and researcher Adam Cochran, this is where the potential of cryptocurrencies really shines through.\n\n1/25 I think most people in crypto don't fully understand or appreciate yields and what it can mean for the crypto space at large \u2013 as it's one of the things that gets me incredibly bullish on the space. And it's part of why I think ETH still has a 20x+ in its future. \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) May 15, 2023\n\nBy creating non-dilutive yields through the use of fees, cryptocurrencies can offer investors a way to earn passive income without the risk of inflation. This is particularly important in a world where traditional investments like savings accounts and bonds offer little to no yield.\n\nOne cryptocurrency that is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of the power of yields is Ethereum. With its growing ecosystem of decentralized applications and smart contracts, ETH has the potential to generate significant fees for investors through its use as a platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, according to Cochran.\n\nFor example, ETH staking currently offers yields in the 5%-7% range, while Synthtetix (SNX) staking can generate yields of up to 24% in external fees. Similarly, Curve (CRV) staking can generate yields of up to 15% in crvUSD fees. This means that billions of dollars in capital are now able to generate yields of more than 3% annual percentage yield (APY), which is a significant opportunity for investors.\n\nThis is particularly important in a world where traditional investment opportunities like savings accounts and bonds offer little to no yield. As more investors become aware of the potential of cryptocurrencies to generate high yields with acceptable levels of risk, this can likely drive more interest and investment in the space.\n\nFrom HODLing To Yielding\n\nIn its recent post, Adam Cochran emphasized the importance of focusing on asset productivity and real yield in the cryptocurrency space. Despite the current narrative that fundamentals don\u2019t matter and memes and rhetoric dominate the market, Cochran believes that one day, the true value of assets will become apparent.\n\nAccording to Cochran, those who already possess assets have the advantage, as they stand to gain significant capital gains in addition to the 2% APY on the face value of the asset. This is particularly relevant in the cryptocurrency space, where prices can be extremely volatile and subject to sudden fluctuations.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Miners Continue To Sell, Bearish Sign?\n\nFurthermore, Cochran predicts that as funds of increasing size start to realize the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency space, they will begin to invest heavily.\n\nThis influx of capital will fundamentally change the finance industry, and those who have acquired a significant number of coins before this shift will reap the benefits.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Best Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now: Solano, Ethereum and Bitcoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Global investors continue to scour the markets and search for the fastest growing, highest yielding cryptocurrencies. 2023 has provided investors with a number of opportunities to make fast profits whilst also providing stability. The crypto market is known for its volatility, traders and enthusiasts must keep their finger on the pulse as selecting the correct investment is critical. With the cryptocurrency market maintaining a market cap above the $1 trillion mark most of the time, many investors are constantly looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now\n\nInnovative, groundbreaking technology is the key to any successful cryptocurrency. Market movers and shakers, disrupters and enhancers provide investors with the perfect opportunity to make profits. Below are some of the best cryptocurrency investments to buy right now:\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin will always be on the list of the best investments, with a market cap of over $500million the once obscure cryptocurrency has become the bedrock of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin currently has a market dominance of more than 45% with crypto experts recognising that the price of many other cryptocurrencies is dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group of people still unknown to date. Bitcoin was created to serve as peer-to-peer cash, a currency that would be independent of the government. The lack of governmental control has drawn many to the decentralized asset over the years. Another factor that has attracted users to the asset is its limited supply. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, which means that it is a deflationary asset that is resistant to inflation. This scarcity has helped to drive up the price of Bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors looking to store value and hedge against inflation.\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price crashed violently. The crypto asset started the year trading around the $45,000 mark. However, Bitcoin ended the year below $20,000, falling as low as $15,000 at some point. Ironically, 2022 seemed to be the year when Bitcoin would reach the $100,000 milestone.\n\nPlan B, a renowned Bitcoin analyst, and proponent, deduced a system for predicting Bitcoin\u2019s price based on supply. This unique system coined by Plan B had been effective in the past, accurately predicting the period when Bitcoin would hit the $10,000 mark and cross the $50,000 mark. The stage seemed set for the next prediction. According to Plan B\u2019s model, BTC would reach the $100,000 mark sometime around late 2021 or early 2022. Unfortunately, that never happened.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price tumbled after a series of negative events in the crypto ecosystem, the most notable being the crash of LUNA and UST. After hitting unexpected lows in 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price is now due for some relief. Crypto investors realize that Bitcoin below $20,000 is undervalued. More so, the flagship cryptocurrency has always bounced back from black swan events and massive price crashes. In 2023, investors expect Bitcoin to bounce back from the massive fall from its peak experienced the year before.\n\nFurther, Bitcoin\u2019s halving is expected to take place in 2024. The halving of Bitcoin would reduce block rewards to miners. This would make the crypto asset scarcer than it was. Historical price action reveals that Bitcoin always appreciates massively months after the halving. Prudent long-term investors will use the dollar-cost averaging method to invest in the asset before the next halving in 2024.\n\n2. Tradecurve \u2013 A Presale to Purchase\n\nTradecurve.io\u2019s presale is making waves within the cryptocurrency currency market, with phase one of it\u2019s presale rapidly selling out TCRV is showing all the signs of a profitable opportunity for investors. Designed to become the worlds first hybrid trading exchange, Tradecurve will serve as a bridge between the financial and cryptocurrency markets. Tradecurve\u2019s unique privacy policy and disposal of KYC checks allows users of the platform to trade the financial markets in complete anonymity.\n\nTradecurve\u2019s native utility token $TCRV powers the entire Tradecurve ecosystem and is currently priced at $0.01. Tradecurve is as an excellent opportunity for investors who are able to take advantage of its current price, a total of 40% of $TCRV will be sold during the presale.\n\nHolders of the Tradecurve token will also benefit from a number of offerings such as; access to trading academies via the metaverse, automated trading, copy trading, passive income through staking, high-leverage options, lowered subscription and trading fees. Tradecurve will also incorporate algorithmic trading, allowing users to utilize advanced algorithms and AI to execute trades with speed and precision.\n\nProviding access for investors to trade; stocks, shares, currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities and indices all from one account, Tradecurve has set the precedent for never-seen-before privacy when trading the financial markets. With an experienced team behind the project, multiple use cases and features of the Tradecurve platform, investors are expecting the $TCRV presale to continue gaining rapid momentum.\n\n3. Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network\u2019s native token is Ether. Ether is used to pay for transactions and services on the platform. This has created an economic system within the platform that has helped to drive its adoption and use.\n\nThe protocol is widely utilized in the NFT and DeFi space. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and the project was founded by Vitalik Buterin and co. Notably, Charles Hoskinson, the current founder of the Cardano network, also played an integral role in the development of Ethereum. Ethereum was created to facilitate the development of immutable smart contracts and programs. Today, the blockchain protocol has lived up to expectations, enabling developers to build decentralized applications.\n\nOne of the main advantages of Ethereum is its flexibility. Developers can use the platform to create a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Notably, the blockchain protocol\u2019s native token (ETH) has made early investors a lot of money. Ether was less than a dollar for most of 2015. Today, however, Ether is valued at around $1800.\n\nInterestingly, despite the massive growth Ethereum has experienced over the years, the protocol still has a long way to go in development. The constant innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem has led the project to continue to see tremendous success. The Ethereum Foundation implemented a means of receiving improvement proposals, that is EIPs. EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, and it gives room for innovation in the ecosystem.\n\nOn the 12th of April, Ethereum successfully completed an EIP that has long been pending. The EIP enabled the release of staked tokens to users who had locked their ETH to enable its consensus mechanism transmission. Ethereum previously utilized the proof of work consensus mechanism but has now switched to the proof of stake consensus mechanism. This switch will enable scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nVitalik Buterin noted that the successful transition of the Ethereum network from proof of work to proof of stake was not the end of Ethereum\u2019s development trajectory. The protocol still has significant upgrades in its roadmap for 2023 and 2024.\n\nWhen investors factor in the upcoming developments waiting on the Ethereum network, the project becomes more appealing. Ethereum currently has very strong fundamentals, and a more scalable Ethereum would attract more investors. This makes Ether a good crypto asset to invest in for long-term gains.\n\n4. Solana\n\nSolana is one of the well-known \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in the crypto ecosystem. The cryptocurrency made a name as an ETH-killer because of the fascinating features of its blockchain. Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that was created to solve the scalability and performance issues faced by the Ethereum network. It was launched in 2020 by a team of developers led by Anatoly Yakovenko and has quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders and investors.\n\nSolana has magnificent transaction speed. The platform boasts a transaction speed of 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks in existence. This has made it an attractive option for developers looking to build decentralized applications that require high-speed transaction processing.\n\nSolana has some disadvantages, though. While Solana stands tall in its speed, the blockchain protocol seems to be slightly deficient in centralization. This relative deficiency is understandable due to the fact that the protocol is relatively new. Newer blockchain networks tend to be less decentralized than long-standing protocols. Further, the Solana network has also been criticized for its security in the past. The blockchain network has been stopped on two occasions due to upgrades.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Solana ecosystem still has a strong developer community. Its strong community has helped the ecosystem and the native token to survive catastrophic seasons. Last year, during the crypto market meltdown, the SOL token was severely affected.\n\nIts price fell from a high of $250 to as low as $50. While this price crash was massive, the worst was still yet to come. In November, when the FTX exchange was found guilty of mismanaging traders\u2019 funds, the SOL token paid a part of the price. The FTX exchange held most of its assets and collateral in SOL. As the heat intensified, the exchange had to liquidate most of its collateral in FTT and SOL. That month, SOL tumbled from around the $30 mark to as low as $8.\n\nInterestingly though, while it seemed to be the end of the road for the Ethereum killer, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. A team of developers launched BONK, the first memecoin of the Solana ecosystem. The developers emphasized that their goal was to attract liquidity to the Solana ecosystem and rescue the dying token. Thankfully, their plans were met with success.\n\nLate in December and early in January, memecoin fans joined the Bonk ecosystem, and the Bonk airdrop further contributed in boosting liquidity in the Solana ecosystem. At the moment, Solana still seems miles away from its all-time high. However, the token has continued to survive the crypto market storms and would be set to bounce back when a significant bull run occurs. Solana offers a compelling investment opportunity for those looking to invest in the cryptocurrency market. Its speed, low fees, and strong community support make it an attractive option for developers and investors.\n\n5. Pancakeswap\n\nPancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange running on the Binance Smart Chain network. It was launched in September 2020 and has quickly become one of the largest DEXs. Compared to DEXs built on the Ethereum network, Pancakeswap has low transaction fees. This has attracted many retail traders to the exchange.\n\nAnother advantage of PancakeSwap is its yield farming feature, which allows users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to the platform. Liquidity providers make a share of the fees generated by the exchange, and they can also earn CAKE tokens, the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, as a reward for their participation.\n\nNotably, CAKE, the native token of the Pancakeswap ecosystem, was once in the top 20 ranks of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, the price of the CAKE token has fallen drastically recently, and so has its market capitalization. CAKE is now ranked as the 85th largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile its current price and decline in the past two years are discouraging, it is worth noting that the exchange has no competition on the BSC network. Cake currently has the largest liquidity for BSC projects and will continue to be widely utilized.\n\nAdditionally, the price decline presents a massive investment opportunity for investors. If the CAKE token is to reclaim its all-time high, that would be a 20X move from its current price. Factoring the project\u2019s fundamentals and its role in the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, CAKE will have the potential to profit investors in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nUndoubtedly, Tradecurve, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and PancakeSwap tokens have solid fundamentals making them great coins to invest in this year. The crypto market is full of opportunities and now is the time to invest. Notably, optimum profits are not made from well established cryptos but young, innovative tokens with real world usage. Tradecurve has all of these credentials and an exciting future ahead, now is an excellent time to get involved in the presale.\n\nFor more information about Tradecurve (TCRV), visit the links below:\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The correlation dipped below 80% over the week from ATH levels of 97% at the end of 2022.\n\nThe recent price action of the two coins showed that both have moved on a similar wavelength.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] correlation with Ethereum [ETH] dropped to its lowest level since November 2021, indicating a significant divergence in the growth trajectories of the two blue chip cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBased on a 40-day rolling window, the correlation dipped below 80% over the week, according to market data provider Kaiko. This was a marked departure from the all-time high (ATH) levels of 97% seen during the end of 2022.\n\nIs Shapella the reason?\n\nAs depicted, the correlation between the two cryptos has been falling since mid-to-late March. However, the rift widened after the much-awaited Shapella Upgrade went live in April, bringing some improvements unique to Ethereum.\n\nInterestingly, a similar event in September 2022, known as the Merge, which kickstarted Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, failed to bring about a considerable decoupling between the two assets.\n\nBut the recent Shapella Upgrade closed the loop on some of the key aspects of the transition that couldn\u2019t make it to the Merge last year, thus positioning Ethereum as a full-fledged PoS network.\n\nIt is important to understand that both the assets function very differently from each other.\n\nWhile Ethereum is often used as a platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of payment.\n\nInfact, by virtue of being a chain which hosts numerous applications, the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum was a whopping $27 billion at the time of writing. In contrast, Bitcoin held assets worth only $183 million.\n\nWhat can be the implications?\n\nAs per a 21 April report by Coinbase, lower BTC-ETH correlation makes a case for portfolio diversification as holding both the assets can result in higher returns. As for institutional investors, the trend could impact their trading strategies like cross-hedging.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHaving said that, recent price action of the two coins showed that both have moved on a near identical wavelength. Earlier this week, BTC\u2019s crash fueled by a false rumor created ripples in the broader crypto market and ETH didn\u2019t go unscathed.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, BTC was down 8.48% over the last week while Ethereum\u2019s weekly losses were 6.44%."

        "content": "Ethereum developers have taken measures to address the finality issues that occurred on the Beacon chain in the past week. On May 11 and May 12, the Beacon chain, the consensus layer of the Ethereum network, was unable to reach finality on two occasions. The first occurrence lasted for 25 minutes, and the second for over an hour.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of such an incident is yet unknown, it is worth stating that this network glitch had no impact on on-chain activity and transactions were still processed.\n\nEthereum Developers Roll Out Network Patches To Tackle Finality Challenge\n\nIn response to the past week, Ethereum developers have released patches to provide a solution for network users.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Beacom Chain community health analyst superphiz, Teku and Prysm, two of Ethereum\u2019s constitutional clients, have implemented these fixes, which will help prevent further finality issues on the Beacon chain.\n\nWe can start putting this loss of finality issue behind us, @Teku_ConsenSys and @prylabs have deployed fixes that will prevent the attestation flooding. This is one step on our diversity & decentralization journey, let's learn from it and move forward with greater purpose. pic.twitter.com/cSRgPTWeuy \u2014 superphiz.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@superphiz) May 13, 2023\n\nSuperphiz also shared a statement from the Ethereum Foundation in which they are speculating the cause of these \u201cexceptional scenarios\u201d to be the \u201chigh load of some Consensus Layer clients\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation applauded client diversity which made it feasible for transactions to occur on the network, as not all client implementations were affected by the finality challenges.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation also confirmed that the exact cause of the Beacon chain glitch is still unknown. However, they provided assurances that the upgrades implemented by Teku and Prsym would help avoid future occurrences via optimizations that will prevent beacon nodes from high resource usage during these situations.\n\nETH Total Supply Declines Following The Merge\n\nIn other news, Ethereum\u2019s total supply decreased in the months after The Merge.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, The Merge occurred in which the Ethereum network fully transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), leading to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIn the 241 days after this historical event, data from the Ethereum supply analytics platform, ultrasound.money shows that ETH\u2019s total supply has declined by 0.29%.\n\nSince The Merge, over 653,000 ETH has been burned compared to the 425,000 ETH that has been minted in the last eight months resulting in a net negative change of about -227,000 ETH.\n\nInterestingly, ultrasound.money predicts the total ETH supply to have increased at a rate of 3.244% per year had The Merge not occurred.\n\nThat said, if this deflationary trend continues, it would mean good news for long-term ETH investors. This is because a decrease in supply usually results in a rise in value.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,805.77 with a total supply of 122.89 million. Along with most of the market, ETH showed a negative price movement in the last week, losing 5.36% of its value.\n\nETH Trading At $1804.73 | Source: ETHUSD Chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured Image: Forbes, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Uwerx (WERX) Token Sale Reaches New Heights And Could Surpass Bitcoin Cash (BCH) And Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nCrypto investments have been seen to make people wealthy with suitable investments at the right time in the right project.\n\nThis article will give you insights into the market. And hopefully, benefit you enough to guide you in making that suitable investment.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Experiences Massive Mining\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is the fork of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Even though they are often mistaken to be the same coin, they differ primarily in their native currency, Ethereum uses (ETH), while Ethereum Classic uses (ETC).\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) focuses solely on 'immutability,' famously known as 'code is law.' Ethereum Classic (ETC) is fully decentralized and can run a wide range of decentralized applications using its native coin ETC for transactions and smart contracts on its network.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has also moved closer in similarities to Ethereum (ETH). After Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) merge, the computing power of Ethereum Classic (ETC) almost doubled. This is because mining has significantly stopped on the Ethereum (ETH) network.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Launches BCH BULL\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a blockchain forked out of Bitcoin (BTC) to solve Bitcoin's (BTC) throughput issue, which initially took long hours to complete.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) offers lightning-fast transactions than Bitcoin (BTC). Users enjoy cheaper transaction fees, scalability, a maximum block size of 8 megabytes, and an emergency adjustment feature.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) was set up to be a better-suited crypto than Bitcoin (BTC) for affordable, everyday payment.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) recently launched BCH BULL, which lets users create hedge positions on assets like gold and Bitcoin (BTC). This move allows people to permissionlessly lock their Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to external legacy currencies without worrying about the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nUwerx (WERX) Token Price Sees A New High\n\nUwerx aims to be a freelancing platform that maximizes blockchain's ability to offer many advantages to freelancers and companies.\n\nUwerx offers a 1% transaction fee by using smart contracts to eliminate middleman involvement. This means the platform utilizes blockchain to provide cheaper transaction fees compared to 10%-20% of other freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.\n\nUwerx will also see a 25-year liquidity lock on developers\u2019 liquidity, giving investors security on investment. They will also renounce smart contract ownership of the project when it lists on centralized exchanges. In addition, Uwerx has been audited by SolidProof and InterFi Network to promote transparency and long-term viability.\n\nWERX is Uwerx\u2019s native token, and it will be used to transact on the platform. WERX has seen an increase in value recently and is currently priced at $0.0225 per WERX token. The project's stage 4 allocation increased from 60 million to 77.5 million, and presale token allocation has risen to 54% from the previous 45%. Uwerx is also developing an Alpha version of the platform, which will be released next week.\n\nInvestment confidence has also increased, with founders' allocation reduced from 8% to 7%. A new stage 5 presale will soon start with a 72.5 million token allocation, and the hard-cap presale will end on 31st July 2023.\n\nThese three coins are moving forward with massive gains for investors. Still, Uwerx stands tall with excellent investment security, a promising real-world use case, and a successful presale that has boosted the value of WERX.\n\nFollow the links below and learn more about Uwerx and how to benefit from its amazing offers.\n\nPresale: invest.uwerx.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/uwerx_network\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/uwerx_network\n\nWebsite: https://www.uwerx.network\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

        "content": "The Lido liquid staking protocol has enabled Ether withdrawals for the first time, according to May 15 data from Parsec Finance. Over 260 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) was redeemed for its underlying Ether (ETH) in the first three hours, worth about $500,000.\n\nLido is a liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol that allows ETH holders to stake their coins with participating validators and earn additional ETH as a reward. When users stake their ETH with Lido, they receive stETH in return. As users earn ETH from staking, their stETH increases in quantity to reflect the additional rewards.\n\nHowever, before the April 13 Shapella upgrade, Ethereum did not allow validators to withdraw their Ether held in the staking contract. Even after Shapella, Lido users couldn\u2019t withdraw their ETH because Lido\u2019s software did not have a withdrawal function. But on May 15, the Lido decentralized autonomous organization voted to upgrade Lido to version two, allowing withdrawals for the first time.\n\nRelated: New Cosmos chain will use liquid staking coins for security\n\nData from Parsec shows that it took about an hour for stakers to realize that they could withdraw. The first hour of withdrawals produced around 4 ETH ($7,308) worth of redemptions of stETH. But the following hour, redemptions swelled to approximately 227 ETH ($414,956). The pace of redemptions fell the following hour to around 44 ETH ($80,388). Over $500,000 worth of ETH was withdrawn in the first three hours of withdrawals being enabled.\n\nETH withdrawals on Lido. Source: Parsec\n\nLiquid staking solutions have gained in popularity since the Shapella upgrade. On May 1, liquid staking became the top decentralized finance category in terms of total value locked, surpassing even decentralized exchanges, according to DefiLlama. However, there are still some legal questions around liquid staking in the United States, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently stated that it may see staking providers as securities issuers."

        "title": "Crypto Week Ahead: BTC, ETH Show Weak Stance As Binance Exits Canada. New Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino Could Be A Crypto Ally - ABP Live",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, managed to become stable within the $27,000 and $1,800 range, respectlvely, after weeks of slump. They still have some ways to go and need to pick up steam in order to achieve the positive marks of over $28,000 and $1,900, respectively. Binance, the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange in terms of trading, has taken a stance against Canada\u2019s new crypto regulations and has decided to exit the country entirely, which could lead to a blow to crypto prices in the coming day. However, the soon-to-be Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino could prove to be a crypto ally. Read on to find out more.\n\nBefore we proceed further, readers should note that the overall crypto market and coin prices are extremely volatile in nature. There are no foolproof methods to ascertain how cryptocurrencies are expected to behave in the future. This article is aimed at helping investors stay on top of the current market scenarios and the biggest events that have already taken place as well as some upcoming occurrences that are worth noting. Investors are advised to do their own research before taking any call.\n\nCrypto Prices Over The Past Week\n\nLast Monday (May 8), the overall crypto market cap stood at $1.16 trillion. BTC price stood at around $28,210, ETH price stood at around $1,865.\n\nA week later, the overall market cap dipped down to $1.14 trillion, as per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nCheck Out Top Crypto Prices Today\n\nDeFi's total volume stands at $1.65 billion, at 6.31 percent of the total market 24-hour volume. In case of stablecoins, the overall volume stands at $23.09 billion, at 88.42 percent of the total 24-hour market volume.\n\nBTC dominance, at the time of writing, stood at 46.45 percent.\n\nOver the past seven days, Bitcoin achieved a high of $28,299.16 (on May 10) and a low of $25,964.88 (May 13), showing signs of a relatively weak run.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, saw a high of $1,879.84 (May 10) and a low of $1,746.31 (May 12).\n\nCrypto Events To Note\n\nPepe (PEPE), the memecoin that got listed on Binance earlier this month, continues to see a decline in prices, remaining the top loser of the day as per CoinMarketCap (as on May 15).\n\nIn a major development, Binance has announced that it will stop operations in Canada. This was an outcome of the country\u2019s regulatory guidelines on investor limits and stablecoins. The exchange are clearly not happy with the new rules, indicating that they have made the Canadian market unsustainable.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao, on the other hand, is looking to offload a part of his stake in the company and is actively looking at strategies to do so, as per reports.\n\nIn a bit of good news amid the overall gloomy weather, Twitter\u2019s soon-to-be new CEO Linda Yaccarino was spotted following the Shiba Inu (SHIB) account on the microblogging platform. Could this signal adoption of crypto on the platform later on? We\u2019ll have to wait and find out.\n\nWhat Crypto Traders Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin has seen a slight recovery, gaining over 1 percent in the last 24 hours, following a few days of a downward trend. Despite being down 60 percent since its all-time high, the cryptocurrency has made significant gains, nearly 98 percent, since its lowest cycle in January. To initiate a decent increase in the near term, Bitcoin needs to surpass the $27,400 resistance level. However, if it fails to do so, it might experience another decline towards the $27,000 level.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon offered his take, \u201cDespite midweek growth on lower-than-expected inflation readings, Bitcoin and Ethereum faced moderate losses over the last seven days. However, BTC pulled back amid competition from a rising dollar, hitting a two-month low.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Why Shapella looks like a game changer for Ethereum - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Why Shapella looks like a game changer for Ethereum\n\nDr Sreejith Das\n\nby Dr Sreejith Das, CEO and co-founder of Attestant\n\nAnalysts were evenly divided in the run up to the Shapella on April 12, and many thought that the ability to withdraw staked Ether for the first time in years would put downward pressure on the price.\n\nHowever, Ether went up for a period before retreating to where it was before the upgrade.\n\nIn terms of active validators staking in the network, we saw an initial reduction of nearly 3,000 validators, and a further 11,000 currently waiting to exit, but this has been more than offset by the 16,000 new validators waiting to enter.\n\nRather than a predicted reduction in the number of validators staking, we have seen the appetite for staking remain remarkably stable. It would however be a mistake to assume that now the Shapella upgrade has been successfully completed things will carry on as they have been.\n\nFor the first time ever, it is now possible to unstake Ether and get back the original stake.\n\nWhy is this so important? Before now, staking Ether was like buying a bond that didn\u2019t pay coupons, can\u2019t be resold, and had no maturity date. Not an attractive proposition to an institutional investor!\n\nWith the ability to un-stake successfully implemented, it opens up the asset class to a wider range of new investors that were prevented from staking Ether by their disciplined risk management.\n\nThese new investors can choose to run staking software in-house, stake custodially, or use a non-custodial staking service and enjoy all the benefits of the staking return without giving up ownership of their assets and be confident they will get their Ether back on demand.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t some unanswered questions for risk managers and compliance officers at institutional investment firms. Highly regulated institutional investors face challenges when reporting, assessing the jurisdiction, tax status and accounting for staking profits and losses.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade does however remove one major obstacle in that institutions can prove that they can retain custody of their funds and withdraw when they see fit.\n\nThis point has become particularly salient in light of the centralized lending platform collapses that took place in 2022.\n\nNo pension fund trustee would entrust their funds with a bunch of fresh-faced Millennials who have little financial experience or understanding of compliance. However, if they can manage the investment process, any questions related to risk management end.\n\nShapella marks a turning point for institutional investors (that manage trillions of dollars worth of assets), allowing them to earn a return where they couldn\u2019t before.\n\nIn an era of increasing inflation, more limited access to credit and considerable macro-economic uncertainties, the need for greater diversification and strong returns make digital assets an attractive choice.\n\nResearch from Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenization of global illiquid assets to be a 16 trillion dollar business opportunity by 2030. There\u2019ll be no shortage of new and exciting digital assets to invest in, and any well-constructed portfolio will contain a mix of both high risk and low risk investments.\n\nIn order to help facilitate the shift of institutional money to Ethereum, developers should take note of what investors need. They want access points to gain exposure to digital assets, they want a variety of products with varying levels of risk and returns that currently don\u2019t exist or are very limited.\n\nIt is clear that the digital asset industry will have to step up its service offering if it\u2019s to evolve into the future of finance, and developers should look to structure new products aimed at institutional investors that acknowledge concerns they might have related to fraud and volatility.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade may have passed without much fanfare, but we might look back in the future and recognise this as being the pivotal moment when the cryptocurrency industry matured and answered long-held compliance issues from institutional investors.\n\nDigital assets have come a long way in the last decade from being a fringe movement on the sidelines of finance to a multi-trillion dollar asset class, the next decade will see this industry continue to grow and gain the legitimacy of institutional investment."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum face challenges, Liechtenstein embraces BTC, and Tether reports huge profit\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a downward trend, moving from around $28,000 to a low of roughly $26,500, before it started to recover. BTC is now changing hands at $27,400.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, moved in a similar way with a downward movement from $1,850 to less than $1,750, before a recovery started to take it to the $1,830 mark.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week varied, with some of the most significant surrounding congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and glitches on the Ethereum network. Bitcoin\u2019s congestion, partly driven by the growing popularity of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) Ordinals, saw leading exchange Binance briefly halt BTC withdrawals before adjusting withdrawal fees.\n\nWe've temporarily closed #BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions.\n\n\n\nOur team is currently working on a fix and will reopen $BTC withdrawals as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nRest assured, funds are SAFU. May 8, 2023\n\nThe exchange revealed at the time it will keep on monitoring on-chain activity and \u201cadjust accordingly if needed.\u201d It also added it\u2019s working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which would alleviate such situations in the future.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s congestion comes at a time when liquidity has seemingly started dropping. According to CCData\u2019s Order Book data, Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to accommodate sizable orders without substantial price fluctuations has diminished since 2023.\n\nPer the data, the amount of BTC needed to change the price by 1% dropped from 1,400 ($23 million) in January to 462 ($13 million) in April.\n\nWhile Bitcoin suffered from congestion, an unexpected disruption occurred on Ethereum that saw the network become temporarily unable to fully authenticate transactions. The hiccup only lasted 25 minutes and while blocks were being proposed, they were not being finalized.\n\nParticipants using the blockchain noticed that their transactions were seemingly processing as usual, but during the 25-minute stretch of irregularity, these transactions were susceptible to being altered because of the malfunction.\n\nLiechtenstein to accept Bitcoin for state services\n\nLiechtenstein\u2019s Prime Minister and Finance Minister Daniel Risc has revealed that the country will soon allow Bitcoin payments for state services, which will be instantly converted to Swiss francs, its official currency.\n\nHe also expressed interest in investing some of the state\u2019s reserves, which amount to 2.23 billion francs (about $2.51 billion), in cryptoassets in the future. The country, which has no debt, saves three times its annual budget of 900 million francs (around $1 billion) and invests it in securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) National Security Division is said to be investigating cryptocurrency exchange Binance for allegedly allowing Russians to use its platform in violation of US sanctions.\n\nThe company and its executives have not been accused of anything related to the investigation, which is part of a national security probe and a criminal division investigation. Binance restricted its services in Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022.\n\nHowever, according to a company executive, the exchange continued operations, blocking only certain areas of Ukraine no longer under government control and servicing non-sanctioned individuals.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time in which Binance has seen its spot trading volume suffer a 48% fall last month, marking the second consecutive month of declines for the cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nAccording to CCData\u2019s latest Exchange Review report, Binance\u2019s trading volume dropped to $287 billion last month, recording its second-lowest monthly trading volume since 2021\n\nOver the week two of the world\u2019s top market-making firms, Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, have also chosen to scale down their cryptocurrency trading operations in the United States as regulators crack down on the industry.\n\nJane Street has been in the crypto market since 2017 while Jump Crypto, the crypto division of Jump Trading, is shrinking its US presence while growing its operations abroad. Both firms still operate as market makers on a smaller scale, and haven\u2019t completely stopped their crypto activities.\n\nNotably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a formidable force in American corporate advocacy, has taken up arms for digital asset industry players who have been vocally critical of U.S. regulatory approaches.\n\nThe Chamber has thrown its considerable weight behind the legal challenge brought against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Coinbase, which came as Coinbase asks the SEC to clarify its rules for the industry.\n\nTether reports $1.5 billion profit\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has recently disclosed a Q1 net profit of $1.5 billion, a figure that more than doubles its 2022 performance from the same period. As of May 9, the company\u2019s consolidated total assets were approximately $81.8 billion, while its consolidated liabilities amounted to $79.4 billion.\n\nIn a groundbreaking step, Tether, the entity responsible for USDT, has expanded its reserves report to include new categories. This marks the first instance of the company openly declaring its investment in bitcoin, physical gold, overnight repo, and corporate bonds.\n\nThe disclosed holdings include $1.5 billion in bitcoin and a substantial $3.3 billion in precious metals, which are likely being used to back Tether\u2019s gold-backed cryptocurrency, Tether Gold (XAUT).\n\nWhile Tether is reporting significant profits, crypto exchange Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware. The exchange estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors, between $500 million and $1 billion in assets, and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee is on the High End - Tekedia",
        "content": "If you have ever used Ethereum to process transactions on the Blockchain, you might have noticed that the gas fee is not cheap. Gas fee is the amount of Ether that you pay to the network for processing your transaction. The gas fee depends on two factors: the gas price and the gas limit.\n\nThe gas price is the amount of ether that you are willing to pay for each unit of gas, and the gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction can consume. The higher the gas price and the gas limit, the higher the gas fee.\n\nWhy is the Gas Fee so high on Ethereum Network?\n\nThe main reason is that Ethereum is a popular platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that run on smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that execute automatically on the blockchain according to predefined rules.\n\nHowever, smart contracts also consume gas when they are executed, and some of them can be very complex and require a lot of computation. Therefore, when there is a high demand for dApps and smart contracts on Ethereum, the network becomes congested and the gas fee increases.\n\nHow To reduce Gas Fee on Ethereum Network\n\nThere are a few ways to save on gas fees when using Ethereum. One way is to adjust your gas price and gas limit according to the network conditions. You can use tools like Etherscan or EthGasStation to check the current average gas price and the recommended gas price for fast or slow transactions.\n\nYou can also use MetaMask or other wallets that allow you to customize your gas price and gas limit before sending a transaction. However, you should be careful not to set your gas price too low or your gas limit too high, as this might result in your transaction being rejected or stuck in the network.\n\nAnother way to reduce the gas fee on Ethereum is to use layer 2 solutions or sidechains. Layer 2 solutions are protocols that run on top of Ethereum and provide faster and cheaper transactions by using different consensus mechanisms or off-chain computation.\n\nSome examples of layer 2 solutions are Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, zkSync, Loopring, and StarkWare. Sidechains are independent blockchains that are compatible with Ethereum and allow users to transfer assets between them.\n\nSome examples of side chains are xDai, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. By using layer 2 solutions or sidechains, you can avoid paying high gas fees on the main Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum gas fee is not cheap because of the high demand for dApps and smart contracts on the platform. However, you can reduce the gas fee by adjusting your gas price and gas limit or by using layer 2 solutions or sidechains. These DApps and smart contracts require a lot of computation and storage, which consume a lot of gas.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum has transitioned to a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which requires a lot of energy and resources to secure the network. PoW also limits the scalability of Ethereum, as it can only process around 15 transactions per second.\n\nPoS has helped stimulate lower gas fees significantly on the Ethereum network, as it will reduce the need for intensive computation and competition among miners. Ethereum is not cheap, but it is valuable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "After the major upgrade to the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem launched in mid-April that enabled investors to withdraw their staked ETH, the staking returns on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap have reached record highs.\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum staking annualized rate of return, or the interest rate for running an ETH validator, at press time, stood at 8.76%, which is a historical high since the Shanghai update introduced staking withdrawals, according to the latest data retrieved from analytics platform Token Unlocks on May 15.\n\nSpecifically, since the implementation of unstaking on the Ethereum network, investors have deposited 3.44 million ETH into ETH 2.0 contracts, whereas they have withdrawn 2.67 million ETH at a net pledge of 770.70k ETH (worth around $1.41 billion), as the recent information shows.\n\nHistorical Ethereum statistics.

        "content": "On May 11th and 12th, the Ethereum network was hit by two separate incidents that caused a significant loss in Finality. According to a recent tweet by Glassnode, over 60% of validators on the network stopped performing their duties during these incidents.\n\nOn May 11th and 12th, the #Ethereum network experienced two occasions where over 60% of the validators stopped performing their duties, causing a loss in Finality.\n\n\n\nFinality refers to the state where a supermajority of validators (2/3 of the total stake) have attested to the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/H13rdYeFPP \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 14, 2023\n\nFinality is a crucial state where a supermajority of validators (2/3 of the total stake) have attested to the final state of the blockchain, ensuring that a block and its processed transactions cannot be altered or removed from the blockchain.\n\nDue to the absence of up to 60% of validators, the Ethereum chain\u2019s performance was impacted, leading to a degradation in performance.\n\nDaily slots of about 3.68% were missed, and 253 blocks were not proposed on time. However, this was still lower than the 658 blocks missed during the Shapella upgrade.\n\nOn a more technical level, some consensus layer clients encountered older attestations and were forced to load up older states for verification, which caused these systems to overheat and malfunction.\n\nNevertheless, some clients did not encounter this issue due to a difference in design approach. Hence, validators running these clients continued to process transactions and produce blocks.\n\nIn both incidents, the affected validators returned online within 20 minutes and an hour, respectively, with the participation rate quickly jumping back to over 98%.\n\nInactivity Leak: A First For Ethereum Network\n\nFortunately, these incidents did not affect end-users on the Ethereum mainnet, and transactions continued to be processed as usual. However, the second incident resulted in the first-ever Inactivity Leak, an emergency state utilized to recover Finality on the Beacon Chain.\n\nAn inactivity Leak is a state where inactive validators are increasingly penalized until they are diluted out of the chain or begin participating once more.\n\nDuring the Inactivity Leak, the amounts subtracted from validators\u2019 beacon chain accounts are effectively burned, resulting in less ETH issuance during that time.\n\nNevertheless, these incidents serve as a reminder of the importance of network security and the need for a reliable and robust validator ecosystem. However, the Ethereum community must continue to take proactive measures to prevent future incidents and ensure the smooth operation of the network.\n\nRelated Reading | Weekly Market Watch: Bitcoin & Ethereum Tumble While Altcoins Struggle To Survive"
