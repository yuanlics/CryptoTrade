        "title": "Is Ethereum Losing Steam in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market has been having a tough year, to put it mildly. Prices are down across the board, the FTX implosion has left a bad taste in many investors' mouths, and more skeptics are voicing their concerns about the industry's future. While Ethereum (ETH 0.09%) has consistently given investors reason to be optimistic, it's also been hit hard -- falling nearly 70% from its peak in late 2021.\n\nGiven everything that's been happening in the crypto market lately, is Ethereum still a strong investment? Or is it losing steam in 2023? Here's what you need to know.\n\nReasons to be optimistic\n\nDespite the current market volatility, 2022 was a big year for Ethereum. The network successfully completed The Merge, transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) mining protocol to proof of stake (PoS), and dramatically decreasing its energy usage.\n\nThis was a major win for Ethereum and could also help it gain market share from the notoriously energy-intensive Bitcoin. It also sets the stage for future updates that will help improve Ethereum's speed and efficiency.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason to be optimistic about Ethereum's future, though, is its potential in the decentralized application space. Ethereum is one of the most diversified investments in the crypto space because it's the leading blockchain within multiple niches. It's the most popular platform for NFT marketplaces, for example, and a key player in the metaverse. Its smart-contract abilities could also revolutionize a variety of industries.\n\nThe blockchain can also host other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is home to well-known projects like Shiba Inu, Polygon, Decentraland, and The Sandbox. If NFTs, the metaverse, smart contracts, or any of these Ethereum-hosted cryptocurrencies succeed, the network will benefit from it.\n\nDownsides to consider\n\nThe biggest reason to be skeptical of Ethereum right now is the fact that crypto, in general, is still speculative. Nobody knows for certain whether crypto will succeed over the long term or if it will even exist a decade or two from now. If the entire sector fails, it won't matter how strong the individual cryptocurrencies are.\n\nAlso, because the crypto industry moves so quickly, a new blockchain could disrupt Ethereum's competitive advantage. While Ethereum is a clear leader in the crypto space, its sluggish transaction times and high fees have been holding it back -- and users are getting frustrated.\n\nThe network does have updates in the pipeline to address these issues. But the major ones aren't expected to be completed until late 2023 or 2024, at the earliest. (And Ethereum has a history of delaying upgrades by months or even years.)\n\nThat's a long time in the crypto world, and a smaller competitor could swoop in and steal market share from Ethereum in the meantime.\n\nIs Ethereum still a good investment?\n\nWhen deciding whether to invest in Ethereum in 2023, it's important to weigh risk versus reward. The cryptocurrency has its drawbacks, and the future of crypto, in general, is still uncertain. There are no guarantees that any investment will survive over the long term, so consider your risk tolerance before you buy.\n\nThat said, Ethereum remains one of the strongest crypto assets in the game right now. It's not only the second-most-popular crypto behind Bitcoin, but it's also diversified into several different areas of the industry -- from NFTs to the metaverse, and more.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is a key player in the crypto industry. Despite its short-term volatility, it has a better chance of succeeding over the long run than many other cryptocurrencies. While nobody knows for certain what will happen, Ethereum still has plenty of growth potential."

        "content": "BNB Chain deployed the highest number of dApps throughout 2022 with 2,163 dApps, while Ethereum ranked first for amount of NFT transactions, according to a recent report by DappRadar.\n\nWith 21.2 million transactions, Ethereum (ETH) became the busiest platform for NFT sales in 2022, followed by WAX (WAXP) and Polygon (MATIC) at second and third place with 14.5 million 13.3 million transactions, respectively. Meanwhile, BNB Chain only recorded 1 million NFT transactions throughout the year.\n\ndApp Integrations\n\nEven though it recorded a 7% decrease since 2021, BNB Chain remained at the top of the list by integrating 2,163 dApps in 2022. Polygon and Ethereum are second and third in the ranking, with over 500 integrations each.\n\nExcept for BNB Chain, Ethereum, and TRON (TRX), all others recorded increases in the number of integrated dApps.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, BNB Chain\u2019s dominance of dApp integrations sits at 36.7%, as opposed to 43.7% in 2021. Coming second in line, Polygon\u2019s dominance also decreased slightly to 12.8% in 2022 from 13% in 2021. Ethereum\u2019s dominance also shrunk from 16.4% in 2021 to 11.4%\n\nApplications that posed a high financial or operational risk were the dominant dApp category for BNB Chain, with 31%. Gaming and NFT were the most prevalent categories for Polygon and Ethereum, with 21% and 35%, respectively.\n\nNFT Sales\n\nEthereum-based NFT sales exceeded 21.2 million in 2022 \u2014 a 207% increase from 2021\u2019s 6.9 million.\n\nWax and Polygon followed Ethereum as second and third with 14.5 million and 13.3 million transactions, respectively. Despite its leading performance in dApp installments, BNB Chain is ranked at the bottom of the list with 1 million NFT transactions.\n\nBased on year-over-year growth percentages, however, Solana (SOL) and Immutable X (IMX) surpass Ethereum as first and second. As opposed to Ethereum\u2019s 207% growth, Solana\u2019s transaction count recorded a 440% increase, while Immutable X grew by 315%.\n\nEthereum is also the network with the highest intrinsic NFT value in 2022, with over $300 per NFT transaction. Polygon and Solana follow Ethereum as second and third, with $104 and $88 per transaction, respectively.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The S&P 500 metric showed a price correction while Ethereum continued an uptrend.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit was over 67% at press time, representing a four-month high for Ethereum.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] rose dramatically over the last few days, which indicated a bull trend. Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum and equity prices go in opposite directions\n\nRecent information indicated that Ethereum\u2019s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment\u2019s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.\n\nWhen the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit hits four-month high\n\nBesides the stock market\u2019s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.\n\nThe graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.\n\nMVRV shows reduced loss\n\nWhen the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of Ethereum.\n\nThough a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum remains in the overbought zone\n\nA daily timeframe chart of Ethereum\u2019s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory."

        "content": "Over the course of the past three weeks, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has seen a meteoric rise. Despite the fact that are a few bearish indications that appear along the levels of lower timeframes, bulls have still continued to prevail. However, as per recent analysis by experts, the price seems to indicate a trend exhaustion that could be underway.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Surge\n\nThe price of Ethereum has increased by 38% since the beginning of 2023 and is presently trading in the $1,650 range. Because of this enormous rise, new all-time highs were established on January 13 and 20. And, in spite of the fact that there is a clear theoretical prognosis for the Ethereum price to reverse, there is a possibility that there will be a liquidity run, which might result in a third higher high being reached.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More: Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023\n\nThis has been echoed by industry stalwarts like Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, who is of the opinion that ETH can continue rallying towards $1,700-1,730 before facing any sort of rejection. Earlier, when the ETH price had dipped, Micheal noted that those dips were the \u201cbest options before the relief rally occurs\u201d.\n\nIn this scenario, bulls have a possibility of making a comeback if they can drive the momentum signal to create a higher high at the same time. In the event that buyers are unable to make this occur, investors should expect a moderate trend reversal. Bears need to push prices below $1,568\u2014a level that serves as a support for higher time frames\u2014in order to generate momentum against buyers. If the support level of $1,568 is breached and turned into a resistance level, it will clear the way for sellers to push the price of Ethereum down to the support levels of $1,417, $1,331, and $1,227. ETH To Cross $2K? On the other hand, few experts tend to believe that the uptrend for Ethereum is far from being done. ETH bulls must stage a rebound in order to force the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to create another higher-high in the overbought area in their quest to gather liquidity resting above $1,650. The $1,820 barrier can become a support floor for Ethereum pricing if it is overcome, according to experts. Concurrently if the RSI supports this upward climb, the bearish argument will be refuted & a similar development would make ETH retest the psychological threshold of $2,000 as well. As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,661. This represents an increase of 6% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 9% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nOver the course of the past 20 days, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, has moved about $12 million worth of cryptocurrency between his several wallets. According to the findings of LookOnChain\u2019s investigation, the \u201cwhale\u201d address that ends in 0x9e92 and has received 9,300 ETH in the past 20 days may be connected in some way to the person who created the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe recipient of the payments is most likely Vitalik, given the receiving address, which ends in \u201c0xd04d,\u201d has only received money from the wallet known as Vb3 so far, says LookOnChain.\n\nFollowing the completion of the transaction, the whale now possesses a total of 170,913 ETH, which has a value of around $265.3 million at press time. The history of the transaction does not indicate any activity that would lead us to believe that the whale is in fact connected to a certain exchange or operates as an unregulated counter.\n\nWhy is Vitalik Selling His Ethereum Holdings?\n\nThere does not seem to be any particular reason for Vitalik to be selling his crypto assets; but, in the past, we have seen that this has a negative influence on the price of Ethereum.\n\nThis is due to the fact that there are users, traders, and investors in crypto that follow him on social media and keep tabs on what he does. This action may cause a widespread pessimistic outlook, which, in turn, will have a negative impact on the price of Ether.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the second biggest cryptocurrency has been seeing some rather solid bullish movement, and at one point, it even managed to break over the $1,600 level. The coin has reached a resistance point of around $1,500 and is now trading at roughly $1,550 at the time of this publication.\n\nIn addition, the alternative coin\u2019s price has increased by more than 10% in the previous week, making it one of the assets that are now doing its best. On-chain signals indicate that the bulls have acquired a fractionally greater amount than the bears. We can only hope that this state of affairs persists and that Vitalik\u2019s activities have no impact on the token\u2019s value."

        "content": "Ethereum plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency sphere making it command the center stage of the overall blockchain technology. ETH is the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $187 billion and has generated enormous profits for investors during its hay day. From a modest start of $1 in the indices in 2015 to touching a high of $4,878 in 2021, ETH has created millionaires along the way. Despite the dip in 2022, ETH remains to be a safe long-term investment as it boasts various use cases in the Defi sector.\n\nAlso Read: XRP or ADA: Which Cryptocurrency Might Reach $1 First?\n\nHere\u2019s Why Ethereum Is A Safe Long Term Bet\n\nHighest Developer Activity\n\nEthereum is always buzzing with developments as it receives the highest developer activity compared to other Layer-1 blockchains. Despite the market downturn, the blockchain experienced an increase in activity and a spurt in projects supporting the DeFi cause. Around 5,750 developers work on different smart contract platforms adding 234 new developers between December 2021 and 2022 alone.\n\nElectric Capital published data showing that Ethereum\u2019s developer activity is 2.8x higher than its competitor PolkaDot. The network is always brimming with activity making it the centerpiece of decentralized blockchain technology.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Gearing Up to Reach $1,800?\n\nSource: Electric Capital\n\nThe ETH Deflationary Status\n\nThe Ethereum network went from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake protocol after The Merge in September 2022. Since the Merge, around 2,464 ETH have been burned and removed from circulation. If Ethereum remained as PoW, it would have added 1.48 million ETH to the network.\n\nThe ETH Staking\n\nThe staking option is now enabled after the Ethereum network moved from PoW to PoS last year. Since then, 16 million ETH is staked and the present staking returns are around 5.3% Annualized Percentage Rate (APR). ETH being a deflationary asset with staking yields, many investors would earn passive income throughout the tenure. The total staked amount would go much above 16 million in 2023 putting the tokens constantly to work.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin at $20,000 is Full of Roses: Where are the Thorns?\n\nIn conclusion, all these developments make Ethereum a safe long-term bet that could pay off in the long run.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $1,549 and is up 2.1% in the 24 hours day trade. ETH is down 68.2% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it reached in November 2021."

        "title": "Three reasons why Ethereum is the safer long-term bet - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price hovers around $1,550 after a bullish start to 2023.\n\nInvestors are already detailing fundamental reasons why the current levels are the best place to accumulate ETH.\n\nDeveloper activity, deflationary status, and staking are a few of the most important reasons that make the smart contract token stand out from the rest.\n\nEthereum has played an extremely important role in building the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the world. Although many blockchains were launched after Bitcoin\u2019s start in 2009, ETH became a major focus of speculation due to the wide range of potential applications it could offer if it were to be successful. Now, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of $187 billion.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at three reasons why Ethereum may be a good long-term investment.\n\nDeveloper Activity\n\nDespite a good start to 2022, the latter half of the year was brutal and caused investors to suffer significant losses as key players in the industry collapsed. This caused many projects to go under due to affiliation or lack of funds. Regardless, the developer activity seen in the Ethereum blockchain failed to decline.\n\nThe ETH blockchain saw an addition of 234 new developers between December 2021 and 2022, with a total of 5,750 developers working on the smart contract platform. The number of developers combined with the activity of these builders is one of the best ways to measure the value of a particular blockchain. Additionally, as noted in Electric Capital\u2019s developer report, ETH\u2019s ecosystem of developers is 2.8x higher than the next one, which is Polkadot.\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s developer report\n\nDeflationary status\n\nSince the implementation of the Merge update 126 days ago, a total of 2,464 ETH have been burned or taken out of existence. The Merge was a hard fork that migrated Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. In contrast, if Ethereum had stuck with PoW, there would have been 1.48 million ETH added to the network.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, the deflationary aspects make Ethereum one of the best investment vehicles as Bitcoin is still an inflationary asset since roughly 328,000 BTC are minted per year until all 21 million BTCs are mined.\n\nETH ultrasound\n\nStaking\n\nEthereum enabled staking when it moved from PoW to PoS, and since then, 16 million ETH have been staked. The current staking reward sits around 5.3% Annualized Percentage Rate (APR).\n\nMore recently, it was announced that the Ethereum blockchain would soon undergo another upgrade known as Shanghai, which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH.\n\nETH staked\n\nCombining this information with the Ethereum being a deflationary asset, the real staking yields will only increase in the future. Additionally, with the Shanghai upgrade, users can stake and unstake at will, which is likely to result in a high participation rate, pushing the total staked ETH much higher by 16 million ETH."

        "title": "Going cashless: Norway's digital currency project raises privacy questions - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The small Nordic country of Norway may not be particularly notable on the global crypto map. With its 22 blockchain solution providers, the nation doesn\u2019t stand out even at the regional level.\n\nHowever, as the race to test and implement central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) accelerates every day, the Scandinavian nation is taking an active stance on its own national digital currency. In fact, it was among the first countries to begin the work on a CBDC back in 2016.\n\nDropping cash\n\nIn recent years, amid a rise in cashless payment methods and concern over cash-enabled illicit transactions, some Norwegian banks have moved to remove cash options altogether.\n\nIn 2016, Trond Bentestuen, then an executive at major Norwegian bank DNB, proposed to stop using cash as a means of payment in the country:\n\n\u201cToday, there is approximately 50 billion kroner in circulation and [the country\u2019s central bank] Norges Bank can only account for 40 percent of its use. That means that 60 percent of money usage is outside of any control.\u201d\n\nA year before that, another large Norwegian bank, Nordea, also refused to accept cash, leaving only one branch in Oslo Central Station to continue handling cash.\n\nThis sentiment came in parallel with Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm, as DNB enabled its customers to buy BTC via its mobile app, local courts demanded that convicted drug dealers pay their fines in crypto, and local newspapers widely discussed investments in digital assets.\n\nRecent: Bitcoin mining in a university dorm: A cooler BTC story\n\nLast year Torbj\u00f8rn H\u00e6geland, executive director for financial stability at Norway\u2019s central bank, Norges Bank, outlined to the project\u2019s goal of replacing cash use in the country:\n\n\"With this background, the decline in cash use and other structural changes in the payment system are key drivers for the project.\"\n\nThe experimental phase of the Norwegian CBDC will last until June 2023 and end with recommendations from the central bank on whether the implementation of a prototype is necessary.\n\nEthereum is the key\n\nIn September 2022, Norges Bank released the open-source code for the Ethereum-backed digital currency sandbox. Available on GitHub, the sandbox is designed to offer an interface for interacting with the test network, enabling functions like minting, burning and transferring ERC-20 tokens.\n\nHowever, the second part of the source code, announced to go public by mid-September, has yet to be revealed. As specified in a blog post, the initial use of open-source code was not a \u201csignal that the technology will be based on open-source code,\u201d but a \u201cgood starting point for learning as much as possible in collaboration with developers and alliance partners.\u201d\n\nNorges Bank in Oslo. Source: Reuters/Gwladys Fouche\n\nEarlier, the bank revealed its principal partner in building the infrastructure for the project \u2014 Nahmii, a Norway-based developer of a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum of the same name. The company has been working on this scaling technology for Ethereum for several years and has its own network and tokens. At this point, the test network for the Norwegian CBDC uses not the public Ethereum ecosystem, but a private version of the enterprise blockchain Hyperledger Besu.\n\nIn late 2022, Norway became part of Project Icebreaker, a joint exploration with the central banks of Israel, Norway and Sweden on how CBDCs can be used for cross-border payments. Within its framework, the three central banks will connect their domestic proof-of-concept CBDC systems. The final report for the project is scheduled for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nLocal specifics, universal problems\n\nIn terms of hopes and fears, what defines the Norwegian CBDC project among others is the national regulatory context. Like its geographical neighbors, Norway is known for its cautious approach to the digital assets market, with high taxes and the relatively small scale of its domestic crypto ecosystem \u2014 a recent study by EU Blockchain Observatory estimated its total equity funding at a modest $26.9 million.\n\nNorwegian serial entrepreneur Sander Andersen, who has recently moved his fintech company to Switzerland, doubts that the upcoming project will co-exist peacefully with the crypto industry. There are already more than enough problems for tech entrepreneurs in the country, he said in a chat with Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cDespite the country's strong infrastructure for entrepreneurs in other industries, such as low energy costs and free education, these benefits do not extend to the digital realm. The tax burden faced by digital companies makes it nearly impossible to compete with businesses based in more business-friendly jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nAs central bank digital currencies have the potential to compete with private cryptocurrencies, and the goal of any government is to control financial transactions as tightly as possible, Andersen doesn\u2019t see Norway among the exceptions:\n\n\u201cThe Norwegian central bank's CBDC project can also pose a threat to the legal status of private stablecoins in the country. The introduction of a CBDC may prompt increased regulation and oversight of private stablecoins, making it harder for these companies to operate.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin, a company contributing its contracts library to the Norges Bank project, doesn\u2019t sound so pessimistic. From a technical perspective, he emphasized, there is nothing stopping private stablecoins from trading and operating alongside CBDCs on both public and private Ethereum networks, especially if they use common, compatible token standards such as ERC-20.\n\nHowever, from a policy perspective, there\u2019s nothing that can stop central banks from performing financial gatekeeping and enforcing the Know Your Customer (KYC) standards, and this is where the CBDC looks like a natural development. Banks will not sit idly by as the blockchain ecosystem grows, as there is a lot of shadow-banking activity happening on-chain, Lewellen specified, adding:\n\n\u201cCBDCs offer central banks the ability to better perform gatekeeping and enforce KYC rules on CBDC holders, whereas enforcing the same standards against entities using non-governmental stablecoins is far more challenging.\u201d\n\nRecent: Ava Labs and Amazon\u2019s partnership could \u2018expand the pie\u2019 for blockchain\n\nCould Norway\u2019s CBDC offer anything reassuring in terms of users\u2019 privacy? It\u2019s hardly possible from both technological and strategic points of view, Lewellen said. Today, a mature solution doesn\u2019t exist that would allow privacy in a compliant manner regarding the use of CBDCs.\n\nAny national digital currency would almost certainly require every address to be linked to an identity, using KYC and other means we see in banks today. In fact, if done on the private ledger, like the one that Norges Bank is testing right now, the CBDC will offer not only less privacy for a single customer, but at the same time less public transparency with regard to blockchains."

(\u201cMTMT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE American: MTMT), today announced that the Company closed its initial round of private placement (\u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) launched on December 23, 2022 and will issue an aggregate of 4,314,615 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $1.30 per share for aggregate gross of approximately $5.6 million. In addition, the Company had completed the private placement of $4.4 million previously in October 2022.\n\n\n\nIn the past 3 months, the Company raised over $10 million in total to develop its new business model in digital assets staking. The new business model is two-fold: engaging in solo-staking and providing staking as a service (\u201cStaaS\u201d). The Company has previously explored Solo-Staking in Q3 2022 and plans to pursue its StaaS under Saving Digital Pte. Ltd., the Company\u2019s Singapore subsidiary.\n\nSolo-Staking enables the Company to utilize its Ethereum (ETH) treasury to stake on the Ethereum beacon chain and to earn ETH-denominated rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. The Company will operate StaaS through its staking platform \u201cMarsProtocol,\u201d an individual and institutional grade designed staking platform, assisting users to participate in staking to earn ETH rewards and yield in a safer, more stable, and more efficient way. For more information, please visit: http://www.marsprotocol.com.\n\nFollowing the transition by Ethereum on September 15, 2022 from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (the \u201cMerge\u201d), Ethereum shifted to a PoS validation system where validators stake their ETH into a smart contract on Ethereum to serve as collateral that can be destroyed if the validator behaves dishonestly or lazily. The validator (selected randomly) is then responsible for processing the blockchain transactions, storing data and adding new blocks to the blockchain. To become a validator on Ethereum, a participant must stake 32 ETH. MarsProtocol will seek to provide a non-custodian StaaS platform where its users\u2019 private keys are not stored in its data base to ensure the safety of its users\u2019 digital assets.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about our new business strategy, and we are looking forward to provide the excellent digital assets staking services through MarsProtocol enabling users to earn ETH rewards through an easy-to-use platform,\" said Mr. Yucheng Hu, CEO of Mega Matrix Corp.\n\nAbout Mega Matrix: Mega Matrix Corp.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Invest in Crypto in 2023 -- and 1 Reason Not To - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the last year has been rough for crypto.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 0.59%) and Ethereum (ETH 0.13%) are both down roughly 70% from their peaks, and Cardano and Solana have plummeted by around 90%. Those numbers are tough to stomach, and many investors have fled the crypto market in recent months.\n\nIf you're nervous about the market right now, you're not alone. But should you keep investing? There are three reasons to stick with crypto in 2023, and one reason you're better off avoiding it for now.\n\nWhy now could be a smart buying opportunity\n\n1. Prices are at rock bottom\n\nAt its peak, Bitcoin cost nearly $70,000 per token, and Ethereum was priced at close to $5,000 per token. Today, Bitcoin stands at just under $21,000, with Ethereum at roughly $1,500.\n\nIf you've been looking for a more affordable time to invest in crypto, you may not get a better chance than right now. The crypto market is essentially on clearance at the moment, and it's possible to load up on quality investments for a fraction of the price.\n\n2. The upswing could be lucrative\n\nOf course, nobody knows for certain whether the crypto market will recover. However, downturns like this aren't necessarily uncommon in this industry, and major cryptocurrencies have faced worse in the past.\n\nFor example, back in 2018, Ethereum's price fell by nearly 95% over the course of the year. If you had invested at its lowest point, you would have seen returns of nearly 4,500% over the following three years alone.\n\nAgain, it's unclear what the future holds for crypto, and we may not see another rally similar to the 2020-2021 surge. But even if cryptocurrencies don't reach their all-time highs again anytime soon, even a relatively small upswing could still be lucrative if you invest at rock-bottom prices.\n\n3. You might regret not investing\n\nCrypto is a speculative investment, so nobody -- even the experts -- knows how it will fare over the long term. While it could fail, it could also change the world.\n\nWhen you're deciding whether to invest, consider which of these options you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if crypto fails, or not investing and missing out on the investment of a lifetime if crypto succeeds.\n\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean you should go all-in and invest every dollar you have in crypto. As with any investment, it's important to buy wisely and only invest what you can afford. But for some people, it's worth risking a little money to avoid the regret of not taking this chance.\n\nWhy it may be best to avoid crypto\n\n1. You're a risk-averse investor\n\nFor all its potential, crypto also carries a significant amount of risk. At the moment, it's impossible to know whether crypto will succeed, and there's always a chance that you could lose whatever you invest. If money is tight, now may not be the best time to buy.\n\nAlso, this investment is notorious for its extreme volatility. Even in good times, it can experience nauseating ups and downs. Not all investors have the stomach for crypto, and that's OK. If you know you'd lose sleep over that level of volatility, you might be better off sticking to stocks for now.\n\nThe future of crypto is uncertain, and whether you choose to invest now will depend largely on your risk tolerance and personal preferences. But if a rebound is on the way, right now may be one of the best chances to buy."

        "content": "Tel-Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- SSV.Network\n\nssv.network DAO is launching a $50 Million Ecosystem Fund dedicated to supporting the development of Distributed Validator Technology (\u201cDVT\u201d) based applications. To usher in the next wave of Ethereum staking technologies, a host of Staking companies and VCs from the crypto space - including the likes of DCG, OKX, HashKey, NGC, Everstake, HackVC, GSR, Chorus.One, SevenX, 1kx, and more - have joined forces to help advance the next generation of staking solutions. All of these major players have come together to promote Ethereum\u2019s decentralization through the use of DVT.\n\nThe Fund is the first of its kind, dedicated solely to DVT use cases. Partners backing up the Fund are placing a special emphasis on helping projects that will support Ethereum\u2019s decentralization over the long run as more stakers join the network. DVT and the various use cases being built using the tech are similar to the early days of L2 implementations. However, each technology works on its own specific problem, DVT, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralization, and L2s, which focuses on transaction speed and lowering costs.\n\nThe Fund's purpose is to Solidify DVT as critical Ethereum infrastructure\n\nDVT is a key component in Vitalik\u2019s Ethereum's roadmap toward a fully decentralized Ethereum 2.0. The ssv.network is the first implementation of DVT and has positioned itself as Ethereum's security layer - or Layer 0. With each Ethereum validator that uses DVT, the network becomes more decentralized and secure, bringing it one step closer to a global network uncensorable by any one entity.\n\nEarlier this year, the ssv.network DAO pledged $3 Million for developer grants. In less than 12 months, over $1.2 Million has been allocated to over 20 leading companies in the Proof of Stake (\u201cPOS\u201d) ecosystem. Among the grantees are industry-leading builders, including Blockscape, ANKR, Stader, Moonstake, and others using DVT to build their next-gen applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe time to build is now!\n\nTotal ETH at stake has officially reached 16 million, with the majority of it concentrated in the hands of a few players. It leaves the Ethereum ecosystem in demand for decentralizing factors such as DVT. Considering that the Shanghai update and the ssv.network\u2019s mainnet are approaching in 2023, there has never been a better time to build than the present.\n\nAlon Muroch, Core Dev Lead - \u201dDistributing Ethereum\u2019s security layer has never been more important. The protocol is currently secured by a small group of companies which, when put together, control the entire Blockchain. DVT\u2019s aim is to distribute Ethereum\u2019s security by offering quick and easy access to an open-source, public good that will completely change the way staking is operated today. There are already more than 20 companies building on top of ssv.network\u2019s DVT protocol, and that list is expected to grow significantly with the Eco Fund\u2019s launch\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are currently in a pivotal moment in ETH staking. We expect staked assets to increase as staking yields are considered the benchmark return for ETH owners. A near-term tailwind is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade, which is due to be released in the first half of this year and will enable liquidity for those contributing to the network\u2019s core infrastructure. Few teams are as well-positioned as SSV to convene the diverse and cutting-edge products and applications that are using and developing staking technology. We are excited to support those projects as a founding member of this ecosystem initiative.\u201d According to Samantha Bohbot, VP Growth for DCG.\n\nAbout ssv.networks\n\nsv.network is a leader in the development of Distributed Validator Tech. DVT enables the distributed operation of Ethereum validators through a network of trustless nodes. As a core component of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, DVT aims to solve protocol-wide correlation and downtime risks. The network is constructed as a community-owned public good run by hundreds of nodes across the globe. The Network supports over 50 development teams building next-gen ETH staking applications. The various use cases ranging from staking services to solo stakers built on the SSV protocol will usher in the widespread usage and adoption of the DVT primitive.\n\nContact Details\n\nMarketAcross\n\nItai Elizur\n\nItai@marketacross.com\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://ssv.network/\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/ssv-network-launches-50-million-ecosystem-fund-to-support-ethereum-pos-decentralization-562449608"

        "content": "Crypto.com\u2019s 2022 report notes that global crypto ownership increased by 39% despite \u2018winter\u2019\n\nEthereum (ETH) owners grew by 263% from 24 million in January to 87 million in December, accounting for 20% of global owners.\n\nCrypto.com has published its Crypto Market Sizing Report 2022, which provides insights into the actual dynamics within the digital asset market.\n\nThe key takeaway of the report is that global crypto owners increased by 39% in 2022, rising from 306 million in January to 425 million in December in spite of macro headwinds, namely high inflation, the conflict in Europe, supply chain disruptions, and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs to the top crypto assets in the market:\n\nBitcoin (BTC) owners grew by 20% from 183 million in January to 219 million in December, accounting for 52% of global owners;\n\nEthereum (ETH) owners grew by 263% from 24 million in January to 87 million in December, accounting for 20% of global owners.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the strongest growth in 2022 happened in April when the Central African Republic became the second country to adopt BTC as legal tender after EI Salvador and Goldman Sachs offered its first BTC-backed loan, showing further signs of increased interest in crypto from Wall Street institutions.\n\nCrypto.com further explained that the main catalyst behind Ethereum\u2019s high adoption growth rate \u2013 ETH owners grew by 263% vs BTC owners that grew by 20% \u2013 was The Merge: a highly anticipated event that marked the completion of the network\u2019s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rising adoption in 2022 was also due to interest from institutional investors and the popularity of ETH liquid staking.\n\nCrypto.com lays off 1,000 people and delists Tether (USDT) in Canada\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a positive week in terms of market prices, the FTX contagion is spreading and made a new victim. Genesis, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nAmid the \u2018crypto winter\u2019, digital assets exchanges have been announcing lay offs. This is the case for Crypto.com, which plans to lay off 20% of its corporate workforce, or nearly 1000 people, in order to adapt to current market conditions, CEO Kris Marszalek said in a tweet on Friday.\n\nEmployees were told the firm was seeking to trim expenses and narrow its focus to more-promising businesses amid chilly crypto winter. Marszalek said several factors played into their decision to reduce headcount. Despite maintaining a strong balance sheet, he claims, Crypto.com had to navigate economic headwinds and unforeseeable industry events. He explains that they grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, aligning with the broader industry, but the trajectory has now changed with a confluence of negative developments.\n\nCrypto.com also made headlines after it told its Canadian customers that it will delist Tether\u2019s stablecoin (USDT) trading, transactions, deposits and withdrawals by the end of this month.\n\nThe write-off of the world\u2019s largest and most liquid stablecoin comes as the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has banned crypto exchanges operating in the region from touching Tether (USDT). The decision dates back to 2021 when the stablecoin was deeply linked to alleged market manipulation, and it was the only prohibited digital asset in the country."

        "content": "After leaving Ethereum, Hoskinson took a six months sabbatical. During this time, he contemplated returning to academia and perhaps rounding up his Ph.D.\n\nHowever, life had other plans for him. During his sabbatical, he was approached by Jeremy Wood, a former colleague at Ethereum.\n\nThe two men founded Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). The company was founded as an engineering and research company that built cryptocurrencies and blockchains. They initially put a few thousand dollars into the company and started getting crypto-building contracts.\n\nThe company got paid in Bitcoin, and the market soon entered a bull run. Within a short while, Hoskinson realized that IOHK was raking in unbelievable profits and could now build its own blockchain and still have enough left for administrative costs.\n\nIOHK sold part of its Bitcoin holdings and began work on building Cardano. Interestingly, while building Cardano, Hoskinson refused to seek venture capital.\n\nHoskinson later revealed that he believed seeking venture capital for Cardano would counter crypto\u2019s principles. He felt that venture capitalists would \u201cget their pound of flesh\u201d from the project before anyone else and thus ran contrary to crypto\u2019s principles of decentralization.\n\nIn recent times, Hoskinson has even been critical of his decision to oppose Buterin at Ethereum. He\u2019s admitted that he may have been wrong about what path Ethereum should follow, and the subsequent success of the community means that Buterin and the rest of his camp could have been correct.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Cardano grew at a dizzying rate. By 2017, IOHK, the parent company of Cardano, was rich enough to sponsor research labs at the University of Edinburgh and the Tokyo Institute of Technology. This research eventually led to the Ouroboros blockchain consensus protocol. Ouroboros would later be used as the basis of the Cardano blockchain platform.\n\nThe next year, Cardano announced a partnership with the Ethiopian government to discuss ways to deploy Cardano in the country.\n\nLike every other cryptocurrency, Cardano suffered during the 2018 bear market. The project only started recovering in 2021, and since then, it has managed to hit new highs before succumbing to the current bear market."

The results were released as part of a Dapp Radar report on blockchain and decentralized application adoption in 2022.\n\nAs per the report, the Ethereum [ETH] ecosystem dominated the NFT ecosystem, accounting for 21% of the market and processing over 21.2 million transactions. Wax [WAXP] (14.5 million), Polygon [MATIC] (13.3 million), and Solana [SOL] (12.9 million) followed suit.\n\nTransaction activity in the Solana and ImmutableX ecosystems increased by 440% and 315%, respectively, compared to 2021.

        "content": "China launches smart contracts for its digital yuan, on leading shopping application Meituan.\n\nEthereum smart contracts are still healthy and likely to outpace the completion.\n\nChina is still on the path of increasing adoption for its country\u2019s central backed digital currency (CBDC). In its most recent attempt to further usage, the country has launched interactive smart contracts for its CBDC ; the digital yuan.\n\nChina kicks off the new year with a recent smart contact functionality launch. It took place on the 17th of January 2023, and runs on one of the country\u2019s most popular application Meituan.\n\nThe smart contract launch comes four months after the country\u2019s PBOC\u2019s Digital Currency Institute teased the integration of a smart-contract functionality. Shortly after, the announcement was followed up with the launch of a smart contract-based function. It was designed to halt the collection of funds from payees, who might be making away with prepaid funds.\n\nIn a bid to attract users, the smart contract is giving users a daily price for usage. Users can take in as much as 8,888 RMB (1,312) on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, the offer is only open to users who make a purchase for payment on the application, using China\u2019s digital yuan.\n\nAs reported by a local media platform, users are able to earn a portion of the 8,888 RMB. When the smart contract tracks and finds specific keywords from the users\u2019 items and purchases that tally with the words it generated for that day.\n\nIf both the words generated by the smart contract, and the words on the users\u2019 items and name matches, the user will win some of the money up for grabs. The cash prize will be transferred into their digital yuan wallet.\n\nIs China\u2019s new smart contract relevant enough to outperform Ethereum\u2019s?\n\nMeituan is a leading E-commerce shopping application. Formerly known as Meituan-Dianping, the application helps users local customer products and other retail services.\n\nAccording to data from the statistics platform expandedramblings, Meituan had a monthly merchant count total of 8.3 million. The application also had an active monthly user count of 290 million and 600 million registered users as of April 2018.\n\nWith a large number of users on the platform, adoption for the digital yuan is likely going to surge in the near future. The added daily benefits are also attractive to users, and is poised to increase usage of the newly integrated smart contract.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract platform might not be severely affected by the digital yuan\u2019s smart contract. This is particularly because the demand for Ethereum smart contracts is still notably high.\n\nAdditionally , statistics from Web3 dev platform Alchemy, revealed that Ethereum smart contract deployment surged by an outstanding 293% in 2022. During the fourth quarter of the same year, smart contract deployment on Ethereum surged by 453%.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

In this situation and with this step, it will be in a position to utilize a variety of approaches through the Ethereum rollups, and also, with the adequate utilization of an interoperability solution, it will find itself in the position of being able to effectively connect with a lot more inclined users, leading to the obtaining of further liquidity.\n\nThere are some differences between UXD (Solana) and UXD (Ethereum, rollups) in this specific case scenario. In the case of the UXD (Ethereum, rollups), it happens to be ably supported by various approaches right through the Ethereum and rollups, with the correct usage of an interoperability solution. However, where the UXD (Solana) is concerned, there happen to be limitations with regards to being supported with approaches for Solana only.\n\nAt the present moment in time, the Solana team members are carrying out work on three approaches to Ethereum. The first happens to be the delta-neutral position on optimism. It will presumably be positioned on Perpetual Protocols. The second one uses Rage Trade\u2019s delta-neutral vault and is the delta-neutral position on Arbitrum. The third one, which is also the last, entails using the yield aggregators Beefy Finance on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. All of these strategies will help to bring the price of UXD to USD into a more reasonable range.\n\nIn the middle of Ethereum and rollups, UXD will also become completely fungible. Users can either mint or receive UXD back on Ethereum, rollups, and the chains that connect them. The fundamental situation in this case will be the application of LayerZero as an interoperability solution. The UXD Protocol will continue to focus on achieving minimal volatility and a higher yield.\n\nUXD Protocol is also going to be in the business of building a fresh governance token to be offered conventionally on Ethereum. Through this, users will become capable of connecting governance tokens with rollups, which in turn will open up cross-chain functions. The money made by the UXD Protocol on Ethereum and rollups will then be utilized to purchase the governance tokens.\n\nFinally, the governance token will be allotted to UXP (Solana) token holders. UXD on Ethereum and rollups need insurance funding in order to be able to balance probable losses coming from a variety of approaches. The proposal is to transfer $35 million USDC from Solana to Ethereum in order to stand up for UXD on Ethereum and many other rollups."

        "title": "What is a DAO & How Does it Work? - Coin Culture",
        "content": "Since its beginnings, blockchain technology has significantly developed and revolutionised numerous industries, including the financial and creative sectors. Alongside the widespread adoption of DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs, other blockchain technologies, particularly Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), are gaining popularity in the digital arena. However, what a DAO is, how it works, and what the top DAO projects are in 2023. Keep reading to figure it out!\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\nOne of the common challenges in the digital world is how to organise people around the world who don\u2019t personally know each other, establish rules and enforce them. For now, DAO is available to solve the challenge.\n\nSo, what does DAO mean? Wikipedia defines a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) as an organisation represented by rules encoded as a computer program. These rules are transparent as they are member-controlled instead of single-control authority.\n\nA DAO\u2019s financial transactions records and programs are maintained on a blockchain. It provides a safe way for internet strangers to collaborate and a platform to commit funds for various causes.\n\nDAOs are more like internet-based businesses without a single control organ. The members collectively own and manage the business. It has in-built treasuries that can only be accessed with the members\u2019 authorisation. All the decisions in the organisation are made through member proposals and voting.\n\nWhat makes DAO different?\n\nDAO is becoming a popular organisational strategy due to its unique approach to finances and operations. The recording of the DAO\u2019s financial transactions and rules on the blockchain leads to transparency.\n\nDue to smart contracts, DAO eliminates the need for a third party in financial transactions. The DAO draws its firmness from smart contracts. Therefore, it is right to find out what DAO Ethereum is. Ethereum provides a platform for developing and deploying smart contracts that govern the DAOs.\n\nThe smart contracts contain all the organisation\u2019s guidelines and storage. Given the decentralisation of blockchains, no one can edit the smart contracts without the other members\u2019 consent. Transparency eliminates the need for legal status backing like other traditional firms.\n\nCompared to traditional companies, DAO has democratised organisations. Instead of letting a few individuals make decisions on behalf of the company, DAO allows every member to vote to adopt proposals. The funding for most of the DAOs is through crowdfunding. Also, all the DAO activities are transparent and fully public. This is different from the traditional organisations, whose operations are predominantly private and with limited public access.\n\nSo far, DAOs are being used for many purposes, such as investment, charity, fundraising, borrowing, or buying NFTs, all without intermediaries. A DAO can accept donations from anyone around the world, and the members can decide how to spend donations.\n\nHow DAO works\n\nAs stated previously, a DAO is an organisation in which decisions are made from the bottom up; a group of members collectively owns the organisation. There are numerous ways to engage in a DAO, the most common of which is token ownership.\n\nDAOs operate via smart contracts distributed on various blockchains and Ethereum was the first blockchain to employ them. Those with a stake in a DAO are then granted voting rights and can affect the organisation\u2019s operations by rejecting or proposing new governance proposals.\n\nThis strategy prohibits spamming DAOs with proposals; a proposal will only pass if most stakeholders support it. The smart contracts specify how this majority is chosen for each DAO.\n\nFor a DAO to launch, it must undergo various sustainability phases. Here is the process of creating a functional DAO.\n\nThe smart contract setup \u2013 the first step in creating a DAO is to develop a set of rules governing the organisation. These rules are encrypted on the smart contracts and used for all operations. They determine the DAO\u2019s workflow, finances, and governance system. The smart contract rules will only change through member proposals and voting.\n\nFunding \u2013 once the smart contract is in place, the DAO needs funding to start operating. The DAO smart contract details the funding through the creation of a native token. This token operates like any other crypto and can be used for voting rights and incentives. Anytime you interact with what is a DAO crypto, you are referring to the native token of the given organisation.\n\nDeployment \u2013 with the rules and funds in place, the last step is the DAO deployment. The organisation operates within the rules set by the smart contract.\n\nWhy do we need DAOs?\n\nTo trust the individuals you want to collaborate with to start a business is challenging, especially with someone you\u2019ve only ever communicated with online. For DAOs, the only thing you need to trust is the DAO\u2019s code, which is open and verifiable by anybody. This can pave the way for many new kinds of cooperation and coordination globally.\n\nDAO A traditional organisation Often flat, and entirely democratised. Often hierarchical. Members need to approve any modifications before they go into effect. The structure determines whether a single party is given the option to make changes or whether voting is required. Votes are tallied, and the result is implemented without a trusted middleman. If voting is permitted, votes are tallied internally, and voting results must be handled manually. Services are handled automatically in a decentralised manner (e.g. distribution of charity funds). Requires human intervention or centralised automation and is susceptible to manipulation. All activity is publicly available and transparent. Activity is private and limited to the public.\n\nBelow are some examples of how you can use a DAO:\n\nA charity: You can take donations from everyone worldwide and vote on which causes to finance through a charity.\n\nCollective ownership: Members can vote on how to use physical or digital assets acquired through collective ownership.\n\nVentures and grants: You can build a venture fund that pools investment cash and votes on which firms to support. Later, repaid funds could be divided among DAO members.\n\nBest DAO crypto projects 2023\n\nRobotEra \u2013 Overall Best DAO Project in 2023\n\nRobotEra, a metaverse-based ecosystem that intends to be a Sandbox-like metaverse gaming project, is our top-recommended best DAO project in 2023. RobotEra uses TARO as its native token, and the ERC-20 token grants investors access to the RobotEra DAO and other metaverse resources.\n\nRobot NFTs are the 3D in-game avatars of users on the \u2018Taro Planet\u2019 \u2013 the virtual metaverse world of RobotEra. With NFTs, players can purchase Land on seven continents inside the Taro Planet.\n\nAccording to the RobotEra whitepaper, the platform will ultimately deploy its DAO, which can be accessible by staking TARO tokens. The DAO will offer the ability to vote and make decisions on numerous aspects of the Taro Planet. Since Robots in the game are separated into diverse factions, DAO members can vote on and propose implementation tactics for their own factions.\n\nBattle Infinity \u2013 Overall Best Crypto DAO Project\n\nBattle Infinity intends to merge Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming with Web 3.0 technology by establishing a metaverse-based game (Battle Arena). It provides users with a decentralised platform that gives them access to a virtual game ecosystem where they can play, earn, and create products.\n\nThe IBAT token serves as the platform\u2019s utility token. IBAT tokens are generated on the Binance Smart Chain and are preparing for a mainnet deployment in phase 3 of the platform\u2019s roadmap. To participate in the Battle Stake, users must stake IBAT, with the possibility to earn, build, and generate NFTs that can be turned into IBAT awards.\n\nMakerDAO \u2013 Top DAO Project Built on Ethereum\n\nMakerDAO is a peer-to-peer decentralised autonomous organisation established on the Ethereum blockchain that enables individuals to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. As with any other DeFi protocol, the borrowing and lending procedure on this platform is governed by smart contracts.\n\nDue to the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies, MakerDAO employs Dai, a stablecoin, to establish lending rates and repayment amounts. MakerDAO is a cryptocurrency lending credit facility that grants loans at predetermined interest rates. If a MakerDAO user wants to borrow a specified quantity of cryptocurrency, they must first deposit Ethereum into a Maker smart contract.\n\nFuture application-specific decentralised financial protocols will rely heavily on the Maker Protocol and Dai stablecoin as the foundational infrastructure layer.\n\nTamadoge \u2013 Upcoming Meme Token DAO project\n\nTamadoge, the native cryptocurrency of the Tamaverse, is a project launched amid massive hype as the latest Doge-themed meme coin with significant potential. Tamadoge provides a multi-utility token and play-to-earn (P2E) platform on the blockchain, whereas Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies gained popularity owing to the social media support of notable celebrities.\n\nOn this P2E platform, players compete for possible earnings from a prize pool, which are awarded as TAMA tokens. Tamadoge pets are supposed to be created, bred, and traded by users. Each pet is issued as a non-fungible token (NFT) via smart contracts and possesses unique qualities, strengths, and limitations. The objective is to make these Doge pets competitive to gain points on the leaderboard each month.\n\nDash \u2013 Innovative \u2018Privacy Coin\u2019 Set for a Rebound\n\nDash is one of the top utility tokens for privacy and anonymity. Dash began as a fork of Litecoin and has since become a popular digital currency among those who value privacy about their personal information and transaction history. Over the past few years, businesses and online retailers have increasingly adopted Dash, which is now accepted at over 155,000 locations.\n\nDash functions similarly to Bitcoin, except that its InstantSend feature allows transactions to be completed in less than two seconds. In addition, Dash employs a valuable method that mixes transactions with others, making it nearly impossible to identify a specific transaction to a particular wallet.\n\nWhile the project is a DAO insofar as all decisions are made collectively via a subset of master nodes, the degree to which the Dash network is decentralised remains debatable because the network\u2019s governance tokens were distributed in a manner that concentrated wealth among a small group of stakeholders, granting them disproportionate voting power over the project.\n\nUniswap \u2013 Leading DeFi Protocol with $5.5B in TVL\n\nUniswap is a decentralised exchange (DEX) established on the Ethereum network that facilitates the easy exchange of ERC-20 tokens. This is the Ethereum token standard and contains some of the top altcoins, like Chainlink and Shiba Inu. Since the exchange is decentralised, an intermediary is unnecessary to facilitate transactions.\n\nUniswap employs liquidity pools, which eliminate the typical order book. Anyone can deposit unused ERC-20 tokens into Uniswap\u2019s liquidity pools in exchange for a yield. Depending on the token, returns can be significantly higher than those granted by conventional savings accounts.\n\nDue to its widespread adoption, Uniswap has become one of the most popular DeFi protocols worldwide. Numerous investors purchase UNI, the protocol\u2019s native token, to gain exposure to its growth.\n\nConsequently, Uniswap keeps the second position on our DAO crypto ranking list.\n\nOlympusDAO \u2013 DAO Project for Stablecoins\u2019 Liquidity\n\nThe objective of the OlympusDAO project was to create a new decentralised infrastructure for finance, which would be community-driven. At its core, OlympusDAO provided a solution to one of the most vexing issues in DeFi: the provision of sustainable liquidity for native tokens.\n\nInstead of renting liquidity through token payouts, Olympus acquires it through its bonding mechanism. The mechanism provides a discount on the project\u2019s OHM token in return for tokens, such as liquidity provider tokens (e.g. ones that represent deposits in OHM-DAI pool).\n\nIn addition, Olympus gave rise to the famed 3,3 meme, a slang for game-theoretic cooperation. This means the option to stake OHM tokens to get the six-digit APY offered at the project\u2019s inception. When new bonds are issued, the protocol mints new OHM tokens, and the bulk of these tokens are distributed to stakers.\n\nFAQs about DAOs\n\nWhat is the purpose of a DAO?\n\nA DAO\u2019s purpose is to improve several organisations\u2019 traditional management structures. A DAO attempts to provide every member with a voice, a vote, and the ability to suggest initiatives, as opposed to relying on a single individual or a small group of individuals to guide the organisation\u2019s direction. A DAO also aspires to have governance by blockchain-based code.\n\nWhat is an NFT DAO?\n\nNFT DAOs are decentralised autonomous organisations that use NFTs as a membership and governance token in addition to a shared DAO treasury. By doing so, NFT initiatives can set up a formal structure that gives holders collective control over the project\u2019s development. In laying the groundwork for collaborative, decentralised, and economically beneficial construction, NFT DAOs embody some of web3\u2019s defining characteristics.\n\nWhat is Lido DAO (LDO)?\n\nFor Ethereum 2.0 and other proof of stake (POS) blockchains like Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Lido is a decentralised autonomous organisation that offers a liquid staking service. Lido DAO token holders can stake them and reap profits without locking or managing the staking infrastructure. Also, they can stake Ethereum without making any initial investments or worrying about the upkeep of any underlying infrastructure; hence, joining on-chain operations like compound returns and lending.\n\nHow to create DAO on Ethereum?\n\nThere are a number of DAO startup templates and tools available to help startups save time and effort in developing their systems, or they can choose to develop their systems from scratch. Popular choices for the Ethereum blockchain include Aragon and Snapshot. Also, to make DAOs on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, you can use a program called DAOstack Alchemy (formerly known as xDAI). If you want your DAO\u2019s tokens, crowdfunding, and treasury tasks to go well, you\u2019ll need to get the DAO treasury tools working properly after you set them up.\n\nHow does a DAO make money?\n\nTypically, a DAO will exchange fiat currency for its token as its initial funding mechanism. A member\u2019s share of voting power and ownership is reflected in the value of this native token. If a DAO is successful, there will be a rise in the price of the tokens used within it.\n\nTokens issued in the future by the DAO can be sold for higher prices. The members of a DAO have the power to authorise the organisation to make investments. Buying up businesses, NFTs, or other tokens is only one example of what a DAO can do with its funds. If the value of those assets goes up, so does the value of the DAO.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe goal of DAOs is to create a collective organisation in which all members have an equal say in the running of the business. Many experts and insiders in the field agree that this form of organisation is gaining popularity and may even displace certain more conventional businesses.\n\nCurrent trends can influence how customers connect with a company or brand. Thus, companies and brands need to keep tabs on these developments. While DAOs\u2019 adoption isn\u2019t widespread now, they\u2019re gaining popularity amongst many developers and creators."
