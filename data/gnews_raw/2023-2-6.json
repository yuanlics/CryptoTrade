        "content": "Have you heard the term \u201cgas\u201d in relation to the Ethereum Virtual Machine? Are you scratching your head, wondering how someone could possibly need gasoline so they can pay $30,000 for a jpeg of a drooling gorilla?\n\nWhat Is Gwei? Gwei is a denomination of a popular cryptocurrency known as Ether or Ethereum. It is the fuel used to power transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and provide the gas that keeps the network running.\n\nYou\u2019re in the right place. This article will break down some of the basics of gwei and gas and how they relate to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFurther Reading On BlockchainThe Blockchain-Powered Web3 Is Emerging. What Will It Be Like When It\u2019s Here?\n\nWhat Is Gwei?\n\nGwei is simply a denomination of a popular cryptocurrency known as Ether or Ethereum. It is not the only denomination; if you look at the table below, you will see that kwei, mwei and gwei are featured in rapid succession. Following the prefix designations used within the metric system, each of these unit denominations is a portmanteau of the prefix. In the case of gwei this would be \u201cgiga\u201d or billion, and \u201cwei.\u201d In short, 1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH.\n\nThe easiest way to conceptualize gwei is with a simple chart.\n\nMost informed consumers will not be satisfied merely understanding that one gwei is equivalent to one-billionth of a unit of Ether. Curious folk will want to understand what that truly means. Fortunately for these individuals, we can break this concept down even further with an example.\n\nWhat Is Gwei? An Example\n\nPicture a table with two individuals seated across from each other. Benjamin is holding a crisp $100 bill and Abraham is holding a shiny penny. What is the difference between the currency Ben and Abe are holding? Ben is holding a paper-like fabric with various distinctive markings on both sides. Abe is holding a small metal disk made of zinc coated in copper.\n\nThe currency Ben is holding could be used to purchase a reasonably full cart of practical groceries. The currency Abe is holding is worth less than the scrap metal value of the material it is printed on. The difference between a unit of Ether and a unit of gwei is more than twice the difference between the orders of magnitude between $100.00 and $0.01.\n\nThe term \u201corders of magnitude\u201d typically refers to the smallest possible power of 10 that can be used to represent a number in relation to a standard reference point. Consider $1USD to be the standard in this example. The $100 note is 2 orders of magnitude larger than a single dollar. Conversely, the penny is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than a single dollar.\n\nNow imagine two denominations of a currency with a difference of 9 orders of magnitude. Like many other cryptocurrencies, and in contrast to more traditional fiat currency, Ether is not restricted to the bounds of physical objects like fabric or metal.\n\nInstead, the currency is built on a platform that allows for 18 decimal places for the division of Ether. Building on our earlier U.S. dollar comparisons, the dollar has 2 decimal places for the division of dollars. You can\u2019t cut a penny into pieces. It\u2019s both illegal and an ineffective strategy for further dividing the store of value.\n\nVerbiage gets a bit tricky here. The Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum Network and an expansive community of Ethereum developers created the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a distributed, trustless computer capable of processing smart contracts. This system raised an early round of funding through the initial coin offering of Ethereum.\n\nMore Reading on Blockchain61 Blockchain Companies Paving the Way for the Future\n\nWhat Is Gwei Used For?\n\nWith the current ETH / USD exchange rates, gwei is used to quantify the fees involved in processing on-chain transactions. With time this will likely change. The price of Ether could crater, and gas fees may then be calculated in Microether or Milliether; but for the foreseeable future it\u2019s safe to assume gwei will be the best denomination for quantifying transaction fees.\n\nTransactions can be a simple transfer of value between two accounts, but the Ethereum Virtual Machine is also capable of processing complex logical operations carried out by smart contracts. In our next example, let us assume the former for the sake of simplicity. You bought 2 Ether from an exchange. You navigate to the withdrawal/send functionality, and transfer half your purchase to your friend Stanley and the other half to another friend, Albert. One might assume Stanley and Albert each have 1 Ether, right?\n\nEthereum transactions need gas fees to support the expense of operating the network.\n\nIn a practical sense, yes, but technically no: for the sake of simplicity we will say they each received 0.99 Eth. What happened to that hundredth of an Ether? It was used to pay for the gas fees necessary to execute the transaction. In centralized systems this is meaningless. Transferring money from a checking account to a savings account with the same bank is a poor parallel for what\u2019s happening in a blockchain based system of accounts.\n\nIn short, Ethereum transactions need gas fees to support the expense of operating the network."

        "title": "Is Staking Ethereum Really Worth It? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When Ethereum (ETH 0.32%) developers implemented The Merge, the name given to its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, they made it so that staked funds couldn't be withdrawn and were locked on the network for an indeterminable amount of time. This inability to withdraw likely dissuaded would-be holders from staking, as there was no end in sight to when they could reclaim their staked funds if needed.\n\nBut now it looks like there is an end in sight. Building off of The Merge, Ethereum developers are in the process of fine-tuning the next upgrade, known as Shanghai, which will allow users to finally withdraw funds and should be unveiled this March.\n\nSo, with light at the end of the tunnel, this begs the question: Should you stake your Ethereum?\n\nA couple of options to consider\n\nBefore answering that question directly, let's evaluate the different ways to stake.\n\nThere are two primary ways. One is through an exchange that provides access to staking pools, and the other is known as a liquid staking protocol. Both provide users with interest rewards, but the manner in which it is done differs slightly.\n\nUsing a staking pool through an exchange is easily the most straightforward and simple. Popular exchanges like Binance or Coinbase allow users to lock up their Ethereum and earn generous rewards that are paid out every few days.\n\nThe alternative to a staking pool are liquid staking protocols. Rather than staking your funds and only earning interest, liquid staking lets you earn interest and provides an equivalent amount of the funds staked in the form of another unique token. In doing so, users get the benefit of earning rewards but also maintaining liquidity to go participate in other crypto endeavors like buying non-fungible tokens or using them for other investing options.\n\nOne of the most popular is Lido. Users who stake their Ethereum through Lido (LDO 1.53%) receive another token in exchange, stETH (STETH 0.16%). Users are compensated with an equal amount of stETH as the amount of ether they staked. The stETH tracks Ethereum's price, so there is virtually no lost value. This stETH is also the means by which rewards are paid out.\n\nA word of caution is needed, though, as this method is slightly more technical for the average user.\n\nThe crypto version of a dividend stock\n\nWhile it would have been tough to advise staking without knowing when withdrawals would be allowed, the loom of Shanghai makes staking much more alluring. While staking Ethereum isn't a get-rich-quick strategy, it can still be a valuable way to pad your portfolio and put your money to work. Rewards are paid out every few days and are proportionate to the value staked -- meaning the more you stake, the more you earn.\n\nCurrently, the annual percentage rate hovers around 4% to 5%, but this rate is set by the Ethereum network and rises and falls based on the number of validators. The fewer validators, the higher the return, which incentivizes users to join the network and stake funds. The greater the number of validators, and the APR will fall slightly.\n\nModest profits can be made at the current APR (4% to 5%). For investors with $1,000 worth of Ethereum, they can expect around $43 per year. At $5,000, that number grows to nearly $220. But the beauty of this method is that you can reinvest these rewards, let them compound, and reap the benefits of letting your money work for you. In addition, should Ethereum rise in price, the total value you have staked will also increase, thereby increasing your return.\n\nYou could think of staking as being similar to a stock that pays dividends. It may not be much in the short term, but consistency over the long run is where true gains can be made. Although the payout might feel minuscule in the beginning, one day it could turn into a significant source of income, especially if Ethereum continues to rise in value as it has over the past few years."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2023? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Whichever way you slice it, Ethereum is a good investment in 2023, and it\u2019s virtually impossible to argue against that. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market in terms of market capitalization, and enjoys a lot of popularity in the community thanks to its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem. In addition, whether you\u2019re interested in swapping tokens, lending crypto, collecting NFTs or using stablecoins, chances are that the most exciting developments are happening on Ethereum first.\n\nWhile the Ethereum ecosystem is still going strong, not all ETH investors are happy. After all, ETH is down about 66% from its all-time high after crashing in 2022 alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency market. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange, which were the two major crypto industry disasters of 2022, spared almost no cryptocurrency project.\n\nOn the other hand, the current prices can represent a good opportunity to buy ETH if you believe in the Ethereum project\u2019s long-term potential. In fact, Ethereum has put its price potential prominently on the display, starting the year with a massive +37% upswing.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at Ethereum from multiple angles to help you determine if Ethereum is a good investment in 2023 or not.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll begin by listing a variety of reasons why Ethereum might be a good investment in 2023. Of course, we\u2019ll also consider some of the downsides of investing in ETH.\n\nHere\u2019s why Ethereum is considered a good investment\n\nLast September, pretty much every ETH investor and user held its breath as the network underwent its most significant upgrade ever \u2013 the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm \u2013 dubbed \u201cThe Merge\u201d. While the price of ETH plummeted ahead of the upgrade, with investors fearing that it could have an adverse impact on the network, the price quickly recovered after it became obvious that the transition was a total success.\n\nNow, with the uncertainty of the Merge ever more distant in its rearview, there are several reasons that make Ethereum a good investment in 2023, including:\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is increasing\n\nDeflationary pressures are making ETH more valuable\n\nLayer 2 solutions are successfully mitigating Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues\n\nEthereum is retaining its smart contract dominance\n\nInvest in Ethereum\n\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why Ethereum is a good investment in more detail. We\u2019ll also present a case against Ethereum, so that you can get familiar with some of its drawbacks.\n\nA substantial amount of ETH is staked even before withdrawals are enabled\n\nAt the time of writing, 16.4 million ETH, or about 13.6% of the ETH supply, is locked in the staking deposit contract. This is impressive, given that staked ETH currently cannot be withdrawn from the contract. This will only become possible after a future upgrade called Shanghai, which is tentatively planned for March 2023.\n\nThe fact that $27 billion worth of ETH has been staked even before there\u2019s a mechanism to withdraw the coins indicates that Ethereum investors have a lot of confidence in the project\u2019s ability to execute its roadmap.\n\nThe number of staked ETH. Image source: Nansen\n\nThe fact that you can stake ETH is also one reason that can make Ethereum a good investment. If you\u2019re looking to hold your ETH over the long term, you can currently enjoy an APY of about 5.2% on your staked coins. While these are not earth-shattering gains, it\u2019s better than earning no yield at all if you weren\u2019t planning to sell your ETH anyway.\n\nETH has become a much more attractive asset to hold following the Merge\n\nWhen the Merge was close to happening, much of the discussion in the cryptocurrency community (rightly) revolved around Ethereum moving over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. However, there was one aspect of the Merge that perhaps got less attention than it deserves.\n\nPrior to the Merge, the Ethereum protocol issued about 13,000 ETH every day in order to reward miners. With the new Proof-of-Stake system, the protocol only needs to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to provide sufficient incentives to Proof-of-Stake validators to secure the network.\n\nThis change, combined with the EIP-1559 mechanism introduced in 2021, has actually turned ETH into a slightly deflationary cryptocurrency. According to ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by a total of 7,820 ETH following the Merge.\n\nThis deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH has made it a more attractive hold over the long term, as ETH holders effectively no longer need to consider inflation as a factor that could negatively affect the value of their coins.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s not a certainty that ETH will remain deflationary, as this will depend on how much demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. More demand for transactions equals more burned ETH, as the base transaction fees for each transaction are being burned thanks to EIP-1559. While the deflationary aspect is a nice bonus, Ethereum is one of the best long term cryptos to buy, regardless of whether its tokenomics are slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary.\n\nEthereum layer 2s are making good progress\n\nIt\u2019s not secret that the current iteration of Ethereum has major problems with scalability. In 2021, when the crypto market was in the middle of a raging bull run, transaction fees on the Ethereum network skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. At points, users were paying north of $50 just to make a single transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis is obviously not a sustainable situation if Ethereum is to become a widely adopted network. Thankfully, there are several solutions in sight. The Ethereum protocol itself will receive upgrades in the future, most notably sharding, which will allow it to process more transactions while keeping costs lower.\n\nIn addition to improvements on the protocol base layer, there\u2019s also a number of layer 2 scalability solutions that leverage the security of the Ethereum mainnet while processing transactions off-chain to keep costs low.\n\nThere\u2019s already a number of layer 2 platforms for Ethereum available. The most notable examples are Arbitrum One and Optimism, which are both based on optimistic rollup technology. Moving forward, we\u2019ll also see the launch of layer 2s based on zero-knowledge rollups, which promise to provide even bigger efficiency improvements.\n\nEthereum continues to dominate the smart contracts space\n\nThere\u2019s a slew of Ethereum competitors available on the market. Many alternative layer 1 chains have adopted the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), while others like Solana, Cardano and Aptos have taken completely different approaches.\n\nIn any case, no other blockchain has come even close to challenging Ethereum as the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are the main reasons why it tops the list of best altcoins to buy. According to DeFi Llama, Ethereum has a 59.3% market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, according to the TVL (total value locked) metric. The next closest competitor, TRON, has a market share of about 10.8%.\n\nDeFi TVL market share among all blockchains. Image source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe demand for using the Ethereum network is also evident based on the total fees paid to use it. As of early February 2023, users are paying a total of $4.4 million in fees daily for Ethereum transactions, according to data from cryptofees.info. BNB Chain is in second place with a daily average of $590,000 in total daily fees, and Bitcoin comes in third with about $360,000 in fees collected daily.\n\nETH is still down substantially from its all-time high\n\nEven though ETH kicked off 2023 with a rally, the Ethereum price is still down about 66% from its all-time high. This could make ETH a good investment at the moment, as it has already displayed the ability to reach much higher prices in the past. Still, broader positive momentum in the cryptocurrency market will likely be required if you\u2019re questioning whether Ethereum will recover to its previous highs.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s still unclear if ETH has already reached a bottom, or if there\u2019s still lower price levels to explore. ETH, which peaked at around $4,850 in November of 2021, dropped all the way to $1,100 by July 2022. At the time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $1,660, which is not high enough to comfortably call its current cycle low of $1,100 a bottom.\n\nAs a side note, even if Ethereum were to surpass its previous ATH, there is virtually no chance that it could explode by 100x or post similarly impressive gains \u2013 its current market cap is just too large and the growth required to post triple or four digit gains is just not feasible.\n\nDespite being constrained from benefiting from 100x price increases, the 5-year Ethereum average return rate would still net investors an incredibly handsome sum in the span of 10 years, mostly due to the magic of compounding interest. Here\u2019s how a $5,000 investment in Ethereum with a monthly contribution of $100 would fare over the next 10 years, if we take the growth of ETH in the past 5 years as a basis.\n\nA $5,000 investment in Ethereum (with a $100 monthly contribution) in 2023 will grow to nearly $2,000,000 by 2032 if we assume Ethereum\u2019s average 5-year rate of return. Source: Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhat are the cons of Ethereum as an investment?\n\nHopefully, we have demonstrated that Ethereum has a lot going for it as an investment in early 2023. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that buying ETH is a sure bet.\n\nWhile layer 2 solutions promise to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes, they are still in their relatively early stages, with many taking compromises in terms of decentralization. Meanwhile, the Ethereum mainnet is still very expensive to use.\n\nAt the time of writing, a simple token swap will cost about $4.5 in fees, which makes it very difficult to portray Ethereum as a platform that targets a broad audience and enables financial inclusion. In addition, the fees get substantially higher whenever there is a surge in demand.\n\nIn addition, the macroeconomic situation might also not bode well for cryptocurrencies. After all, many economists are predicting a recession to happen in 2023. If these predictions materialize, the cryptocurrency market will be in uncharted territory, as it has never existed amid a global recession\u2014let\u2019s remember that Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and only became a significant asset a few years later.\n\nDepending on the severity of this expected recession, there could be a sell-off in the crypto markets due to investors getting rid of their risky assets, and ETH would undoubtedly also be impacted in such a scenario.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that even though Ethereum is among the most established crypto projects, ETH is still a highly volatile asset when compared to traditional investments. Before buying any cryptocurrency, make sure to carefully consider your financial situation and never invest more than you are willing to lose.\n\nEthereum price prediction in 2023-2024: A new ATH brewing on the horizon?\n\nOur algorithm forecasts Ethereum price to increase by +260% and reach a new ATH in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum will see sideways movement for the majority of 2023. However, the world\u2019s largest altcoin is expected to start mounting a rally late in the year, culminating in a new all-time high of $5,880 in the first half of February 2024.\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction is based on the snapshot of technical indicators in early 2023, with 19 indicators signaling bullish and 11 bearish signals. Keep in mind that the prediction could change considerably going forward if the underlying indicators change.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014the future of Ethereum looks bright, but the macro environment could spoil the party\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cshould I buy Ethereum?\u201d, the current situation might be a good time to do so. As we can see, there are a lot of positive indications for the future of Ethereum that could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\n\nA large number of ETH is being staked even before the launch of withdrawals, EIP-1559 and the Merge have combined to drastically reduce the issuance of ETH, and Ethereum is continuing to dominate the smart contracts sector. In addition, ETH is trading significantly below its all-time highs, which means the current prices could represent an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nStill, the performance of Ethereum could be negatively impacted by the macroeconomic situation, which is looking rather bleak for 2023. If there will indeed be a global recession, it is difficult to expect cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, to perform well.\n\nFor more information, check out our ultimate guide on cryptocurrency investing for useful tips and ideas on how to approach investing in crypto.\n\nInvest in Ethereum"

The latter is a protocol that allows validator duties to be shared across multiple nodes.\n\nThe Staking Router is envisaged to allow Lido to become an extensible protocol due to its modular design.

Modules will manage an internal operator registry, store validator keys, and allocate staking and rewards among its operators.\n\nThe enabling of liquid staking rewards withdrawals allows Lido Staked ETH (stETH) holders to withdraw funds from Lido at a 1:1 ratio in ETH. An overview of the upgrade shared with Cointelegraph notes that the withdrawals feature also mitigates risks in the secondary market, which is provisionally set for activation after Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade.\n\nRelated: Lido overtakes MakerDAO and now has the highest TVL in DeFi\n\nUsers looking to withdraw ETH will have to follow a proposed request and claim process. A request will require users to lock stETH to start the withdrawal. The protocol sources ETH to fulfill the request, locks the ETH, burns the locked stETH, and marks the request as claimable for the user to retrieve their ETH.\n\nA short timeline outlines development milestones through February to April 2023, where code will be tested on the Goerli Testnet before a withdrawal credential rotation ceremony and the upgrade itself are set to take place.\n\nThe withdrawal credential rotation is necessary due to a discrepancy between Lido protocol validators using BLS-based \u201c0x00\u201d signatures and those using newer smart-contract based \u201c0x01\u201d signatures.\n\nLido intends to rotate the credentials through a DAO ceremony, where participants will sign a rotation message that will then be broadcast to the consensus layer network.\n\nAs previously reported, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade has seen Lido Finance lead the charge as the largest decentralized finance protocol, with over $8 billion of value staked on its platform going into 2023."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently reached a new milestone in its burning volume. The implementation of the Merge protocol has resulted in the destruction of over 10,000 coins, marking a significant increase in the rate of burning compared to previous periods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increase in Ethereum's burning pace has the potential to finally start affecting the actual market price of the asset, as its circulating supply is now decreasing at a faster rate. Previously, the burning of Ethereum was more of a speculative opportunity that attracted investors, but the impact on the price was minimal.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has been consistently moving upward throughout the market recovery that started in January, contrary to assets like XRP and Cardano. The cryptocurrency has been receiving constant support from retail investors as ETH staking became more popular on the market, in contrast to the December stalemate.\n\nThe burning of Ethereum coins serves to reduce the supply of the asset and increase its scarcity, thereby potentially leading to an increase in its value. This increase in demand and scarcity could be one of the factors that will drive the price of Ethereum upward in the future.\n\nDespite the possibility of an improving price performance on the market with the help of coin burning, it cannot become a main source of support for the cryptocurrency, as Ethereum's backbone is network revenue that includes transaction fees and network activity.\n\nWith the further recovery of the market, we should see the rise of new solutions on the network, which should lead to the fundamental growth of the ecosystem and positive performance on the market."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFirst proposed in November 2021, Aave\u2019s latest upgrade is finally here.\n\nLaunched earlier this month, V3 of the DeFi lending protocol has already raked in more than $143 million across the first seven assets listed.\n\nThough the asset list is far shorter than the previous iteration, the project\u2019s founder and CEO Stani Kulechov says this upgrade is all about managing risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe DeFi space itself has been growing significantly, so we\u2019ve seen more and more value at stake,\u201d said the founder. \u201cBecause of that, and especially with the DeFi summer explosion in 2020, what we wanted to do is to create a version of the Aave protocol that basically has different kinds of security features, ensuring that the risk management is as optimized as possible for the community.\u201d\n\nNew features like Isolation Mode, for example, will let the protocol safely onboard what Kulechov calls long-tail assets without putting the entire protocol at risk. These would be tokens that have low liquidity, subjecting them to extreme volatility.\n\nAssets added in Isolation Mode have a specific debt ceiling and can only be used to borrow stablecoins, which are defined by the Aave governance community. A debt ceiling refers to exactly how much money can be borrowed using these kinds of long-tail assets as collateral. With this update, Kulechov says the protocol \u201ccan silo the risk away.\u201d\n\nAfter the security optimization, the latest upgrade is also introducing a new portal feature that will let users move assets across different markets on different blockchains. \"In the portal feature, you can move assets from Ethereum to Polygon, Polygon, to, let's say, Avalanche, pretty much instantly,\" he said.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting feature is one will let Ethereum bulls lever their bets using so-called liquid staking derivatives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHigh-efficiency lending and borrowing\n\nEthereum has emerged as the largest market ($59 million) on Aave\u2019s latest upgrade, but shortly after comes Lido Finance\u2019s Staked Ethereum (stETH) ($54 million).\n\nBy depositing Ethereum into Lido, you can earn a yield (sourced from validators securing the proof-of-stake network) and you also receive that stETH token as a sort of receipt for your deposit. You can then use that stETH elsewhere in the world of DeFi to keep earning your yield.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only version of staked Ethereum, either; in fact, there\u2019s a whole index that\u2019s batched all these assets together. Collectively, the crypto community has called these tokens liquid staking derivatives or LSDs, and they\u2019ve attracted a huge amount of attention since Ethereum executed the merge last September.\n\nNow, thanks to Aave\u2019s latest upgrade, you can take this same bet even further using the protocol\u2019s new High-Efficiency Mode. This mode lets users lend and borrow like-pegged assets such as various stablecoins or staked Ethereum products.\n\n\u201cThat LSD represents the value of what you staked and you can actually rehypothecate the value by using it as collateral,\u201d Kulechov told Decrypt.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Deposit your Ethereum in Lido Finance to receive stETH; use that stETH to borrow more Ethereum on Aave; restake the Ethereum on Lido and repeat the cycle. This kind of crypto-finance voodoo is also referred to as capital efficiency.\n\nThis is especially interesting for users when faced with a bear market. Instead of selling your holdings and incurring a loss, said Kulechov, you can borrow against them.\n\n\u201cWhen the market trend is going upwards, they might actually use to borrow with their collateral more, like stablecoins or ETH, and buy a specific asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey leverage their holdings based on the market cycle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd as this trade emerges, Kulechov suspects that it\u2019s going be quite trendy moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a proposal from the Coinbase team to list the cbETH, which is Coinbase\u2019s staking derivative,\u201d he said. \u201cThat allows you to be more capital efficient with the staking assets that you might have as a user.\u201d\n\nJudging by the current results of the proposal, a whopping 99% approval, users appear eager to onboard the asset as soon as possible."

        "content": "Solana (SOL) creator Anatoly Yakovenko is laying out a prediction for crypto markets for the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nIn a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Yakovenko says while there may be challenging macroeconomic conditions ahead, it likely won\u2019t stop an unprecedented wave of innovation from hitting the crypto space.\n\nYakovenko warns that if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to draw down inflation it could drive investment away from the less established blockchain projects like Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a big question for probably all of the smart contract platforms except for Ethereum: Are we going to be in a high-interest rate environment for the next five years where all the riskier bets get squeezed down and there\u2019s no traction?\n\nThat means that there\u2019s nothing for Solana to do that\u2019s useful to the world that Ethereum doesn\u2019t cover, even if Solana is 100 times faster. Even if we do more transactions than all the Ethereum [layer-2s] combined. They\u2019re not providing enough value to the world in that environment, if they\u2019re not, that means it\u2019s not going to survive. Now that\u2019s like the big if and that I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019 for crypto. What is crypto doing right now that is so crucial to the world that it can\u2019t live without it?\u201d\n\nHowever, Yakovenko says he is optimistic about Solana\u2019s future. He says that even if there is an economic downturn, Solana\u2019s market share of non-fungible token (NFT) projects would create enough value to sustain the project.\n\n\u201cThis is like if I put on my worst bear hat and everything\u2019s going to sh*t, interest rates are at 10%, is the Web3 NFT business model [going to] survive? I think so. And if that\u2019s true, I think Solana survives.\u201d\n\nYakovenko predicts innovation in the crypto space will surge at a pace never seen before, helping the sector successfully navigate through choppy economic times.\n\n\u201cI feel like way more bullish now than 2018, 2019. There\u2019s so much funding that\u2019s still happening in crypto. There\u2019s so many smart young people that are not joining the big companies and building awesome products.\n\nMy guess is if you looked at all the product launches from the inception of crypto to now to what\u2019s going to happen in the next 12 to 18 months, then the next 12 to 18 months is probably going to be way more than everything else combined up to this point. And if people are launching products, they\u2019re grinding for product market fit, they\u2019re going to get users, it means crypto is going to survive.\u201d\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s uptrend has been halted after reaching the major resistance at $1.7K. The price action seems choppy, while a short-term correction is what many expect.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has surpassed the 200-day moving average and the multi-month channel\u2019s upper trendline due to the recent bullish move of the whole market. However, the price declined from the major resistance level of $1.7K and is now consolidating beneath it.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a substantial bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the daily timeframe. It could lead to volatility in the upcoming days.\n\nNonetheless, there are three critical static levels for Ethereum on the daily chart; the $1.7K major resistance level, the $1.3K minor support level, and the $1K major support level.\n\nThe price has been ranging between $1K and $1.7K for several months, and the $1.3K minor support level is likely to be Ethereum\u2019s next stop in case of rejection from $1.7K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s price action seems to be bearish on the 4-hour timeframe as it has been forming an ascending Head and Shoulder pattern, also known as a three drives pattern, a popular reversal pattern in the classic price action, after reaching a vital resistance region.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency cascades below the neckline, roughly at $1.5K, the market should expect a short-term plummet toward the $1.3K minor support level. Hence, considering the current price action and the bearish signs mentioned above, Ethereum is likely to experience a period of consolidation correction before the next impulsive move.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe following chart demonstrates the Open Interest metric\u2019s 14-day RSI alongside Ethereum\u2019s price. Following the recent uptrend in Bitcoin\u2019s price during the last two weeks, ETH has also printed a surge, showing signs of demand in the market.\n\nAs a result, the futures market activity has also increased in the last week resulting in an uptrend in Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest. Typically, when the Open Interest\u2019s RSI reaches the red zone (above 70), the possibility of a short-term correction expands.\n\nPresently, the metric has surged and is close to entering the red area. Accordingly, a short-term plummet might flush out the highly leveraged long positions. This structure underlines the risk of the futures market in the short term."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nCrypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group has begun to sell shares in several of its most prized cryptocurrency funds at a steep discount, as it seeks to raise capital to pay back creditors of its bankrupt lending arm.\n\nSoftBank-backed DCG has started to offload its holdings in several investment vehicles run by its subsidiary Grayscale, according to US securities filings seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe move to sell down the assets underscores the financial difficulties at DCG as it tries to raise funds to support collapsed lending units under crypto broker Genesis, while seeking to preserve its most cash-generative business.\n\nConnecticut-based DCG, founded in 2015 by former banker Barry Silbert, is one of the largest and oldest investors in crypto coins and businesses. It is backed by investors including SoftBank, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC and Alphabet\u2019s venture arm CapitalG.\n\nGrayscale, DCG\u2019s asset management business, is an important asset: it earns hundreds of millions of dollars per year in lucrative fees for managing large pools of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies in funds that investors can buy shares in from their brokerage accounts.\n\nDCG is selling stakes in one of Grayscale\u2019s largest trusts even though the shares over the past two years have fallen to substantial discounts to the underlying value of cryptocurrency they hold.\n\nIt is seeking to raise money after the lending units of Genesis, its crypto broker, collapsed into bankruptcy in January, becoming the latest large crypto company to fail after the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange rocked the digital asset industry.\n\nThe US group has been attempting to repay more than $3bn to its creditors and has been embroiled in a public dispute with the Winklevoss twins\u2019s Gemini exchange over the debts. To raise further funds, the group last month hired Lazard bankers to help sell its trade news site CoinDesk. It is also seeking to offload some of its $500mn venture portfolio, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nOn Monday, after months of negotiations, DCG reached an agreement with Genesis\u2019 main creditors, including Gemini. \u201cThis plan is a critical step forward towards a substantial recovery of assets,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nDCG\u2019s recent share sales have focused on Grayscale\u2019s ethereum fund, where the group has moved to sell about a quarter of its stock to raise as much as $22mn in several trades since January 24, according to the filings. The company is selling at about $8 per share, despite each share\u2019s claim to $16 of ether.\n\n\u201cThis is simply part of our ongoing portfolio rebalancing,\u201d DCG said.\n\nGrayscale earns a 2.5 per cent management fee on the 3mn of ether in the trust, equating to $209mn in the year to end September. DCG last sold shares in the Ethereum Trust in 2021, when the vehicle traded nearly at par with its net asset value, according to the filings provided by The Washington Service. Today the shares trade at half the value of the ethereum coin they represent.\n\nIts flagship bitcoin trust holds about 3 per cent of all bitcoin, worth $14.7bn, from which Grayscale earns a 2 per cent fee. It earned $303mn from fees on the bitcoin trust in the first nine months of 2022, according to securities filings.\n\nDCG has also moved to sell down smaller blocks of shares in Grayscale\u2019s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust and Digital Large Cap Fund, according to the filings.\n\nThe group does not allow investors to redeem their shares for the coins held in the trusts, which would help close the significant net asset value gaps. Grayscale is suing the US Securities and Exchange Commission over blocking the creation of a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing that this would benefit investors and allow redemptions.\n\n\u201cDCG faces a trade-off: they could allow redemptions and enable liquidity at par value, including for their own holdings, but they\u2019re better off not doing it because they make so much money from the management fees,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of Lumida Wealth. \u201cClosing the discount would mean giving up this cash cow.\u201d\n\nBefore cryptocurrency was easily tradable through reputable exchanges, the shares in Grayscale\u2019s trusts traded at a large premium to the value of the coins they held, incentivising holders of bitcoin and ethereum to hand over their coins for shares in the Grayscale vehicles."

        "content": "Governance tokens of liquid staking derivatives continue to outpace other digital assets as anticipation for Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Shanghai upgrade grows.\n\nShanghai, expected to launch sometime next month, is set to allow validators to withdraw staked ether from the Beacon Chain \u2014 some of which has been locked up for over three years.\n\nAssociated protocols and assets representing staked ETH are outgunning most other digital assets on the day, as well as on a year-to-date basis.\n\nLiquid staking solution Lido DAO (LDO) clinched a near 9% gain as of 7 pm ET. Frax Share (FXS) \u2014 the governance token of the Frax ecosystem behind frxETH \u2014 and staking pool Rocket Pool (RPL) were up 20% and 6%, respectively.\n\nIn year-to-date terms, LDO, FXS and RPL are up between 100% and 190%. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were down roughly 1% on the day and are each up roughly 35% so far in 2023.\n\nAs a result of the upgrade, tokens representing staked ETH will have the ability to achieve better price parity with ETH, making people more likely to trust them and hold on to them, according to Blockworks Research analyst Ryan West.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the supply of [liquid staking derivatives] already grow 5% since the start of 2023, with some versions growing more than others, such as frxETH growing 74% and rETH (Rocketpool) growing 10%,\u201d he said.\n\nMarket expectations are punting on the basis that the supply of liquid staking derivatives will continue to grow after the upgrade as there is a greater trust in the tokens to stay in line with ETH\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cThe liquid staking protocols sit in a unique position, where they can give their users withdrawals much quicker than the Ethereum protocol processes validator withdrawals,\u201d West said.\n\nThis is because the protocol typically has ETH that is constantly coming in through new deposits and from staking rewards that can satisfy withdrawals in the short term, he added.\n\nLido has revealed its plans for withdrawal processing, estimating a window of 28 to 48 hours for completion, unlike the Ethereum protocol which could take several weeks.\n\nThis is due to a steady influx of ETH from new deposits and staking rewards that enable Lido to fulfill short-term withdrawal requests, West said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Create Your Own Blockchain From Scratch - Built In",
        "content": "What is blockchain? Is it hard to build one? Where do you start? Which programming language should I use?\n\nI get these questions quite often when meeting people who are interested in blockchain technology. You may also be one of those people, but don\u2019t worry, I was, too.\n\n4 Steps to Creating a Blockchain Create a block. Add the data (header and body) to the block. Hash the block. Chain the blocks together.\n\nThere are plenty of blockchain resources online, but it can be overwhelming and frustrating to understand as a beginner to this booming technology. However, this article is a little different than those other resources.\n\nI\u2019ll approach the subject in baby steps with you, and guide you through the basic concepts of blockchain and how to program one using Golang (Go).\n\nFor speed, endurance, and security, most blockchain core engines are built in C/C++ (Bitcoin, EOS, etc.\u2026), Go (Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum), Java (Ethereum), Rust, Haskell (Cardano) and/or Ruby (Ethereum), then provide bindings to other easy-to-use programming languages.\n\nAlso, some blockchain engines combine many programming languages for robustness and ease-of-use for developers. Ethereum is the best example of this.\n\nWhat Prerequisites Do I Need to Create a Blockchain?\n\nA network.\n\nCryptography.\n\nA data structure and algorithms.\n\nDecentralized systems.\n\nJavascript, Go or Python knowledge.\n\nYou only need to understand the basic concepts to program your first blockchain prototype, so let\u2019s begin with some theories.\n\nMore on Blockchain: Sushiswap vs. Uniswap: What Are the Differences?\n\nWhat Is a Blockchain?\n\nYou can\u2019t program something you don\u2019t understand, right? Let\u2019s break it down. Blockchain is not Bitcoin. Blockchain is not a digital currency, Blockchain is a set of different technologies that had already existed before its creation.\n\nSo, is this a blockchain?\n\nNo, but bear with me.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify things with an example and some figures.\n\nLet\u2019s take a MySQL database that stores some information in different tables.\n\nAn illustration of a MySQL database. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nWith the above database, there are some limitations. It allows you to do some tasks, including:\n\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) operations. Storing the same information twice.\n\nBut its limitations are many, including:\n\nWe can drop the entire database either mistakenly or intentionally. We can\u2019t share sensitive information with others. It\u2019s centralized, which means there\u2019s a single point of failure and a security issue. There\u2019s no way to trust everything that is stored in it. Ill-intentioned people can comprise the database. The database needs a manager. The users don\u2019t have power over their own data\n\nWe need something different that\u2019s transparent, reliable and independent from people. Something that\u2019s automatic, immutable, decentralized and indestructible. That\u2019s where blockchain kicks in.\n\nA blockchain is a secure, trusted decentralized database and network all in one.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Work?\n\nIn other words, a blockchain is a chain of blocks. These blocks are like tables in the database, but they can\u2019t be deleted or updated. The blocks contain information such as transactions, nonce, target bit, difficulty, timestamp, previous block hash, current block hash, Markle tree and block ID, etc, and the blocks are cryptographically verified and chained up to form an immutable chain called a blockchain or a ledger.\n\nAn illustration of a blockchain. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nThe same chain is then distributed to all the nodes (computers or miners) across the network via a P2P network.\n\nIllustration of a blockchain P2P network. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nSo, instead of a centralized database, all the transactions (data) that are shared across the nodes are contained in blocks, which are chained together to create the ledger. This ledger represents all the data in the blockchain. All the data in the ledger is secured by cryptographic hashing and digital signature and validated by a consensus algorithm. Nodes on the network participate to ensure that all copies of the data distributed across the network are the same.\n\n5 Key Concepts in the Blockchain Ecosystem Cryptographic hash and digital signature. Immutable ledger. P2P network. Consensus algorithm ( PoW, PoS, PBFT, ETc\u2026). Block validation ( Mining, Forging, etc\u2026).\n\nI will explain these concepts more in detail as we go.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Using Blockchain?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to using blockchain, including:\n\nRemoving intermediary organizations. An immutable ledger Transparency Security Reliability\n\nWhen Should You Use Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is not a silver bullet, so, it\u2019s best to use it when:\n\nThe data stored cannot be modified (proof of existence ). The data cannot be denied by its owner (non-repudiation). You want decentralization. You want one source of truth. You want high security. You don\u2019t care about speed. For example, Bitcoin takes 10 minutes on average to validate a block of transactions. But some blockchains are faster because they use different consensus algorithms other than PoW. We will talk about this later.\n\nBlockchain Use Cases\n\nBlockchain goes beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. It can be used in different sectors, including:\n\nReal estate : Land ownership.\n\nHealthcare : Securely record the patient\u2019s data.\n\nFinance : Reduce the taxes and intermediaries, anti-money laundering and cross border payment.\n\nSupply chain : Track items from the vendors to the customers, including verifying authenticity and original content creation.\n\nCybersecurity : DDOS attacks.\n\nGiving the power back to the user: Own your data and share it securely with whom you want (DID).\n\nCryptocurrency .\n\nVoting mechanism .\n\nBlockchain Platforms and Applications to Know\n\nBitcoin\n\nEthereum\n\nHyperledger Fabric\n\nEOS\n\nChainlink\n\nCardano\n\nDogecoin (meme coin)\n\nMore on Blockchain: 22 Crypto Apps to Know\n\nBlockchain Types\n\nThere are three types of blockchain:\n\nPrivate: Use only internally, and when we know the users (eg. Hyperledger Fabric).\n\nPublic: Everyone can see what is going on (Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n\nHybrid: In case you want to combine the first two.\n\nCreate Your Own Blockchain\n\nThere are two ways to build a blockchain\n\nThe easiest way is to use a pre-built blockchain open-source like Ethereum (create distributed applications, altcoins , decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , etc.), Fabric (configure a private blockchain), EOS or Cardano, etc. so that you don\u2019t have to deal with the core engine, which is difficult to implement. If that doesn\u2019t fit your requirements, then you can build one from scratch or fork, modify and/or improve an existing blockchain open-source code. For example, Litecoin and Bitcoin cash were forked from Bitcoin. This last method is tougher, more time-consuming and requires a lot of work and a strong team.\n\nIn this article, we will build a blockchain prototype from scratch so that you can thoroughly understand the blockchain\u2019s state machine.\n\nMore on Blockchain: What Is Layer 1 in Blockchain?\n\nHow to Create a Blockchain From Scratch in Go\n\nWe\u2019re going to create the first baby blockchain in Go. You can also learn how to create it in Python, and JavaScript. These prototypes can help you understand the concepts we described earlier. We\u2019ll complete this in four steps:\n\nCreate a block. Add the data (header and body) to the block. Hash the block. Chain the blocks together.\n\nA block contains information mentioned earlier, but to simplify things We are going to remove some. Let\u2019s delve into the specifics.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Go, try to familiarize yourself with the basics, including functions, methods, data types, structures, flow controls and iterations, etc.\n\nAn error occurred. Unable to execute JavaScript. Try watching this video on www.youtube.com , or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.\n\nA tutorial on how to build a blockchain in Golang. | Video: Tensor Programming\n\n1. Create a Block\n\nWe\u2019ll start with creating a folder with two files in it, main.go and block.go\n\nFolder structure\n\ngo // the folder main.go // file 1 block.go // file 2\n\nMain.go\n\n// use the main package package main //import the fmt package import ( \"fmt\" ) func main(){ fmt.Println(\"I am building my first blockchain\") // print this CreateBlock(\"The hearder will be shown here\", \"the body will be shown here\") // call the function that will create the block and pass some parameters in it. }\n\nIf you run this program it will show an error because the CreateBlock function is not defined yet, so go ahead and create it in block.go .\n\npackage main import ( \"fmt\" // this will help us to print on the screen ) func CreateBlock(Header, Body string){ fmt.Println(Header ,\"\n\n\", Body) // Show me the block content }\n\n2. Add Data to Your Blocks.\n\nThe beauty of Go is that you don\u2019t have to import or export functions, just declare them with capital letters, and Go will find them for you. Now, open a terminal and move to your created folder, and run go build , then run .\\go on Windows, or ./go on Linux and Macbook.\n\nScreenshot of the Go program that calls a function and passes a string of data. | Screenshot: Sinai Nday\n\nWe just created a simple Go program that calls a function and passes some string data. Let\u2019s add two more files, blockchain.go and structures.go . Now we have four files: main.go , block.go , structures.go , and blockchain.go\n\n3. Hash Your Block\n\nI will add to each line of code some comments in order for you to understand what I am doing.\n\nStructures.go\n\npackage main //Import the main package // Create the Block data structure // A block contains this info: type Block struct { Timestamp int64 // the time when the block was created PreviousBlockHash []byte // the hash of the previous block MyBlockHash []byte // the hash of the current block AllData []byte // the data or transactions (body info) } // Prepare the Blockchain data structure : type Blockchain struct { Blocks []*Block // remember a blockchain is a series of blocks }\n\nBlock.go\n\npackage main import ( // We will need these libraries: \"bytes\" // need to convert data into byte in order to be sent on the network, computer understands better the byte(8bits)language \"crypto/sha256\" //crypto library to hash the data \"strconv\" // for conversion \"time\" // the time for our timestamp ) // Now let's create a method for generating a hash of the block // We will just concatenate all the data and hash it to obtain the block hash func (block *Block) SetHash() { timestamp := []byte(strconv.FormatInt(block.Timestamp, 10)) // get the time and convert it into a unique series of digits headers := bytes.Join([][]byte{timestamp, block.PreviousBlockHash, block.AllData}, []byte{}) // concatenate all the block data hash := sha256.Sum256(headers) // hash the whole thing block.MyBlockHash = hash[:] // now set the hash of the block } // Create a function for new block generation and return that block func NewBlock(data string, prevBlockHash []byte) *Block { block := &Block{time.Now().Unix(), prevBlockHash, []byte{}, []byte(data)} // the block is received block.SetHash() // the block is hashed return block // the block is returned with all the information in it } /* let's now create the genesis block function that will return the first block. The genesis block is the first block on the chain */ func NewGenesisBlock() *Block { return NewBlock(\"Genesis Block\", []byte{}) // the genesis block is made with some data in it }\n\nBlockchain.go\n\npackage main // create the method that adds a new block to a blockchain func (blockchain *Blockchain) AddBlock(data string) { PreviousBlock := blockchain.Blocks[len(blockchain.Blocks)-1] // the previous block is needed, so let's get it newBlock := NewBlock(data, PreviousBlock.MyBlockHash) // create a new block containing the data and the hash of the previous block blockchain.Blocks = append(blockchain.Blocks, newBlock) // add that block to the chain to create a chain of blocks } /* Create the function that returns the whole blockchain and add the genesis to it first. the genesis block is the first ever mined block, so let's create a function that will return it since it does not exist yet */ func NewBlockchain() *Blockchain { // the function is created return &Blockchain{[]*Block{NewGenesisBlock()}} // the genesis block is added first to the chain }\n\nMain.go\n\n//Time to put everything together and test package main import ( \"fmt\" // just for printing something on the screen ) func main() { newblockchain := NewBlockchain() // Initialize the blockchain // create 2 blocks and add 2 transactions newblockchain.AddBlock(\"first transaction\") // first block containing one tx newblockchain.AddBlock(\"Second transaction\") // second block containing one tx // Now print all the blocks and their contents for _, block := range newblockchain.Blocks { // iterate on each block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the block %x\n\n\", block.MyBlockHash) // print the hash of the block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the previous Block: %x\n\n\", block.PreviousBlockHash) // print the hash of the previous block fmt.Printf(\"All the transactions: %s\n\n\", block.AllData) // print the transactions } // our blockchain will be printed }\n\nLet\u2019s run it now, go build then .\\go .\n\nResult. | Screenshot: Sinai Nday\n\nVoila. Easy, right?\n\n4. Chain Your Blocks Together\n\nOops, our blocks in the blockchain don\u2019t have any IDs and timestamps. So, let\u2019s add that information by modifying the main.go file, add these two lines in the for loop :\n\nfmt.Printf(\"Block ID : %d\n\n\", i) fmt.Printf(\"Timestamp : %d\n\n\", block.Timestamp+int64(i))\n\n//Time to put everything together and test package main import ( \"fmt\" // just for printing something on the screen ) func main() { newblockchain := NewBlockchain() // Initialize the blockchain // create 2 blocks and add 2 transactions newblockchain.AddBlock(\"first transaction\") // first block containing one tx newblockchain.AddBlock(\"Second transaction\") // second block containing one tx // Now print all the blocks and their contents for i, block := range newblockchain.Blocks { // iterate on each block fmt.Printf(\"Block ID : %d\n\n\", i) // print the block ID fmt.Printf(\"Timestamp : %d\n\n\", block.Timestamp+int64(i)) // print the timestamp of the block, to make them different, we just add a value i fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the block : %x\n\n\", block.MyBlockHash) // print the hash of the block fmt.Printf(\"Hash of the previous Block : %x\n\n\", block.PreviousBlockHash) // print the hash of the previous block fmt.Printf(\"All the transactions : %s\n\n\", block.AllData) // print the transactions } // our blockchain will be printed }\n\nLet\u2019s save the code and run it again, go build then ./go .\n\nFinal result of your blockchain. | Image: Sinai Nday\n\nAs you can see, the blockchain is well structured. Except for the genesis block, each block contains its hash and the hash of the previous block, which makes it immutable. If the data in the block is altered, the hash will automatically change and the block will be discarded. The genesis block doesn\u2019t have any previous hash because it\u2019s the first one. There is no previous block.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Congratulations, you\u2019ve just created your first baby blockchain in Go.\n\nWe will gradually fulfill the blockchain requirements. Blockchain is a masterpiece that needs to be engineered the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nIn blockchain, there are also two common roles. A blockchain engineer and a blockchain developer. A blockchain engineer is a professional who thoroughly understands the principles of blockchain, security, and software engineering for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating the blockchain core engines and software. A blockchain developer is a professional who builds software on top of the blockchain called decentralized applications.\n\nMost blockchain developers use open blockchain platforms and frameworks like Ethereum, hyperledger fabric, EOS, etc. Now that you have the basics, it\u2019s up to you to decide which one you want to be."

        "content": "Digital Currency Group (DCG) has reportedly been selling shares of some of Grayscale Investments\u2019 crypto trusts in an effort to raise capital following the bankruptcy filing of Genesis.\n\nFounded by Barry Silbert, DCG is the parent company of crypto lending firm Genesis, asset manager Grayscale Investments and media company CoinDesk, among others.\n\nA quarter of DCG\u2019s stock in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has been sold, raising as much as $22 million in several trades since Jan. 24, the Financial Times reported late Monday, citing filings.\n\nETHE, which launched in 2017, has $5 billion in assets. The trust was trading at a roughly 54% discount to its net asset value on Monday, according to YCharts.com.\n\nDave Nadig, a financial futurist at data firm VettaFi, said the trust issuer\u2019s reported sale at such a steep discount highlights the need for a redemption window. Redemptions of shares for ETHE are not currently authorized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great look, obviously, but on the other hand, if a corporation needs to raise cash, selling assets is a pretty time-honored way of doing so,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nDCG has also moved to sell a smaller number of shares in Grayscale\u2019s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust and Digital Large Cap Fund.\n\nThose four trusts have combined assets under management of roughly $700 million.\n\nSpokespeople for DCG and Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nGenesis filed for bankruptcy last month after taking a major hit during last year\u2019s market turmoil. The company on Monday reached an agreement in principle with Gemini and other creditors on a restructuring plan, following a public feud with Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nDCG\u2019s reported sale of various Grayscale trust shares comes after the Financial Times said last month DCG was looking to sell some of its venture capital holdings, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s largest investment product is its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which launched in 2013 and has $14.5 billion in assets.\n\nThe cryptoasset manager has sued the SEC in an attempt to convert GBTC to an ETF, a process Grayscale executives said would help close the trust\u2019s discount, which has exceeded 40% in recent months.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told investors in a December letter the firm would consider a tender offer for GBTC shareholders if its bid to convert the trust to an ETF fails.\n\nThere is no concrete timeframe for a resolution to the legal wrangling, and some GBTC shareholders are growing impatient.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Polygon NFTs on Opensea Outshine Ethereum Once Again\n\nAccording to data from the Dune Dashboard, the number of unique Polygon NFTs sold on OpenSea has overtaken the number of Ethereum-based collectibles for the past two months in a row.\n\nSince December, when OpenSea handled the sale of 1.3 million NFTs in comparison to the 1 million NFTs that were sold on Ethereum, this pattern has persisted unabated. OpenSea reported the sale of more than 1.5 million NFTs on the Polygon layer 2 chain in the month of January, while the Ethereum mainnet reported sales of more than 1.1 million NFTs through the same market.\n\nThe exponential growth of Defi and NFTs on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in increased transaction volumes, causing network clogging and skyrocketing gas fees during peak usage times. Basically, every transaction on a blockchain network requires paying a certain amount of gas, a unit of measure used to calculate transaction fees. These fees have led to a search for alternative solutions such as Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche, which offer lower transaction costs and provide more efficient chains to host high volume NFT collections.\n\nThanks to its partnerships with well-known companies like Reddit, Polygon\u2019s NFT market is experiencing a surge in adoption. Despite the crypto market downturn, the number of first-time and returning buyers in Polygon\u2019s NFT market hit record highs in December 2022, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.\n\nAlmost 1 billion successful transactions were processed on the @0xPolygon blockchain last year\u26a1\ufe0f Check out this @DuneAnalytics dashboard reviewing Polygon in 2022\ud83d\udcca \ud83d\udccdhttps://t.co/XOPURG8LH4 pic.twitter.com/D3uFQ1uf3b \u2014 James (@JamesT0lan) February 5, 2023\n\nPolygon Rise as a Destination for Gaming NFTs and Affordable Collectibles\n\nAccording to recent analysis, Polygon outperformed Ethereum by a small margin. However, the number of traders on the Ethereum still exceeds that of Polygon, with Ethereum having 319,641 traders and Polygon reporting 224,719.\n\nEven though Polygon has sold more non-fungible tokens than Ethereum since the start of the year, Ethereum still has a much higher traded value overall. On OpenSea, Ethereum trades in January were worth about $446 million, while Polygon NFT sales were only worth $15.4 million. In the last 7 days according to the data from Cryptoslam, Ethereum has had $179 million of sales while Polygon has only $2 million sales.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t the first time that the total number of monthly Polygon NFT sales has surpassed Ethereum. Late 2021 and early 2022 saw a similar rise in sales, but then the number of Polygon sales dropped until just recently. Most of the most popular and expensive NFTs, like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, are still on Ethereum, which has a lot more trading volume than Polygon. However, the sidechain network is gaining traction as a destination for gaming NFTs and low-cost collectibles, which could help drive broader NFT adoption by reaching a larger audience.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Ethereum network\u2019s validator numbers remained steady despite bear market.\n\nDecreased whale interest, network growth, velocity, and trader sentiment raised concerns.\n\nValidators on Ethereum [ETH] could play a significant role in the network\u2019s future. New data on 6 February suggested that the number of new validators added to the network remained constant in 2022, even during the bear market.\n\nDid you know that there were 218,068 new Ethereum validators (almost 7 million ETH worth) that were spun up in 2022 alone? This was roughly the same number of validators that were spun up in 2021. Bull or bear, the demand for ETH staking is insatiable. pic.twitter.com/4gIthHw6KP \u2014 sassal.eth ?? (@sassal0x) February 6, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThus, there was interest amongst stakers, even in a volatile market. The upcoming Shanghai Upgrade was expected to further incentivize new validators to join the network.\n\nRecent validator interest could be driven by the positive developments surrounding Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the positives\n\nA positive indicator for Ethereum was the declining number of addresses in loss, reaching a five-month low according to Glassnode.\n\nHowever, despite this positive news, whale interest decreased over the last month. If large addresses decided to sell their investments, it could negatively impact retail investors.\n\nHaving a look at Ethereum, on-chain\n\nEthereum\u2019s declining network growth could be one reason for the decrease in whale interest, as there was a cutback in new addresses transferring ETH for the first time. This suggested that new addresses were not showing interest in the network.\n\nAnother reason for the lack of whale interest could be the decline in Ethereum\u2019s velocity, meaning that the frequency of ETH trades decreased.\n\nAdditionally, trader sentiment also turned negative during this period. Short positions against Ethereum increased, according to Coinglass. This surge in short positions increased after 1 February. At press time, the percentage of short positions against ETH was 51.57%.\n\nEven though traders were pessimistic about Ethereum, a new development with Visa could improve the network\u2019s odds of success. As per a 6 February tweet, Visa was using the Ethereum network to test USDT transactions.\n\nVISA: We've been testing how to actually accept settlement payments from issuers in USDC starting on Ethereum and paying out in USDC on Ethereum. And these are large value settlement payments. https://t.co/M2PkeQDNBL \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 6, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe aforementioned partnership could help increase Ethereum adoption and improve sentiment among traders and whales.\n\nOverall, the number of validators on the network and their continued growth, despite market volatility, suggested a promising future. The Shanghai Upgrade and Visa\u2019s partnership are key indicators to watch out for, as they have the potential to positively impact the king altcoin\u2019s adoption and its overall future."

        "title": "3 High-Growth Coins That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2030 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the cryptocurrency market, only one coin has ever attained a trillion-dollar market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC 0.65%). But a growing number of analysts and investors now think the next crypto bull market will result in multiple coins attaining a trillion-dollar valuation.\n\nJust how likely is that scenario? After all, the highest-ever market capitalization of all cryptocurrency combined -- which encompasses thousands of different coins -- was $3 trillion. So, unless the size of the crypto market expands dramatically, the path to a trillion-dollar valuation for any coin is difficult at best. Here's a closer look at three high-growth coins that might get there.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nThe case for Bitcoin attaining a $1 trillion valuation in the next bull market is more reasonable than it might sound, given that it topped out at $1.28 trillion in the last bull market. At a current market cap of $458 billion, Bitcoin needs to slightly more than double in value to reach the trillion-dollar mark. Given its current price of $23,785, that would imply a future price near $50,000 -- well below Bitcoin's all-time high of $68,789.63.\n\nThere are other, more sophisticated ways to think about a trillion-dollar valuation for the token. For example, prominent Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor has focused on the world's physical gold supply.\n\nIf you buy into the notion that Bitcoin is \"digital gold,\" then at some point, the value of Bitcoin and the value of the world's physical gold supply should start to converge. Right now, the value of the world's physical gold supply is estimated to be between $10 trillion and $15 trillion, so Bitcoin's maximum possible valuation could also rise to that level.\n\nThat logic might sound far-fetched, but Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has applied a similar reasoning process, arriving at a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin in January 2022.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nThe case for a trillion-dollar valuation is harder to make for Ethereum (ETH 0.32%), which currently has a nearly $200 billion market cap. It would need to increase in value fivefold to hit $1 trillion.\n\nEven at its all-time peak, the digital coin only reached a market cap of $571.67 billion, so there's clearly work to do. Slow, incremental growth is not the path to a trillion-dollar valuation for Ethereum.\n\nOne approach to valuing Ethereum is to separately value all of its business lines -- e.g. non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. You would then need to make a growth projection for each of these business lines.\n\nBut are any of Ethereum's core business lines capable of growing at a 5X rate? Take, for example, the NFT market, which was worth $25 billion in both 2021 and 2022. Assuming that Ethereum currently controls close to 75% of the NFT market, that's roughly $20 billion in annual sales. A 5X scaling factor would imply $100 billion in annual NFT sales for Ethereum.\n\nThat's possible over a long-enough time horizon, but most likely we would need to look elsewhere for a huge 5X impact. That's why many analysts are focused on sectors like the metaverse, where growth could be truly exponential.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the metaverse could be a trillion-dollar market opportunity, so even if Ethereum claims just a 10% market share, that's still $100 billion, more than enough to make up for any sluggishness in the NFT market.\n\n3. Solana\n\nLastly, there's Solana (SOL -0.98%), which had been a crypto market darling before the events of 2022 unfolded. Solana is up more than 100% in 2023, so things are looking sunnier for the crypto. Even with that rapid rise, its market cap is still less than $10 billion, so a trillion-dollar valuation would imply a more than 100X gain in value.\n\nThis presents enormous challenges from a financial modeling perspective. Is there anything Solana can do that will lead to 100X returns? Most likely, it would require several high-risk, high-reward strategies and a lot of good luck.\n\nThe good news is that it is making a big bet on mobile crypto with its new Solana Mobile initiative. And its expanding network of retail stores (which Solana prefers to call \"embassies\") could be one way to supercharge growth with retail investors.\n\nSolana is also going big on its global expansion strategy, investing in new initiatives across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nA long-term view of crypto\n\nThere's a good reason why venture capitalists like to refer to start-up companies that attain a billion-dollar valuation as \"unicorns.\" They are extremely rare. And rarer still are companies that obtain a trillion-dollar valuation. Right now, only a handful of publicly traded companies have ever topped that figure.\n\nThat's why I think it might take nearly a decade before we see multiple cryptos obtain a trillion-dollar valuation. For now, I'm pinning my long-term investment hopes on Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are both capable of reaching that peak without dramatic changes to their overall growth plans. If you are looking for cryptos to buy and hold for the long haul, Bitcoin and Ethereum are potential options."

        "title": "DeFi's Next Big Thing: Liquid Staking Derivatives - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The popularity of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) has increased significantly in recent months resulting in a surge in cash flow in DeFi. LSDs are a relatively new type of token that enables stakers to augment potential returns by unlocking liquidity for their staked cryptocurrency, such as ETH.\n\nLSDs have been exploding in popularity across the Ethereum ecosystem and have the potential to become equally as widespread among other Layer-1 networks, such as Polygon and Avalanche.\n\nLSDs are already playing a significant role in DeFi, making up over 20% of the entire TVL across liquid staking protocols. The dominance of Lido alone \u2014 currently the largest liquid staking protocol \u2014 is over 17% of DeFi\u2019s TVL as of February 2023.\n\nLSDs may have jump-started a strong rebound in DeFi activity, as the trend is likely to accelerate with the deployment of the Shanghai upgrade, which is expected to attract more stakers and thus boost demand for LSDs.\n\nHow do LSDs stimulate DeFi activity?\n\nLSDs grabbed the attention of DeFi users after Ethereum adopted the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which replaces mining with staking. ETH holders can now stake their tokens to maintain the network and generate an annual yield.\n\nHowever, two conditions limit access to staking for regular token holders. First, there is a minimum deposit limit of 32 Ether (ETH) to join the block validation battle. Second, the staked ETH remains located on the Beacon Chain until the Shanghai Ethereum update is completed, and even then, rewards will gradually become available.\n\nLiquid staking protocols solve the first problem by pooling ETH from multiple holders to facilitate participation in Ethereum\u2019s block validation process. Thus, protocols such as Lido, enable ETH holders to stake without having to run a validator node.\n\nLiquid staking protocols not only enable fractional deposits in their staking pools but also offer stakers derivative tokens based on a 1:1 ratio in the form of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs).\n\nStakers can use these LSD tokens in the broader DeFi market to leverage yield opportunities. Thanks to LSD tokens, stakers can multiply the benefits from their locked tokens, which otherwise would only generate staking rewards.\n\nHow to put LSDs to work?\n\nStakers that utilize LSDs can leverage various yield opportunities in the fast-growing DeFi space. For example, they can pursue generous yield opportunities on lending platforms by depositing their derivative tokens or using them as collateral to borrow assets for further market activities.\n\nSeveral DeFi lending protocols have integrated LSDs into collateral markets. Among them is Euler Finance. This Ethereum-based non-custodial lending protocol allows users to lend and borrow several LSDs, such as cbETH and stETH, derivatives that are facilitated by Lido and Coinbase.\n\nRecently, Euler added support for cbETH, the LSD token issued by Coinbase to ETH stakers who choose to stake with the exchange. Prior to the listing, cbETH holders couldn\u2019t leverage their collateral to facilitate other market opportunities. After launching support for this derivative, Euler attracted about $29 million in this asset alone, demonstrating the tremendous potential of LSDs in DeFi.\n\nSeraphim Czecker, Head of Risk at Euler Labs commented:\n\n\u201cThe fact that supplied cbETH on Euler exceeded grew so rapidly overnight after being promoted to collateral tier suggests wide appetite across retail and funds alike to trade LSD products beyond just Lido\u2019s staked ETH. With more than a billion in mintable cbETH, this market is bound to expand as DeFi traders use Euler to earn additional yield on cbETH or lever up on staking rewards.\u201d\n\nLSDs\u2019 market share in DeFi may surge\n\nThe DeFi boom back in 2020 wouldn\u2019t have been possible without stablecoins, which accounted for over 30% of the entire DeFi market at their peak. LSDs can have a similar impact thanks to their unique ability to enhance staking benefits.\n\nAccording to Staking Rewards, the percentage of staked Ethereum is only 14%, which is very low compared to Cardano\u2019s 71%, Avalanche's more than 62%, and Polygon's nearly 40%. One of the reasons why ETH holders are still hesitant to stake has to do with the restrictive condition of locking the ETH tokens when staking.\n\nThere is good news, though. The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will include a code, referred to as EIP 4895, which will enable staked ETH withdrawals. The upgrade will allow a 1:1 exchange of Beacon Chain staked ETH for ETH. This will encourage more ETH to be staked through liquid staking pools, which would drive demand for LSDs and potentially trigger rapid growth in DeFi TVL.\n\nEventually, other blockchains, such as Polygon and Avalanche, can benefit from their own LSDs, which would help them compete with Ethereum and contribute to a healthy balance across the DeFi space.\n\nLearn more about Euler Finance"

        "content": "In the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in southeastern Turkey, many in the cryptocurrency industry have sought a crypto wallet address to donate to, following the examples of India in 2021 and Ukraine in 2022.\n\nBut Turkey\u2019s 2021 ban on crypto as an everyday currency in payments discouraged the Turkish crypto community from starting a fundraiser, Baki Er, Turkish co-founder of crypto research platform Lytera, told DL News. There was a fear that donations would count as payment and would be illegal, he said.\n\nThe tide quickly turned when well-connected Turkish rock star Haluk Levent personally took the matter to the government.\n\nLevent, who also heads non-profit Ahbap and is currently involved in the rescue efforts in the eathquake region, asked his 6.9 million followers in a poll yesterday whether he should push for crypto donations since \u201cmany in the world are asking to donate in crypto.\u201d The poll received nearly 1 million votes, as of this writing, with 82% supporting the idea.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nAfter consulting the government\u2019s financial watchdog MASAK, Levent said, he received approval to accept crypto donations for one week.\n\nCrypto wallet addresses, set up in various blockchains such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, received more than $2 million in various cryptocurrencies within a few hours of his announcement. Avalanche Foundation, headed by Turkish-American Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, has donated $1 million.\n\nBlockchain explorer Etherscan has labelled the wallet on Ethereum as \u201cAhbap Yard\u0131m / Earthquake Support\u201d to distinguish it from scammer wallets. Ethereum is permissionless, meaning anyone can set up a crypto wallet and solicit transfers. No central authority may revert blockchain transactions.\n\nCrypto donations are tax-efficient in most jurisdictions since donors don\u2019t have to sell crypto for fiat, and can instead transfer 100% of the value to the recipient. They\u2019re also fast and low-cost, allowing for near-instant transfers from anywhere.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe death toll in the aftermath of the earthquake that struck near the city of Gaziantep has risen to nearly 5,000, with more casualties expected as search and rescue efforts continue for those still trapped beneath the rubble.

        "content": "TRON outperformed Ethereum in stablecoin dominance.\n\nThe network\u2019s growth is shown in TVL, whale interest, and price increase.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world has seen tremendous growth in recent times, with several networks vying for dominance in different sectors. One area where TRON [TRX] has been making significant headway is in the stablecoin sector.\n\nInteresting. More than 50% of USDT is on Tron and this % has been growing recently. For comparison, 39.87% is on Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/V30EbK1EJA \u2014 Patrick | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) February 6, 2023\n\nTRON saw growth in these aspects\n\nAs per the tweet above, 50% of USDT was present on the network, as opposed to Ethereum [ETH]. This dominance in the stablecoin sector was a significant achievement and could suggest TRON\u2019s strength in the DeFi space.\n\nThe stability that USDT provided made it a crucial component of DeFi, and TRON\u2019s ability to hold a significant portion of USDT was testament to its growing influence in the sector.\n\nRead TRON\u2019s [TRX] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAlong with its stablecoin dominance, TRON also saw an increase in its TVL. According to DefiLlama, TRON\u2019s TVL increased from 4.11 billion to $5.04 billion, indicating a growing interest in the network. The rise in TVL also suggested that more people are placing their trust in the TRON network and its capabilities.\n\nAnother positive indicator for TRON was the increasing interest of whales in the network. As more and more whales invested in TRX, the price of the token also increased, providing a significant boost to the network.\n\nNot all roses and sunshine\n\nIn spite of its growing performance, TRON was not bereft of challenges. According to Santiment, TRX\u2019s volume fell from 902 million to 423.75 million, which could impact the protocol\u2019s future. The declining volume suggested that fewer people were actively trading TRX at press time, which could negatively impact the network\u2019s liquidity.\n\nAlong with the declining volume, the number of stakers on TRON decreased by 21.49% over the last 30 days. This could suggest a lack of confidence in the network, causing a drop in TVL and future stability.\n\nAnother issue that TRON was facing was the decrease in the number of active and new accounts on its network. The decrease in active accounts is also a negative indicator, as it could lead to a drop in liquidity and make it more challenging for people to trade on the network.\n\nIn conclusion, the network\u2019s dominance in the stablecoin sector is a significant achievement, but the network also faced several challenges that could impact its future. It remains to be seen how things pan out for the altcoin."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe world's second most popular DEX and one of the most used dApps ever, Uniswap (UNI), expands to a next-generation second-layer solution for Ethereum (ETH), Boba Network (BOBA).\n\nUniswap (UNI) comes to Boba Network (BOBA) as proposal passes\n\nAccording to the joint official statement shared by Uniswap (UNI) exchange and Boba Network (BOBA) second-layer scaler, the platform has decided to add Boba Network (BOBA) to its toolkit of supported blockchains.\n\nThe results are in and the community has voted to launch Uniswap v3 on @BobaNetwork!\n\n\n\nCongratulations to everyone involved \ud83e\uddcb \u2014 Uniswap Labs \ud83e\udd84 (@Uniswap) February 3, 2023\n\nThanks to the overwhelming support of the community, the proposal to expand Uniswap (UNI) to a new platform has passed with 51.01 million \"yays\" of the 40 million needed. The proposal was backed by all major UNI stakeholders, including FranklinDAO (previously Penn Blockchain), GFX Labs, Blockchain at Michigan, Gauntlet and ConsenSys.\n\nThe exchange is set to deploy its architecture on Boba Network (BOBA) in the coming weeks, per its team's projections.\n\nAlan Chiu, co-founder and CEO of Enya Labs, Boba's core contributor, is excited about the Uniswap (UNI) expansion and claims that it will be a major milestone for Boba Network's (BOBA) progress:\n\nBoba Network's Hybrid Compute will make it possible for ecosystem developers to build a new generation of hybrid on-chain/off-chain DeFi applications atop of Uniswap. While the Uniswap protocol will remain permissionless, developers will be able to build a compliant layer atop of it that leverages Hybrid Compute to tap existing, TradFi-friendly KYC/AML services. As a result, Uniswap will become more accessible to the larger institutional market.\n\nBy press time, Uniswap (UNI) is the largest decentralized crypto exchange on Ethereum (ETH) with over $2.36 billion in total locked in smart contracts.\n\nNew community, new opportunities\n\nThe expansion to Boba Network highlights Uniswap's commitment to having its presence strengthened in the Asia Pacific region. Boba Network (BOBA) is a dominant L2 solution for the Korean and Japanese ecosystems.\n\nTo foster the progress of Uniswap (UNI) on Boba Network (BOBA), its foundation allocated $1 million in BOBA tokens for financial incentive programs focused on Uniswap's liquidity providers.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Boba Network (BOBA) made headlines in Q4, 2022, by becoming the first L2 scaling solution for BNB Chain and Moonbeam (GLMR)."

        "title": "Rabby Wallet, Your Alternative Ethereum-Compatible Wallet - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Ethereum is still one of the most used blockchains. However, many people are not happy anymore with the existing Ethereum-compatible wallets. That\u2019s why we introduce Rabby Wallet to you. This is a great alternative to either MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\n\nSo, let\u2019s have a look at what Rabby Wallet has to offer.\n\n1/3 Excited to see the growing community turning to Rabby for a better & more secure wallet experience thanks to all the supporters. First-time users may wonder how to connect Rabby to dapps. You can use Rabby to access all dapps through a \"One-click-switch\"\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/bmCkHlTmil \u2014 Rabby Wallet (@Rabby_io) February 3, 2023\n\nWhat Is Rabby Wallet?\n\nDeBank is the company behind Rabby Wallet. This is a Chinese company, founded by Tang Hongbo. However, they reside in Singapore. They track DeFi protocols, currently well over 800 spread out over 15 chains. DeBank also raised $25 million in funds for development. There were some well-known investors involved. For instance, Coinbase Ventures, Crypto.com, Circle Ventures, and more.\n\nOne of their development areas was with the Rabby Wallet. This is an Ethereum-compatible, non-custodial wallet. In other words, it connects to all dApps that MetaMask supports. But, it has more to offer. So, here are three features that make this wallet stand out.\n\n1: Multi-chain. Currently, Rabby connects to 44 chains. But the great thing is that Rabby will automatically switch to the correct chain. You don\u2019t have to manually switch chains anymore. However, you can set up a manual switch, but the settings only work for that specific chain.\n\n2: You see what you sign. This is a great feature because this wallet shows you exactly what you sign. This is in contrast to most other wallets. So, no more signing of transactions that you don\u2019t understand. It shows you what your balance will look like after the transaction. See the picture below.\n\nSource: Rabby Wallet website\n\n3: The wallet scans pre-transaction risk. Another great feature. Rabby screens each transaction before you can sign it. It will warn you if the transaction may fail or if there\u2019s a security risk. It will also tell you if the address was previously under attack. Furthermore, it will also tell you if the address doesn\u2019t exist on the chain. See the picture below.\n\nThey update their security rules on a regular basis. Rabby Wallet also underwent various audits.\n\nHow to Set Up Your Rabby Wallet\n\nSetting up the Rabby Wallet is super easy. To clarify, though, it\u2019s only currently available as a Chrome and Brave extension. Firefox and Edge versions are on their way. Follow the following steps for installation:\n\n\n\nDownload the Chrome extension and open it.\n\nNow you can either set up a new Rabby address or import an existing address. For instance, you can import your MetaMask or Trust Wallet.\n\nIf you set up a new address, write down the 12-word seed phrase. Make sure to store this in a safe and secure place.\n\nYou can also import your MetaMask. You have two options \u2013 either import the MetaMask seed phrase or the private key. That\u2019s all you have to do. You\u2019re all set to go.\n\nBesides hot wallets, like MetaMask, you can also connect to hardware wallets. For instance, to a Ledger .\n\nNow, all your tokens across all EVM chains are visible to you in the dashboard. See the picture below.\n\nBefore you can start writing down the seed phase, the wallet gives you ample warnings. This emphasizes the importance of storing your seed phrase in a safe and secure place. Furthermore, keep in mind that you should not store your seed phrase on your phone or laptop/PC. See the picture below.\n\nHowever, before you start using your this wallet, you may see the following message:\n\n\n\n\u201cMetaMask is in use and Rabby is banned.\u201d\n\nThis means that MetaMask is set as your default wallet. You can click on the \u201cflip\u201d button. This will make Rabby Wallet your preferred or default wallet. See the picture below.\n\nNFTs\n\nRabby Wallet also shows your NFTs in a well-organized way. You can see them, and the wallet shows you all Ethereum and Polygon NFTs you own. The wallet should show NFTs you own from all 44 chains the wallet connects to. Furthermore, all NFTs are also in specific collection sections. In other words, the NFT section of the wallet is efficient and easy to navigate.\n\nThis in contrast to other Ethereum-compatible wallets that don\u2019t show you your NFTs at all. I like it when a wallet is this well set up and organized for my NFTs. See the picture below. The yellow arrows show you the different chains.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Rabby Wallet seems like a perfect alternative to other Ethereum-compatible wallets. What I like about it are its three main features. The automatic change to the correct chain. The screening for potential risks. And Rabby shows you the transaction before you sign it. Furthermore, the wallet also has a well-organized NFT section. I have installed my Rabby Wallet, imported my MetaMask, and am about to start testing this wallet.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roofstock , the leading digital real estate platform specializing in single-family rental (SFR) properties, today announced the sale of an Alabama rental property via a non-fungible token (NFT) enabled by Roofstock onChain (ROC), its web3 subsidiary. Unlike commemorative NFTs that are used as a marketing tactic to sell homes, ROC uses the technology to settle real estate transactions via an NFT marketplace on the Ethereum Blockchain built by Origin Protocol , a web3 pioneer bringing real world NFT use cases to the market. Teller Protocol provides flexible, asset-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending options, with real estate lending accessible through USDC.Homes , a real estate financing marketplace powered by the Teller Protocol.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoing from our first sale in South Carolina to our second sale in Alabama in just a few months has proven that the model is scalable across different real estate markets,\u201d said Geoff Thompson, Chief Blockchain Officer at Roofstock onChain. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue innovating in the real estate industry by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. Buyers and sellers can benefit from instantaneous sale and settlement of rental properties, with flexible asset-based DeFi leverage options, all while maintaining transparency and security in the transaction process,\u201d added Sanjay Raghavan, Head of web3 Initiatives at Roofstock onChain.\n\nROC facilitates instantaneous sale and settlement of single-family rental (SFR) properties listed on its NFT marketplace powered by Origin Protocol\u2019s NFT arm Story. Located in Harvest, Alabama, the home is among the first property sales to happen on a blockchain via NFTs. Utilizing blockchain technology enables properties to be purchased more efficiently and transparently, compared to conventional residential real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cNon-fungible tokens are quickly gaining fresh utility while most of the world is no longer watching. As decentralized solutions begin impacting traditional industries to a greater degree, users will begin adopting the technology to reap the benefits of NFTs. In the case of real estate, transactions will become much cheaper, more transparent, and far quicker through the use of blockchain,\u201d said Matthew Liu, co-founder of Origin Protocol.\n\nRoofstock onChain links home ownership to non-fungible tokens by holding each property in a limited liability company. The LLC is then wrapped in an NFT on Ethereum, dubbed a \u201cunique Home onChain.\u201d From financing to title ownership, the entire transaction happened peer-to-peer on Ethereum. Non-fungible token transfers allow for seamless and transparent transactions on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nTeller Protocol has enabled DeFi liquidity providers to provide leverage for this NFT property purchase. Buyers can seek a loan for up to 80% loan-to-value of the sale price of the NFT with USDC Homes , a DeFi lending marketplace built on the Teller Protocol. USDC Homes is not affiliated with Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC). USDC Homes partners with a network of underwriters and data providers to verify identity and provide creditworthiness reviews for lenders.\n\nBorrowers can use Teller to raise a loan request and finance the purchase of a Home onChain through USDC Homes. Once a lender funds the borrower\u2019s request, the USDC Homes protocol permissionlessly uses funds to purchase the LLC NFT. The NFT is then transferred to a smart contract escrow vault until the borrower pays back the entire loan plus interest.\n\nAbout Roofstock onChain\n\nRoofstock onChain is the web3 subsidiary of Roofstock, the leading digital real estate investing platform for the $4 trillion single-family rental home sector. Using blockchain technology, Roofstock onChain provides investors the ability to purchase tokenized single family rental properties with one click, and to transact with crypto, cutting the time and cost incurred by legacy systems.\n\nRoofstock provides extensive resources for investors to actively participate in the SFR space, including data analytics, connections to property management companies and contractors, and other management tools. Founded in 2015, Roofstock has facilitated more than $5 billion in investment transactions to date.\n\nTo learn more or to get started with Roofstock onChain, please visit onchain.roofstock.com.\n\nAbout Origin Protocol\n\nFounded in 2017, Origin Protocol is a web3 pioneer developing innovative products in the crypto industry\u2019s fastest growing verticals of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Origin\u2019s NFT platform, Origin Story , the platform\u2019s NFT product, has powered NFT sales like 3LAU's $11.7M record-breaking music sale, the Charlie Bit My Finger viral video sale that generated global headlines, Paris Hilton\u2019s iconic \u201cPast Lives, New Beginnings\u201d series drop, and many more. Origin has worked with top NFT creators like Trevor Jones and Alotta Money as well as brands like Rolling Stones and Inspiration4/SpaceX, in addition to developing branded marketplaces for beloved NFT collections, including Pudgy Penguins and Karafuru.\n\nAbout Teller Protocol\n\nTeller Protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial lending book that allows users to lend and borrow any crypto asset with no price-based liquidation. Teller brings forth the first use case of on-chain credit in DeFi, which gives liquidity providers insights into wallet repayment probability which then allows yields above money market rates. Teller is live on both the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nRoofstock onChain Media Contact\n\nKayla Gill, kayla@serotonin.co\n\nOrigin Protocol Media Contact\n\nPeter Padovano, ppadovano@mgroupsc.com\n\nTeller Protocol Media Contact\n\nSeth Franke, seth@teller.org\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8565145f-772e-4d3d-9e3d-f2ee022c14e8\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9478311a-cadb-4302-9106-fe71e872fb06\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/13c1bd84-2d58-459d-9be3-87e7f9d111ae"

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe payment company Visa aims to establish a familiar process for settlements by enabling customers to convert digital assets into traditional currencies on its platform. This information was shared by Cuy Sheffield, the head of Visa's crypto division, during a presentation at the StarkWare Sessions 2023.\n\n\n\nAccording to Sheffield, the company has been experimenting with accepting settlement payments in USDC on the Ethereum blockchain and paying out in USDC on Ethereum. These payments are for large-value settlements.\n\nSheffield stated that the company is investing in global settlements using digital assets and fiat currencies. He explained that they want to create a familiar process, similar to converting between dollars and euros in cross-border transactions, for converting between tokenised digital dollars and traditional dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa is investigating how to incorporate blockchain technology into its existing infrastructure to speed up money transfers. However, at present, settlements are still conducted through the SWIFT system, which is a cooperative society established by European bankers to provide secure and standardised communication for transactions between its members.\n\n\n\n\n\nSheffield explained that their current system operates over SWIFT, which limits the frequency of money transfers. As a result, the company has been conducting experiments, including accepting settlement payments using stablecoins, to address these limitations.\n\nDuring a recent annual shareholder meeting for Visa, former CEO Al Kelly briefly discussed the company's plans for central bank digital currencies and private stablecoins. He stated that stablecoins and CBDCs have the potential to significantly impact the payment industry and that the company has multiple ongoing initiatives in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\nSheffield confirmed Visa's perspective on blockchain technology and digital assets, saying that the company is considering how to bring the value it provides through traditional banking channels to the blockchain using stablecoins. He stated that they believe there are substantial opportunities in this area and that they are keeping a close eye on its growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

        "content": "MetaMask Snaps aims to facilitate a \u201cmultichain future,\u201d allowing the Ethereum-based wallet service to support non-native blockchains and tokens for the Web3 economy.\n\nDetails of the latest in-development addition to MetaMask\u2019s growing ecosystem were unpacked at the StarkWare Sessions event in Tel Aviv, Israel, in Feb. 2023. Speaking to Cointelegraph Magazine editor Andrew Fenton, Alex Jupiter, product manager of accounts and key management at MetaMask, revealed details about potential blockchain synergies.\n\nThe last 18 months have seen the development of Snaps speed up after the success of MetaMask Swaps, which brought token swap functionality to the service\u2019s native browser extension. As Jupiter explained, interoperability is becoming increasingly important in the blockchain space:\n\n\u201cMetaMask has historically been an Ethereum wallet. We need to start moving beyond that. The multichain future is very clear.\u201d\n\nSnaps aims to create a permissionless ecosystem where developers can extend MetaMask in any way they want. Jupiter says the team is trying to create an environment where developers can use various application programming interfaces (APIs) from different blockchains to bring additional options to a user\u2019s core wallet experience.\n\nRelated: The blue fox: DeFi\u2019s rise and the birth of MetaMask Institutional\n\nMetaMask describes Snaps as a system that allows developers to extend the capabilities of the wallet extension. A snap is a program that runs in an isolated environment that can customize a user\u2019s wallet experience.\n\nThe possibilities are extensive, with a snap allowing the addition of new APIs to MetaMask, multi-blockchain protocol support and the ability to modify existing MetaMask functionality using external APIs. According to Jupiter, Snaps should be able to integrate with most blockchain protocols:\n\n\u201cTechnically it\u2019s possible for us to incorporate all of them. I\u2019m sure there's going to be an edge case. We have managed to extend Bitcoin, managed to extend to StarkNet. So it should be possible with any of them.\u201d\n\nAs Jupiter explains, MetaMask has already created a Bitcoin (BTC) Snap that allows users to interact with its protocol from the wallet extension. This is a more difficult proposition than integrating Ethereum virtual machine-compatible chains like Polygon, but the end result is a highly-interoperable wallet extension across the broad blockchain-based ecosystem:\n\n\u201cIt basically means that you don\u2019t need to go anywhere else and MetaMask can almost be the core of your Web3 experience.\u201d\n\nImproving Web3 functionality is another driving factor in the development of Snaps. Despite onboarding millions of users to Web3 through MetaMask\u2019s tools, Jupiter says that simple actions like signing transactions can still be precarious:\n\n\u201cPeople have problems in terms of knowing if they\u2019re signing a transaction whether it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nJupiter believes Snaps can address this area, allowing third parties to create transaction insights and potentially warn users of signing dubious transactions with unwanted consequences.\n\nMetaMask Snaps is currently available in the developer version of MetaMask Flask. Jupiter says the aim is to have Snaps integrated with the main MetaMask by the end of 2023."

        "content": "Data from Etherscan shows that some crypto scammers are targeting users with a new trick that allows them to confirm a transaction from the victim\u2019s wallet, but without having the victim\u2019s private key. The attack can only be performed for transactions of 0 value. However, it may cause some users to accidentally send tokens to the attacker as a result of cutting and pasting from a hijacked transaction history.\n\nBlockchain security firm SlowMist discovered the new technique in December and revealed it in a blog post. Since then, both SafePal and Etherscan have adopted mitigation techniques to limit its effect on users, but some users may still be unaware of its existence.\n\nRecently we have received reports from the community of a new type of scam: Zero Transfer Scam. Be careful if you see suspicious 0 transfer in your wallet record:\n\n\n\n1/10 \u2014 Veronica (@V_SafePal) December 14, 2022\n\nAccording to the post from SlowMist, the scam works by sending a transaction of zero tokens from the victim\u2019s wallet to an address that looks similar to one that the victim had previously sent tokens to.\n\nFor example, if the victim sent 100 coins to an exchange deposit address, the attacker may send zero coins from the victim\u2019s wallet to an address that looks similar but that is, in fact, under the control of the attacker. The victim may see this transaction in their transaction history and conclude that the address shown is the correct deposit address. As a result, they may send their coins directly to the attacker.\n\nSending a transaction without owner permission\n\nUnder normal circumstances, an attacker needs the victim\u2019s private key to send a transaction from the victim\u2019s wallet. But Etherscan\u2019s \u201ccontract tab\u201d feature reveals that there is a loophole in some token contracts that can allow an attacker to send a transaction from any wallet whatsoever.\n\nFor example, the code for USD Coin (USDC) on Etherscan shows that the \u201cTransferFrom\u201d function allows any person to move coins from another person\u2019s wallet as long as the amount of coins they are sending is less than or equal to the amount allowed by the owner of the address.\n\nThis usually means that an attacker can\u2019t make a transaction from another person\u2019s address unless the owner approves an allowance for them.\n\nHowever, there is a loophole in this restriction. The allowed amount is defined as a number (called the \u201cuint256 type\u201d), which means it is interpreted as zero unless it is specifically set to some other number. This can be seen in the \u201callowance\u201d function.\n\nAs a result, as long as the value of the attacker\u2019s transaction is less than or equal to zero, they can send a transaction from absolutely any wallet they want, without needing the private key or prior approval from the owner.\n\nUSDC isn\u2019t the only token that allows this to be done. Similar code can be found in most token contracts. It can even be found in the example contracts linked from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s official website.\n\nExamples of the zero value transfer scam\n\nEtherscan shows that some wallet addresses are sending thousands of zero-value transactions per day from various victims\u2019 wallets without their consent.\n\nFor example, an account labeled Fake_Phishing7974 used an unverified smart contract to perform more than 80 bundles of transactions on Jan. 12, with each bundle containing 50 zero-value transactions for a total of 4,000 unauthorized transactions in one day.\n\nMisleading addresses\n\nLooking at each transaction more closely reveals a motive for this spam: The attacker is sending zero-value transactions to addresses that look very similar to ones the victims previously sent funds to.\n\nFor example, Etherscan shows that one of the user addresses targeted by the attacker is the following:\n\n0x20d7f90d9c40901488a935870e1e80127de11d74.\n\nOn Jan. 29, this account authorized 5,000 Tether (USDT) to be sent to this receiving address:\n\n0xa541efe60f274f813a834afd31e896348810bb09.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Fake_Phishing7974 sent a zero-value transaction from the victim\u2019s wallet to this address:\n\n0xA545c8659B0CD5B426A027509E55220FDa10bB09.\n\nThe first five characters and the last six characters of these two receiving addresses are exactly the same, but the characters in the middle are all completely different. The attacker may have intended for the user to send USDT to this second (fake) address instead of the real one, giving their coins to the attacker.\n\nIn this particular case, it appears that the scam did not work, as Etherscan does not show any transactions from this address to one of the fake addresses created by the scammer. But given the volume of zero-value transactions done by this account, the plan may have worked in other cases.\n\nWallets and block explorers may vary significantly as to how or whether they show misleading transactions.\n\nWallets\n\nSome wallets may not show the spam transactions at all. For example, MetaMask shows no transaction history if it is reinstalled, even if the account itself has hundreds of transactions on the blockchain. This implies that it stores its own transaction history rather than pulling the data from the blockchain. This should prevent the spam transactions from showing up in the wallet\u2019s transaction history.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wallet pulls data directly from the blockchain, the spam transactions may show up in the wallet\u2019s display. In a Dec. 13 announcement on Twitter, SafePal CEO Veronica Wong warned SafePal users that its wallet may display the transactions. In order to mitigate against this risk, she said that SafePal was altering the way addresses are displayed in newer versions of its wallet so as to make it easier for users to inspect addresses.\n\n(6/10) Upon this, we have taken actions:\n\n1) In the latest V3.7.3 update, we adjusted the length of the wallet address displayed in the transaction history. The first and last 10 digits of the wallet address will be displayed in default, for the sake of address examination \u2014 Veronica (@V_SafePal) December 14, 2022\n\nIn December, one user also reported that their Trezor wallet was displaying misleading transactions.\n\nCointelegraph reached out through email to Trezor developer SatoshiLabs for comment. In response, a representative stated that the wallet does pull its transaction history directly from the blockchain \u201cevery time users plug in their Trezor wallet.\u201d\n\nHowever, the team is taking steps to protect users from the scam. In an upcoming Trezor Suite update, the software will \u201cflag the suspicious zero-value transactions so that users are alerted that such transactions are potentially fraudulent.\u201d The company also stated that the wallet always displays the full address of every transaction and that they \u201cstrongly recommend that users always check the full address, not just the first and last characters.\u201d\n\nBlock explorers\n\nAside from wallets, block explorers are another type of software that can be used to view transaction history. Some explorers may display these transactions in such a way as to inadvertently mislead users, just as some wallets do.\n\nTo mitigate against this threat, Etherscan has begun graying out zero-value token transactions that aren\u2019t initiated by the user. It also flags these transactions with an alert that says, \u201cThis is a zero-value token transfer initiated by another address,\u201d as evidenced by the image below.\n\nOther block explorers may have taken the same steps as Etherscan to warn users about these transactions, but some may not have implemented these steps yet.\n\nTips for avoiding the 'zero-value TransferFrom' trick\n\nCointelegraph reached out to SlowMist for advice on how to avoid falling prey to the \u201czero-value TransferFrom\u201d trick.\n\nA representative from the company gave Cointelegraph a list of tips for avoiding becoming a victim of the attack:\n\n\"Exercise caution and verify the address before executing any transactions.\" \"Utilize the whitelist feature in your wallet to prevent sending funds to the wrong addresses.\" \"Stay vigilant and informed. If you encounter any suspicious transfers, take the time to investigate the matter calmly to avoid falling victim to scammers.\" \"Maintain a healthy level of skepticism, always stay cautious and vigilant.\"\n\nJudging from this advice, the most important thing for crypto users to remember is to always check the address before sending crypto to it. Even if the transaction record seems to imply that you\u2019ve sent crypto to the address before, this appearance may be deceiving."

        "content": "Majority of cryptocurrencies saw a decline over the course of the weekend as a result of the fall in US stocks brought on by Friday\u2019s strong job growth figures, raising worries about potential interest rate hikes to control the economy and tame inflation.\n\nAfter giving up all of their weekend gains and trading flat on a weekly basis, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major crypto tokens were trading low on Monday. Traders eagerly anticipate the US Fed Chairman\u2019s speech on Tuesday for hints about inflation and monetary tightening. However, investors don\u2019t appear to be in a rush, as there seems to be a feeling of confidence that the market will soon be up and blazing again.\n\nBitcoin Fails To Continue Bullish Run\n\nBitcoin lost roughly 4% of its value and fell to around the $22,000 level in the early Asian hours. However, although falling more than 4%, Bitcoin still aintains an unassailable lead on the top of the hierarchy, with a lead of over USD 20,000.\n\nIt was, no doubt, a weekend to forget for Bitcoin, as it was seen fluctuating within a small band of $22,900 and $23,100 on Sunday. Bitcoin has dropped over the last week in the last 24 hours, with support at $22,800 and resistance at $23,150. And on Monday morning, it traded for as low as $22,700.\n\nHowever, analysts believe that BTC will bounce back up during the week and push further forward to continue its transcedental start to the New Year.\n\nEthereum Loses By 2%\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin\u2019s biggest rival lost about 2% of its total value over the weekend. Most alternative currencies were trading at lower prices, but the losses were limited. Ethereum however maintained above $1,600, despite the downslide and traded at $1,619 on Monday morning.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been moving in lockstep with that of Bitcoin, but if the negative regime starts, ETH will experience a sharp decrease. The smart contract token could find support at $1,429 in the event of rejection at the $1,677 monthly resistance level and a subsequent decline. Due to the intense pressure from investors seeking to book profits, a collapse of this level might push the price of Ethereum to $1,331. ETH might return to the $1,227 floor in a severe situation.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: All The Way Up!\n\nMeme coin, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has continued to live up to expectations, despite the cryptocurrency market going down over the weekend. As at Monday morning, the soon-to-be-launched token had made an incredible USD 23million in presale, after making USD 21 million by Friday\u2019s close of business.\n\nBIG also extended its 200% launch bonus till Monday, February 20, 2023. This allows investors to earn a treble of their investment when they purchase the meme token. This means, a one thousand dollar investment gives investors three thousand dollars worth of Big Eyes Coin. No doubt, this is the best cryptocurrency offer!\n\nThe exceptional performance of BIG at the presale is a testament to the trustworthiness of the token and its commitment to deliver premium cryptocurrency dividends for its investors. BIG has been on a constant rise since it was created towards the end of 2022, and will be going live in the shortest possible time.

        "title": "Arbitrum Airdrop Guide - Benzinga",
        "content": "Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that is taking the crypto community by storm with hints of a potential upcoming Arbitrum token airdrop. With its unique set of off-chain and on-chain executions, Arbitrum strives to provide lightning-fast and cost-effective transactions.\n\nIn recent months, Arbitrum has picked up considerable momentum, with increased liquidity flowing to the network. Rumors are circulating about a potential Arbitrum crypto airdrop in the near future.\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum scaling solution about half the size of Arbitrum, conducted the first stage of its airdrop in mid-2022, airdropping an average airdrop of 777 Optimism tokens per wallet (roughly $500 at the time). Given Arbitrum\u2019s superior size to Optimism, there is no telling how lucrative an Arbitrum airdrop could be. For example, owners of Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were airdropped tens of thousands of dollars worth of $APE.\n\nAlthough there have been no official announcements yet, several key reasons could explain why an Arbitrum airdrop is more than likely. The following article will explore the Arbitrum ecosystem and the likelihood of an airdrop \u2014 discussing strategies that could increase your chances of eligibility.\n\nget started Limited Time Offer: Trade $100, Get $10 Buy $100 worth of crypto and get a $10 bonus! get started Disclosure: eToro supports the following currencies: BTC, ADA, DASH, DOGE, EOS, ETH, LTC, NEO, XLM, XTZ, TRX, ZEC. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Show More\n\nWhat is Arbitrum?\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 solution that seeks to address the network congestion, poor efficiency and higher transaction fees on Ethereum \u2014 the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the world.\n\nArbitrum improves the capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts through a method called optimistic rollup, a type of data compression technique for blockchain transactions that roll up batches of transactions into a single transaction.\n\nThe benefit of this technique is that blockchains only need to verify one transaction \u2014 the rolled-up transaction \u2014 instead of having to confirm each individual transaction that is part of the rollup. This process improves efficiency, as the blockchain only needs to confirm one transaction, avoiding the need to wait while numerous transactions are validated at once.\n\nAlthough this process takes place on a separate layer to boost speed and scalability, Arbitrum leverages the security provided by the Ethereum mainnet. All validated transactions on Arbitrum are moved back to Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum vs. Other Blockchain Networks\n\nArbitrum is designed to provide a user-friendly platform that developers can work in to launch highly scalable and efficient Ethereum-compatible decentralized applications (dApps). However, it\u2019s not the first platform seeking to overcome Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nNotable competitors include Polygon, Optimism and Metis, among others. The following features separate Arbitrum from the rest.\n\nHigh EVM Compatibility\n\nArbitrum is widely regarded as one of the most EVM-compatible rollups. It\u2019s compatible with the EVM at the bytecode level and any language that can compile to EVM such as Solidity and Vyper.\n\nMarket Leader\n\nIn early February 2023, Arbitrum has the highest total value locked (TVL) out of all Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. Arbitrum takes the slight edge on Polygon with a TVL of $1.76 billion (3.52% of industry TVL) compared to Polygon\u2019s $1.22 billion TVL.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) All Chain - DeFi Llama\n\nSupporting a higher TVL than Polygon is no small feat. Polygon is a top 10 crypto by market capitalization with a market cap of $13 billion. For comparison, the next largest Layer 2, Optimism has a market cap of $650 million.\n\nWell-Developed Ecosystem\n\nArbitrum is already collaborating with a vast range of Ethereum dApps and infrastructure projects, including Uniswap, Sushi, DODO and dozens of others.\n\nWill There Be an Arbitrum Airdrop?\n\nAs of January 2023, no official plans have been announced for an Arbitrum cryptocurrency airdrop. However, here are a few compelling reasons why an Arbitrum airdrop is likely.\n\nAlthough Ethereum Layer 2 networks do not need a native token to operate, many other Layer 2 projects have launched their own tokens to facilitate governance and other use cases. A few notable examples include:\n\nPolygon\n\nOptimism\n\nMetis\n\nLoopring\n\nOn April 20, 2022, the same day that the Optimism airdrop was announced, Steven Goldfeder from Arbitrum tweeted the following message:\n\nAnother key reason why Arbitrum may launch a token airdrop is to reward its early adopters and repeat users. This strategy has been employed by several successful cryptocurrency projects, including Uniswap, a top 20 crypto by market capitalization.\n\nArbitrum AirDrop Guide\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to guarantee that you will be eligible for Arbitrum airdrop \u2014 if there even is one. However, several strategies can improve your chances of eligibility. These strategies focus on maximizing your activity, consistency and reach across the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n1. Purchase Ethereum\n\nThe first step you need to take for your best chance at an airdrop is to acquire ETH \u2014 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. ETH is used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\nEthereum can be purchased through a centralized crypto exchange such as Coinbase, Uphold or KuCoin. After you have acquired ETH, you transfer it to your software wallet of choice.\n\nEnsure that your chosen software wallet supports ETH or runs on the Ethereum mainnet. MetaMask \u2014 an Ethereum-compatible wallet that connects to hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps) \u2014 is a great choice.\n\n2. Connect Arbitrum to MetaMask\n\nTo see ETH in your wallet, add the Arbitrum network to MetaMask (or your other chosen software wallet). This is an extremely easy step.\n\nIn the case of MetaMask, the easiest way to connect to Arbitrum is to use the one-click method. To do so, visit the Arbitrum Bridge website and click on Add/Switch to Arbitrum Network.\n\nYou will receive a pop-up message from MetaMask. Click on Approve, and the Arbitrum Network will be added to your MetaMask wallet.\n\n3. Bridge Funds to Arbitrum\n\nAfter you have purchased ETH, the next step is to bridge your ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum network.\n\nTo bridge ETH, visit the Arbitrum website and connect your personal wallet to the application. From there, follow the instructions provided \u2014 the entire process can take several minutes to complete.\n\n4. Complete Guild On-Chain Quests\n\nOnce your ETH has been bridged to the Arbitrum network, you will be able to complete a few tasks on Arbitrum that will grant you access to the Arbitrum guild.\n\nCurrently, there are no added benefits of joining the guild other than a corresponding role in Arbitrum\u2019s official Discord; however, it is a great starting point for new users. To join the guild, visit the guild\u2019s official website and complete the necessary tasks.\n\n4. Weekly Arbitrum Interactions\n\nInteract with Arbitrum frequently \u2014 either on a daily or weekly basis. This important step ensures that you are an active and consistent user.\n\nThe rationale is to use as many protocols that support Arbitrum as possible as frequently as possible. The developers have released no specifications for how much ETH (or other tokens) you need to move around. It is up to you to determine an appropriate amount of assets you want to keep on the Arbitrum network based on your unique risk tolerance.\n\nPopular protocols that you can use that support Arbitrum and have interesting use cases include:\n\nGMX\n\nHop Protocol\n\nKyber Network\n\n1inch\n\nShell Protocol\n\nConsider making swaps, taking trades and adding liquidity and staking within liquidity pools.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nETH can be traded on major exchanges such as HYCM, Binance (or Binance.US for U.S. investors), Uphold, Crypto.com and KuCoin. Many of these platforms allow you to purchase ETH using your credit card, through swapping features or via trading pairs such as ETH/USDT or ETH/BTC.\n\nHow to Store Ethereum\n\nEthereum can be stored safely using a crypto wallet. Choose from two types of crypto wallets \u2014 software and hardware wallets. Software wallets allow users to easily manage their cryptocurrency, including buying, selling, swapping and lending through the internet. Hardware wallets, which keep private keys offline, are considered the most secure way to store ETH.\n\nIf you plan to actively engage in these tasks, it is recommended that you use a software wallet. Software wallets are superior at connecting to and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Arbitrum network.\n\nBest Software Wallet: Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is an industry-leading software wallet that enables crypto holders to store, buy, exchange and collect cryptocurrencies and NFTs all in one location. Acquired by Binance in 2018, Trust Wallet is trusted by millions of users worldwide. Users can access 250,000+ crypto assets on over 65 blockchains, which makes it a great choice for investors at all ends of the spectrum.\n\nIs Preparing for the Arbitrum Airdrop Worth it?\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that Arbitrum will have an airdrop or launch a utility token, strong evidence suggests that it is likely. To maximize your chances of eligibility, you may consider following a few of these tasks.\n\nWhether or not an airdrop is announced, Arbitrum is still a great Layer 2 solution with a vibrant ecosystem of dApps. Being an active user doesn\u2019t guarantee that you will be rewarded; however, the opportunity to leverage some of Arbitrum\u2019s fascinating dApps and learn more about decentralized finance (DeFi) is a benefit."

        "title": "Ethereum: The price trend and its market cap - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Thanks to the rising price, until a few days ago Ethereum\u2019s market cap was back above $200 billion.\n\nThe price trend of Ethereum and its market cap.\n\nAt the end of December last year, Ethereum price was around $1,200. This was not the 2022 annual low, however, because this was touched in June below $1,000, and it has never fallen below that threshold since.\n\nStarting on January 4, 2023, however, the price of ETH began to rise, although it did not rise above $1,300 until January 9.\n\nOn January 14 it had also already risen above $1,500, and on the 21st it climbed above $1,600.\n\nSo it has now been effectively hovering around this threshold for three weeks, with only one very brief spike above $1,700 on Feb. 2, and a low of $1,530 on Jan. 25.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market capitalization\n\nSince market capitalization is a purely theoretical figure obtained by multiplying the price of an ETH by the number of ETHs in circulation, its trend closely replicates that of the price.\n\nIn this case, however, the threshold to watch is precisely that of $200 billion.\n\nThe first time it reached that figure in its entire history was in February 2021, which was two months after the last major bull run began.\n\nIt should be noted that before the bull run began, i.e., in November 2020, Ethereum capitalized about $50 billion, or a quarter of its current capitalization.\n\nHowever, as early as May 2021 it was close to $500 billion, while the all-time high was reached on November 10 of that year at over $570 billion.\n\nEthereum capitalization today\n\nSo today\u2019s market capitalization is two and a half times less than it was in May 2021, and almost three times less than its peak in November of the same year.\n\nIndeed, looking at the curve from December 2020 to the present, it looks as if, outside the bubble, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization has hovered right around the $100 billion mark.\n\nIn other words, the bear market of 2022 has failed to bring it back to pre-bubble levels, and indeed after falling to $120 billion in June, it has returned to the usual levels of the past two-plus years net of the bubble itself.\n\nIt is as if from December 2020 to February 2021 it rose from $50 billion to $200 billion, only to be inflated by the bubble to $570 billion and always back to $200 billion with its burst during the bear market of 2022.\n\nIn short, an ascent to 570 billion followed by a descent to 120 billion, and then always settling back to the usual threshold of recent years net of the bubble.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance\n\nAnalyzing the dominance curve over the same period reveals that Ethereum\u2019s market cap has moved in much the same way as the crypto markets as a whole.\n\nIn November 2020, Ethereum\u2019s dominance was at about 11 percent, while Bitcoin\u2019s was at 64 percent. Ethereum has risen slightly, to 18 percent, while Bitcoin has collapsed to 40 percent.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s rise from 11% to 18% all happened in the early months of 2021, that is, from December 2020 to May 2021, after which it did nothing but hover around 18% for almost two years. Since December 2020 it has never returned to 11%, with a low peak at 14% in June 2022.\n\nBitcoin also fell to 40% in May 2021 and has since peaked at a high of 46% and a low of 35%.\n\nSo the first five months of 2021 saw a repositioning of BTC and ETH within the crypto market, which has subsequently held up to the present.\n\nETH\u2019s rise was not particularly significant, as its dominance had even exceeded 30 percent for a brief moment in the past, while Bitcoin\u2019s descent in dominance was decidedly more significant, due perhaps in part to the significant increase in stablecoin market capitalization.\n\nAlthough BTC\u2019s dominance had also fallen to 33 percent in the past, the fact that it has now seemed to have stabilized around 40 percent for almost two years gives a good idea of the change that has taken place in crypto markets in 2021."

        "content": "Bloomberg recognizes Polygon Blockchain as the outstanding technology that it is.\n\nBloomberg also predicts Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in the long term.\n\nPolygon is a blockchain that has stamped its mark in the industry. Bloomberg, according to its most recent report, is recognizing Polygon for its noteworthy growth and increased adoption so far.\n\nMike McGlone, the Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg, posted a recent report that goes over Polygon\u2019s notable performance in the last few years.\n\nPolygon has been recognized by Bloomberg, for its ability to scale a variety of decentralized applications. Polygon has surpassed its long-standing rival Ethereum, to host most dApps this year. Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf the entire worldwide blockchain economy, Polygon has the third-largest ecosystem for decentralized apps (dApps). Many of the most popular DeFi dApps on Ethereum, including Aave and Uniswap, have migrated over and are being developed on Polygon. Its 359 dApps is more than three times that of its closest L2 rival and half that of Ethereum.\n\nBloomberg also recognizes that the Polygon Network has more developers than other Layer 1 alternative like Avalanche and Fantom.\n\nPolygon is often making headlines, for its many partnerships with some of the most valuable traditional Fintech companies in the world, and Bloomberg is rightfully recognizing this.\n\nIn January, MasterCard tapped Polygon to launch artists into the web3 ecosystem through an artist accelerator program. Polygon has partnered with Starbucks, Nubank, Adobe, Adidas, Prada and many other global brands in recent times.\n\nBased on Polygon\u2019s string of brand-name partnerships in 2H22, this year could be the year of mainstream NFT adoption. The explosion in active users on the network stemmed from several blockbuster corporate partnerships struck by the company behind the network, Polygon Technology..\n\nBloomberg; Ethereum will overthrow Bitcoin\n\nBloomberg is also predicting that there will be higher asset prices and higher volatility. This will then result in cryptocurrencies facing their first real recession.\n\nThe inception of Bitcoin came during the last economic recession in the United States. Bloomberg is of the opinion that a similar milestone will be experienced, as the economy takes another turn. However, there is no telling how much loss would be recorded in the market before gains are sustained in the future.\n\nBloomberg perceives a resting bull market between Ethereum and Bitcoin, which it refers to as digital gold. According to Bloomberg\u2018s galaxy crypto index, there has been a steady Ethereum/Bitcoin rate since the 2021 peak.\n\nThis is suggesting that digital assets are moving towards a mainstream strong audience.

Rally To $1,848 Next?\n\nHowever, since making that bullish prediction on Ethereum, the Altcoin bulls have been struggling to break through major resistance. And for the past few days, we have seen the ETH price try to break through this $1,690 key resistance over and over again and failed!

        "content": "Bitcoin Analysis\n\nOn Sunday bearish traders of the Bitcoin market secured their first red candle in five weeks and sent the asset\u2019s value lower by $379 on the day.\n\nThe BTC/USD 1W chart below from holeyprofit is where we\u2019re leading-off this week\u2019s analyses. BTC\u2019s price is trading in between the 0.618 fibonacci level [$21,794.1] and the 0.76 fib level [$23,238.5], at the time of writing.\n\nThe targets on bitcoin to the upside of the weekly time frame are the 0.76 fib level followed by 0.86 [$24,255.78], 1.272 [$28,446.63], 1.618 [$31,966.13], 2.272 [$38,618.60], and the 2.618 fibonacci level [$42,138.10].\n\nIf bearish BTC traders can capitalize on last week\u2019s red weekly candle and inflict further damage to the downside they\u2019ll first need to push BTC\u2019s price below the 0.618 fib level. Their targets on BTC below the 0.618 are 0.5 [$20,593.87], 0.382 [$19,393.58], 0.236 [$17,908.47], and a full retracement at 0 [$15,507.88].\n\nThe Fear and Greed Index is 56 Greed and is +31 from last month\u2019s reading of 25 Extreme Fear.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Moving Averages: 5-Day [$23,258.91], 20-Day [$21,465.17], 50-Day [$18,716.77], 100-Day [$18,810.66], 200-Day [$21,697.22], Year to Date [$20,532.10].\n\nBTC\u2019s 24 hour price range is $22,777-$23,419 and its 7 day price range is $22,777-$23,485. Bitcoin\u2019s 52 week price range is $15,505-$48,162.9.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin on this date last year was $42,379.\n\nThe average price of BTC for the last 30 days is $21,041 and its +37.5% over the same interval.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price [-1.63%] closed its daily candle worth $22,936 and in red digits for a fourth consecutive daily session on Sunday.\n\nEthereum Analysis\n\nEther\u2019s price marked-down as well on Sunday and when traders settled-up to close the day\u2019s candle, ETH\u2019s price was -$37.47.\n\nThe second chart we\u2019re looking at for this Monday is the ETH/USD 2D chart below by SquishTrade. At the time of writing, Ether\u2019s price is trading in between the 0.5 fib level [$1,551.53] and the 0.618 fibonacci level [$1,664.82].\n\nOn the 2D timescale we can see below that the targets for bulls of the Ethereum market are 0.618, 0.786 [$1,826.11], and 1 [$2,473.66].\n\nBearish traders that are still shorting the Ethereum market are targeting the 0.5 fib level if they can crack an important level of inflection at $1,600. Below the 0.5 fibonacci level bearish ETH traders have a secondary target of the 0.382 fib level [$1,438.24].\n\nEther\u2019s Moving Averages: 5-Day [$1,612.70], 20-Day [$1,543.42], 50-Day [$1,360.12], 100-Day [$1,350.85], 200-Day [$1,508.89], Year to Date [$1,482.79].\n\nETH\u2019s 24 hour price range is $1,609.3-$1,673.81 and its 7 day price range is $1,5660.5-$1,673.81. Ether\u2019s 52 week price range is $883.62-$3,579.96.\n\nThe price of ETH on this date in 2022 was $3,056.40.\n\nThe average price of ETH for the last 30 days is $1,517.71 and its +35.39% over the same duration.\n\nEther\u2019s price [-2.25%] closed its trading session on Sunday worth $1,629.45 and in red digits for the first time in three days.\n\nAlgorand Analysis\n\nThe final chart to wrap-up the projects we\u2019re analyzing for this Monday is the ALGO/USD 4HR chart below from plancton0618. Algorand\u2019s price is nestled between the 0.5 fibonacci level [$0.2362] and the 0.618 fib level [$0.2543], at the time of writing.\n\nOverhead bullish traders of the Algorand market have levels to control of 0.618, 0.786 [$0.28], and the 0.886 fib level [$0.2953].\n\nBearish traders will be looking to send ALGO\u2019s price back below the heartline of its 4HR channel and are targeting the 0.5 fib firstly. Bearish ALGO traders have a secondary aim of the 0.382 fib level [$0.2182] which would potentially set up bears for a retest of the asset\u2019s 12-month low [$0.159].\n\nAlgorand\u2019s Moving Averages: 5-Day [$0.25], 20-Day [$0.233], 50-Day [$0.215], 100-Day [$0.27], 200-Day [$0.319], Year to Date [$0.233].\n\nAlgorand\u2019s 24 hour price range is $0.25-$0.27 and its 7 day price range is $0.239-$0.27. ALGO\u2019s 52 week price range is $0.159-1.10.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s price on this date last year was $1.02.\n\nThe average price of ALGO over the last 30 days is $0.23 and its +37.71% over the same span.\n\nAlgorand\u2019s price [-3.67%] closed its daily candle on Sunday worth $0.257 and in red figures for a second straight day."
