        "content": "The deluge of new cryptocurrency ETFs continues. Bitwise Asset Management announced today the launch of two Ethereum-themed ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange. With the launch, investors can gain exposure to futures in this category through the ETF wrapper for the first time.\n\nThe Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: AETH) invests in regulated CME ether futures focused on front-month contracts. The Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: BTOP) provides equal exposure to regulated CME bitcoin futures and CME ether futures. Both funds have an expense ratio of 0.85%.\n\nSee more: \u201c ProShares Launches 3 Cryptocurrency ETFs, Including 1st to Target Ether \u201d\n\n\u201cEthereum now has billions in revenue, millions of users, and thousands of distinct apps and developers,\u201d said Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley. \u201cAs the leading operating system for crypto, Ethereum has spread like wildfire. With blue-chip brands like Nike, Starbucks, Adidas, Pepsi, PayPal, JPMorgan, and others building and using applications on Ethereum, the momentum is only building. AETH and BTOP give investors the opportunity to participate in that growth with confidence through regulated ETFs.\u201d\n\nEthereum: A Broader Opportunity Than Bitcoin\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hougan argued in the news release that the \u201cportfolio opportunity with Ethereum is broader than bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHougan continued: \u201cSome investors consider Ethereum an alternative, while others see it as a traditional growth investment. It has elements of both. Like alternatives, Ethereum\u2019s correlation to traditional equities over the last two years has been low, and trending lower. At the same time, its increased usage and cash flows suggest it has the characteristics of a growth asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find that, to some investors, Ethereum makes more intuitive sense than bitcoin,\u201d he added. \u201cEvery time people use an Ethereum-based app, they pay a fee in Ethereum, which ultimately accrues value to investors in a manner similar to stock buybacks. With cash flows and real-world applications, Ethereum is often easier to grasp and value for experienced investors.\u201d\n\nThe launch of AETH and BTOP adds to Bitwise\u2019s broad suite of professionally managed vehicles. As of their launch, Bitwise\u2019s lineup of more than 20 products includes five crypto ETFs.\n\nMoving Day for Crypto ETFs\n\nThese Bitwise funds are part of several crypto-linked ETFs that begin trading today. The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) begins trading on the Cboe Exchange. ProShares also today launched three crypto ETFs on the NYSE, including the first ETF to target the performance of ether.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been clearing their desks ahead of the possible government shutdown,\u201d said VettaFi\u2019s associate director of research Roxanna Islam. \u201cThis means issuing delays for spot bitcoin ETF filings while likely allowing ether future ETFs to potentially begin trading early next week.\u201d"

        "title": "Ether Futures ETFs Fail To Dazzle On Debut, More In The Wings - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways The first of many ether futures ETFs started trading Monday, and more such products are expected to launch soon.\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nSome ether futures ETFs may also contain exposure to bitcoin futures.\n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. began trading in Oct. 2021, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nEther futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a decline in value and limited volume activity on debut Monday. The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) was down 6.6% at 3:30 p.m. Eastern, while Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) were trading 4% and 3.7% lower respectively.\n\n\n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S.\u2014ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\u2014began trading in October 2021.\n\n\n\nHow Ethereum Futures ETFs Work And Why Should You Care?\n\nEther, the native crypto asset of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind bitcoin. Ether futures ETFs, invest in futures contracts with ether being the underlying security, rather than investing directly into ether itself.\n\nFor investors, these products offer a way to gain cryptocurrency exposure without directly having to buy ether. However, cryptocurrencies are volatile, making investing in future ETFs risky.\n\nBut the ETF providers are trying to sweeten the deal. For example, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) is structured as a C-Corp in an effort to offer \"a more efficient tax experience for long-term investors,\" the company said.\n\nNot Just Pure Play In Ether\n\nSome providers are not limiting their offerings to just ether futures. Bitwise & ProShares have announced ETFs that would include both bitcoin and ether exposure.\n\nThe Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF will only contain ether futures contracts, while the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) will contain a 50-50 split of ether and bitcoin futures contracts. The custodian for both of these funds is Bank of New York Mellon. This brings Bitwise's total number of crypto-related ETFs to five.\n\nThe ProShares Ether Strategy ETF will strictly contain exposure to ether futures contracts. However, the firm is also offering two products that combine exposure to the prices of bitcoin and ether.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE) is intended to contain equal exposure to both bitcoin and ether, while the ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF splits price exposure between the two assets based on their current market capitalizations. All three of these ETFs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nValkyrie was expected to change the strategy of their bitcoin futures ETF to also contain ether last week; however, this update has been delayed due to a regulatory issue with the SEC. This product will be known as the Valkyrie Bitcoin & Ether Strategy ETF once it has launched. Ether futures ETFs from Kelly ETFs and Volatility Shares are also expected to launch soon.\n\nVanEck and others have filed to launch spot ether ETFs as well, but these applications are still awaiting Securities and Exchange Commission approval. Additionally, the SEC is considering the approval of a plethora of bitcoin spot ETF applications, most notably from BlackRock.\n\n"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH-USD) futures ETFs have begun trading in the U.S. for the first time. Yahoo Finance Live co-hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman monitor the price action in the crypto space, including bitcoin (BTC-USD), after the issuance of several ethereum futures ETFs.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: The ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise all launching their products. This coming as Grayscale files for approval to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund. So this is interesting, Julie.\n\nSo we've had, of course, Bitcoin futures ETFs for a while now. Of course, those made their debut during a very different time in the world of crypto. Bitcoin was a lot higher. Now we have these Ethereum-themed ETFs.\n\nI'll be very interested what demand is like. And to the extent there is demand, where does it come from? Does it come from retail investors, Julie, Josh, friends, and family, or is this, to the extent again that we see it, is it more of a financial advisor product? This is something they want to buy their customers.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: I'm not clear on the answers to any of these questions, right, because on the one hand, you have the SBF trial that is set to begin, that defenders of crypto would say, well, you get fraud in any asset class. This is not unique to crypto. Critics of crypto would say that there are qualities of cryptocurrencies that make it especially susceptible to fraud. In part, one of them being that it is not as regulated as other types of asset classes. So that debate rages on in the background, even as we get approval and beginning of trading of these new products.\n\nSo it's an interesting time, if you will. At the same time, we see Bitcoin up today, right? We see some buying again, even as the SBF trial is set to begin.\n\nEthereum, though, is trading lower. So all of these products are also under pressure in today's session. So it's unclear exactly what the situation will bring. I should also mention real quickly, Grayscale Investments is also now applied to have its Ethereum trust converted into an ETF. And of course, it's been on that similar quest with its Bitcoin ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Bitcoin, we just showed there. So near 28,000. It has rebounded strongly. But of course, way off that record of $69,000.\n\nI thought it was very interesting too, Julie, just what venture investors are doing right now. So these are obviously the men and women that are writing all those checks to those private companies. And this courtesy of Bloomberg, VC deals targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have shrunk to about $7 billion in total this year. That is about, Julie, a quarter of the full year tally in each of 2021 and 2022. So bottom line, VCs tightening their purse strings a bit here.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Again, you have that at the same time that the likes of Coinbase are in DC still really taking their case to regulators.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So much enthusiasm for those spot Bitcoin ETFs, right? That is really-- from at least the crypto fans."

Discover SCENE\n\nSeveral Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have started trading in the United States for the first time.\n\nInvestment firms ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares collectively debuted a total of nine ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Monday morning.\n\nProshares launched three funds: the Ether Strategy Fund (EETH), the Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BETH), and the Bitcoin and Ether Equal Strategy ETF (BETE).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Bitwise debuted its Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP).\n\nVanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) kicked off trading Monday, along with Valkyrie's Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF), and Volshares debuted its Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU). Brazilian fund manager Hashdex also rolled out its Ether Strategy ETF (EX).\n\nBut the nine funds got off to a slow start. As of 11:25am ET, they had traded little under $2 million in total, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Bulchunas, who described the volume as \"meh\" on Twitter.\n\nValkyrie's BTF was leading the race with around $787,000 worth of shares trading hands by that time.\n\nPretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group, a little under $2m, about normal for a new ETF but vs $BITO (which did $200m in first 15min) it is low. Tight race bt VanEck and ProShares in the single eth lane. pic.twitter.com/F9AHtrVcVf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 2, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe funds have a long way to go since the first Bitcoin futures ETF started trading on the New York Stock Exchange back in 2021: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF traded nearly $1 billion in shares in one day on its debut, almost breaking records in the process.\n\nBack then, at the height of the bull market, Bitcoin was trading for over $66,000 per coin\u2014nearly 60% higher than it is now.\n\nToday's crypto funds, which track the future price of Ethereum rather than the asset itself, come as investors await a spot crypto ETF. A spot ETF lets investors gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in question\u2014without holding the actual asset\u2014at the current price of the coin, while investing in a futures ETF is effectively a bet on a later price of the asset.\n\nAmerica's top regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has a long list of applications from high-profile Wall Street players\u2014including BlackRock\u2014to make a decision on.\n\nUntil then, investors wanting exposure to cryptocurrencies will have to trade futures contracts\u2014or buy the digital asset directly.\n\nCoinGecko showed that the price of Ethereum at the time of writing stood at $1,690, a 24-hour rise of just 0.5%. The asset is also up almost 7% in the past seven days."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nETH price increased by 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhales accumulated and staked as on-chain data suggests.\n\nA breakout was made but it encountered new resistance.\n\nLookonchain, a prominent on-chain analytics platform, has detected substantial crypto whales amassing and staking significant quantities of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nTwo significant withdrawals, totaling $7.2 million and $16 million in ETH, were executed from Binance, and the entire amount was subsequently transferred to staking accounts.\n\nThis whale activity coincides with a noticeable 4.7% surge in ETH\u2019s price over the past day, breaching key resistance levels. Furthermore, Ethereum\u2019s promising momentum is contributing to a broader cryptocurrency market resurgence, including Bitcoin.\n\nETH On-chan Data\n\nAccording to recent data from Lookonchain, there has been notable activity among crypto whales, specifically in their accumulation and staking of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nNotably, two substantial withdrawals from the Binance exchange have attracted attention. One whale withdrew ETH worth $7.2 million, while another made an even more impressive withdrawal of $16 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s intriguing is that both whales subsequently moved these substantial sums entirely into staking accounts.\n\nThat this isn\u2019t an isolated case and that more investors are staking ETH is shown on the on-chain Total Value Staked chart from Cryptoquant.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the Total Value Staked (TVS) has increased from 29,527,744 to 29,551,488 ETH, equivalent to $40,839,680 at the current price of $1,720 per ETH. This upward movement is part of an ongoing and consistent uptrend that gained momentum starting in mid-April.\n\nWhen we examine the staking rate, calculated by dividing the balance of the ETH 2.0 deposit contract by the total ETH supply, it becomes evident that mid-April marked the significant turning point when staking activity surged.\n\nThe ETH All Exchange Reserve chart further reinforces the notion of increased accumulation among investors. As ETH is withdrawn from exchanges and moved into private wallets, it indicates investors\u2019 willingness to hold ETH for the long term.\n\nIn a manner similar to staking, we are witnessing a consistent downtrend in this metric. The most pronounced period of accumulation occurred between November 6 and December 20 of the previous year when the total ETH held on exchanges dropped from 23,340,585 to 18,448,188, indicating a withdrawal of 4,852,397 ETH.\n\nCurrently, this figure is even lower, standing at 14,538,278 ETH.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOn September 11, ETH experienced a notable drop to $1,540. This marked a nearly 25% decline from its high on July 14, when it was trading at $2,030. During this period, the price chart exhibited the formation of a descending trendline that acted as resistance. Additionally, when combined with the lower descending trendline dating back to April 26, it created a descending triangle pattern.\n\nAs the price began its upward movement, it initially breached the resistance of the descending triangle, progressing to the next horizontal resistance level at $1,760, where it encountered a temporary halt.\n\nThis ascent, measured from its low on September 11, marked a 15% increase, suggesting the potential for further upward movement. However, a minor pullback might precede this, aiming to test the broken triangle\u2019s resistance as a newfound support. Consequently, we may expect a slight descent to around $1,650.\n\nIf this support level holds, it could pave the way for a continuation of the upward trend, possibly surpassing $1,800. It\u2019s worth noting that the descending triangle may have served as a corrective structure, potentially leading to ETH achieving a new yearly high, especially since it didn\u2019t achieve one on July 14, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nConversely, a robust rejection at the current levels, roughly around $1,760, could trigger another downward move, taking the price below its September 11 low of $1,540. In such a scenario, the next potential support zone lies at $1,360.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "The surge of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and BASE, overtaking Layer 1 blockchains Solana and Avalanche in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) as of September 25, 2023, highlights the pivotal role of Layer 2s in augmenting the scalability and transactional efficiency of the Ethereum network. The data underscores a growing preference for Layer 2 solutions, demonstrating their potential in enhancing the blockchain technology landscape.\n\nTop-performing Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum , Optimism, and BASE have outpaced prominent Ethereum competitor Layer 1 blockchains such as Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of September 25, 2023, according to Grayscale. This shift is pivotal as it demonstrates the growing significance of Layer 2 solutions in enhancing the scalability and transactional capacity of the Ethereum network.\n\nLayer 1 refers to the base protocol layer of a blockchain network. It encompasses the fundamental rules governing the network, including consensus algorithms, transaction validation processes, and the creation of new blocks. Layer 1 solutions are integral to the operation of a blockchain and include established networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana , and Avalanche. However, as blockchain networks grow in popularity, scalability issues arise, often leading to slower transaction speeds and higher fees.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are secondary protocols built atop Layer 1 blockchains, aiming to alleviate scalability issues by offloading transaction processing from the main chain. These solutions retain the security guarantees of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain while providing faster transactions and lower fees. Examples of Layer 2 solutions include Arbitrum, Optimism, and BASE, which operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains operate by processing transactions from decentralized applications (dApps) and subsequently \"batching\" them together. This batch of transactions is then sent back to the main network in a compressed form for final settlement. This mechanism serves as an auxiliary route or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway, thus optimizing the transaction process.\n\nBy functioning as outlined, Layer 2s enhance the overall usability and transaction potential of the Ethereum ecosystem while still leveraging the network\u2019s fundamental security. As the Ethereum network scales further, a significant amount of activity can transition to the more cost-effective Layer 2 solutions. This transition, in turn, directs value back to Ethereum, further bolstering its position in the blockchain sphere.\n\nAmong the 31 active Ethereum Layer 2 projects listed by L2Beat, five projects namely Optimism, Arbitrum, BASE, Starknet, and zkSync are recognized for their standout performance in fundamental metrics. A chart released by Grayscale on September 27, 2023, sheds light on these top Layer 2s by TVL. It's noteworthy that while Arbitrum and Optimism have launched a token, BASE, Starknet, and zkSync have yet to do so. The market caps column within the chart signifies the market cap for each respective token.\n\nA recent report by Will Hamilogden delves deeper into the landscape of Layer 2s within the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a more extensive understanding of this burgeoning sector. The report is available on Grayscale\u2019s website for individuals seeking a more comprehensive exploration of Layer 2s and their role in scaling Ethereum.\n\nSource: L2BEAT\n\nThe data from L2BEAT reveals that as of October 2, 2023, the sum of all funds locked on Ethereum converted to USD stands at $10.78 billion, marking a 4.64% growth over the past seven days. The TVL across various projects underscores the growing traction of Layer 2 solutions. For instance, Arbitrum One leads with a TVL of $6.03 billion, followed by OP Mainnet with $2.70 billion, and zkSync Era with $459 million.\n\nThe ascent of Layer 2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and BASE in terms of TVL is a testament to their value proposition in augmenting the Ethereum ecosystem. By surpassing notable Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche, these Layer 2s have showcased their potential in fostering a more scalable and cost-effective environment for dApps, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement of the blockchain technology landscape.\n\nDisclaimer & Copyright Notice: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as financial advice.

        "title": "Grayscale Ethereum (OTC:ETHE) Gains as It Moves to Convert Fund to ETF - TipRanks.com - TipRanks",
        "content": "Grayscale Ethereum (OTC:ETHE) has made a name for itself as a cryptocurrency stock focusing on Ethereum (ETH-USD), much as the name suggests. But it gained ground in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading as it made an important pivot that should help it catch more interest and manage more cryptocurrency assets. Grayscale moved to convert its operations from a trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on Ethereum spot trades.\n\nTo accomplish this, Grayscale has filed for approval with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S. and also got together with NYSE Arca to establish the fund. Currently, Grayscale is the largest Ethereum investment vehicle around, as it manages nearly $5 billion in assets. That\u2019s roughly 2.5% of all Ethereum currently in circulation.\n\nCurrently, Grayscale invests in Ethereum-based futures contracts. But with the move, it will be able to invest directly in Ethereum itself. Grayscale\u2019s CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, offered comment on the move, noting that this was an \u201c\u2026important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S regulatory perimeter.\u201d It\u2019s been said before that only institutional investment will truly allow cryptocurrency to take off, and making an Ethereum ETF should work nicely to pull some institutional dollars.\n\nWhat is the Future of Grayscale Ethereum Stock?\n\nThe future of Grayscale Ethereum is uncertain at the moment as it mainly relies on the price movements of the underlying asset. Nevertheless, a look at the last five days in trading for Grayscale Ethereum stock shows that it\u2019s making headway upward. While early in the period, it saw a clear decline, it recovered those losses within a few hours of trading and started a ramp-up. It\u2019s been continuing that ramp-up for most of the last five days, following a moment of near-vertical rise today and a loss of much of that gain over Monday\u2019s trading session.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase above $1,720 against the US Dollar. ETH could accelerate higher if it clears the $1,750 resistance.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase above the $1,720 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting trend line forming with resistance near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if it clears the $1,750 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Gains Traction\n\nEthereum\u2019s price settled above the $1,650 level. ETH formed a base above $1,650 and recently started a decent increase above the $1,700 level, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $1,720 resistance level and the price tested the $1,750 zone. A high was formed near $1,756 and there was a minor downside correction. The price declined below the $1,735 level. However, it is still above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,668 swing low to the $1,756 high.\n\nEthereum is trading above $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,750 level. There is also a connecting trend line forming with resistance near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is $1,800. A clear move above the $1,800 resistance zone could set the pace for a larger increase. In the stated case, the price could visit the $1,850 resistance. The next key resistance might be $1,920. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,000.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,750 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,710 level. The next key support is $1,680.\n\nThe 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent rally from the $1,668 swing low to the $1,756 high is also near $1,685 to provide support, below which the price could test the $1,650 support. A downside break below the $1,650 support might start another bearish wave. In the stated case, there could be a drop toward the $1,600 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,750\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The crypto market sees green as investors pay close attention to the launch of the Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) kick off October with impressive price surges. The largest cryptocurrency broke through $28,000 as October begins. Bitcoin is now trading around $27,990, up to 3.3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe price of Ethereum surged from $1,595 to $1,750 before hovering around $1,723 at the time of writing. It remains unclear if the market has made a turn, or if this is just a flash in the pan.\n\nBull Run or Bull Trap?\n\nThe sudden rally came amid the market\u2019s anticipation of the first Ethereum futures ETF product within this month. Last Friday, the community was abuzz with news that Valkyrie would be the first to offer the futures ETF.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC reportedly approved other Ethereum futures ETFs from VanEck, Bitwise, ProShares, Kelly ETFs, and Vol Shares. These 9 products will come on October 2.\n\nApart from Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin spot ETFs are also in the spotlight, even though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could continue to extend the deadline for a decision on whether to approve them.\n\nThe SEC has delayed a decision on Bitcoin spot ETFs several times, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, there is growing pressure on the SEC to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF. Crypto members are optimistic about a potential approval in early 2024.\n\nOn a day when the two largest coins celebrated the new month, other altcoins also heated up. Over the past 24 hours, Solana (SOL) surged by 12.05%, THORChain (RUNE) was up to 12.35%, and Polygon (MATIC) increased by 5.64%. Other top altcoins, such as Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX), also recorded gains of 1% to 3%.\n\nWith the sudden return of bullish momentum, \u201cUptober\u201d is now the trending keyword across the crypto members. Historically, the price of cryptocurrencies has mostly rallied in October.\n\nThe unexpected price move has benefited spot and long positions, but it has been painful for short sellers. According to Coinglass, $70 million in short positions were liquidated within two hours, with nearly $36 million worth of BTC shorts and $23 million worth of ETH shorts liquidated.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment expected the Bitcoin bull run could continue in October. According to Santiment\u2019s report, Bitcoin whales that own between 10 to 10,000 BTC have accumulated their highest holdings in 2023, currently at 13.03 million BTC.\n\nThese whales have also been quietly buying Tether (USDT) over the past six weeks. The accumulation of Bitcoin and USDT by whales and sharks suggests that they are confident in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat to Expect this October?\n\nTwo significant macro events this month are U.S. unemployment rate on October 6 and CPI reports on October 1. The data provide insights into the health of the economy and the level of inflation, which are both key factors that the Federal Reserve (Fed) considers when making decisions about interest rates.\n\nWhile the Fed took a pause in its interest rate hikes in September, many financial experts and analysts are of the opinion that this pause is temporary. They believe that the Federal Reserve is inclined to resume raising interest rates, possibly as early as its upcoming meetings in November or December.\n\nThe rationale behind this expectation is the Fed\u2019s ongoing efforts to control and reduce inflation, which has been running above its desired 2% target. Of course, the Fed is limited, and more rate hikes will put more strain on the global financial system.\n\nGiven this scenario, the crypto market could experience some effects from the federal agency\u2019s decision. However, its significance may be minor. Analysts and observers believe that the broader economic outlook is pivotal in shaping the crypto market\u2019s direction."

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Explores Ethereum Staking Changes \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nSource: a video screenshot, ETHWORLD / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently shared his thoughts on potential changes to Ethereum\u2019s staking system.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin discussed various protocols, including ERC-4337, ZK-EVMs, private mempools, code precompiles, and liquid staking, and explored the trade-offs associated with incorporating them into Ethereum\u2019s code.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind said the goal behind the article was to \u201cstart to build toward a framework for better identifying possible targets where enshrining certain features in the protocol might be worth considering.\u201d\n\nButerin expressed a stronger inclination towards incorporating certain protocols into Ethereum\u2019s code, such as ERC-4337, while being more cautious about others, like private mempools.\n\nERC-4337 is a token standard co-authored by Buterin, Kristof Gazso, Dror Tirosh, Tjaden Hess, Yoav Weiss and Shahaf Nacson that introduces account abstraction without changes to the underlying Ethereum protocol.\n\nMeanwhile, private mempols, or \u201cencrypted mempools,\u201d keep users\u2019 transactions encrypted until the moment they get irreversibly accepted into a block.\n\nHe acknowledged that each of these protocols present complex trade-offs that will continue to evolve over time.\n\nButerin Expresses Concern About Staking Concentration\n\nOne specific concern that Buterin mentioned was the concentration of power among Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking providers.\n\nLido, a prominent liquid staking pool, currently controls over 32% of the staked ether on Ethereum, with holdings distributed across different validators.\n\nAlongside Rocket Pool, Lido is a significant player in the ecosystem, but Buterin highlighted the need for more robust safety mechanisms.\n\nButerin proposed exploring additional solutions to enhance the safety and decentralization of liquid staking.\n\nRather than relying solely on moralistic pressure to encourage stakeholders to diversify their choice of staking providers, he suggested tweaking the Ethereum protocol itself.\n\nThis could involve refining RocketPool\u2019s existing approach or granting enhanced governance rights to a randomly sampled committee of small stakeholders. These measures could contribute to a more decentralized and resilient Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs reported, several prominent liquid staking providers have implemented or are in the process of implementing a self-limit rule in an effort to maintain the decentralized nature of Ethereum.\n\nThe rule ensures that these providers will not own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, which could help address concerns over the growing centralization of Ethereum staking.\n\nRocket Pool, StakeWise, Stader Labs, Diva Staking, and Puffer Finance are some of the staking platforms that have already committed to the self-limit rule.\n\nHowever, Lido Finance has decided not to commit to the self-limit rule.\n\nBack in June, the project put forward a proposal to impose a limit on Lido\u2019s maximum stake.\n\nLess than one half of one percent of the votes cast were in favor of the self-limit rule, while those holding more than 99% of Lido\u2019s governance tokens, LDO, voted for the protocol to not hold back on its growth.\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest staking provider, holds only an 8.7% market share, according to data from Dune Analytics."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter ongoing efforts to convert its Bitcoin (BTC) Trust into an exchange-traded fund, Grayscale now intends to do the same with its Ethereum (ETH) product.\n\nNYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF shortly after the first series of futures Ethereum ETFs reached the U.S. market.\n\nWhen listing a new crypto ETF, regulatory permission is always sought from the exchange listing the new fund\u2019s shares, rather than the sponsor itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter,\u201d said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein in a Monday statement.\n\nGrayscale did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAs with its Bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is the largest Ethereum investment vehicle worldwide, comprising 2.5% of all circulating ETH.\n\nSince launching in 2019, conversion into a spot ETF has always been the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of its intended lifecycle, per the press release.\n\nRight now, ETHE shares trade at a whopping 30% discount to the underlying ETH held by the fund. Whereas the total value of the fund\u2019s ETH holdings amount to $5.14 billion at writing time, its shares total to just $3.6 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnder an ETF structure, ETHE shares would be directly redeemable for the underlying ETH. This would likely bring the firm\u2019s net asset value and share value to parity.\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares for ETHE spiked 6.15% on the day.\n\nGrayscale turns from Bitcoin to Ethereum\n\nThus far, the company\u2019s long battle to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF is yet to bear fruit.\n\nHowever, a major court victory over the SEC in August boosted confidence among both Grayscale and its rivals that the agency may have no choice but to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF to list on U.S. markets. The court found that the SEC was being \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d toward Grayscale in denying its spot Bitcoin ETF application while permitting alternative futures Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSince then, GBTC\u2019s share discount has narrowed from 25% to 20%.\n\nGrayscale was one of many firms to file for a futures Ethereum ETF last month, which is backed by cash-settled futures contracts rather than actual ETH.\n\nA futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a given financial asset at a later date at a pre-determined price, effectively making them speculations on an asset\u2019s price trajectory."

        "content": "VanEck is stepping into the Ethereum blockchain with the launch of VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT). These exchange-traded funds (ETFs), structured as a C-Corp, are aimed at transforming how investors could benefit from the future of Ethereum (ETH), the company said. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, EFUT focuses on ETH futures contracts. It offers an investment opportunity that provides a tax advantage for long-term investors.\n\nEFUT is designed to invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Currently, the fund intends to focus on ETH futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nAccess to ETH Futures Market\n\nKyle DaCruz, the Director of Digital Asset Products at VanEck, said: \"While investors still do not have the means to gain exposure to digital assets here in the US via a spot ETF product, we're very pleased to be launching EFUT as a means to access the robust futures market that has developed around ETH itself.\"\n\nThe ETFs are actively managed by Greg Krenzer, VanEck's Head of Active Trading, who has over two decades of experience in trading across various asset categories, including futures.\n\nKeep Reading OANDA Crypto Goes Live in the UK, but Regulatory Hurdles Remain\n\nEFUT joins VanEck's Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) in offering futures-focused exposure to digital assets.

This delay, affecting major asset management companies including VanEck, results from a funding dispute in Congress and a looming threat of a government shutdown.\n\nThe affected companies face a third set of deadlines in mid-January, potentially subject to further extensions. However, the SEC has emphasized that decisions on these Bitcoin ETFs must be reached by mid-March.\n\nVanEck's previous application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was rejected by the SEC, as the regulators remained cautious about ETFs based on the spot price of Bitcoin. Recently, Congress urged the SEC to approve the pending applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, saying the asset class was similar to crypto futures ETFs that the agency had previously approved."

However, the metric began a significant descent after BlackRock submitted its application for a Bitcoin spot ETF in June. The decline continued, reaching its lowest level in a year, following Ark Invest\u2019s application for an Ethereum spot ETF in early September.\n\nCurrently, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE configuration does not support redemptions, a factor contributing to its trading discount. However, the proposed transition from a trust to an ETF, which inherently allows share redemptions, could potentially eliminate this discount."

        "content": "Here with more insights on the Ethereum ETF race is Van Eck, head of Digital Assets product Kyle de Cruz. Welcome to the show, Kyle. Good morning. Thanks for having me on. Thanks for being here. All right, you just came up in our last segment. We're talking about how each of the firms that are launching this ETF today are going to differentiate themselves from each other. Uh Talk to us about how Van Eck plans to stand out amongst these nine firms. Absolutely. As it was alluded to all, we're all investing in Ethereum futures contracts. And so really the only ways you can differentiate yourself are obviously cost, which were coming in significantly lower than most of the others at 66 basis points. And then further to that is how you structure the ETF. So we structured our is AC Corp and we feel that's a superior uh tax advantage vehicle for taxable, long term investors. And really that comes down to uh the long term benefit of being able to carry forward and carry back your losses in, in a asset class like crypto, obviously, that can be instrumental for investors. Yeah, if you could explain that a little bit more about the C Corp, uh some of the other structures that, that are out there in the market today. Um And how that, that might benefit certain tax payers. That's right. So essentially Etfs, most etfs that we all know and love are structured as RS. And so the C Corp, the difference between the C CORP is there's one negative and that's taxes accrue, corporate taxes accrue at the fund level daily. And so you may see a NAV underperform in both periods, however, counter to that, you are afforded the ability to carry forward losses. And so in down years, in A R, all those losses are actually just lost. And so in AC Corp, you can carry those forward and offset your future gains. In addition to that, all distributions from A R are taxed at your ordinary income rates, which can be as high as 37%. And so with investors in the CC Corp, you're actually taxed at QDII rates which is about 20%. But you're, you, you're taxed twice, right? You're, you're basically, you're taxed on the C Corp level and then you're taxed on personal, in personal income level that doesn't, uh you, you, you, as you mentioned that the, the carry forward would basically accrue to the C Corp not to the individual, correct, but it accrues to the NAV. So that is in your performance of the fund. And so when, when taxes are offset in the future or even three years back to call back taxes and, and the investor realizes that through the NAV and, and, but that's, that's assuming they're gonna hold for, for extended periods of time. Correct. That's correct. And that's why this structure is really ideal for longer term taxable investors. Let's talk about one of the other differentiators that Cynthia brought up in the last segment. Van E also announced that it's going to donate 10% of all profits from the futures ETF to Ethereum core developers for 10 years. Talk about what went into making this decision and how it's gonna work. Yeah, I think Vanex sits at a really unique intersection of traditional Trad if you will firm uh founded in 1955 to uh a kind of a crypto native uh uh future looking form. And one of the benefits of having this talent uh is people that are working and using this emergent technology daily. And so we are aware of the work and uh the time that these developers spend to maintain this Blockchain that we all are using. And so it makes sense that we all stand to gain both Trad and crypto native that we should be supporting that community. And so it really was a no-brainer. So, so just to be sure though, uh is it, is this gonna be like the Hollywood bottom line where there's never a profit? Uh How is this, how is this gonna work in terms of uh you know, as you mentioned, it's the court and that if there are losses, those losses go, they can basically carry forward to the future of clawback in the past. So how would it work here in this situation? Is it annually, is it uh based on like how, how are you calculating such such profits and, and as a and as a shareholder? Why, why don't I just get the profits? Why, why not let me deal with it and and allocate it to developers the way I want to, why do I have to have you guys do it? Sure. Now to be clear, this is va sharing our profits from the fund with the community. This is not impacting the shareholders of the fund directly. And so we will work with the details with protocol guilt um to figure out the timing, but to be clear, we intend to be fully transparent with this donation. And so to the extent we can be transparent and show transactions online, we will do so. Of course, the these details need to be finalized with the protocol guilt and va so, so, so that's uh that's the profit you're making on, on the uh on the transactions. But let, let me ask about kind of what happens today. I and this is a question asked uh previously to our previous guest. What happens if these uh you and the the other eight or so that have been approved for today? What if it, if it's lackluster? What does that mean? God forbid, I know, you know, this everything's gonna be perfect and great. You can fingers cross the whole works. But the reality is this, the, the world is a different place than it was a couple of years ago. What happens if this is the lackluster uh release? What does it mean for spot ETF S? What does it mean for the overall crypto eco ecosystem? If this underperforms uh investments today? Sure. I, I think, you know, for one, you're right as you alluded to, it's a different market today than even when Bitcoin futures ETF S were launched. Um Certainly things were, were going much better in the crypto space. But I think regardless of the amount of asset managers launching these products, this is, this is a monumental step forward for crypto. And the reality is since 2017, we were one of the first established ef issuers to file for a Bitcoin linked TF. We have always followed that ethos of if you want crypto exposure, you should buy it directly in self custody it. If you can't, then the next best way is to buy that through an EF and so we think there are a lot of investors out there today that either can't or won't buy spot crypto. And this product is really for those, Kyle. Thank you very much for joining the show. This morning and congratulations on the lunch. Good luck. Thank you all for having me. That was head of digital assets product, Kyle de Cruz."

        "content": "One layer of defense may not be enough to combat the centralization risks present in some ETH staking pool operators, said the Ethereum cofounder.\n\nEthereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns over the underlying mechanisms running on major ETH staking pool providers Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nLido and Rocket Pool are the two largest liquid ETH staking pools by market share, allowing users to participate in staking ETH, earning rewards, without having to lock their funds in the staking smart contract.\n\nIn a Sept. 30 blog post, Buterin said that both Lido\u2019s model of having its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) whitelist node operators and Rocket Pool\u2019s model of having users put down 8 ETH to run a node had different issues.\n\nLido offers users a derivative token called \u201cstaked ETH\u201d or stETH to represent the value of the amount staked, while Rocket Pool allows users to stake ETH by running a permissionless node.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s approach would allow malicious actors to 51% attack the network, forcing users to pay most of the costs, said Buterin. Meanwhile, Lido\u2019s DAO approach would create a scenario of potentially attactable governance gadget controlling a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s validtors if a single staking token dominates.\n\n\u201cTo the credit of protocols like Lido, they have implemented safeguards against this, but one layer of defense may not be enough,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nHe proposed encouraging ecosystem participants to diversify to different staking pool operators as a short-term solution to the prospect of one provider becoming too large, and thereby, a system risk to the blockchain.\n\nAnother solution would be enshrining features at a protocol level to curtail the effects of centralization in other areas. In his view, \u201cminimal viable enshrinement\u201d could be the middle ground that addresses these challenges without being too narrowly focused.\n\n\u201cRather than enshrining a full liquid staking system, changing staking penalty rules to make trustless liquid staking more viable,\u201d said Buterin, as one example of how this could be carried out."

        "content": "As the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has always dominated the headlines and drives the mainstream hype around cryptocurrencies. In terms of performance, it\u2019s no news Ethereum (ETH) has followed behind BTC in the past few years. However, according to crypto analyst Dave the Wave, Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nDave the Wave took to social media to share his views on the Ethereum/Bitcoin price action. The current trajectory shows Ethereum has been falling against Bitcoin in terms of performance since the beginning of the year.\n\nA more in-depth examination reveals that Ethereum has been following a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative of a continued downward trend. However, according to the pseudonymous crypto analyst, a larger timeframe presents a better view of the general situation of things.\n\n\u201cThe longer timeframe trumps the shorter, and helps to predict future price action, which is what speculation is all about, as opposed to simply describing recent past price action,\u201d he said.\n\nETH/ BTC Careful of [shorter-term] hindsight bias \u2013 it\u2019s a series of lower highs until it\u2019s not. The longer time-frame trumps the shorter\u2026. and helps to predict future price action, which is what speculation is all about, as opposed to simply describing recent past price\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kMrqN3istb \u2014 dave the wave\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf13 (@davthewave) September 29, 2023\n\nA closer look into a multi-year timeframe shows a falling wedge has been forming in the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair\u2019s performance since July of 2022. The current situation shows the formation of this wedge might be nearing its end which indicates a decrease in downside momentum and a potential trend reversal.\n\nThis possible reversal is reiterated by the Fibonacci indicator, which shows the downward trend is at the 0.236 level.\n\nCan Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum has frequently outperformed Bitcoin for periods stretching months at a time. The ecosystem also has a few key advantages over BTX that could help it outperform in the coming years.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin still reigns as the top cryptocurrency, Ethereum seems poised to gain more mainstream traction in the coming years. As more projects and blockchains are built and connected to the Ethereum network, we could see Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of performance as early as next year.\n\nBTC Remains The Primary Vehicle For Wealth Creation\n\nBitcoin still remains the primary vehicle for building wealth in both the crypto and traditional markets. According to Dave The Wave, Bitcoin is poised to continue on this trajectory for the next few years before becoming fully capitalized and on the same level as traditional markets. The analyst makes this prediction by sharing a logarithmic growth curve chart showing BTC still has a higher chance for growth in the longer term.\n\nBTC chart for growth | Source: X\n\nBitcoin, in particular, has led the crypto markets in gains for the past week. Meanwhile, Ethereum has also recorded gains of 9.82% in a 7-day timeframe and is currently trading at $1,730. However, Ethereum faces a resistance at $1,750 which could force a downside correction.\n\nETH price looks strong above $1,700 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from StealthEX, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Is ERC20 Ethereum? Exploring the Fungible Tokens and NFTs\n\nBlockchain technology has revolutionized the digital landscape by introducing decentralized networks and enabling peer-to-peer transactions.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in this field is the creation of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens come in various forms, including fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIn this article, we will explore the ERC-20 token standard, answer \u201cIs ERC20 Ethereum?\u201d, and the role in the proliferation of tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso read: US Excess Savings Depleted, Will it Impact Stocks And Crypto?\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nUnderstanding Fungible Tokens\n\nWhat are Fungible Tokens?\n\nFungible tokens are digital assets that are interchangeable with one another. In other words, each token is identical in value and can be exchanged one-to-one.\n\nThis interchangeability makes fungible tokens convenient for various use cases, such as digital currencies, loyalty points, etc.\n\nIs ERC20 Ethereum?\n\nThe ERC-20 Token Standard\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 stands for \u201cEthereum Request for Comments 20,\u201d and Fabian Vogelsteller proposed it in November 2015.\n\nThis standard defines a set of rules and functions that tokens on the Ethereum network should adhere to. It allows developers to create interoperable tokens with other products and services built on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso read: GTA 6: Interesting Points About the Use of Crypto In-Game\n\nKey Functionalities of ERC-20 Tokens\n\nERC-20 tokens provide several functionalities that make them highly versatile and widely adopted. These include:\n\nToken Transfer: ERC-20 tokens allow users to transfer tokens from one account to another. This functionality enables peer-to-peer transactions and facilitates the seamless exchange of value. Token Balance: Users can quickly check the current token balance of an account. This feature provides transparency and allows individuals to keep track of their token holdings. Total Token Supply: ERC-20 tokens allow users to retrieve the total supply of a particular token available on the network. This information is crucial for various applications, including market analysis and portfolio management. Token Approval: ERC-20 tokens include a function that allows token owners to approve the spending of their tokens by third-party accounts. This feature is essential for applications that require permissioned access to tokens.\n\nBy adhering to the ERC-20 standard, developers can create tokens that seamlessly integrate with wallets, exchanges, and other decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum network.\n\nExploring Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nWhile fungible tokens represent identical units of value, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.\n\nEach NFT has a distinct value and set of properties, making it one-of-a-kind.\n\nUse Cases for NFTs\n\nNFTs have gained significant popularity in recent years, primarily due to their ability to represent ownership and provenance of digital assets. Some common use cases for NFTs include:\n\nDigital Art: NFTs allow artists to tokenize their digital artwork, providing a secure and verifiable way to prove ownership and authenticity. Collectibles: NFTs enable the creation and trading of digital collectibles, such as virtual trading cards, in-game items, and virtual real estate. Virtual Worlds and Metaverses: NFTs play a crucial role in virtual worlds and metaverses, allowing users to own and trade unique digital assets within these immersive environments. Tokenized Real-World Assets: NFTs can represent ownership of real-world assets, such as real estate, luxury items, and intellectual property rights.\n\nERC-721: The Non-Fungible Token Standard\n\nWhile ERC-20 is the standard for fungible tokens, ERC-721 is the standard for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nERC-721 tokens provide a set of functions and events that allow developers to create, manage, and transfer unique digital assets.\n\nThis standard has facilitated the NFT market\u2019s growth and enabled the creation of various innovative applications.\n\nThe Role of Tokens in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nTokens and Ethereum\u2019s Native Currency, Ether (ETH)\n\nTokens created on the Ethereum network do not have their blockchain but instead rely on the Ethereum blockchain for security and transaction settlement.\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network and is often used as a means of exchange for tokens and as a gas fee to execute smart contracts.\n\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs)\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard significantly impacted the rise of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). ICOs allow startups and projects to raise funds by selling tokens to the public in exchange for ETH or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard provided a common framework for these token sales, making it easier for investors to participate and for projects to distribute tokens.\n\nTokenization of Real-World Assets\n\nOne of the most promising aspects of tokens on the Ethereum network is the ability to tokenize real-world assets.\n\nWith the help of smart contracts, developers can create compliant tokens that represent ownership of real estate, company shares, and other valuable assets.\n\nThis tokenization process can increase liquidity, fractional ownership, and easier transferability to traditionally illiquid assets.\n\nDeFi and Tokenized Finance\n\nTokens have also played a significant role in decentralized finance (DeFi) growth on the Ethereum network.\n\nDeFi applications leverage tokens to enable peer-to-peer lending, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and other financial services.\n\nThese tokenized financial instruments give users greater control over their assets and the ability to participate in a permissionless and open financial system.\n\nConclusion: Is ERC20 Ethereum?\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard and the emergence of NFTs have transformed the digital landscape, enabling the creation and exchange of fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network.\n\nFungible tokens offer flexibility and interoperability for representing value. NFTs enable unique digital asset ownership and provenance.\n\nBoth types of tokens have opened up new possibilities for decentralized applications, financial services, digital art, and more.\n\nTokens will grow crucial in the evolving Ethereum ecosystem, enabling decentralized transactions across diverse industries.\n\nWhether it\u2019s creating a compliant token, participating in a decentralized finance protocol, or owning a unique piece of digital art, tokens have become an integral part of the decentralized revolution."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe tokenization trend continues to gather steam.\n\nToday, UBS Asset Management, the asset management division of Switzerland\u2019s largest financial holding, announced the launch of its inaugural live pilot of a tokenized Variable Capital Company (VCC) fund.\n\nThe fund represents a legal entity for investment funds in Singapore that was introduced in January 2020 to enhance the city-state\u2019s position as a hub for fund management activities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm will leverage its in-house tokenization service called UBS Tokenize to initiate a controlled pilot of a tokenized money market fund, which comes in the form of a smart contract on Ethereum and lets the firm facilitate fund subscriptions and redemptions.\n\n\u201cThis is a key milestone in understanding the tokenization of funds, building on UBS\u2019s expertise in tokenizing bonds and structured products,\u201d said Thomas Kaegi, Head of UBS Asset Management, Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n\nHe said that within this initiative UBS will collaborate with both traditional financial institutions and fintech providers. The goal is to gain insights into how to enhance market liquidity and provide better market access for their clients.\n\nThe pilot is part of Project Guardian, the broader MAS-led VCC umbrella initiative, which aims to tokenize various real-world assets. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is the city-state's financial watchdog and central bank; Variable Captial Companies (VCC) are an alternative corporate structure to limited partnerships, trust structures and others.\n\nTokenization of real-world assets is the process of converting ownership or rights to physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis approach uses blockchain technology to transform tangible assets like real estate, artwork, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens that can be conveniently purchased, sold, and traded on a blockchain network.\n\nUBS joins tokenization wave\n\nThe financial regulator\u2019s previous efforts within the blockchain space included the exploration of potential decentralized finance (DeFi) applications in wholesale funding markets.\n\nTo that end, in November 2022, JP Morgan Onyx, DBS, and SBI Digital Asset conducted trials for foreign exchange transactions and government bond trades using modified public lending protocol Aave and the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nThe UBS Tokenize platform was also utilized in Hong Kong for the recent issuance of digital structured notes by Bank of China Investment (BOCI), amounting to CNH 200 million ($27.3 million). These tokenized notes were created and issued on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a similar development toward the end of the previous year, UBS launched the world\u2019s first publicly traded digital bond\u2014a 375 million Swiss franc-denominated three-year bond with a 2.33% coupon, which has the same instrument structure, legal status, and rating as a traditional UBS senior unsecured note.\n\nDespite its interest in blockchain technologies and allowing its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers has in the past ruled out actively offering trading, custody, or lending services related to \"alternative\" crypto assets, while also calling cryptocurrencies an \"untested asset category.\""

The actively managed fund provides exposure to Ether-linked investments via an exchange-traded instrument. It does not, however, directly invest in Ethereum or other digital assets.\n\nNOW TRADING: The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, $EFUT.\n\n\n\nThe transformation happens when enough of us are ready. #EnterTheEther. pic.twitter.com/cb2KMG3wfW \u2014 VanEck (@vaneck_us) October 2, 2023\n\nThe fund became effective on Sept. 29, 2023, according to VanEck; the Ethereum ETF fund is now available for trading, which is a significant milestone for the entire crypto industry.\n\nVanEck announced its huge decision to support Ethereum development over the weekend, revealing that it aims to donate 10% of the EFUT ETF profits to Protocol Guild, a grassroots funding method for over 150 individuals who are critical to the upkeep of Ethereum's core protocol, for at least 10 years.\n\nETH Futures ETFs debut in US\n\nThe first-ever exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum futures are set to commence trading in the U.S., concluding a years-long campaign by firms to establish investment vehicles centered on the second-largest digital asset, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to filings filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and announcements, ProShares, Bitwise and others are launching funds on Monday, in addition to VanEck's Ethereum futures fund, which began trading on Monday.\n\nThis is a big victory for the crypto industry, given that the SEC had previously not allowed such funds to trade.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices are on the rise in a positive start to October. At the time of writing, ETH was up 2% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1,712."

        "content": "UBS Asset Management issued a pilot tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum public blockchain. It is one of the controlled pilots that are part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Project Guardian.\n\n\u201cThis is a key milestone in understanding the tokenization of funds, building on UBS\u2019s expertise in tokenizing bonds and structured products,\u201d Thomas Kaegi, Head of UBS Asset Management, Singapore & Southeast Asia. \u201cThrough this exploratory initiative, we will work with traditional financial institutions and fintech providers to help understand how to improve market liquidity and market access for clients.\u201d\n\nA key advantage of tokenizing funds is greater liquidity through an expanded reach. That\u2019s where public blockchain can help. If it\u2019s possible to reduce fund distribution costs through technology, this translates to smaller denominations for investments \u2013 so-called fractionalization \u2013 which expands the pool of investors. High net worth individuals might invest in funds previously only accessible to institutions.\n\nDuring the first pilot transactions, UBS Asset Management executed fund subscriptions and redemption of the tokenized fund represented as a smart contract. It plans to work with more partners and explore other investment strategies in further live pilots. UBS used its own UBS Tokenize platform.\n\nThe fund is structured as a Variable Capital Company, a new Singapore corporate structure targeted at the asset management industry. PwC recently compared the VCC structure to others used by major asset management centers around the world.\n\nUBS\u2019 tokenization experience\n\nThe UBS Tokenize platform was used in Hong Kong for the recent Bank of China Investment (BOCI) digital structured notes for CNH 200 million ($28m). It also issued the tokenized notes on Ethereum. Late last year, UBS Wealth Management issued $50 million in blockchain debt securities. Investors included high net worth individuals in Hong Kong and Singapore via a private placement. In that case, it used a permissioned version of Ethereum.\n\nCloser to home, last year UBS issued its own CHF 375 million ($411m) bond via the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), a bond listed on both SDX and SIX, even though the bond is natively digital. This was possible because SDX linked its central security depositary (CSD) to the main SIX SIS CSD. The UBS bond is also possibly the largest digital bond issued so far.\n\nTalking about blockchain earlier this year, UBS Chair Colm Kelleher recently said, \u201cThe technology\u2019s unstoppable. Blockchain technology will reduce huge operational friction, reduce costs and, harnessed properly, will be a very good value additive to the chain.\u201d"

        "title": "VanEck Launches EFUT, the Only Ethereum Futures ETF Structured as a C-Corp. - Business Wire",
        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today launching the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (CBOE: EFUT), a unique new actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts. EFUT is the only ETF providing focused exposure to ETH futures that is structured as a C-Corp., potentially offering a more efficient tax experience for long-term investors. EFUT does not invest in ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\n\u201cEthereum is the layer 1 building block of the decentralized applications ecosystem, driving innovations in digital currencies, global payments, smart contracts and much more, with Ethereum as the platform\u2019s method of exchange. While investors still do not have the means to gain exposure to digital assets here in the U.S. via a spot ETF product, we\u2019re very pleased to be launching EFUT as a means to access the robust futures market that has developed around ETH itself,\u201d said Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Asset Product with VanEck.\n\nEFUT invests in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, the only ETH futures the Fund intends to invest in are those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nEFUT is actively managed by Greg Krenzer, Head of Active Trading for VanEck. Mr. Krenzer joined the firm in 1994 and has more than two decades of experience trading in a host of asset categories, including the futures space.\n\n\u201cExperience matters when selecting a fund manager, and VanEck has a long history of investing across global markets and through different market cycles. Our legacy of offering investors access to important new segments of the capital markets continues with the launch of EFUT,\u201d said Ed Lopez, Head of Product Management at VanEck. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to be bringing this new ETF to market and to be providing a key building block for a diversified digital assets portfolio for individuals and advisors.\u201d\n\nEFUT joins the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) in providing futures-focused exposure to key digital assets. Like EFUT, XBTF is also structured as a C-Corp. XBTF does not invest in BTC or other digital assets directly.\n\nVanEck will be posting updates on EFUT on X (formerly Twitter) at @vaneck_us and the firm is a prolific producer of research and insights on the digital assets space, which can be accessed here.\n\nAbout VanEck\n\nVanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm\u2019s drive to identify asset classes and trends \u2013 including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 \u2013 that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.\n\nToday, VanEck offers active and passive strategies with compelling exposures supported by well-designed investment processes. As of August 31, 2023, VanEck managed approximately $80.8B in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs and institutional accounts. The firm\u2019s capabilities range from core investment opportunities to more specialized exposures to enhance portfolio diversification. Our actively managed strategies are fueled by in-depth, bottom-up research and security selection from portfolio managers with direct experience in the sectors and regions in which they invest. Investability, liquidity, diversity, and transparency are key to the experienced decision-making around market and index selection underlying VanEck\u2019s passive strategies.\n\nSince our founding in 1955, putting our clients\u2019 interests first, in all market environments, has been at the heart of the firm\u2019s mission.\n\nImportant Disclosures\n\nThe value of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoion (BTC) and the Funds\u2019 Futures holdings, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment. The Funds do not invest in BTC, ETH or other digital assets directly.\n\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the digital asset networks may adversely affect the price of digital assets and therefore cause the Funds to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in digital assets or restrict the use of digital assets or the operations of the digital asset networks or venues on which digital assets trade in a manner that adversely affects the price of digital assets and, therefore, the Funds\u2019 digital asset Futures. Digital assets generally operate without central authority (such as a bank) and are not backed by any government, digital assets are not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of digital assets, and regulation in the United States is still developing.\n\nFutures Contract Risk. The use of futures contracts involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets. The market for digital asset Futures may be less developed, and potentially less liquid and more volatile, than more established futures markets. Digital asset Futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Funds\u2019 ability to achieve its target exposure. Margin requirements for digital asset Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) may be substantially higher than margin requirements for many other types of futures contracts. Futures contracts exhibit \u201cfutures basis,\u201d which refers to the difference between the current market value of the underlying digital asset (the \u201cspot\u201d price) and the price of the cash-settled futures contracts.\n\nThis risk may be adversely affected by \u201cnegative roll yields\u201d in \u201ccontango\u201d markets. The Funds will \u201croll\u201d out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract on a digital asset with a later expiration date. The \u201crolling\u201d feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Funds\u2019 performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the digital asset. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a \u201ccontango\u201d market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) may be subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, risks related to market and volatility, investment (in ETH futures), ETH and ETH futures, futures contract, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, credit, interest rate, liquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bond, ETH-related company, ETH-related concentration, and equity securities risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) may be subject to risks which include, among others market and volatility, investment, futures contract, derivatives, investments related to bitcoin and bitcoin futures, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, indirect investment, credit, interest rate, illiquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/asset-backed securities, and sovereign bond risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund.\n\nInvesting involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal.

        "content": "September 15 2023 marked exactly one year since the Ethereum blockchain conducted the Merge, whereby becoming a full Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain.\n\nBefore the transition, Ethereum utilized the same consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, which is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). This mechanism required miners to compete in solving complex mathematical puzzles, and in return for participating in the energy-intensive process, they were rewarded with cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nEnergy Consumption\n\nEthereum\u2019s shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) meant that validators, not miners, were required to stake Ethereum as collateral in exchange for network security and rewards. This change aimed to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability.\n\nA report from the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute indicates that the network\u2019s carbon footprint decreased by 99.99% as a result of this transition.\n\n\"The merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%\" \u2013 @drakefjustin \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nStaked Ethereum\n\nAround 23% of the total $ETH supply is now staked. This puts the total staked at ~27.4 million ETH, equating to ~$45B. h/t @hildobby_ pic.twitter.com/iyadwg46ty \u2014 Binance (@binance) October 8, 2023\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s PoS transition, the amount of Ethereum staked has nearly doubled. The total amount has grown by 93% to reach 26.5 million Ethereum, which is valued at nearly $43 billion. According to a dashboard on Dune created by Dragonfly Data Scientist, Hildebert Mouli\u00e9, this represents approximately one out of every five Ethereum tokens in circulation.\n\nCentralization\n\nIn the aftermath of the PoS upgrade, concerns about centralization and censorship were raised especially after it emerged that two entities, Lido and Coinbase, controlled 46.15% of validator nodes adding blocks to the Ethereum blockchain just hours after it transitioned to a full Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain.\n\nOne year later, Lido controls about 32% of total staked amount while Coinbase controls 8.3%, with the top ten list dominated by either staking pools or centralized exchanges.\n\nWhile not an exchange, the heavy utilization of Lido, a liquid staking solution, has been identified as a potential vulnerability in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem in terms of decentralization.\n\nLido Staked Ethereum ($STETH) stands out prominently, boasting a market capitalization of $14 billion, as reported by CoinGecko.\n\nThe second-largest token representing staked Ethereum by market capitalization is Rocket Pool ETH ($RETH), with a market capitalization of $926 million.\n\nIncreased Impact of Scaling Solutions\n\nScaling solutions that seek to address Ethereum\u2019s limitations have also become more impactful, one year since the Merge.\n\nThe average transactions per second (TPS) across all Ethereum layer-2 networks has now exceeded 50, marking a substantial improvement from the previous year. This data, sourced from L2 Beat, reflects the increasing scalability and efficiency of layer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen you aggregate the total number of transactions over the past 30 days for popular layer-2 networks like zkSync Era, Optimism, and Arbitrum Nova, the count surpasses 61 million transactions. This figure is twice the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum network during the same time frame.\n\nETHEREUM |#Ethereum L2s are growing so much it doesn\u2019t make sense to build on anything else. pic.twitter.com/cqzyDFYGmJ \u2014 BitKE (@BitcoinKE) September 28, 2023\n\nReduction in Token Supply\n\nAnother notable effect of the Merge on Ethereum is a reduction in the token\u2019s overall supply. The shift in how new Ethereum is issued, along with the burning of transaction fees, has caused a 0.25% decrease in the total amount of Ethereum in circulation, according to sound.money.\n\nThis decrease in supply can impact Ethereum\u2019s overall scarcity and may have implications for its economic dynamics.\n\nPrice of Ethereum\n\nLast but not least, regarding Ethereum\u2019s price, it may seem that not much has changed since September 2022. Around the time of the transition, ETH was trading at approximately $1,600, which is roughly the same price it\u2019s trading at a year later, $1,586.09 at the time of writing.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________"

        "content": "The first trading session of October 2023 also marks the launch of the very first U.S.-listed ETFs holding ether futures. Ether is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. Bitwise, ProShares, and Van Eck collectively rolled out a total of six funds that hold such futures. Additional similar funds from other issuers are in the works.\n\nVanEck started the latest Ethereum ETF frenzy with the announcement on Thursday that the launch of its VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) was imminent. That coincided with a flurry of re-filings for similar ETFs. But those funds are only the start. There are more such futures ETFs in registration, and more such physical ETFs are also in the pipeline.\n\nConcerned about the potential for a government shutdown (now averted), the SEC focused last week on cleaning up its backlog. It approved the launches of the ether futures ETFs. However, it pushed off the approval of the ARK 21 Shares spot bitcoin fund.\n\nThe Ethereum Wave Gets Rolling\n\nOn Monday, VanEck launched EFUT, which is largely differentiated by the fact that it is a C-Corp fund, a structure that conveys certain tax advantages. Bitwise launched two funds of its own, the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). Those funds respectively offer exposure to the performance of ether futures and to a 50/50 portfolio of bitcoin and ether futures. Both have expense ratios of 0.85%.\n\nProShares jumped into the pool with three funds. The ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) targets ether futures to capture the performance of the cryptocurrency. The ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE), like Bitwise\u2019s BTOP, offers exposure to a regularly rebalanced equal-weighted portfolio of bitcoin and ether futures. And the ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF (BETH) holds a similar blended portfolio that weights the two cryptocurrencies by their market capitalizations. All three have expense ratios of 0.95%.\n\nHowever, there are other funds yet to debut that will also hold such futures. The Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU), with a 1.15% expense ratio, and the Hashdex Ether Strategy ETF (EX), with an expense ratio of 0.98%, are both in the queue to launch.\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie has filed a supplement to its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) with the intention of adding ether futures to the fund\u2019s portfolio.\n\nSpot Ether Funds in the Queue\n\nWhile there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign that spot ether ETFs are any more likely to be approved than spot bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale is pushing to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF, just as it wants to do with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The NYSE recently filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC to that end, Grayscale announced Monday.\n\nAn appeals court recently rejected the SEC\u2019s reasoning in its refusal to approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the regulator can\u2019t present another argument against the approval going forward. Some see the approval of ether futures ETFs as a sign that spot cryptocurrency funds may also be nearing approval.\n\nAnd Invesco is looking to roll out the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, which does not yet have a ticker but will be structured as a 1933 Act fund and will actually hold the cryptocurrency. In other words, both Grayscale and Invesco are in a race to launch a spot Ethereum fund.\n\nARK and 21Shares have teamed up to file for the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, which would also provide exposure to spot ether. The SEC will issue a decision in January on the two firms\u2019 proposed ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, which would provide spot exposure to bitcoin."

        "content": "Today, Lido Finance is the largest player in the Liquid Staking space. In fact, as of the end of August 2023, it accounts for 73.4% of all staked $ETH on LSD protocols. Now, with such a huge allocation, Lido Finance controls a ton of voting power over Ethereum.\n\nThis brings about certain \u201ccentralization\u201d concerns, which we discuss below. But before we dive in deeper, let us do a quick recap on what Lido Finance is.\n\nWhat Is Lido Finance?\n\nIn short, Lido is a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocol. It allows users like you and me to stake $ETH without a minimum limit. Contrast this to staking directly on Ethereum, where you need a 32 $ETH minimum stake.\n\nIn addition, staking on Lido allows you to get $stETH. This is an LSD token that represents your stake. Over time, it accrues staking rewards as well. With $stETH, you can participate in DeFi and provide liquidity. Also, you could transact your $stETH too! The recipient can then redeem the $stETH for $ETH directly with Lido.\n\nWhy Is Lido Finance \u201cCentralizing\u201d Ethereum?\n\nTo answer this question, let us refer to the following tweet. Here, Danny Ryan from the Ethereum Foundation voices his concerns over Lido\u2019s voting power.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Danny Ryan of the Ethereum Foundation calls @LidoFinance a \"corporatization, a centralization and a system threat\" of Ethereum. \"What happens when a regulator realizes that 3 people control the vote? I got 3 doors to knock on, easy.\" \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/K3eDQl5SAm \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) September 26, 2023\n\nFirstly, Danny, one of Ethereum\u2019s Founders, feels that Lido is like a Venture Capitalist (VC)-owned \u201ccartel\u201d. Many projects in the crypto space are similar too. VCs are important to help jump-start a project with funding. However, Danny raises issues with VCs due to their control over LSD projects.\n\nSecondly, Danny says that in Lido, only \u201c3 people control the vote\u201d. Indeed, this reflects the centralization aspect of Lido. This is dangerous for any project in crypto. As Danny clearly points out, regulators only \u201cgot 3 doors to knock on, easy\u201d. In turn, this means that Lido can easily be shut down by authorities.\n\nA Centralized Protocol Controlling a Decentralized Ethereum\n\nToday, Ethereum is decentralized to a large extent. There are many validators and LSDs tokens that stake on Ethereum. However, he is not happy with Lido\u2019s centralization. He claims that it\u2019s akin to layering \u201ca pretty centralized component\u201d atop Ethereum. If Lido shuts down, it could significantly affect the finality of the Ethereum chain.\n\nHow Do We Avoid a \u201cDisaster\u201d Scenario?\n\nHere, Danny believes that the issue with Lido\u2019s centralization is not a huge issue at the moment. He believes that the situation can be managed. However, it\u2019ll be very helpful to discuss such scenarios early on. By bringing these issues early to the table, precautions can be taken.\n\nNah i still take the stand Danny is right and lido is a problem However, his point is on 'decentralization' and MAV If Lido control's 33%, that's an issue Similarly if BNP pools, control 33% that's still an issue The problem is concentration and not permissionlessness \u2014 Juve (@notjuve) September 27, 2023\n\nMoreover, members of the Ethereum community seem to be heeding Danny\u2019s warnings. For sure, we all hope for a decentralized Web3 world. Ethereum is the main foundation for this. Hence, we hope that Lido\u2019s centralization won\u2019t cause problems down the road.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

The development comes more than a month after the US court granted Grayscale a victory over the SEC in the spot Bitcoin ETF lawsuit.\n\nGrayscale has filed Form 19b-4 with the US SEC along with NYSE Arca. Interestingly, the filing comes on the same day when the first Ethereum Futures ETF will hit the market. Speaking on the development, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cAt Grayscale, our unwavering commitment is to offer investors transparent and regulated access to crypto through product structures that are familiar. As we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter.\u201d\n\nGrayscale remains committed to overseeing each of its digital asset products through a structured four-phase lifecycle, ultimately culminating in the conversion to an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which was launched in March 2019, achieved a public listing in May 2019, and proactively transitioned into an SEC reporting company in October 2020. Today, it stands as the world\u2019s largest investment vehicle for Ethereum, managing assets valued at nearly $5 billion, equivalent to 2.5% of the total circulating Ether.\n\nWith shares trading in millions of dollars in daily volume, the product has garnered the support of over a quarter of a million American investor accounts. Grayscale Global Head of ETFs David LaValle said:\n\n\u201cThis filing is another important milestone as Grayscale continues to build its best-in-class ETF team, product suite, and capabilities \u2013 serving investors as a globally respected asset manager with unmatched crypto expertise. We are proud to partner with NYSE Arca on this filing and look forward to engaging with the SEC on next steps.\u201d\n\nWill Grayscale Filing Help ETH Price Rally?\n\nNote that Grayscale is not among the first to file for a spot Ethereum ETF. Last month in September, Ark Invest submitted a similar filing with the US SEC.\n\nEarlier today, the ETH price rallied to $1,750 levels amid excitement surrounding the futures ETF launch. However, the ETH price retraced partially and currently trading around $1,731 levels. For the ETH price rally to continue, it must break the resistance of $1,750. The next immediate target would be $1,800 and $2,00 further."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently discussed the possibility of integrating more features directly into the Ethereum protocol.\n\nHistorically, the Ethereum project has aspired to maintain a core protocol with minimal complexity, encouraging building applications and solutions on top of it, also known as Layer-2 solutions.\n\nButerin, however, offered important discussions regarding maintaining a balance between protocol simplicity and advanced feature integrations.\n\nPhilosophy behind minimalist\n\nFrom its inception, Ethereum has embraced a minimalist philosophy, seeking to create a clean and simple core protocol and allowing innovations and advanced features to be built on top of it by users. This philosophy aimed to maintain a decentralized and user-empowering approach.\n\nHowever, Buterin acknowledges the growing interest in enshrining more features within the core Ethereum protocol. Enshrining, in this context, implies integrating advanced features and functionalities directly into the Ethereum protocol, which could potentially increase user convenience but may also pose challenges related to protocol complexity and governance.\n\nBenefits and trade-offs of new features\n\nEnshrining more features into the core protocol could help avoid potential centralization and mitigate risks in other areas of the blockchain ecosystem. It could offer standardized solutions, avoid complications arising from diverse independent implementations and enhance user flexibility and experience. However, Buterin emphasizes the caution required in this approach. Over-enshrining can complicate the protocol, overextend its governance, and may not always align with the evolving needs of the users. Hence, a balanced approach that maintains Ethereum's credible neutrality and aligns with user needs is crucial."

The approval of a spot crypto ETF would mark a pivotal development for both investors and the wider cryptocurrency sector.\n\nEther ETF race\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Invesco and Galaxy Digital recently entered the Ethereum spot ETF arena despite looming uncertainties regarding governmental and SEC delays.

        "content": "Ethereum Layer-2s have proven to be a solid line of defense against Layer-1s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s TVL outperformed Solana and Avalanche and could be gunning for market cap too.\n\nThe 2021 bull run exposed some major drawbacks in the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain. Thanks to this, the term \u201cEthereum killer\u201d gained traction as a way to describe the many competitive layers aiming for the top spot by attempting to overthrow the network\u2019s dominance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFast-forward to the present, and Ethereum is still the most dominant PoS blockchain in some key areas. Layer Blockchains like Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] have thus failed to dethrone Ethereum.\n\nThe latter\u2019s secret weapon is arguably its Layer-2 networks, which have allowed it to overcome the previously-existing scalability limitations.\n\nA recent Grayscale analysis revealed that Optimism [OP], Base, and Arbitrum [ARB], three Ethereum Layer-2s, have surpassed Avalanche and Solana in TVL.\n\nThis is because Ethereum is already miles ahead of its competition in terms of adoption and the dApps that operate on its network.\n\n?Following a period of strong growth, top performing Layer 2s #Arbitrum, #Optimism and #BASE are surpassing Ethereum competitor Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of 9/25.\n\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important. (1/6) pic.twitter.com/DpTJyLQ5Nj \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nLayer-2 networks successfully assist Ethereum in bypassing its previous limitations. The L2s facilitate transaction processing, allowing the dApps to operate efficiently and cost effectively. There is one key component that has allowed Layer-2 networks to surpass some Layer-1 blockchains.\n\nWhile the latter have to build up their own dApps and clientele, Layer-2s benefit from Ethereum\u2019s already existing dApps, of which there are plenty. On top of that, the same Layer-2s are also able to attract dApps on their own.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains process transactions from dApps and then \u201cbatch\u201d them together before sending a compressed version back to the main network for settlement, acting as a side road or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway. (2/6) \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nCan Ethereum Layer-2s secure market cap dominance?\n\nThese observations confirmed that Ethereum was still able to command robust utility and demand at press time. But while its Layer-2 networks enjoyed robust TVL growth, they were still lagging behind Solana and Avalanche in terms of market cap.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Solana\u2019s market cap was slightly over $8.8 billion, while Avalanche had a market cap of $3.27 billion at the time of writing. The closest of the aforementioned Layer-1s was Arbitrum at $1.17 billion, followed by Optimism at $1.06 billion.\n\nBase had the lowest market cap among them, at $530 million.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt makes sense that the Layer-2s would have lower market caps, considering that their counterparts are Layer-1 networks that have been around for longer. Nevertheless, the Layer-2 market caps highlighted their rapid growth.\n\nJudging by these factors, it is possible that they will get closer to Solana and Avalanche. These numbers also highlight the fact that it is now more difficult to beat Ethereum than ever before."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSeveral futures-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have timidly stepped into the limelight in the U.S. The investment firms ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and VolShares each debuted their offerings on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) this Monday.\n\nDid anyone care?\n\nThe market's reaction to these debutants was anything but triumphant. Analysts and observers were quick to note the \"shockingly low\" volumes, leading to speculation regarding the level of retail interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese ETFs only managed to accumulate a combined trading volume of approximately $1.7 million in the initial hours of trading.\n\nIn contrast, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF launch in 2021 had amassed a whopping $200 million within the first 15 minutes.\n\nObservers like Eric Balchunas were left unimpressed, labeling the performance of these Ether Futures ETFs as \"pretty meh\" and highlighting the stark difference in their reception compared to the BITO.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has also dipped back below the $1,700 level, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEyes on the prize\n\nAmid the lukewarm reception of futures-based Ethereum ETFs, Grayscale, a titan in the crypto asset management arena, is charting its course to seek approval for converting its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIf approved, this endeavor stands to bring a product structure familiar to U.S. investors into the mainstream crypto space. This could potentially offer a massive level of engagement missed by the recently launched futures-based ETFs.\n\nInvesco, Ark Invest, and Galaxy Digital are also among the major players that are vying to launch a spot Ethereum ETF."

        "content": "KuCoin, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently released its latest asset reserve certificate dated Sept. 29. The report shows a noticeable decrease in user assets across Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether. Specifically, BTC assets dropped by 4% to 17,617.5, ETH assets decreased by 3% to 148,125, and USDT assets fell by 4% to 837 million, compared to the previous month's data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, KuCoin has experienced a net outflow of approximately $118 million in the past month. This outflow is significant and warrants a closer look at the current market dynamics that could be influencing these movements.\n\nKucoin released the latest (9-29) asset reserve certificate. The user's BTC assets were 17,617.5, a decrease of 4% from the last time (8-31); the user's ETH assets were 148,125, a decrease of 3%; the user's USDT assets were 837 million, 4% lower than last time.\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 1, 2023\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to this trend. First, the overall market has been experiencing a period of uncertainty and volatility, which often leads to investors moving their assets to perceived safer havens.\n\nSecond, the regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with more countries tightening their grip on cryptocurrency exchanges. This could have led to a loss of confidence among KuCoin users, prompting them to withdraw their assets.\n\nAnother possibility is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which offer lucrative yield farming and staking opportunities. Investors might be reallocating their assets to these platforms in search of higher returns, thereby reducing their holdings on centralized exchanges like KuCoin.\n\nIt is also worth considering the impact of competition. With new exchanges and trading platforms entering the market, offering lower fees and additional features, users have more options than ever and may be exploring these alternatives."

This transfer was accomplished using Thorchain, a decentralized exchange enabling cross-chain swaps that allow the hacker to convert the ETH holdings into BTC.\n\nA massive hack\n\nThese transactions marked yet another movement of Ether held in the compromised wallet since the hack occurred nearly a year ago.\n\nFor the uninitiated, FTX suffered a major security breach on Nov. 11, with unauthorized withdrawals amounting to about $600 million. The attack was believed by some to be an inside job.\n\nThe exploit took place only hours after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and founder Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down from his role.\n\nShortly after the hack, blockchain experts suggested the exploiter exhibited signs of panic, hastily moving and converting tokens in an attempt to avoid detection and sustaining significant losses in the process.\n\nSBF's impending trial\n\nFTX's turbulent downfall shocked the industry, with the rapid dissolution of Bankman-Fried\u2019s once-flourishing $40 billion crypto empire.\n\n\n\nBankman-Fried is scheduled to face trial starting from Oct. 3, with charges including fraud and conspiracy levied against him. The former FTX executive has pleaded not guilty to all counts, and if convicted, he faces a possible maximum prison sentence of 115 years."

While those funds track Ethereum futures contracts rather than the spot price of Ether, the move was seen as clearing the way for spot ETFs like the one Grayscale envisions.\n\nThe filing was submitted by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on behalf of Grayscale, reflecting Grayscale\u2019s commitment to converting its family of crypto investment products into ETFs.\n\nETHE is currently structured as a trust and trades on the public market. It launched in 2019 and has $5 billion in assets under management, making it the biggest Ether investment product in the world.\n\nThe SEC has yet to approve a spot crypto ETF in the US market, repeatedly citing concerns about market manipulation and illicit activities. It remains unclear if or when the regulatory agency will give the green light, but many see the growth of the crypto futures market as a positive sign.\n\nETHE is up 2.5% over the last 24 hours, according to Yahoo!

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin toyed with bringing back ERC-4337 in his recent blog.\n\nZK-EVMs may also be able to help with data storage.\n\nImplementing major upgrades to Ethereum [ETH] is not something new. This is because the blockchain has successfully finalized at least one substantial development each year over the last few years.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nNow, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested that more could be achieved on the blockchain through increased experimentation.\n\nVitalik proposes a call for an on-chain increase\n\nOn 30 September, Buterin posted on his blog and titled the article \u201cShould Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?\u201d About six months ago, Buterin had also posted extensively about the viability.\n\nAccording to the new blog post, Buterin disclosed that account abstraction and scaling implemented now were two areas the blockchain had in mind to improve as far back as 2015.\n\nFor context, account abstraction is the process of making it easier for users to interact with blockchain by customizing elements of smart contract accounts, from fee payments to transaction approval mechanisms.\n\nOn the other hand, the main goal of scaling is to improve transaction speed, and transaction throughput without affecting Ethereum\u2019s security or decentralization.\n\nButerin also noted that the Ethereum protocol could enshrine more features. But this would require bringing back some attributes.\n\nFirst off, it could be necessary to bring back ERC-4337. Authored by Buterin himself, alongside five other developers, the ERC-4337 was the token standard that introduced account abstraction.\n\nThe return of the standard could help with censorship resistance, gas efficiency, and support for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) opcodes.\n\nButerin further highlighted that,\n\n\u201cFully functional ERC-4337 wallets are big. This implementation, compiled and put on-chain, takes up ~12,800 bytes.\u201d\n\nZK for storage\n\nAnother aspect Buterin touched upon was the ZK- EVMs. ERC-4337 comes into play in this regard too, but the focus here is more on scaling than account abstraction. According to him, the ZK protocol feature could help with Ethereum\u2019s multi-client philosophy.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the project could face a challenge enshrining this part. This is because of the limited data the Ethereum blockchain can store. But he also mentioned that ZK-EVMs can compress more data.\n\nButerin wrote:\n\n\u201cZK-EVMs are much more data-efficient if they do not have to carry \u201cwitness\u201d data. That is, if a particular piece of data was already read or written in some previous block, we can simply assume that provers have access to it, and we don\u2019t have to make it available again.\u201d\n\nIn other parts of the blog post, he also mentioned how liquid staking could encourage ecosystem participation, particularly on Lido Finance [LDO] and Rocket Pool [RPL]."

This follows a hold above strong support at the June low of 24750, which has kept intact the higher-top-higher-bottom formation since the end of 2022. Importantly, this keeps alive the possibility of a further recovery given the sharp 2021-2022 decline.\n\nBTC/USD is now testing a key ceiling at the end-August high of 28150, coinciding with the 200-day moving average. A decisive break above could clear the path toward the July high of 31800, which could be a defining moment for Bitcoin. Any break above would not only trigger a double bottom but would reinforce the bullish medium-term trajectory, first highlighted earlier this year \u2013 see \u201cBitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC/USD Turns Bullish\u201d, published January 18.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nThe potential price objective of the double bottom pattern (the June and the September lows) works out to around 39000. Such a move would imply a break above the 89-week moving average and a cross above the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly charts \u2013 for the first time since 2022. For the bullish view to unfold, BTC/USD needs to stay above the June low of 24750.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nETHEREUM: Beginning to flex muscles\n\nEthereum\u2019s break above the mid-September high of 1670 appears to have reduced immediate downside risks. This follows a hold above a crucial floor at the August low of 1535, not too far from the lower edge of a declining channel since early 2023.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nChart Created by Manish Jaradi Using TradingView\n\nETH/USD is now testing a fairly strong resistance area. This includes the end-August high of 1745, the upper edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, and the 200-day moving average. Ethereum needs to break above 1745-1805 for the medium-term recovery trajectory to play out. So far, ETH/USD has been holding above significant long-term support on the 200-week moving average \u2013 despite the weakness since 2021, ETH/USD hasn\u2019t decisively fallen below the average.\n\nIf this morning\u2019s rebound is indeed a turning point for cryptocurrencies, ETH/USD needs to hold above the stiff support at 1450-1550.\n\nRecommended by Manish Jaradi Top Trading Lessons Get My Guide\n\n--- Written by Manish Jaradi, Strategist for DailyFX.com\n\n--- Contact and follow Jaradi on Twitter: @JaradiManish"

Readers should do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. U.Today is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods or services mentioned in the article.\n\nThe fusion of Bitcoin and Ethereum with a tangible, real-world product has all chances to propel BTCS ICO into a realm of explosive growth. By merging the strengths and capabilities of these two prominent cryptocurrencies and integrating them with a practical, tangible BTCS product, this Bitcoin Spark ICO holds the potential to enhance the market and capture significant attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBTCS is a Bitcoin hard fork addressing scalability, transaction speed, and energy consumption challenges. BTCS aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of digital transactions and blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Bitcoin Spark is its innovative and accessible consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Process (PoP). PoP takes PoS and PoW concepts and repackages them to allow diverse users to validate transactions and secure the network by renting their device power and staking BTCS, its native token.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark Application is an essential component allowing users to engage in mining, processing power provision, trading, storing BTCS, and rewards distribution. The application combines PoS and PoW mechanisms to create a dynamic robust network. It strives for a more decentralized and secure network featuring active participation, preventing centralization, and fostering a balanced ecosystem. BTCS runs an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to attract early investors while providing an opportunity for potential returns on investment. One BTCS token is $2.75, with a bonus of 8% in the current phase six.\n\nBitcoin mining\n\nBitcoin mining creates new bitcoins to be added to the circulating supply. It serves as a crucial mechanism for securing and validating transactions on the Bitcoin network. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex math problems that group transactions into blocks. These blocks are added to a public ledger containing a record of all transactions called the blockchain.\n\nMiners compete to solve these mathematical problems and the first one to solve it adds a new block to the blockchain. For their efforts, a reward of newly created BTCs through block rewards and transaction fees paid by users. Bitcoin mining has become highly competitive and resource-intensive, requiring specialized ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners to provide a competitive edge. Nonetheless, the total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, and mining rewards are sliced approximately every four years in an event known as the \"halving,\" making it progressively challenging and reducing the rate of new Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nEthereum staking\n\nEthereum staking is a process that involves actively participating in the Ethereum network to help validate and secure transactions, create new blocks, and maintain the network's overall integrity. It's a fundamental component of Ethereum's transition from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, part of the Ethereum upgrade.\n\nIn a PoS, validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of Ethereum coins (ETH) they hold and are willing to \"stake\" or lock up as collateral. The more ETH a validator stakes, the higher the chance of being chosen to create a block and earn rewards.\n\nThe validators staking ETH and actively participating in the network are incentivized to follow the rules, and if they attempt to act maliciously, they lose the ETH staked. This design increases network security and reduces energy consumption compared to PoW, making the Ethereum network more sustainable and efficient.\n\nEthereum staking is anticipated to significantly improve the network's scalability, speed, and overall functionality as it evolves, playing a crucial role in the broader adoption and success of the Ethereum merge.\n\nMore details on BTCS and ICO here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, proposed a new approach to add features in the Ethereum blockchain called \u201cminimal viable enshrinement.\u201d\n\nMinimal viable enshrinement involves enshrining specific functionalities in blockchain to simplify implementation without imposing strict rules.\n\nFor example, instead of enshrining a full liquid staking system, the protocol could enshrine a specific piece that solves the key challenges. This will help to implement the functionality in an easy way, without complexing things.\n\nShould Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?https://t.co/7F7yOLBoUr \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 30, 2023\n\nInspired by the Unix philosophy, Buterin argues that this approach is necessary because blockchains are unique social systems.\n\nHe believes that enshrinement can help prevent centralization risks that arise when complexity is pushed to external layers.\n\nButerin explains that excessive enshrinement can compromise the protocol\u2019s trust and governance. He also suggests that de-enshrinement may also be necessary for rarely used features, ensuring backward compatibility and a lighter protocol. This would help in keeping ethereum blockchain compatible with older versions.\n\n\n\nIn the blog post Buterin also discussed the challenges of verifying Ethereum-like blocks within ZK-SNARKs. He conceptualizes whether Ethereum can introduce \u201cverify EVM execution in ZK\u201d as a protocol feature.\n\nHe argues that this would allow Ethereum\u2019s social consensus to handle exceptional situations as it would make things smoother. It could also reduce the need for additional governance in the rollup ecosystem.\n\n"

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nIn crypto investment circles, identifying the perfect projects can amplify your portfolio by margins that Bitcoin and Ethereum might not achieve. In this fast-paced arena, strategic selection and foresight in emerging projects like Bitcoin Spark can lead to exponential growth, offering an exciting journey into the future of digital assets.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS): Enriching Portfolios Beyond BTC and ETH\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark Application introduces a mechanism to ensure fairness and inclusivity. Miners and stakers receive rewards based on their contributions to the network, proportionally distributed to acknowledge their endeavors. This Proof-of-Process (PoP) approach promotes active engagement and mitigates mining centralization, fostering a more decentralized and secure network.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS) seeks to revolutionize cryptocurrency mining by making it more inclusive and user-friendly while enhancing network security and decentralization. Miners and validators are rewarded for providing processing power to the network, promoting decentralization and security without excessive energy consumption. By leveraging innovative technologies and a unique PoP consensus mechanism, BTCS creates a distinct ecosystem, ensuring a fair distribution of rewards. With its potential for growth and adoption, BTCS presents an exciting opportunity and a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s record-breaking 100x ICO is in phase six with one BTCS at $2.75, accompanied by an 8% bonus offer. Investors can expect 393% gains on launch at $10.\n\nBTCS is set to incorporate a smart contract layer within the Bitcoin Spark network. The system will operate on multiple layers converging on the main network, enabling diverse programming languages for application development. Initially, an in-house blockchain explorer will be established, and plans are in place to collaborate with third-party developers for further solutions. In line with its roadmap, the GitHub release for third-party developers is slated to be rolled out shortly after the mainnet launch.\n\nBitcoin price\n\nBitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, boasts a decade-long track record in trading. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s price encountering multiple bearish markets, it has consistently demonstrated remarkable recoveries. Looking back at its history, each time Bitcoin bounces from a low, it tends to surge to set unprecedented highs. Bitcoin price has surged by over 80% since the start of the year, surpassing major assets and offering significant returns for those who bought it during dips. Discussions circulate about Bitcoin hitting $100,000 by 2025, with various predictions and beliefs from notable figures in the crypto world. However, many crypto watchers think that while Bitcoin might reach such levels, achieving this in 2025 could be improved. In the current uncertain market, traders might avoid investing in or purchasing risky assets, while the existing BTC holders might sell their holdings, adding unnecessary strain on the crypto.\n\nEthereum price\n\nEthereum serves as a primary platform for dApps and NFTs creation, transaction, and management. The Ethereum blockchain\u2019s robust infrastructure and support for smart contracts make it a perfect fit, solidifying its position as a fundamental pillar of the crypto space. Ethereum\u2019s network upgrades and expanding ecosystem have displayed resilience when it faces market fluctuations. The PoW transition to PoS through Ethereum 2.0 was expected to drive Ethereum prices higher. In addition, its historical performance and position as a leading smart contract platform make it a favored choice among investors. In the past week, ETH reached a high of $1,669.05 and a low of $1,574.86. ETH has maintained a range between $1,550 and $1,650 this year. The current market cap is 191B. However, external factors, including the deepening banking crisis and currency weakening, have stagnated cryptocurrencies like ETH. Before getting involved, potential investors and users should conduct thorough research and due diligence.\n\nMore on BTCS and ICO here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register"

        "content": "ETH, BNB, and XRP showcased bullish metrics, suggesting price upticks.\n\nDOGE was lying low while SHIB\u2019s price surged by over 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMajor altcoins like Ethereum [ETH], BNB Chain [BNB], and Ripple [XRP] have been disappointing investors for quite some time now with their slow-moving performances. However, if the latest data is to be considered, things might take a U-turn soon.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBut as we enter the last quarter of 2023, the crypto market has the potential to turn volatile, and here\u2019s how.\n\nIs the altcoin market getting ready for a bull run?\n\nMags, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet revealing details about the current market condition. As per the tweet, the altcoin market cap has been trading inside a massive Wyckoff accumulation pattern.\n\n#Altcoin Bull Run Is Finally Here ?? ? The Altcoin Market Cap has been trading inside a Massive Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern ? This Pattern consists of 5 Phases : \u2022 PHASE A : This phase marks the end of the downtrend as supply weakens after intense selling. \u2022 PHASE B :\u2026 pic.twitter.com/h9B9e0YfHh \u2014 Mags (@thescalpingpro) September 30, 2023\n\nThis pattern consists of five phases. At press time, the chart was in the fourth phase, named D. During this phase, the price will reportedly move at least to the upper resistance lines as demand takes over.\n\nAfter the completion of Phase D, Phase E will take over, in which the price will break out, demand will be in full control, and the uptrend will be obvious to everyone.\n\nDoubts still remain\n\nThough the aforementioned data looked optimistic, a closer look at the top altcoins provided a better understanding of what might be ahead. For instance, Ethereum, which is the largest altcoin by market capitalization, failed to breach the $1,700 mark of late.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,686.51 with a market cap of over $202 billion. CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was increasing, meaning that the token was under selling pressure at press time.\n\nAnother bearish signal was that ETH\u2018s total number of coins transferred has decreased by -57.66% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, its takers buy/sell ratio was also in the red, suggesting that selling sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market at the time of writing.\n\nThis further increased the chances of a downtrend in the days to follow.\n\nA look at how other altcoins are doing\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s performance was underwhelming, the second-largest altcoin, BNB, also failed to surprise investors. As per CoinMarketCap, BNB only moved marginally over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $215.89 with a market cap of over $33 billion.\n\nBut BNB\u2019s MACD displayed a bullish crossover, which hinted at a more volatile price movement towards the north. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered an uptick and was headed above the neutral mark.\n\nNonetheless, its Money Flow Index (MFI) went the other way around as it dropped.\n\nThough a few of the market indicators were in BNB bulls\u2019 favor, its social metrics soared. As per LunarCrush, BNB\u2019s social engagement soared by more than 33% last week.\n\nAdditionally, its Altrank and bullish sentiment also improved considerably last week, suggesting a price uptrend soon. A similar slow-moving trend was also seen on XRP\u2019s graph, which merely moved in the last 24 hours in terms of price.\n\nAfter a massive spike, XRP\u2019s trading volume also dropped. But the good news was that its 1-week price volatility was up. The token\u2019s Binance Funding Rate also remained green, reflecting its popularity in the derivatives market.\n\nMore bullish indicators were revealed upon checking XRP\u2019s daily chart. As per TradingView, XRP\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) gained upward momentum. Apart from that, the token\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also moved upwards, giving hope for a price uptick in the days to follow.\n\nAt the time of writing. XRP was trading at $0.5207, with a market cap of over $27 billion.\n\nAre the memecoins gaining momentum?\n\nWhile mentioning altcoins, it\u2019s important to also include top memecoins such as Dogecoin [DOGE] and Shiba Inu [SHIB]. Notably, both memecoins did not show any sign of decoupling.\n\nTheir daily charts were in the green, but SHIB\u2019s price went up by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, which was encouraging.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000007473, while DOGE had a value of $0.06266. Therefore, considering the performance of all the major altcoins, the possibility of a bull rally in October can\u2019t be ruled out.\n\nHowever, as the crypto market is infamous for its unpredictability, the way the market moves in the coming days will be intriguing to watch."

        "content": "Ethereum Futures ETFs near launch, and JPMorgan\u2019s UK subsidiary bars crypto payments\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) went up steadily throughout the week, starting at around $26,000 to now trade at $28,300 after a significant upswing over the weekend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation, moved in a similar way, starting the week at $1,680 and seeing a quick jump throughout it to the $1,700 mark, to now trade at $1,730.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week were partly focused on the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) attitude towards a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House Financial Services Committee sending a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler saying the regulator should listen to the courts and approve a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFour prominent members of the Committee wrote a letter to Gensler, who is scheduled to testify before them soon. They claimed that there is no difference between a spot Bitcoin ETF and a Bitcoin futures ETF, which the SEC has already given the green light.\n\nThe letter urged the SEC to approve the applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs from companies like Fidelity and BlackRock\u2019s iShares. It comes after last month the SEC was ordered by a DC Circuit Court of Appeals judge to reconsider its position on these applications.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts expect Ether futures ETFs to launch as soon as this week as they believe the SEC is gearing up to greenlight a series of ETH futures ETFs. Investment management firm VanEck has raised its market efforts for these products with the release of two \u201cEnter the Ether\u201d-themed television commercials.\n\nVanEck is looking to launch its Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), which is set to invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts trading on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nCOMING SOOON. \ud83c\udfb7\ud83c\udfb7\ud83c\udfb7\n\n\n\nFollow for updates on how to Enter the Ether. pic.twitter.com/abXxw2tnaW October 1, 2023\n\nOver the week, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also saw its non-US exchange Coinbase International Exchange, secure regulatory approval from Bermuda\u2019s financial regulators to offer non-US retail customers perpetual futures contracts.\n\nThe firm is now set to offer these perpetual futures contracts to its users in the near future through Coinbase Advanced.\n\nMeanwhile, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance revealed payments solution provider Paysafe \u201cunilaterally\u201d stopped processing euro deposits for its users. Binance has urged its users to either withdraw their EUR or trade them for USDT before the end of October, while it works on integrating new fiat currency channels.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s UK subsidiary to ban crypto\n\nStarting from October 16, JPMorgan\u2019s UK subsidiary Chase will limit crypto-related payments for its clients in a bid to prevent scams and fraud by malicious actors. This is a stricter measure than other UK banks like HSBC and NatWest, which have only imposed some restrictions on crypto transactions.\n\nChase said that its customers will get a message saying that their transaction was declined if they try to make a crypto-related payment after that date. The decision is based on data that reveals a high incidence of crypto scams and frauds in the UK, such as fake celebrity endorsements and bogus investment schemes.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken seemingly started laying the groundwork to facilitate trading of US-listed stocks and ETFs on its platform, and is seemingly looking to offer the new service to customers in the US and UK.\n\nKraken is said to have obtained the required regulatory approvals in the UK and is seeking a broker-dealer license in the US from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). It aims to launch the new service in 2024.\n\nThe week also saw Binance reveal it\u2019s fully divesting from the Russian market as it agreed to sell its business in the country to crypto exchange CommEX.\n\nBinance has entered into an agreement to sell the entirety of its Russia business to CommEX (https://t.co/JJRKCo9coA).\n\n\n\nTo ensure a smooth process for existing Russian users, the off-boarding process will take up to one year. All assets of existing Russian users are safe and\u2026 \u2014 Binance (@binance) September 27, 2023\n\nCommEX is notably a newly launched cryptocurrency exchange that offers \u201ca wide range of product suites including Spot, Futures, Simple Futures and P2P service to engage with the world of cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nGoogle Cloud adds 11 new blockchains to BigQuery\n\nAs blockchain adoption grows, Google Cloud, the tech giant\u2019s computing arm, added 11 new networks, including Polygon, Optimism, and Polkadot to its BigQuery program, which is described on its webpage as a \u201cserverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse\u201d is tailored to cater for \u201cpractitioners of various coding skills\u201d.\n\nAccording to Google Cloud, one of its key advantages is allowing users to fetch historical data from an off-chain source faster than they would query the blockchain directly.\n\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s move came the same week a new report published by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) called for the global harmonisation of cryptocurrency regulation to ensure broader market stability.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Ethereum Has Over 10x Full-Time Developers Than Cardano: Will ADA Ever Catch Up? - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform if the number of full-time developers is anything to go by. Based on the Developer Report, sourcing their data from GitHub, Ethereum had 1,889 full-time developers, more than 10X those working on Cardano (153), a competing platform, and more than triple those working on Polkadot (621), as of October 1.\n\n\n\nDevelopers Prefer Ethereum: Competitors Struggling\n\nNotably, more developers are contributing code for the Bitcoin blockchain (340) than those working on Solana (268) and the BNB Chain (163). These platforms should technically have more code requirements because they support the launch of decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nDeveloper Report defines a \u201cfull-time developer\u201d as someone who submits code at least ten times monthly. Looking at trends and based on commits submitted at each of the top blockchain\u2019s source code at GitHub, there are at least 1,889 developers who have been actively offering code, and enhancing Ethereum. Based on this data, Ethereum appears to be cementing itself as a choice platform for developers and competing protocols, including Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), could struggle to match.\n\nEthereum, Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, and other popular networks are public ledgers. As such, their code is continuously improved by the community. Since they are public, the number of developers submitting code and actively revamping how the platform operates is critical.\n\nUsually, developer count will not only measure how healthy the protocol is but also the level of activity. Whenever there are multiple developers submitting codes, it indicates that the blockchain is garnering interest, which can contribute towards the release of a robust and secure network that can anchor innovation. This can also decentralize the platform from a developer perspective because no individual is relied on to improve the source code.\n\nCardano Is Building, Why Is ADA Trailing?\n\nEthereum is drawing more activity despite its competitor reaching a critical point in their development. For example, Cardano is at the Basho phase, where Charles Hoskinson, the founder, and Input-Output Global (IOG), the development wing of the blockchain, are building to enhance performance and scale.\n\nSome of the key features the team plans to launch eventually include Hydra, the layer-2 scaling solution being tested, and sidechains like Milkomeda and Atala PRISM, which are being tested.\n\nDespite these developments, Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, looking at total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama. As of October 31, Ethereum manages over $22 billion worth of assets, while Cardano controls roughly $198 million.\n\nOn to the charts, ADA is also struggling against ETH. ADA is down approximately 40% versus ETH from 2023 highs. Nonetheless, prices have been stable over the past three months, looking at price action in the daily chart.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
