        "content": "What Are Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchains and How Do They Work?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 As the pioneering smart contract chain, Ethereum has become the second-largest blockchain network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Due to the network\u2019s prioritization of decentralization and security over scalability, its increased popularity has led to major network congestion.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ethereum Layer 2 solutions are blockchains built with one primary purpose: to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing Ethereum transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem has grown significantly in the last decade \u2014 with a surge of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and NFTs. While this activity brings us closer to the ultimate goal of Web3 mass adoption, the question remains: is the underlying technology equipped to handle it all?\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, this growth has brought key scalability issues to the forefront; namely, high transaction fees (gas fees), network congestion, and slow transaction times during periods of high network activity. While core upgrades like the Merge aim to make transactions faster, Ethereum still needs a scaling solution built to handle the masses.\n\nEnter Layer 2 solutions: blockchains that increase scalability by sharing the burden of transaction processing. In this article, you\u2019ll learn about the different types of Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, how they help solve the scalability issue, and which are the most popular ones. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nEthereum Layer 2s Explained\n\nBuilt on top of Ethereum, Layer 2 blockchains help speed up transaction processing while keeping the costs down for the L1 network. They do the heavy lifting of transactions that Ethereum cannot, simply because it wasn\u2019t designed to prioritize speed.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second most popular blockchain network by market share, conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, and launched two years later. Ethereum became popular due to its self-executing smart contracts.\n\nTo explain, smart contracts are essentially computer programs that execute automatically if certain conditions are met. This competent tech is what paved the way for dApps, and from there, Ethereum took off. From DeFi protocols to the NFT mania to the significant growth of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), the wide-ranging innovations from dApp developers have indicated a field of endless possibilities when it comes to potential crypto use cases. The network boasts the highest number of developers. In fact, 16% of all crypto developers are building on Ethereum.\n\nWhat is a Layer 2 blockchain network?\n\nA Layer 2 solution is a secondary blockchain network, which reduces the load on the parent chain by handling part of its capabilities.\n\nThink of Ethereum as a boss whose desk is overflowing with paperwork (validating & executing transactions). A Layer 2 blockchain is an efficient assistant who takes the bulk of the workload to their desk (L2 network) to process.\n\nHowever, the final approval still comes from the boss. So, the assistant sends the processed paperwork back to the boss, who adds it to the final ledger upon approval. In other words, when approved, the transactions processed on the L2 network are added to the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains for?\n\nEthereum developers, like all blockchain developers, faced an age-old challenge: the blockchain trilemma. The blockchain trilemma, coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, states that a blockchain architecture needs to choose between decentralization, security, and scalability. Ethereum prioritizes the former two aspects, so scalability inevitably took the backseat.\n\nHowever, compromising scalability comes with obvious drawbacks: slow and expensive transactions. Currently, Ethereum\u2019s transaction processing capability stands at a mere 15 to 30 TPS. To provide context, VISA processes around 1,700 transactions per second.\n\nMoreover, transaction finality, when a transaction is added to the blockchain and becomes irreversible, takes roughly 15 minutes on Ethereum. Furthermore, the network is often overwhelmed and congested during periods of high demand, which causes abrupt surges in gas fees.\n\nEthereum layer 2 networks are, therefore, designed to tackle these issues and offer cheaper, faster transactions. They inherit Ethereum\u2019s security and, by processing transactions of the parent chain, make the process more efficient.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions on Ethereum\n\nLayer 2 solutions mainly differ in how they reduce Ethereum\u2019s transaction load. The most common ones are sidechains and blockchain rollups.\n\nSidechains\n\nSidechains are independent blockchains with native tokens and consensus mechanisms whose purpose is to help scale the parent network. They connect to the parent blockchain using a two-way bridge that enables users to move assets to and from Ethereum.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no real transfer of assets between the two chains. Sidechains use something called a two-way peg. A smart contract locks up assets on the main chain and mints a mirror image of the tokens on the sidechain. The value of these new assets is pegged to the assets on the original chain.\n\nLet\u2019s use the boss and assistant analogy once again. In this case, the boss (Ethereum) sets aside a bunch of the workload (locks the tokens). The assistant (sidechain) works with a copy of the workload (pegged assets) to execute transactions. Once done, the sidechain destroys its copies and unlocks the original tokens on Ethereum.\n\nBlockchain Rollups\n\nBlockchain rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that \u201crollup\u201d or bundle a bunch of transactions and then send them to Ethereum as a single piece of data. This network then adds this to an Ethereum block and confirms it.\n\nUsing the earlier analogy, the assistant carries the paperwork (transactions) to their desk, processes them, and compresses a big pile of paperwork into a single file. The assistant then sends that file, instead of the whole pile, back to the boss (Ethereum). This way, the boss has to deal with a fraction of the paperwork, which occupies less space. Therefore, as a user, you pay less gas fees because your transaction is grouped with many others and occupies less data space on the block.\n\nThere are two different types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. Optimistic rollups assume that all transactions bundled together are valid unless otherwise proven. Zk rollups, on the other hand, produce a single cryptographic proof called \u201cvalidity proof,\u201d which attests to the validity of the transactions bundled together.\n\nPopular Ethereum Layer 2s:\n\nOver the years, several Ethereum Layer 2 solutions have emerged \u2014 each prioritizing a specific audience, use case, or solution to Ethereum\u2019s scaling efforts. Here are some of the most popular Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in the industry today:\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon is one of the most popular Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions. It is an independent Ethereum sidechain faster and cheaper than its parent blockchain. Theoretically, Polygon can process up to 7,200 TPS, although the TPS currently stands around 1,000. Then for each of these transactions, the average gas is $0.01. It also plans on improving its transaction finality. Established brands like Starbucks use the network for loyalty programs due to the above benefits.\n\nArbitrum\n\nLaunched by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum is an optimistic rollup that cuts down the speed and cost of transactions by bundling them and processing them off-chain. Arbitrum manages a total of 40,000 TPS, with transactions costing around two cents on average. Additionally, Arbitrum\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) helps Ethereum developers launch their dApps on Arbitrum without too many modifications to the code.\n\nBase\n\nLaunched in August 2023, Base was incubated within Coinbase and built using the MIT-licensed OP Stack developed by Optimism. Notably, the total value locked (TVL) on the network surpassed $300 million by November.\n\nBase subscribes to the vision of a \u2018super-chain\u2019, a collection of inter-connected blockchains built on the OP Stack, that will together scale Ethereum. Optimism and Base are the first two chains that will make up the super-chain.\n\nImmutableX\n\nImmutableX is a zk-rollup scaling solution focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 games. To that end, ImmutableX has built out software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) for game developers to simplify the tedious backend infrastructure.\n\nAlong with fast transactions, ImmutableX aims to offer gas-free, carbon-neutral NFT minting. It also claims to offer transaction speeds of up to 9,000 TPS.\n\nRonin\n\nRonin is an Ethereum sidechain launched by Sky Mavis, which created the popular NFT game Axie Infinity. It uses a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism where Sky Mavis and the community select network validators based on expertise and reputation. The gaming-focused blockchain boasts \u201cnear-instant\u201d transactions with an average cost of less than half a cent.\n\nETH L2s: A new way to explore Ethereum\n\nFor Ethereum to become a global payment system, it must be accessible. Ethereum L2s are designed to do just that by solving the parent network\u2019s scalability challenges. Whether you want to play Web3 games, exchange tokens, mint NFTs, or trade ETH, L2s help you do it faster and cheaper.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to dive deeper into Ethereum Layer 2 networks it doesn\u2019t need to be difficult. Through the Ledger ecosystem, you can access Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and many other L2s.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Enjoy the confidence of self-custody as you explore what the world of Ethereum Layer 2s has to offer through Ledger Live. After all, what is the virtue of crypto without self-custody?"

        "title": "Ethereum Once Looked Unstoppable. But It's 1 Crypto I'm Avoiding in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Heading into 2023, Ethereum (ETH 1.25%) looked unstoppable. Ethereum had just pulled off The Merge, which was often cited as one of the greatest technical accomplishments of 2022. As a result of The Merge, which made the entire network much less energy intensive, Ethereum appeared to be well positioned to continue its dominance in just about every meaningful niche of the blockchain world.\n\nHowever, since August 2022 -- one month before The Merge -- Ethereum is only up 10%, at a time when other cryptos posted stellar triple-digit returns in 2023. From my perspective, Ethereum suddenly looks very vulnerable, which is why it's one crypto I'm avoiding in 2024. Let's take a closer look.\n\nNew strategic roadmap\n\nEthereum just released its new strategic roadmap for 2024, and I'm not impressed. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges that there are only minor changes planned for the year ahead. The primary focus is on resolving some of the blockchain design problems that resulted from The Merge. Fair enough -- it's probably expecting too much from Ethereum to come up with a wildly new strategic roadmap after a breakthrough achievement like The Merge.\n\nHowever, what concerns me is that some of the initial grand strategic goals of The Merge keep getting scaled back. For example, at one time Ethereum promised a total throughput speed of 1 million transactions per second. That has now been scaled back to 100,000. And according to Ethereum's own strategic roadmap, that goal probably won't be achievable in its current stage of development. Meanwhile, rival blockchain Solana (SOL -1.55%) says it already has the ability to handle 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nOn top of all that, Buterin seems to be backing away from what he refers to as the \"financialization\" of Ethereum's blockchain. Simply put, this term means the mainstreaming of Ethereum's blockchain for Wall Street institutions, ensuring that the blockchain's architecture makes sense for the modern financial world. If you're a long-term investor, that's exactly what you want to see, because it would be huge for Ethereum's future growth prospects.\n\nHowever, Buterin now seems to be leaning into what he calls a \"cypherpunk\" (a mashup of \"cyberpunk\" and \"cipher\") approach to blockchain development to recapture some of the early mystique of crypto. Kudos to Buterin for staying true to his original vision for the blockchain. But as a cold-hearted investor, I find that somewhat worrisome. Are top Wall Street firms really going to partner with a bunch of cyberpunks?\n\nRise of new competitors\n\nBy itself, a less-than-compelling strategic roadmap would not be enough to get me off Ethereum. I mean, really, this is Ethereum we're talking about. This is a blockchain that has a strong track record dating back to 2015. Ethereum's Buterin has been featured on the cover of TIME magazine as \"the prince of crypto,\" and it's hard not to think of him as one of the brightest minds of our generation.\n\nHowever, take a step back and consider the overall competitive landscape. One of the primary reasons for investing in Ethereum has always been the fact that it is a best-in-class blockchain, with an obvious dominant market share in key blockchain niches. But now there are several very credible competitors all nipping at the heels of Ethereum. Right now, three of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap -- Solana, Avalanche (AVAX 0.19%), and Cardano (ADA -0.33%) -- are direct competitors to Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, all three of these competitors now appear to be growing faster than Ethereum, especially Solana. At the end of 2022, for example, Solana started to eclipse Ethereum in terms of NFT trading volume and decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume. And institutional investors really appear to be buying into the argument that Solana is a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum. For example, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC, talking up the merits of Solana.\n\nHow can Ethereum get its mojo back?\n\nRight now, I'm not adding to my Ethereum position until it moves out of The Merge stage of development and into what the crypto's leaders have dubbed \"The Surge\" stage of development. To me, the remainder of The Merge stage is filled with a bunch of wonky technical improvements that aren't truly disruptive in nature. In contrast, The Surge is when Ethereum is supposed to hit that 100,000 transactions per second threshold. That's exciting, because even a world-class payment network like Visa, Inc. (V -0.34%) can't deliver that type of throughput.\n\nAt the same time, I'll be watching to see how well Ethereum preserves its market-leading position in key blockchain niches. If Ethereum can show that it is fending off rival blockchains such as Solana, then I will be much more inclined to restore my bullish outlook for Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s core developers are debating the priorities for the next hard fork after \u201cDencun,\u201d which could come in late 2024 or 2025.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s All Core Devs call, the tentative schedule for the Dencun fork remains unchanged, with the Goerli testnet first up on Jan. 17.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nWith the rollout of the upgrade looking likely in March, developers are turning attention to what comes next in Prague-Electra \u2014 Pralectra for short \u2014 the upgrade to follow.\n\nStill very much in flux, a debate is in progress on the overall vision: Either a feature-focused set of smaller Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) or a major protocol upgrade to introduce Verkle Trees to the execution layer.\n\nVerkle Trees are a new data structure that evolve the current Merkle Tree in use today, using more sophisticated mathematical techniques \u2014 vector commitments based on elliptic curve pairings, which are a significant departure from the simpler hash functions used in Merkle Trees, according to verkle.info.\n\nThis structure uses less space and can be verified faster, both of which allow the network to handle more transactions.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a way to deal with the long-term problem of \u201cstate bloat,\u201d which will be increasingly important as Ethereum scales.\n\nThe upgrade is a key milestone on Ethereum\u2019s long-term roadmap, a phase referred to as The Verge.\n\nThere was no clear consensus on the call \u2014 some advocate for keeping the focus squarely on Verkle Trees, with Guillaume Ballet at the Ethereum Foundation warning \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a small fork,\u201d but others calling for a firm commitment to upgrade the network again in 2024.\n\nThe fear is that Verkle Trees could take 18 months or more to deliver \u2014 an eternity in crypto.\n\nDencun itself was originally slated for November, but was finally pushed into 2024 last october.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\n\u201cVerkle is on the scale of the Merge if not worse in terms of complexity,\u201d Ballet said. \u201cYou cannot really ship anything at the same time on the [execution layer] side.\u201d\n\nLukasz Rozmej of the Nethermind execution client team agreed, recommending the developers prioritize a feature-rich fork first before turning fully to Verkle Trees.\n\n\u201cMy experience tells me that state redesigns are extremely hard and they take an extremely long time,\u201d he told colleagues on the call. \u201cVerkle toughness is not the specification, it is the implementation, optimization and testing.\u201d\n\nFeatures, yes, but which ones?\n\nAmong those advocating for a second 2024 fork focusing on features were client teams for Nethermind, Besu and Reth. But the question is what takes precedence?\n\nAndrew Ashikhmin, software engineer on the Erigon client team, suggested that the EVM Object Format (EOF) would be one candidate to drive the next upgrade without distracting from longer-term work on Verkle Trees, because it could be implemented by a smaller team, and was a more isolated change to the code base.\n\n\u201cBut Verkle should be the main focus,\u201d he said.\n\nEOF was originally considered for the Shapella hard fork, but was considered too big to be paired as a \u201cpassenger\u201d alongside the main \u201cdriver,\u201d Proto-Dank sharding or EIP-4844.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Next Upgrade To Focus on Blobs\n\nEOF is \u201cdefinitely not a passenger\u201d according to Justin Florentine, protocol engineer on the Besu client team, but he said that Besu had already made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d on the feature, and therefore was in favor of its adoption in Pralectra\n\nGeorgios Konstantopoulos, chief technology officer and researcher at investment firm Paradigm, which is building the Rust Ethereum (Reth) client, said his team was \u201cOK [with] EOF as it\u2019s [a] one man job and [needs] isolated testing.\u201d\n\nBut Ethereum Foundation developer Marius van der Wijden shared the opinion that \u201cEOF is not going to be in the small fork.\u201d\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs at the Ethereum Foundation supported EOF for inclusion in Pralectra last April, and noted on Thursday\u2019s call that the Solidity team \u2014 maintaining the EVM\u2019s main smart contract programing language \u2014 was strongly in favor.\n\nNo one on the call was there to explicitly advocate for EOF, however, prompting Nethermind founder Tomasz Stanczak to remark, \u201dif nobody champions EOF on this call this would summarize why it has not been shipped yet.\u201d\n\nStanczak called EIP-7002 or \u201cExecution layer triggerable exits\u201d the most upvoted EIP in the Ethereum Magicians forum and \u201csuper important,\u201d because it fixes a \u201cmajor design bug with staking [and] cannot come early enough.\u201d\n\nFellow core developer Parithosh Jayanthi, known by the nickname \u201cPotuz\u201d said if he had to choose one feature to ship it would be EIP-7002. However, in his view, EIP-7549 \u201cshould definitely be in.\u201d\n\nThis feature, which only affects the consensus layer, fixes a bug in Ethereum\u2019s design and aims to reduce the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules. A pairing is an operation used in certain cryptographic algorithms involving elliptic curves.\n\nCurrently, to reach consensus it\u2019s necessary to verify a minimum of 1366 attestations \u2014 indicating agreement between validators \u2014 but after EIP-7549 it would be reduced to just 22.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trivial to implement and it\u2019ll save a lot of aggregation time,\u201d Potus said. \u201cIt can help on trustless bridges \u2014 and zk-provers, zk-bridges \u2014 it\u2019s something that should definitely be in whatever fork we do next.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the call was to kickstart discussion, and the specific approach and improvement proposals will be decided at a later date. Ethereum upgrades are consensus-driven; there is no explicit hierarchy of authority, or voting mechanism to determine priorities.\n\nIt can at times appear challenging or chaotic to make progress, not unlike herding cats, but that\u2019s the nature of the decentralized beast.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Ethereum ETH +1.59% blockchain is experiencing a spike in validators queuing to withdraw their staked ether. The exit queue has reportedly reached 16,000, according to data from ValidatorQueue. The queue represents more than 510,000 ether ($1.1 billion), with a maximum validator stake of 32 ether per validator.\n\nThe processing time for completing the exit queue will be five days, with a total withdrawal length of more than 14 days.\n\nThis comes as Celsius, going through restructuring after filing for bankruptcy protection last year, shared its plans to cancel its stake in the Ethereum network \u2014 intending to distribute assets to its creditors.\n\nCelsius\u2019 withdrawal request of more than 200,000 ETH ($450 million) has contributed to the heightened validator exit queue. However, it seems that Celsius is not alone. Nansen data shows that only 32% of exits belong to Celsius. 54% (350,000 ETH) of the validators waiting to be withdrawn are associated with staking provider Figment.\n\nTom Wan, an analyst at 21 Shares, thinks that those tagged as Figment may also belong to Celsius. \u201cIt is also likely that the withdrawal by Figment belongs to Celsius. Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428k stETH from Lido, it re-staked 197k ETH via Figment,\u201d Wan said. Still, not all of Figment\u2019s withdrawals would account for Celsius, Nansen clarified.\n\nThere are currently a total of 29 million ETH staked on the network, according to The Block dashboard. This means that these withdrawals (roughly 500,000 ETH) account for roughly 1.7% of the total stakes.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nStaking yield\n\nDespite the surge in validators lining up in the exit queue, the entry queue for new validators has remained close to zero \u2014 mirroring the levels observed last week. The time to complete exit and entry queues is based on the churn limit, which is 13 validators per epoch, or a daily cap of 2,925 validators entering or exiting the network.\n\nThe staking yield for Ethereum validators, also known as the staking rewards reference rate, currently stands at about 3.4%. This figure shows a decrease from the near 8% yield recorded in May 2023."

        "title": "Ethereum Validator Exit Leads to Backlogged Queue on Network - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s validator community has encountered an unexpected exodus.\n\nMajor players like Celsius and Figment have triggered a significant withdrawal trend among validators.\n\nNew validators and a regulated limit have contrasted the worrying exodus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s bustling validator scene, long a hive of activity, is witnessing a surprising trend: a mass exit of validators. Thousands of validators entrusted with safeguarding the network are lining up to withdraw their staked ether, raising questions about the future of the platform\u2019s Proof-of-Stake model.\n\nEthereum Exit Fueled by Celsius and Figment\n\nWhile the reasons for this exodus remain murky, some prominent players are driving the surge. Celsius, the embattled crypto lender still navigating bankruptcy, plans to exit the network and distribute its Ethereum holdings to creditors. Its substantial stake, a whopping 200,000 ETH, has undoubtedly contributed to the growing queue.\n\nBut Celsius isn\u2019t alone. Figment, another major staking provider, also appears caught in the exit wave. Data suggests over half of the waiting validators belong to Figment, though experts like Tom Wan of 21 Shares suspect some overlap with Celsius.\n\n\u201cIt is also likely that the withdrawal by Figment belongs to Celsius. Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428k stETH from Lido, it re-staked 197k ETH via Figment,\u201d Wan explains, hinting at a potential indirect link.\n\nIs It Time to Panic?\n\nWhile this mass exit paints a worrisome picture, it\u2019s not the whole story. The queue for new validators remains stagnant, suggesting the exodus hasn\u2019t triggered a wider panic. Additionally, the churn limit, which dictates the pace of validator movements, controls both entry and exit queues.\n\nHowever, a more concerning trend emerges with staking yields. Once hovering near 8% in May 2023, they\u2019ve sunk to roughly 3.4%. This decline could result from the validator exodus, potentially discouraging new entrants.\n\nThe question now looms: is this a temporary blip or a sign of deeper systemic issues within the PoS network? While the churn limit offers some reassurance, the declining yields remain a cause for concern. Whether this exodus represents a healthy market correction or the first tremor of a larger earthquake remains to be seen.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe validator exodus might not necessarily signal a systemic flaw within the Proof-of-Stake model.\n\nThe declining staking yields might prompt a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe departure of a few major players could create opportunities for smaller validators or new entrants to increase their influence within the network.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe next few months will be crucial in understanding the long-term implications of this validator movement. The community will undoubtedly be watching closely, hoping that the churn limit and potentially new initiatives to boost yields can stabilize the network and entice fresh participation.\n\nTo learn more about Celsius unstaking $464M ETH ahead of creditor repayments, read here:\n\nCelsius to Unstake $464M ETH Ahead of Creditor Repayments\n\n\n\nCurious about EVM parallelization and its role in driving SEI hype?

        "content": "Ethereum price tumbled and spiked below $2,000 on Kraken. ETH is now recovering above the $2,200 level, but the bears might be active near $2,300.\n\nEthereum started a major decline and dived below the $2,200 support.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if there is a clear move above $2,290 and $2,300.\n\nEthereum Price Nosedives\n\nEthereum price struggled to settle above the $2,400 resistance zone. ETH also started a major decline like Bitcoin and broke the $2,200 support zone.\n\nThere was a sharp decline and the price even spiked below the $2,000 support zone. A new yearly low was formed near $1,860 and the price is now recovering losses. There was a decent increase above the $2,000 and $2,080 resistance levels.\n\nThe price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,430 swing high to the $1,860 low. However, Ethereum is still below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,290 level. The first major resistance is now near $2,300. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,430 swing high to the $1,860 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $2,300 resistance could send the price toward $2,400. The next key resistance is near $2,440. If there is a clear move above $2,400, there could be a drift toward $2,500. The next resistance sits at $2,500, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,620 zone.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,080 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,080 might start another steady decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,860 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is regaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,180\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "What you'll learn Arbitrum is flexing its muscles not only with other layer 2s but with the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEthereum layer 2s have more locked deposits than other layer 1 networks.\n\nGrowth milestones for layer 2s are bullish signals for Ethereum.\n\nIn yet another indication of ballooning adoption of Ethereum layer 2 blockchains, Arbitrum \u2014 the biggest of the lot in terms of market capitalisation \u2014 has achieved a major milestone, surpassing the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nOn Thursday, decentralised exchange, or DEX for short, trading volume on Arbitrum exceeded that of the Ethereum mainnet \u2014 a first for Arbitrum or any layer 2 blockchain for that matter. Arbitrum\u2019s DEX volume totalled $1.8 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s by almost $400 million, DefiLlama data shows.\n\nEthereum layer 2 networks like Arbitrum help to scale Ethereum while relying on its mainnet\u2019s security architecture.\n\nDex trading volume by blockchains (DefiLlama/DefiLlama)\n\nFor a layer 2 to surpass its mainnet in any metric is quite the feat, it comes amid a growth peak for the blockchain. Arbitrum has hit a trifecta of all-time highs in the last week \u2014 TVL, DEX volume and the spot price of its native token ARB have reached all-time highs.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nTVL, or total value locked, is a measure of the investments locked in a blockchain or DeFi protocol.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s TVL spike means the network leads the way in the net inflow of investor funds among all layer 2 blockchains with $365 million in the last seven days. Ethereum still leads the way in this metric with $705 million, according to DefiLlama.\n\nArbitrum's TVL has soared to a new peak\n\nWhile these milestones point to significant user-adoption gains, Arbitrum is not without its issues. The blockchain has suffered a few outages, the most recent of which occurred in December.\n\nThese outages have been caused by problems with the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer \u2014 a part of the network used to verify, organise, and transfer transaction bundles to the Ethereum mainnet for finality.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nArbitrum\u2019s Sequencer is not the only one of its kind that suffered a temporary failure. ZkSync, another Ethereum layer 2, faced a similar problem last Christmas.\n\nApart from Arbitrum\u2019s recent gains, Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s have been experiencing a period of significant growth. At $20.7 billion, their combined TVL is greater than that of all other layer 1 networks, excluding Ethereum, which stands at $19.7 billion.\n\nApples and oranges\n\nThere is, however, one important caveat with the TVL valuation as it compares figures from two sources \u2014 L2Beat for layer 2 networks and DefiLlama for so-called layer 1 blockchains.\n\nL2Beat\u2019s combined $20.7 billion figure includes not only investor deposits but the market value of the native tokens of these layer 2 networks. In comparison, the reported TVL for layer 1 networks \u2014 $19.7 billion \u2014 only encompasses the value of investments tied up in their respective decentralised finance markets.\n\nZkSync and Arbitrum have even managed to handle more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days, data from L2Beat, a layer two tracking portal, shows.\n\nBlessing in disguise\n\nWhile these achievements suggest some layer 2s are knocking Ethereum off its perch, this does not necessarily imply a negative impact on the mainnet. In fact, the opposite may be true, as these developments are contributing to positive economic outcomes for Ethereum.\n\nFor one, these milestones mean more money for Ethereum validators.\n\nLayer 2 networks pay fees when rolling up their bundled transactions to the Ethereum mainnet for finality \u2014 the process of making transactions irreversible, which ensures the blockchain maintains immutability.\n\nApart from increased validator earnings, the layer 2 transaction uptick is also contributing to mechanisms designed to induce deflation for Ether token supply.\n\nEthereum also has a deflationary mechanism brought on by a network upgrade in August 2021. This upgrade, EIP-1559, made changes to Ethereum\u2019s fee structure with a portion of the transaction fee burned, thus reducing net Ether token inflation.\n\nThree of the top-10 fee burners are currently layer 2 networks, according to data from Ethereum explorer Etherscan.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "2023 was not particularly Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) best year. Although the second-largest cryptocurrency rallied almost 90%, other altcoins, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), were miles ahead. SOL\u2019s price went up by nearly 1000% in 2023. AVAX, on the other hand, saw an increase of over 200%. However, things may change for ETH in 2024, as there is a possibility that the project could surge to new heights.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum to \u201cEasily\u201d Rally 350% and Hit $10,000: Predicts Analyst.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to hit $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOne of the biggest drivers for ETH\u2019s price would be a bull run for the crypto market. Analysts anticipate a bull market in 2024, fuelled by the SEC\u2018s (Securities and Exchange Commission) possible approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) and BTC\u2019s halving event in April. Both developments could usher in a 2021-like bull run for the crypto market. In such a scenario, BTC might hit a new all-time high. If BTC reaches a new peak, ETH is likely to follow.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: ETH Could Hit $3500 in Q1, But There\u2019s a Catch\n\nThe second factor that could send Ethereum (ETH) to $10,000 is the possibility of an ETH ETF. The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is among the interested parties. Moreover, the SEC has accepted ETH as a commodity. Hence, an ETH ETF approval could be smooth sailing for the industry.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that an Ethereum (ETH) rally is long overdue. Other altcoins, such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), etc., rallied hard towards the end of 2023. ETH, however, kept calm. Hence, we may see a late rally for the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is also one of the most-used networks right now. The project dominates in terms of applications and adoption. This metric will play a vital role in ETH\u2019s journey to $10,000."

However, it surpasses Solana\u2019s $5.039 billion and notably exceeds Binance Smart Chain\u2019s daily volume by nearly fourfold.\n\nThe rising DEX volume also coincided with high-network activity on the layer2 network.

Follow-up deployments are set to go live on Sepolia and Holesky on Jan. 30 and Feb. 7 respectively.\n\nDissenters argued that 13 days may not provide sufficient time for any requisite changes to be made based on observations from the Goerli launch. However, the next ACDE call is slated for Jan. 18, meaning the scheduling could be adjusted should developers encounter any issues during the 24 hours proceeding the Goerli fork.\n\n\u201cMost other clients felt the timeline, albeit somewhat aggressive, was acceptable,\u201d tweeted Go Ethereum, an Ethereum client provider. \u201cAssuming all goes well, expect client releases for Goerli next week and for Sepolia/Holesky the week of Jan. 22.\u201d\n\nDencun will usher a significant reduction in transaction fees for Layer 2 rollups by replacing calldata with less gas-intensive blobs via EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, improving data availability on Layer 2.\n\nThe Verge\n\nThe meeting then discussed what measures should be prioritized in Ethereum\u2019s following upgrade, Pectra. Go Ethereum noted that all client teams are in favor of focusing on introducing Verkle Trees \u2014 a data structure enabling the network to become stateless, meaning clients will not need to store Ethereum\u2019s entire state history in order to validate blocks.\n\nSpeaking at the Ethereum Community Conference in July 2022, Vitalik Buterin said instituting Verkle Trees, also called \u201cThe Verge\u201d, will bolster the network\u2019s decentralization by reducing the hardware requirements associated with becoming a validator.\n\n\u201cYou will be able to verify Ethereum blocks and even be a validator without having hundreds of gigabytes on your disc, which is great for decentralization,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nGo Ethereum tweeted that the introduction of Verkle Trees will likely require more than 12 months for development at minimum, meaning Pectra is unlikely to go live in 2024. Lightclient estimated Verkle Trees could take between 18 and 24 months to realize.\n\nOther Ethereum Improvement Proposals may also be included in Pectra."

And I think this showcases a very big hole in Ethereum\u2019s value proposition.\u201d\n\nThe trader also says that there don\u2019t appear to be new developments in the ETH ecosystem generating much excitement.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like Ethereum is like a deadweight chain right now. No new exciting things that have gotten me really juiced up here, no new applications on Ethereum, nothing, for example, that couldn\u2019t be deployed on a dozen other EVM chains that will easily steal that ecosystem activity because they\u2019re much more scalable, they have lower fees.\n\nAnd\u2026 I think that they\u2019re in just as much trouble because they suffer from almost the same position that Ethereum is in. They don\u2019t have any ties to Bitcoin. They\u2019re seeing practically zero single-digit growth. If anything, they\u2019re declining in their stablecoin liquidity deposited on the chain, or any other kind of metrics that we utilize, developer commits, etc.\u201d\n\nThe trader says his analysis is supported by the fact that Ethereum is declining against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC).\n\n\u201cEthereum is losing out against Bitcoin. It might be going up in dollar terms, but the name of the game here in crypto is you either buy Bitcoin or you buy into plays that are consistently helping you to outperform Bitcoin as an asset. If you\u2019re not, why not just buy the king? Why not just buy the largest position in the market, the safest bet? Because Ethereum right now, for four months, has been below the 200-week (moving average). This is not a good sign to see.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.0512 BTC ($2,218) at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "This Layer-2 Crypto Just Passed Ethereum on 1 Key Metric and Is Up 27% This Week - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Arbitrum (CRYPTO: ARB) is among the leading large-cap cryptocurrencies in the market this week. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, Arbitrum has surged 27.2% since last Friday's close and is one of the only top cryptos to have reached a fresh all-time high this past week.\n\nFor mega-cap cryptos, it's been a rather ho-hum week. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), for example, ended the week up 3.7% and down 3.4%, respectively. Hence, the outsize interest in names like Arbitrum.\n\nHere's what investors are watching closely when it comes to this Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution right now.\n\nArbitrum passes Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume\n\nThe big headline that drove an incredible amount of interest in Arbitrum relative to other top cryptos over the past week is a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on the Arbitrum network. Earlier today, Arbitrum pushed past Ethereum to process a 24-hour trading volume of $1.83 billion, making this the leading platform in terms of daily DEX volume.\n\nArbitrum's surge in trading volume was very noticeable, with overall volume increasing more than 32% over the past week. Ethereum's corresponding volume dropped nearly 5% over the same period. Arbitrum's infrastructure, which includes using optimistic rollups to improve speed, scalability, and cost on its network, appears to be striking a chord with traders. In the highly competitive market for DEX market share, Arbitrum is not so quietly rising in the ranks.\n\nTo make things better, Arbitrum also announced record-high total value locked (TVL) metrics this week. The project's overall TVL surged past the $2.5 billion mark for the first time, surpassing Layer-1 network Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) in the process.\n\nAdditionally, Orbit (a Layer-3 project providing developers with the ability to build applications on Arbitrum) announced this week that ARC-20 tokens can now be used for transaction fees. This added benefit for Orbit's individual blockchains and corresponding decentralized applications appears to be spurring overall ecosystem growth for Arbitrum.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat now?\n\nArbitrum appears to be firing on all cylinders. The network's lower-cost, higher-throughput ecosystem is clearly one developers are looking to build upon and users are flocking to. So long as these fundamental metrics continue to improve, this project could certainly continue to see momentum well into 2024.\n\nNow, some of Arbitrum's transaction volume surge can be attributed to a meme token-driven frenzy in recent months. Most conservative investors wouldn't bet the farm on that continuing, and at some point, I think the fuel this catalyst is providing will run out.\n\nThat said, Arbitrum's infrastructure and value as a scaling solution are being validated in a big way by the market. For those betting on growth within the Ethereum ecosystem (with the majority of the spoils in terms of volume going to scaling solutions like Arbitrum), this is a crypto to keep your eye on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ARB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ARB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ARB wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Solana Co-Founder: The Blockchain Doesn\u2019t Need Layer-2s Like Ethereum - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has expressed confidence that their blockchain can handle the growing demand for decentralized applications (dapps) without needing layer-2 solutions like those employed by Ethereum.\n\nSolana Doesn\u2019t Need Layer-2 Solutions\n\nIn a post on X, Yakovenko argued that Solana\u2019s design, which utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism, enables it to scale efficiently without relying on additional layers. The co-founder explained that their goal is to eventually synchronize a global atomic state machine \u201cas fast as the laws of physics allow.\u201d With this stance, Yakovenko appears to be downplaying the role of layer-2 off-chain options like Arbitrum and Base.\n\n\u201cSolana aims to synchronize a global atomic state machine as fast as the laws of physics allow,\u201d Yakovenko said on X. \u201cIn this end state, any layer-2, side chain, or zero-knowledge proof Valadium amounts to the same thing. They are external execution environments that cannot ensure atomic composition with the rest of the layer-1 state.\u201d\n\nDespite the position Yakovenko takes, the co-founder said the floor is open for developers to create layer-2 solutions. However, it won\u2019t be necessary because the network can handle such demand without such workarounds.\n\nEthereum Is Confident Layer-2s Will Be Key To Scaling\n\nThis stance contrasts Ethereum\u2019s approach, which increasingly relies on layer-2 solutions to alleviate congestion and high transaction fees. Layer-2 options such as Optimism and Arbitrum have gained popularity for their ability to offload transactions from the mainnet while maintaining compatibility with existing smart contracts.\n\nTo quantify their role in scaling Ethereum, L2Beat data shows that the layer-2 solutions have a combined total value locked (TVL) of over $20 billion. The largest of them is Arbitrum, which manages $10 billion of assets when writing on January 5.\n\nThough Yakovenko\u2019s comments reflect Solana\u2019s focus on providing a high-performance, low-cost environment for apps, there have been instances when the network froze, calling its reliability into question. To resolve this, the platform plans to upgrade its client, adding the Firedancer for increased node reliability and performance.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum seems to be going the layer-2 route. During their developer call, it was decided that Ethereum\u2019s gas limit won\u2019t be increased further from the 30 million gwei level. This, analysts concluded, meant the delay of on-chain scaling ambitions for off-chain methods, specifically off-chain and sidechain rails.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum network is witnessing a surge in validator exits, which hit a record high of over 16,000 validators in the exit queue on Jan. 5, on-chain data showed.\n\nThe rise in exits has caused the wait time for unstaking to spike to an average of 5.6 days. Around 15,140 validators are still in the queue as of press time.\n\nThe surge was primarily driven by withdrawal requests from defunct CeFi lender Celsius Network and staking provider Figment, which collectively make up roughly 75% of total withdrawals in the queue.\n\n550k ETH\n\nCelsius, which is currently undergoing a restructuring process after declaring bankruptcy last year, has initiated a large-scale withdrawal from Ethereum staking.\n\nThe move, aimed at reallocating assets to satisfy creditors\u2019 demands, involves the withdrawal of more than 200,000 ETH, valued at approximately $450 million.\n\nThe situation is exacerbated by the involvement of Figment, another major staking provider, which is linked to 54% (350,000 ETH) of the total withdrawals in the queue.\n\nTogether, the two entities want to withdraw approximately 550,000 staked Ethereum \u2014 roughly 1.7% of the 29 million ETH staked across all platforms.\n\nEntries drying up\n\nAmid these substantial exits, the entry queue for new Ethereum validators remains notably low, hovering near zero. This is a stark contrast to the swelling numbers in the exit queue.\n\nThe Ethereum network operates with a churn limit, which restricts the number of validators that can enter or exit the network per day to 2,925, based on 13 validators per epoch.\n\nThe surge in exit requests has also impacted the staking yield for Ethereum validators. As of press time, the staking rewards reference rate is about 3.4%, down more than 50% from the nearly 8% yield recorded in May 2023.\n\nThis significant shift in validator dynamics poses potential challenges to the Ethereum network\u2019s stability, given the crucial role of validators in securing and processing transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, the extended wait time for unstaking, now at an average of 5.6 days, has raised concerns about the network\u2019s ability to handle large-scale exits."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Crash Looming? Celsius To Unstake $465 Million ETH - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Celsius Network, the bankrupt cryptocurrency lending company, is gearing up to unstake approximately $465 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) as part of its efforts to compensate creditors. This development follows the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing in July 2022, leaving creditors in a prolonged 18-month wait for financial recompense.\n\nCelsius\u2019s decision to unstake a substantial amount of ETH is seen as a necessary step to ensure liquidity for creditor compensation. The company\u2019s official announcement, made via X (formerly Twitter), highlights the strategic nature of this move:\n\n\u201cIn preparation of any asset distributions, Celsius has started the process of recalling and rebalancing assets to ensure ample liquidity. Celsius will unstake existing ETH holdings, which have provided valuable staking rewards income to the estate, to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process. The significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nCelsius Responsible For Over 86% Of ETH In Exit Queue?\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen states that Celsius possesses approximately one third of the total Ether in the unstaking exit queue, totaling around 206,300 ETH. This figure translates to a market value of around $465 million. To date, Celsius has already withdrawn over 40,249 ETH.\n\nTom Wan, an on-chain data analyst at 21.co (parent company of 21Shares), elaborated on the situation, \u201cOver 540k staked ETH (16,670 Validators) are currently withdrawing from the Ethereum Beacon chain. To fully exit and withdraw now, it will require 14.5 days.\u201d The researcher added that 352,000 ETH (54.7%) waiting to be withdrawn belongs to Figment and 206,000 ETH (32%) belongs to Celsius.\n\n\u201cIt is also likely that the withdrawal by Figment belongs to Celsius. Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428.000 stETH from Lido, they have re-staked 197.000 ETH via Figment,\u201d he added. Therefore, Celsius might be responsible for unstaking 86.7% of all ETH in the queue.\n\nEthereum Price Crash Looming?\n\nWhile some investors express concern that the release of such a large volume of tokens from staking could adversely impact Ethereum\u2019s price, others maintain a more composed outlook, believing that the market is robust enough to absorb this additional volume.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that all ETH from the queue is sold, liquidity appears to be strong enough to absorb such a process, which would be gradual rather than sudden. According to Coinmarketcap, the current ETH trading volume stands around $11.35 billion, suggesting that the market could withstand the potential sale of Celsius\u2019 entire ETH holdings without any major ETH price crash. Fear-mongering is therefore superfluous.\n\nAfter receiving approval for its settlement plan, Celsius has allowed eligible users to withdraw 72.5% of their cryptocurrency holdings, with this option available until February 28. A court document filed in the previous September revealed that approximately 58,300 users possess a total of $210 million in assets, which the court has classified as \u201ccustody assets.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,250. The 1-week chart for ETH/USD indicates that, over the past five weeks, the price of Ethereum has formed a consolidation range. The chart defines this zone with a lower boundary at $2,125, indicated by the red area, and an upper boundary at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, located at $2,441.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price has shown interest in a recovery rally, trading around $2,244.\n\nA spike in whale transaction count suggests investors could be buying the dip.\n\nOn-chain metrics hint at little to no resistance up to $2,800.\n\nA flip of the $2,145 level into the resistance level will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is attempting a recovery bounce that could kickstart a run-up to new yearly highs. Supporting on-chain and technical indicators add credence to this bullish ETH outlook.\n\nAlso read: Institutions\u2019 interest in crypto grew by 176% in 2023 but seems to be waning ahead of Bitcoin ETF\n\nEthereum price ready to move higher\n\nEthereum price slipped low as $2,100 on January 3 after Matrixport\u2019s ETF-rejection post. But ETH, like many other cryptocurrencies, recovered quickly. Ether currently trades at $2,244, forecasting a potentially explosive move to the upside.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 42 after its recovery from the oversold region a few days ago. A higher low formation could indicate a slow but steadily gaining upward momentum.\n\nThe Awesome Oscillator (AO) is much more optimistic than the RSI, which shows a decline in bearish momentum as the indicator approaches the zero line. A flip of the mean level would indicate that the bullish momentum is in play and could push Ethereum price higher.\n\nIn such a case, if Ethereum price flips the $2,300 hurdle into a support floor, it could move higher and retest the $2,400 barrier. In a highly bullish case, ETH could tag the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $2,562 and also the monthly resistance level at $2,652.\n\nRead more: Ethereum price could make a recovery as ETH supply on exchanges hits an all-time low\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nThe bullish Ethereum price outlook is supported by the spike in Whale Transaction Count and Volume on January 3. According to Santiment\u2019s data, this uptick occurred on the day of a massive sell-off, which is a sign of investors buying the dip.\n\nSince whale-transaction count tracks transfers worth $100,000 or more, this uptick has a high chance of being a buy-the-dip move from institutional investors. Considering that the volume coincides with this uptick adds even more credence to the bullish outlook.\n\nETH whale transaction count, volume\n\nFurthermore, IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator shows that the immediate key hurdle at $2,347 is relatively weak. Hence, overcoming this blockade could send ETH to the next critical level of $2,859. Here, roughly 10.77 million addresses that accumulated 5.2 million Ether are sitting at a loss.\n\nTherefore, a potential move into this hurdle could see a considerable spike in selling pressure from these holders trying to break even.\n\nETH GIOM\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum price flips the range low of $2,144, it will create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis. In such a case, ETH could slide 6.50% and revisit the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso read: Following spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, SEC holds meetings with NYSE, NASDAQ and other exchanges"

        "content": "The surge in Arbitrum\u2019s daily volume likely stems from the upcoming Ethereum upgrade dubbed Dencun, not the memecoin frenzy experienced by other blockchain networks.\n\nArbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has taken the lead in daily volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX) for the first time in Arbitrum\u2019s history, according to the most recent data from crypto analytics firm DefiLlama.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the total value of transactions made on Arbitrum by crypto users stands at $1.83 billion, taking the lead from base layer blockchain Ethereum, which has a 24-hour volume of $1.44 billion. In fact, the combined 24-hour volume of Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism and zkSync Era is less than that of Arbitrum.\n\n\n\nThe historical leader in 24-hour volume has been Ethereum, though its seat on the throne has been challenged recently. Solana, a layer 1 blockchain that implements proof-of-history, surpassed Ethereum\u2019s daily DEX volume for several days in December 2023. Now, less than a month later, Arbitrum has taken the lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy feat, there\u2019s a lot of chains and not many have been able to do that, even if it\u2019s just temporarily,\u201d said Martin Lee, content lead at on-chain metrics firm Nansen, to Unchained via Telegram. \u201cWhile it\u2019s an impressive achievement, ideally, I\u2019d want to see this trend continue over a longer time horizon before putting any weight behind it. We\u2019ve seen moments where chains get massive spikes in activity but few manage to maintain it.\u201d\n\nDencun\u2019s Impact\n\nThe spike in Arbitrum\u2019s volume likely stems from the upcoming Ethereum upgrade known as Dencun, Lee noted. Set to be activated on several testnets this month, Dencun is the first major upgrade to Ethereum since Shapella in April of last year, which enabled stakers to withdraw their ETH. The newest upgrade includes EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which is designed to scale Ethereum in a decentralized way.\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding reduces the cost of posting large amounts of data to Ethereum and thereby lowers the operational cost of rollups,\u201d wrote Galaxy\u2019s vice president of research Christine Kim in a research report last June. \u201cEIP 4844 is considered a boost to Ethereum scalability because it makes Layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum more cost-effective,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn addition, Carlos Mercado, data scientist at blockchain data firm Flipside Crypto told Unchained over Telegram that \u201cArbitrum over the last few weeks has been preparing for Arbitrum Orbit, their competitor to the Optimism \u2018Superchain\u2019 thesis,\u201d a network of chains that all share Optimism\u2019s open-source development stack.\n\nNotably, the surge in Arbitrum\u2019s daily DEX volume is not from the recent memecoin frenzy that has gone viral on other Layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche. Memecoins \u201cnever took off\u201d on Arbitrum, according to Nansen\u2019s Lee.\n\nARB, the native governance token for the Arbitrum ecosystem, has slid roughly 11% in the past 24 hours, but has gained nearly 27% in the past seven days to change hands at $1.86, according to CoinGecko.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor of Unchained."

This developmental push will help usher in ENS subdomains that are registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s.\n\nAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s.\n\n\n\nENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!https://t.co/Ice1lTttFE \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) innovation came into the limelight in 2018 as it seeks to bring ease to wallet address identification. Rather than the long alpha-numeric codes that typically characterize private keys, ENS makes it possible to replace these with the user\u2019s name with \".eth\" as the suffix.\n\nAmong the many visions Vitalik Buterin has for the blockchain, he believes it is high time L2s also got their name service with a rare incentive boost \u2014 to make this name service more affordable. This integration call, if perfected, will serve as a major growth push for Layer-2 protocols to function more effectively and attract new users into their ecosystems.\n\nLeveling playing ground\n\nA growing number of Ethereum Layer-2 protocols are differentiating their solutions in a bid to gain the technological advantage that can help them secure a dominant spot in the ecosystem.\n\nShould the call to integrate the Ethereum Name Service be adhered to, it will ultimately level the playing ground for these protocols concerning bolstering user experiences and engagements as a whole.\n\nThe digital currency ecosystem is evolving in no small measure, with Ethereum particularly facing competition from market rivals like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX). The call for ENS integration is a move to help the protocol maintain its dominance in the smart contract world."

However, the asset is down 8% from its weekly high of $2,434 on Dec. 2 as markets cool.\n\nZooming out, Ethereum has been consolidating at current levels for the past month.\n\nAdditionally, analysts have been mulling potential price peaks for ETH this year. Some see it hitting $10,000 quite easily. This is only double its all-time high in the last cycle, in which it made a $4,800 gain from trough to peak."

The selloff Ethereum experienced pushed its price to a low of $2,181 before bouncing back to $2,236.77 which it currently trades at.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recovery was signaled by the reduced selloff with the rate of growth in price and market capitalization staying at 0% in the past 24 hours.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nInsight Into the Whale Ethereum Accumulation\n\nAccording to data from the crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain, the whale with the address \u20180x931\u2019 spent $48 million to buy a total of 21,192 ETH at an average price of $2,265 a couple of hours before writing. This brings the valuation of the stash to $47,999,880.\n\nThe whale has no special preference for centralized exchanges as the accumulation thus far has been conducted through Binance and Decentralized Exchanges.\n\nPer the data shared, since January 13, 2023, the whale has purchased a total of 79,500 ETH at an average price of $1,790 with a total of $36.84 million.\n\n?? Massive whale 0x931 spent $48M to buy 21,192 $ETH at $2,265 on avg ~2hrs ago. In total, the whale has bought 79,500 $ETH from #DEX and #Binance at $1,790 on avg since Jan 13, 2023, with $36.84M (+25.9%) in unrealized profit. The purchases were financed through revolving\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mD245C060o \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 5, 2024\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOne interesting pattern in this whale\u2019s accumulation strategy is that they buy ETH by targeting specific retracement points to maximize subsequent uptrends. This has proven to be effective considering the win rate.\n\nThe whale\u2019s purchases have come from different sources including revolving loans from Aave lending protocol and Liquidity.\n\nPer Spot On Chain\u2019s observations, the Ethereum whale appears to be long on Ethereum and the accumulation thus far has yielded a total of 25.9% in unrealized profit.\n\nEthereum Retracement Underway?\n\nThe accumulation of Ethereum by this whale mimics related bullish moves of Michael Saylor, the Chairman of MicroStrategy, the firm that recently acquired $615 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the committed capital is potentially not large enough to cause a significant shift that can trigger Ethereum\u2019s long-sought bullish retracement.\n\nDiscounting this accumulation, the hype surrounding Bitcoin spot ETF has the potential to trigger a rally in the price of Ethereum as the bullish sentiment that might accompany a likely approval might send prices of all assets correlated with BTC to new heights."

        "title": "Ether ETF likely coming, as SEC 'implicitly' nodded ETH as commodity: Analyst - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission implicitly accepted Ether (ETH) as a commodity when it approved ETH futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year \u2014 meaning a spot ETF variant is likely set for this year \u2014 according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nSpeaking during CryptoQuant\u2019s private webinar on Jan. 4, Seyffart alluded to the approval of Ether futures ETFs in October 2023, noting that the SEC did not challenge the coin\u2019s classification through the ETF registration process with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is blatantly calling Ethereum a commodity. They do not call them securities. [...] The SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs. So again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures.\u201d\n\nSeyffart said the SEC likely had no bandwidth to dispute the classification.\n\nThe first Ether futures ETFs in the U.S. were listed for trading on Oct. 2, with several investment firms launching a total of nine funds on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, including ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly and Volshares. According to Seyffart, the SEC could find itself in court and have to unlist futures ETFs if it were to deem Ether a security.\n\nThe classification matters since securities and commodities ETFs face different legal requirements, with different taxes and regulatory burdens attached to securities.\n\nHere we go \u2026 expect more spot #ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days.\n\n\n\nNOTE: this is an S-1 and not a 19b-4. Which means it does not start a clock in any way \u2026 yet. Expect 19b-4\u2019s soon. https://t.co/sNus2vr5qV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t just be the SEC going against the crypto industry. If they call Ethereum a security, it\u2019ll be going against their sister regulator, CFTC. [...] That\u2019s why I think we could see potential Ethereum ETFs approved this year as well,\u201d the analyst noted.\n\nThe SEC recently lost a court case under a similar dispute in which it exempted the Spikes Index \u2014 a stock volatility index \u2014 from the definition of security futures under claims of promoting competition among such indexes. \u201cThere\u2019sr precedent here to say it matters how these things are registered,\u201d said Seyffart.\n\nThe SEC has a final decision deadline for VanEck, ARK 21Shares and Hashdex\u2019s spot Ether ETF in May 2024, with other decision deadlines coming in the months following.\n\nBefore then, however, the regulator must disclose its verdict on spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. Seyfartt predicts an approval by Jan. 10, with $10 billion flowing into Bitcoin ETFs within 12 months.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable? Lessons from the front lines"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been experiencing a lateral trading pattern for over a month, fluctuating between two key levels at $2400 and $2137. The appearance of daily candles with rejection wicks at both ends signifies a prevailing uncertainty among investors. Recently, a sharp market downturn, partly attributed to speculated rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the US SEC as reported by Matrixport, a digital asset financial services firm, resulted in a notable 6.5% drop in the ETH price. This decline led to the breach of a crucial support trendline, hinting at the risk of further corrections.\n\nIs Ethereum Headed for a Steeper Slide?\n\nA bearish breakdown below the support trendline hints at an early upcoming correction.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price should bolter buyers to revive exhausted bullish momentum,\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $19.3 Billion, indicating a 53% gain.\n\nOver the past eight weeks, the Ethereum price has shown signs of recovery, evident from an ascending trendline on the daily chart. This trendline has historically served as a strategic buying point for investors during market dips, indicative of a robust recovery.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, during the current period of consolidation, Ether has been facing substantial resistance at the $2400 mark. The recent downturn, coinciding with the broader market sell-off, pushed the price below both the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the established support trendline.\n\nIf the daily candlestick closes beneath this critical threshold, it could pave the way for sellers to exert additional downward pressure, potentially triggering a further 20% price decline, bringing the ETH price down to approximately $1750.\n\nEthereum Long-Term Holder Ratio Surpasses Bitcoin\n\nWhile current short-term trends suggest a cautious or downward trajectory for the Ethereum price, an analysis of the \u201cHolder Ratio\u201d chart presents a promising outlook for the cryptocurrency. In a retrospective of 2023, on-chain data from Intotheblock showcased on the X-platform, revealed that the proportion of long-term Ethereum holders exceeded that of Bitcoin for the second time. This vital statistic underscores a growing trend of Ethereum investors committing to hold their assets for extended periods, outpacing similar commitments among Bitcoin investors. This increase in long-term holding is significant as it reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum\u2019s prospects and stability\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope drops below the midline reflecting the sellers are strengthening their group over\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price above daily EMAs(50, 100, and 200) hints the broader market is strongly bullish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "The total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum layer-2 networks recently hit a new all-time high in January, a testament to the continued adoption of Ethereum. Layer 2 networks sit on top of the Ethereum blockchain and help scale it by processing transactions off-chain before sending data back to the main blockchain.\n\nAccording to data from L2BEAT, a layer-2 analytics platform, the TVL on these scaling solutions recently reached an all-time high of $21.16 billion, representing a 340% growth from the same day last year.\n\nEthereum Layer-2 Networks Hit New Milestone\n\n2023 was a great year for Ethereum, as the altcoin and its scaling solutions registered a steady increase in TVL despite strong competition from other networks like Solana and Cardano. Data from L2Beat shows the TVL on these scaling solutions started in 2023 with $4.81 billion but grew steadily throughout to end the year at $19.98 billion dollars, a 315% growth.\n\nThis growth was particularly exacerbated in the last quarter of 2023 and continued into 2024. The TVL grew by $1.18 billion in the first three days of January to reach $21.16 on January 3, its current all-time high.\n\nAt the time of writing, the TVL is now at $20.41 billion, still up by 3.82% in the past seven days. A large fraction of this layer-2 TVL can be attributed to Arbitrum One, with the scaling solution currently having $10.05 billion worth of cryptocurrencies locked.\n\nOP Mainnet, formerly called Optimism, is second with a current TVL of $5.84 billion. 57% of this TVL is composed of OP tokens, compared to Arbitrum One, whose ARB token constitutes only 36% of the TVL.\n\nETH price holds $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nState Of The ETH Network\n\nThis massive growth shows that Ethereum users are flocking to layer 2 networks to escape high gas fees and congestion on the mainnet. Ethereum\u2019s TVL also witnessed steady growth throughout the year, adding $7.6 billion in the last quarter of 2023. Data from DeFiLlama shows the TVL on Ethereum is now at $28.532 billion.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen its daily active addresses and transaction count plunge in the last few months. Data from Artemis revealed the network is currently being surpassed by Solana and Sui in terms of daily transaction count. Recent competition from Solana prompted an analyst to describe Ethereum as digging its own grave by relying too much on its layer-2 networks for scalability.\n\nSome layer-2 chains are also currently processing more transactions than Ethereum itself. L2BEAT puts the monthly transactions on zkSync Era and Arbitrum at 39.91 million and 35.54 million respectively, ahead of Ethereum\u2019s count of 33.91 million transactions.\n\nFeatured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

From Dec 14 to Jan 3, Bitcoin consistently surpassed Ethereum regarding transaction fees, marking three weeks.\n\nWhile not unprecedented, this phenomenon was noteworthy given the typically lower Bitcoin transaction fees. Interestingly, a similar trend surfaced briefly in November when Bitcoin transaction fees outpaced Ethereum\u2019s for three days.\n\nHowever, this recent streak fell short of the record set in 2017, when Bitcoin transaction fees outperformed Ethereum\u2019s for roughly a year. While the recent trend has concluded, the fluctuation in transaction fees between the two digital assets remains a point of interest.\n\nStakeholders are urged to monitor these trends as they could have significant implications for mining profitability and the broader digital asset market dynamics."

        "title": "Ethereum Insider Says XRP Will Shine, Plans to Become XRP Investor - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "As the crypto community anticipates the bull market\u2019s peak, early Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has made favorable predictions for XRP.\n\nNerayoff speculated that XRP will shine in the bull market. According to the crypto advisor, the current bull market started after Ripple secured a legal victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Ethereum advisor explained that Ripple\u2019s legal victory helped clear concerns about uncertainty, leading to the commencement of a bull market.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRecall that Ripple recorded a partial victory against the SEC last year, where a federal judge declared that XRP in itself does not constitute a security as alleged by the regulator.\n\nInterestingly, Nerayoff noted that the current bull market is a catch-up time for XRP, as the coin missed out on the previous bull market due to the SEC v. Ripple legal tussle.\n\nYes, arguably Ripple\u2019s legal victory started this bull run! It\u2019s catch-up time for the last bull run. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) January 1, 2024\n\nHow the SEC Lawsuit Affected XRP Performance in the 2021 Bull Market\n\nFor context, the SEC charged Ripple with offering XRP as an unregistered security in December 2020. The regulator introduced the lawsuit shortly before most crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, recorded new all-time highs (ATHs).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile several crypto assets registered new ATHs in 2021, XRP traded at $1.96 on April 2021, 50% below its previous ATH of $3.4 set on January 4, 2018.\n\nWith a federal judge declaring XRP to be a non-security, Nerayoff believed that this bull run was XRP\u2019s turn to shine. Although he did not give any price prediction for XRP, he speculated that the asset would make up for its low performance in the previous bull market.\n\nNerayoff Plans to Invest in XRP\n\nIn the meantime, Nerayoff has disclosed plans to invest an undisclosed amount in XRP. He made this known after a crypto enthusiast asked him whether he owned XRP.\n\nResponding, Nerayoff said he has not invested in XRP but hopes to do so soon. However, he did not provide any hint about when he plans on investing in the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nNo. I\u2019m not invested in Ether or XRP as I didn\u2019t want anyone to say I was biased. I would be an investor in XRP & have publicly spoken about my belief in them since 2014. (I have a tiny amount of Ether bc I need to pay the ETH Cabal for their exorbitant gas fees). \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) January 1, 2024\n\nCan XRP Surpass Its Previous ATH?\n\nMeanwhile, despite many analysts emphasizing that the bull market has already started, XRP was trading at $0.58, down 82.9% from its previous ATH of $3.4.\n\nThese analysts predict that the bull market will reach its peak after the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, which is expected to occur in April 2024.\n\nHistorically, the prices of various crypto assets, including BTC and XRP, usually skyrocket several months after every Bitcoin Halving. Whether the same pattern will repeat itself in the coming months remains to be seen.\n\nXRP Community Predicts XRP Price in Bull Market\n\nIn the meantime, XRP community members participated in an X survey to predict the final price of the digital asset in this bull market.\n\nOut of the 533 X accounts that participated in the survey, the majority of them, representing 38.1%, projected that XRP could surge to $12 and above in the bull market.\n\nIn addition, 23.5% of the participants forecast that XRP could surge and end the bull market at around $8 \u2013 $12. Notably, a number of participants, representing 18.4%, predict that XRP will trade below $2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Your $XRP Peak Price Prediction in 2024? ??

        "title": "ETF Analyst: Approval of Ethereum Spot ETF in US Could Happen This Year - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "The imminent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States is expected to pave the way for more fund managers to apply for Ethereum spot ETFs in the near future.\n\nThe approval of several Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States in October last year undeniably paved the way for spot ETFs in the near future. According to Bloomberg\u2019s ETF and crypto analyst James Seyffart, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared the way for spot Ethereum\u2019s ETF, having implicitly classified Ether as a commodity through its actions. Notably, crypto leaders in the United States are pushing for most digital assets to be classified as commodities in a bid to avoid the stiff regulations associated with securities.\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is blatantly calling Ethereum a commodity. They do not call them securities. The SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs. So again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures,\u201d Seyffart noted.\n\nThe Grayscale Investments\u2019 court win against the US SEC on the spot Bitcoin ETF ruling has significantly changed the agency\u2019s approach to the cryptocurrency industry. Consequently, should the US SEC approve the dozens of spot Bitcoin ETFs on Friday, the approval of Ether\u2019s spot ETF will significantly increase. Moreover, the US political leaders want to get the attention of the 52 million plus Americans invested in cryptocurrencies by favoring policy changes. Additionally, Seyffart noted that the US SEC does not want to contradict its sister agency, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has already signaled that Ethereum is a commodity.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t just be the SEC going against the crypto industry. If they call Ethereum security, it\u2019ll be going against their sister regulator, CFTC. That\u2019s why I think we could see potential Ethereum ETFs approved this year as well,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nMarket Implication on Ethereum and Price Action\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has grown to a mature network providing liquidity to the majority of web3 tokens. With a market cap of about $279 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $18 billion, the king of smart contracts has more room for growth in the coming years, fueled by institutional investors. In case the US SEC approves the dozen spot Bitcoin ETF applications, Ethereum\u2019s price will rise in tandem with the flagship coin. Additionally, the Ether rise will even be more violent after the US SEC approves the Ethereum spot ETFs.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is a deflationary coin with high demand from all around the world. According to a recent report by CoinShares, Ethereum\u2019s investment products registered a cash inflow of about $78 million in 2023, and the rate is anticipated to spike further in the coming years amid the crypto bullish sentiments."

At the same time, Solana (SOL) remains loyal to the clear narrative of being the \"fastest and cheapest\" chain.\n\nOne thing the eth marketing department got horribly wrong is endlessly peddling new narratives, new jargons, buzzwordy roadmaps, the 50th rollup, the 10th da, the 5th bridge, and the 5th shared sequencer.\n\n\n\nCompare all this marketing complexity to \u201csolana is the fastest cheapest\u2026 \u2014 Qiao Wang (\ud83d\udc7d, \ud83d\udc7d) (@QwQiao) January 4, 2024\n\nWang stressed that the \"marketing department\" of Ethereum (ETH) should be put in quotes as neither the blockchain nor Ethereum Foundation has a centralized unit responsible for promotional activity.\n\nThe ever-increasing range of shared sequencers, bridges, dozens of rollups makes Ethereum (ETH) too complicated to teams only interested in building secure and fast decentralized applications in a resource-efficient way.\n\nWhile \"technocrats and academics\" might find this complexity intellectually satisfying, the majority of cryptocurrency project teams remain \"pragmatic\":\n\nIf modularity loses to the monolithism in 5 years, this will be why\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Ethereum's (ETH) focus on L2 solutions was also criticized by Cyber Capital CIO Justin Bons. Bons foresees the migration of focus to non-EVM blockchains like Near and MultiversX.\n\nSeason of \"flippenings\"?\n\nAt the same time, Wang concludes that these issues can be fixed. Ethereans should just remove the mental friction to become more attractive for developers.\n\nIn 2024, the crypto sphere is discussing various metrics in which Solana (SOL) surpasses Ethereum (ETH). Last week, Solana (SOL) surpassed the largest smart contracts platform in weekly stablecoin transfers.\n\nAlso, in late December 2023, Solana (SOL) flipped Ethereum (ETH) as the most used blockchain for decentralized exchanges (DEXes) in daily and weekly time frames."

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius will unstake 206,300 Ethereum, worth around $470 million, as part of efforts to facilitate the distribution of assets to creditors, according to a Jan. 4 statement on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCelsius said the planned \u201csignificant\u201d unstaking event will occur in the next few days and further revealed that its staked Ethereum holdings provided the failed company a \u201cvaluable staking rewards income\u201d to offset certain costs incurred throughout its restructuring process.\n\nFollowing the news, Nansen\u2019s Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) Upgrade dashboard shows that the lender wants to withdraw 206,300 ETH, or 32% of all ETH awaiting withdrawal, valued at nearly $470 million.\n\nThe dashboard further shows that the firm is among the top 10 firms that have withdrawn their staked ETH since withdrawals were enabled last year. Celsius has withdrawn a total of 40,249 ETH as of press time.\n\nAdditionally, Celsius\u2019s decision has led to a notable surge in the Ethereum validator exit queue. According to data from beaconcha.in, the queue has spiked to over 16,000 today, a record high, and the waiting time has extended to approximately six days.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent announcement signifies progress in Celsius\u2019s restructuring journey and the imminent return of customers\u2019 assets. The court has already approved a restructuring plan that could enable creditors to recover up to 79% of their holdings.\n\nNevertheless, criticisms have emerged due to the absence of a disclosed effective distribution date, with customers expressing weariness over continual preparation updates.\n\nWhat does this mean for ETH price?\n\nCrypto community members are concerned that Celsius\u2019s move might increase the selling pressure on the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nLast December, CryptoSlate reported that the bankrupt lender sold $250 million of digital assets, including Ethereum, in 30 days. At the time, observers suggested that the firm was selling to capitalize MiningCo, a Bitcoin mining company that creditors of the failed firm would own.\n\nHowever, Celsius said, \u201cEligible creditors will receive in-kind distributions of BTC and ETH as outlined in the approved Plan.\u201d"

This decision comes after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, following a liquidity crisis triggered by the volatile crypto market.\n\nThe Celsius Network Ethereum Unstaking Plans\n\nCelsius Network revealed in a follow-up post on X that \u201cthe significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors\u201d. The Ethereum holdings, previously staked by the company, have served as an income stream to offset costs incurred during the restructuring process.\n\nThis development is particularly welcomed by customers who have patiently awaited the return of their funds for over 18 months. According to the firm, as part of the recovery plan, Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum will be distributed to the creditors.\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Nansen reports that almost a third of the ETH in the pending withdrawal queue belongs to Celsius, totaling 206,300 ETH valued at approximately $468.5 million at current prices. While concerns have been raised about potential market impact due to a large sell-off, some view the move as positive for the Ethereum markets in the long run.\n\nIn November 2023, Celsius Network outlined a scaled-back post-bankruptcy strategy focusing on Bitcoin mining. The plan to shift towards Bitcoin mining, however, has faced skepticism from some creditors, and regulatory hurdles still need to be cleared, including approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAt the time, Celsius acknowledged the regulatory requirements and mentioned that if the mining venture doesn\u2019t proceed, an alternative plan for liquidation may be implemented. However, with a settlement plan approved by a Federal Judge, Celsius Network has allowed qualified users to withdraw 72.5% of their crypto until Feb. 28.\n\nAccording to court filings from September, approximately 58,300 users held $210 million in what the court categorized as \u201ccustody assets.\u201d The move is seen as a step towards fulfilling the commitments made under the recovery plan.\n\nCelsius\u2019 Founder\u2019s Legal Troubles\n\nMeanwhile, the founder and former CEO of Celsius Alex Mashinsky, who is facing fraud charges and is currently out on bail, is scheduled for a jury trial on September 17. Though, with less impact, his legal situation adds another layer of complexity to Celsius Network\u2019s already difficult journey.\n\nIn December, Celsius Network entered into an interim agreement with Bitcoin mining company Hut 8. The agreement involves Hut 8 constructing and deploying new mining operation centers in Cedarvale, Texas, for Celsius creditors. The facility is expected to host approximately 66,000 miners, powered by a robust energy supply exceeding 215 megawatts at full operational capacity.\n\nThe partnership with Hut 8 signals a potential avenue for Celsius Network to recover and move forward, emphasizing the resilience of the crypto industry amid challenges."

However, some analysts are backing Bitcoin Minetrix after its presale hits $7.5 million.\n\nAnalysts bullish on Ethereum\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the last bull run, market participants are eagerly anticipating for the coin to hit $10k, hoping it comes in the early stages of the upcoming bull market rally.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum suffered highest losses due to rug pulls and hacks, data shows\n\nFollowing the last Bitcoin halving, Ethereum rose from $200 to over $1,200.\n\nIf the same growth applies, ETH may soar above $13K by the end of 2024.\n\nEven so, several variables are at play, mainly Ethereum\u2019s significantly higher market cap of $272 billion.\n\nAs such, it is not as simple as using past data to determine future results. However, several analysts have weighed in on this possibility in 2024.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, believes the coin could be headed to $4,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThe analyst referenced the Bitcoin halving, speculating it \u201cshould lift all boats.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, X commentator icircle_nft recently said ETH will rally to $5K by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, the analyst has higher hopes for ETH in 2025, forecasting it will reach $18K.\n\nMeanwhile, FieryTrading said the coin is trading inside a rising wedge pattern and may reach $16K by the end of 2025.\n\nThat said, analyst CrediBULL Crypto is even more optimistic, speculating Ethereum could reach highs of $20K or a minimum of $10K by the end of 2024.\n\nUltimately, whether Ethereum will underperform, equal, or outperform its last market cycle remains to be seen. While most analysts are bullish, there are many opinions on where it could be headed.\n\nThough many analysts expect Ethereum to outperform in 2024, some are more bullish on Bitcoin Minetrix after raising $7.5 million in the ongoing presale.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix raises $7.5 million in presale: what\u2019s next?\n\nBitcoin Minetrix allows users to earn passive BTC rewards by staking on Ethereum.\n\nThe project is a cloud mining solution where users can stake BTCMTX for Bitcoin mining credits.\n\nThey can then burn these credits on the Bitcoin Minetrix platform for cloud mining power, receiving Bitcoin.\n\nThis use case requires no hardware or technical know-how from users, making it ideal for beginners.\n\nAnother benefit is that the decentralized and transparent BTCMTX eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams.\n\nOther advantages include no space or noise constraints on the user and it offers a more eco-friendly way to mine Bitcoin.\n\nThese benefits seem to be supporting the project in the ongoing presale which has raised $7.5 million so far.\n\nFor what it offers, an analyst, Jacob Bury, says BTCMTX is set for more gains after launching.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

        "title": "\"Super-important\" ENS Rises Following Buterin Endorsement - CCN.com",
        "content": "E Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has called Ethereum Name Service (ENS) \u201csuper important\u201d triggering a spike in the market price of the protocol\u2019s governance token.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ENS has pumped over 40%.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall crypto market is down over 5% in the same period.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has led a crypto market crash after Matrixport struck a blow to traders\u2019 confidence that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs next week. But one token \u2013 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) \u2013 has bucked the wider market trend.\n\nAt a time when BTC and other leading cryptocurrencies fell between 5% and 10% in 24 hours, ENS surged more than 40% after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin endorsed it.\n\nButerin Backs More Affordable ENS\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter, Buterin discussed upgrades to the Ethereum ecosystem that could promote the use of ENS.\n\nArguing that ENS \u201cneeds to be affordable,\u201d he endorsed the use of Chainlink\u2019s cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) to make ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions. In line with the renewed interest in L2 scaling incorporated in Buterin\u2019s latest Ethereum roadmap, this approach could significantly boost ENS adoption by driving down the costs associated with registering and managing Web3 domains on the blockchain.\n\nAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s. ENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!https://t.co/Ice1lTttFE \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 3, 2024\n\nThe costs associated with ENS are typically paid in ETH. However, the eponymous governance token is an important feature of the technology. It can influence the protocol\u2019s management and future development.\n\nWhat are ENS Subdomains?\n\nEthereum Naming Service is a decentralized domain name system that can link Ethereum addresses with human-readable domains. When combined with IPFS, the ENS protocol can even support fully decentralized web hosting, with domains referencing entire websites.\n\nENS is not just for Ethereum L1. It\u2019s cross-chain and works especially well on L2s that post their state roots to L1. It\u2019s also a permissionless public good that all L2s should be using and can be building on without needing to ask ENS. But we\u2019re here to help if you are! https://t.co/udHqOx3cB6 \u2014 jefflau.eth (@_jefflau) January 3, 2024\n\nMost ENS domains consist of a top-level and a second-level domain. For example, in vitalik.eth, eth is the top-level domain and vitalik is the second-level domain.\n\nBy adding a third level, however, each domain can be divided into subdomains. This could drive adoption by approximating the Web2 domain name system in which a small number of domain owners administer services for a much larger base of end users, without needing to pay gas fees for each subdomain."

With an average daily GitHub commit size of 449, Cardano is setting the pace in the development race, leaving Ethereum's daily average of 183 behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis development not only solidifies Cardano's position but also positions it as a frontrunner in blockchain innovation, outperforming other projects such as Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), which trails with a daily GitHub commit size of 282.\n\nThe significance lies in the potential impact on ADA's market performance. A more active development phase typically correlates with increased functionality and utility. As Cardano attracts more developers, there is an expectation of heightened demand and usage for its native blockchain token, ADA.\n\nDevelopment first\n\nAnalysts believe that Cardano's current development surge is a positive indicator of a growing ecosystem. The project's focus on improving interoperability and fostering collaboration through global workshops has contributed to its leading position in the blockchain-oriented landscape.\n\nWhile the precise impact on the ADA price remains uncertain, the correlation between development activity and token demand suggests a positive trajectory for Cardano. As the project continues to outpace competitors in development, the crypto community anticipates further advancements and innovations from Cardano in the decentralized finance space."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) validator exit queue attained an all-time high at 16,400 amid plans of Celsius ETH staking withdrawal. The waiting time for validators in the queue had extended to more than 5 days. This abrupt surge in validator exit queues could be linked to Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lending platform. The crypto lender recently confirmed its initiation of recalling and rebalancing crypto assets, including Ethereum to repay its creditors.\n\nCelsius ETH Unstaking Plans\n\nCelsius, entrenched in bankruptcy proceedings since its Chapter 11 filing in July 2022, has strategically begun shifting assets to guarantee ample liquidity in anticipation of potential asset distributions. Thereafter, in a recent post on X, Celsius wrote, \u201cThe significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis comes after the firm announced that their creditors would receive BTC and ETH distributions, according to the approved plan. Moreover, the latest move by Celsius carries positive implications for customers who have patiently awaited the return of their funds after 18 months of uncertainty.\n\nThe liberated Ethereum from this unstaking operation will serve a dual purpose for Celsius. Apart from repaying creditors, it will be employed to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process, providing financial maneuverability.\n\nAlso Read: Judge Approves Celsius Network\u2019s Shift to Bitcoin Mining Company\n\nAccording to data from Nansen, a blockchain analytics organization, nearly one-third of the ETH currently in the pending withdrawal queue is attributable to Celsius. The crypto lender\u2019s 32% share accounts for a staggering 206,300 ETH. Its withdrawal share is valued at approximately $467 million based on the price of $2264.64 at press time.\n\nETH Validator Exit Queue Spike\n\nFurthermore, Nansen data revealed that 19,906 validators were awaiting a complete exit a few hours before the massive validator exit queue was cleared. In addition, the stats noted that a total of 637,564 ETH staking was awaiting a full exit.\n\nAccording to Validator Queue analytics, 16,425 validators exited staked ETH positions on Friday, January 5, 2024. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the unprecedented spike led to an all-time high in the validator exit queue on Beacon Chain. The wait time for clearing the queue was recorded to be 5 days\n\nThe recent spike comes exactly a month after the ETH validator queue recorded a peak in December. The network witnessed an exit of 3,829 validators on December 5, 2023. Currently, the number of active validators is 905,879. Moreover, the total staked ETH figure exceeds 28.9 million, representing 24.05% of the total supply.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Layer-2 Transactions Skyrocket 330% In 2023, ARB And OP Take The Lead"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction with Major Gains Expected in 2024 \u2013 Can ETH Surpass Its All-Time High?\n\nThe Ethereum price has gained 2% today, rising back to $2,260 as the wider market recovers from a sharp selloff earlier in the week.\n\nETH\u2019s current price means that it has lost 4% in a week and 0.5% in the last 30 days, yet the biggest altcoin in the market remains up by a very healthy 81% in the past year.\n\nIn other words, this week\u2019s haircut hasn\u2019t done much to dislodge Ethereum from its strong position, with the coin potentially on course to ride a bull market in 2024 to new highs.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction with Major Gains Expected in 2024 \u2013 Can ETH Surpass Its All-Time High?\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s indicators are in a mixed position right now, with the coin\u2019s recent rallies arguably putting it in a position where it should correct downwards for a bit.\n\nFor instance, its 30-day average (yellow) has been well above its 200-day (blue) for a couple of months now, implying that traders had overbought it in recent weeks and that it needs to cool down.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) is hovering around 50, having been high at the start of December.\n\nIts downwards trajectory since last month could mean that it\u2019s on course to fall further, perhaps towards 30, before we see some concerted rises again.\n\nYet one thing holders can take heart from is the fact that ETH\u2019s support level (green) has risen and held up consistently well since November, so even if ETH struggles to rise in the short term it\u2019s unlikely to fall significantly.\n\nIn terms of when we can expect a recovery, the SEC\u2019s potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs will lift the wider market massively, including Ethereum.\n\nAnd given that the market is expecting the Fed to soften its rate stance this year, crypto could see another strong bull market, helped along by Bitcoin\u2019s next halving.\n\nEthereum L1 is an API for security guarantees. Everything happening on top is a cambrian explosion of innovation, attracting the brightest minds of our generation. ETH is the asset powering this ecosystem, being deflationary and yielding 5%+.

In August, Celsius said it plans to distribute nearly $2B worth of BTC and possibly ETH to creditors.\n\n\u201cThe significant unstaking activity in the next few days will unlock ETH to ensure timely distributions to creditors,\u201d Celsius tweeted.\n\nCelsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after halting user withdrawals one month earlier. A July 2023 settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission found that Celsius had misappropriated more than $4B worth of customer funds prior to suspending operations.\n\nOn Dec. 20, An Ape\u2019s Prologue, a web3 researcher, tweeted that Celsius had sold $243M worth of Ether over 30 days. Data from Arkham Intelligence suggests Celsius still holds $227M worth of ETH.\n\nEther ETF speculation runs rampant\n\nDespite the looming possibility that Celsius may move to liquidate the remainder of its sizable Ether holdings, many onlookers believe spot ETF speculation could soon drive gains for ETH.\n\nWith prominent analysts tipping that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may greenlight the first spot Bitcoin ETF next week, an increasing number of researchers are turning their attention to Ether as the next likely candidate for spot ETF approval.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

Start for free\n\n\u201cExpect more spot Ethereum ETFs filings in the coming days,\u201d tweeted James Seyffart, a Bloomberg analyst who expects the SEC to approve an initial cohort of spot Bitcoin ETFs sometime around Jan. 10.\n\nDuring a webinar hosted by CryptoQuant on Jan. 4, Eric Balchunas, a fellow Bloomberg analyst, argued that the launch of Ether futures ETFs in October implicitly treats ETH as a commodity and paves the way for a spot ETF to also receive approval.\n\n\u201cBy approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cIf they call Ethereum a security, it\u2019ll be going against their sister regulator, CFTC... That\u2019s why I think we could see potential Ethereum ETFs approved this year as well.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Flipper, a popular trader and analyst, argued that Ether\u2019s current price does not reflect its spot ETF prospects.\n\n\u201cNot even 1 cent of the proposed spot ETH ETF has been priced in yet,\u201d they tweeted. In my humble opinion\u2026 if the market was rational and forward-thinking, the price of ETH would shoot to $3,000 upon the spot BTC ETF approvals this week.\u201d\n\nDCinvestor, a prominent investor and web3 influencer, shares the sentiment.\n\n\u201cOnce the BTC ETF hits, literally everyone in the newly emergent \u2018TradFi crypto sector\u2019 will be looking at the fact that only one other asset has CME futures, a live futures ETF, has been referred to in the past as a \u2018commodity\u2019 by the CFTC and prior SEC chairs,\u201d they tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s ETH.\u201d"

        "content": "ETH witnessed its highest drop in over two months.\n\nThe Ethereum in profit has gone below 80%.\n\nEthereum [ETH] experienced a significant decline in its price, leading to a corresponding decrease in profit supply.\n\nEthereum sees highest drop in months\n\nOn the 2nd of January, Ethereum faced a notable decrease of over 6%, settling at about $2,210 based on a daily timeframe chart. The chart analysis showed a positive start to the year, with some intermittent declines up to the 2nd of January.\n\nHowever, the most recent dip marked the steepest drop observed in the past few weeks.\n\nAdditionally, this price drop caused the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to fall below the neutral line. As of this writing, the RSI remained below the line despite a slight uptick in the price.\n\nThe price was around $2,230, with less than a 1% increase as of this writing. Also, the short-moving average (yellow line) continued to act as support for now. Nevertheless, this support could shift if the price falls below the existing range.\n\nEthereum sees more outflows\n\nSurprisingly, Ethereum witnessed increased outflows on the 3rd of January, even in the face of a declining price. Leading up to this date, there was a prevailing trend of inflows, signifying a greater influx of ETH into exchanges for potential sale.\n\nHowever, this pattern shifted on the 3rd of January, with over 22,000 ETH leaving exchanges. The netflow on exchanges remains positive, albeit marginally, indicating a higher sales volume.\n\nIt is notable that, at press time, there was no evident indication of an imminent sell-off.\n\nETH supply in profit takes a slight beating\n\nThe impact of the price decline extended to the Ethereum supply in profit. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the supply in profit on Santiment showed a significant reduction in the volume of ETH that was in a profitable position.\n\nBefore the 3rd of January, the supply in profit was over 110 million ETH, constituting over 84% of the total supply.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, by the conclusion of the day on the 3rd of January, this figure had decreased to around 107 million, accounting for about 82% of the supply.\n\nAs of this writing, the supply in profit had further reduced to around 104 million, representing about 79% of the total supply."

On December 12, Ethereum Classic highlighted that its Spiral Network Upgrade will be completed by January 31, 2024. This upgrade will help bring the network up to date and introduce parity to Ethereum Classic with the Shanghai Upgrade implemented on Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs Ethereum Classic waits for the upgrade to be completed, analysts have turned bearish on the price of ETC. They project that ETC will trade sideways and even plunge in the coming weeks before surging again after the upgrade is completed. Nonetheless, the crypto seems resilient and has remained stable amid the recent meltdown in the market.\n\nOn December 31, ETC was trading at $22.20. Analysts expect ETC to rise to $25.50 in January 2024, supported by the Spiral Network Upgrade. Hence, ETC is a good crypto to buy today.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website"

        "content": "The Ethereum network is on the cusp of a major upgrade, one that is set to bring significant improvements and changes to the platform. This upcoming update is called the Prague upgrade, also referred to as the Pectra upgrade, and has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTestnets are essential staging grounds for new features, and the Dencun upgrade will first roll out across several testnets: Goerli on Jan. 17, Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024. These testnets will allow developers to fine-tune the upgrade in a controlled environment, ensuring everything operates smoothly before going live on the main network.\n\nThe core development team is currently in a debate over prioritizing the implementation of Verkle trees, a data structure that would optimize storage and access to information on Ethereum. While some developers advocate making Verkle trees the sole focus, others suggest pursuing a smaller feature fork alongside the Verkle development.\n\nThe main argument for concentrating solely on Verkle trees stems from their complexity and the time investment needed to implement them effectively. This could mean that if Verkle trees become the next priority, no new execution layer (EL) features might appear for 12 to 24 months, or possibly longer.\n\nNevertheless, there is an understanding that even if the focus shifts to Verkle trees, minor updates to the Ethereum Layer (EL) might still be necessary. For example, changes to the gas limit for data availability are crucial for Ethereum's scaling solutions and require coordination across both the execution layer and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nThe Prague upgrade is set to include various proposals that aim to refine the Ethereum platform on different layers, including precompiles for specific cryptographic operations, a new EVM object format (EOF) and modifications to smart contract capabilities.\n\nThe Prague upgrade promises to be a significant event that will shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. It is a step forward in ensuring that Ethereum continues to offer a secure, efficient and scalable platform for decentralized applications."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Ethereum stands as a titan. While Bitcoin may be the undisputed king, Ethereum offers something far more versatile: a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and powering a vibrant ecosystem that extends far beyond simple transactions. And the fuel that keeps this engine running? That\u2019s where Ether (ETH) comes in.\n\nBeyond a Currency:\n\nThink of ETH not just as a digital coin, but as the lifeblood of the Ethereum network. Every transaction, every smart contract execution, every interaction within the dApp universe requires ETH to function. It\u2019s the gas that powers the engine, the oil that keeps the gears turning.\n\nHere\u2019s how ETH plays its crucial role:\n\nTransactions: Sending ETH to another address incurs a transaction fee, paid in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 ETH. These fees compensate miners (or validators in Ethereum 2.0) for verifying and securing the network.\n\nSmart Contract Execution: Deploying and executing smart contracts, the self-executing agreements that power dApps, also require ETH. The complexity of the contract and the computational resources it demands determine the fee.\n\nDApp Interaction: Whether you\u2019re playing a blockchain game, trading on a DeFi platform, or buying an NFT, most dApps require ETH for various functionalities within their ecosystems.\n\nMore Than Just Transactions: ETH\u2019s utility extends far beyond simple payments. It\u2019s the key that unlocks a world of possibilities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Borrow, lend, trade, and earn interest on your crypto assets without intermediaries using DeFi protocols, all powered by ETH.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Own and trade unique digital assets like art, music, and collectibles with the security and transparency of the Ethereum blockchain, facilitated by ETH.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Participate in community-governed organizations without central authorities, using ETH for voting and contributing to the DAO\u2019s treasury.\n\nThe Metaverse: Explore and interact within virtual worlds built on the Ethereum network, buying land, participating in events, and engaging in the economy, all fueled by ETH.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nWith Ethereum 2.0 on the horizon, promising increased scalability and sustainability, ETH\u2019s future looks bright. As the dApp ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, ETH\u2019s demand and value are likely to soar.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that ETH, like any cryptocurrency, is a volatile asset. Its price can fluctuate significantly, and investing in it carries inherent risks. Do your own research and invest responsibly.\n\nETH is more than just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s the beating heart of the Ethereum ecosystem. It fuels the transactions, powers the dApps, and drives innovation across various sectors. As the blockchain revolution unfolds, ETH is poised to play a central role in shaping the future of finance, technology, and even society itself. So, the next time you hear about ETH, remember \u2013 it\u2019s not just a digital coin, it\u2019s the fuel that ignites the possibilities of a decentralized future."

        "content": "NFT sales volume on the Bitcoin network exceeded Ethereum in December.\n\nThis occurred despite Ethereum recording a higher transaction count.\n\nThe Bitcoin [BTC] Network outpaced Ethereum [ETH] as the blockchain with the highest non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume in December, marking the second such occurrence in just two months.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, in December, NFT sales on the Bitcoin network totaled $881 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s $353 million.\n\nIn November, NFT sales on Ethereum fell behind those recorded on the Bitcoin network by almost 10%, to mark the first time in history that the latter would record a higher sales volume than the former.\n\nThe surge in NFT activity recorded on the Bitcoin network in the last two months can be attributed to the resurgence in interest in inscriptions and Ordinals on the blockchain.\n\nDue to the high activity, by 16th December, the Bitcoin network recorded a single-day high of $10 million paid as fees to mint inscriptions on the blockchain, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nAlso, the activity of Inscriptions and Ordinals on the Bitcoin network resulted in an uptick in demand for blockspace. As of 18th December, AMBCrypto found that activity around inscriptions accounted for 39% of the virtual blockspace on the network.\n\nInterestingly, while Ethereum witnessed a lesser sales volume than the Bitcoin network, it recorded a higher transaction count in December. AMBCrypto found that the total count of NFT transactions completed on Ethereum during the 31-day period totaled 698,201.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin network registered only 493,516 transactions.\n\nThe market so far this month\n\nWith four days into the new trading year, the Bitcoin network remains in the lead regarding NFT sales transactions. So far this year, the chain has recorded a sales volume of $61.08 million.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen an NFT sales volume of $27 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nDespite the high activity on the Bitcoin network, the general market has witnessed a retracement in NFT sales activity in the last week. Data from NFTGo showed a decline in NFT sales volume and market capitalization in the last seven days.\n\nInformation from the data provider showed that NFT sales volume in the general market had totaled $116 million in the last week, dropping by 10%.\n\nLikewise, the NFT market capitalization had reduced by 3% during the same period."

        "content": "On-chain data shows the largest of the Ethereum whales have continued to buy more recently as their supply sets another new all-time high.\n\nLargest Ethereum Wallets Have Been Rapidly Accumulating\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest non-exchange Ethereum wallets have continued to show some rapid accumulation recently.\n\nThe relevant indicator here is the \u201csupply held by top non-exchange addresses,\u201d which keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum that the 150 largest self-custodial wallets are carrying in their combined balance right now.\n\nNaturally, the 150 largest non-exchange wallets would belong to the top whale entities of the network. As such, the trend in the metric can provide hints about the sentiment around the cryptocurrency among these humongous holders.\n\nWhen the indicator goes up, it means that these whales are expanding their holdings currently. Such a trend naturally suggests that they are bullish on the asset at the moment.\n\nOn the other hand, the metric registering a decline can be bad news for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, as it implies that these large investors have decided to participate in some selling.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the supply held by the top non-exchange Ethereum addresses over the past couple of years:\n\nLooks like the metric's value has been constantly going up during the last few months | Source: Santiment on X\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the supply held by these top 150 whales has been rapidly going up since April 2023. This would suggest that the rally in the early months of the year caught the attention of these large entities, leading them to accumulate.\n\nInterestingly, the slump between August and October was also not enough to dissuade these holders, as they only continued to buy more. Likewise, these whales have continued to push through the latest plunge in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price as well.\n\nAfter the most recent buying spree, the supply of these top non-exchange Ethereum wallets has reached 56.25 million ETH, which is a new all-time high for the indicator.\n\nIn the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for the supply held by the top exchange addresses. This metric naturally measures the total number of coins that wallets attached to centralized platforms are carrying currently.\n\nWhile the self-custodial whales have ramped up their supply, the top 150 exchange-bound wallets have moved flat in the same period. At present, this indicator has a value of 9.46 million ETH right now, which is nearly the lowest level observed since June 2018.\n\nGenerally, one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling purposes. So the supply of these exchange whales remaining low is a positive sign.\n\nThe rapid accumulation that the self-custodial whale entities are showing, combined with the fact that the top exchange wallets are at low levels, could mean the long-term outlook may be optimistic for Ethereum.\n\nETH Price\n\nWhile Bitcoin has already made some recovery from its crash, Ethereum has only been able to rebound a bit so far, as its price is trading around the $2,250 level.\n\nThe price of the asset appears to have been mostly moving flat since the plummet | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Flavio on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Notably, two whale wallets have seized this dip as an opportunity, making substantial purchases of WBTC and ETH at what many are considering \"the bottom.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wallet designated as 0x8B20 took a bullish stance, deploying a total of $3 million USD in stablecoins to acquire 35.18 WBTC at $42,641 each and 674.18 ETH at $2,225 each.\n\nThis strategic action by cryptocurrency whales is a significant indicator of strong market sentiment. Such movements often suggest a belief among experienced investors that any forthcoming dips in price will be short-lived, offering quick recovery and providing upward momentum. Following the whales' lead, the crypto market has recouped over 5% of its value, suggesting resilience and a possible trend reversal on the horizon.\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a critical factor that could catalyze a market turnaround. Despite the common \"sell the news\" events that often follow such announcements, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF would likely boost investor confidence, attracting institutional money.\n\nAs the market navigates through these turbulent waters, the actions of whale investors offer a glimmer of optimism. The significant investments from these large-scale holders suggest a belief in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If the ETF receives the green light, we may well witness a significant rally, affirming the whales' bullish maneuvers and potentially leading to a market reversal that could reshape the investment landscape."

Buterin said this would prevent the hoarding of domain names among early users looking to maximize profits, enabling wider adoption and more decentralized ownership of ENS addresses.\n\nMagazine: Which gaming guild positioned itself best for the bull market?"

        "content": "The Ethereum price has experienced a slight decrease in the past few days, surpassing the $2,200 mark once again. This indicates that the performance of the ETH token has consistently outpaced that of Bitcoin. Could this be an indication that the Ethereum trajectory might experience a significant surge within the next 12 months? Is a $10,000 Ethereum price plausible in the year 2024? Let\u2019s take a look at this Ethereum price prediction 2024 article in more detail.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH<\u2014\n\nHow has the Ethereum price moved in recent days?\n\nAs of now, the Ethereum price stands at $2,246.13, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $38.32 billion. Ethereum\u2019s market cap is $269.95 billion, and it holds a market dominance of 16.18%. Over the last 24 hours, the ETH price has seen a 0.48% increase. In the last seven days, the ETH price has decreased by -4.42%.\n\nOn November 10, 2021, Ethereum achieved its highest price of $4,867.17, while its lowest price was recorded on October 21, 2015, at $0.420897. The lowest price since its all-time high was $897.01 (cycle low), and the highest ETH price since the last cycle low reached $2,448.66 (cycle high). Currently, the sentiment for Ethereum\u2019s price prediction is neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index registers 72 (Greed).\n\nWith a circulating supply of 120.18 million ETH, Ethereum has a current yearly supply inflation rate of -1.79%, indicating that -2.19 million ETH were created in the last year. In the market cap ranking, Ethereum holds the top position in the Proof-of-Stake Coins sector and is ranked second in the Layer 1 sector.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH<\u2014\n\nCan the Ethereum price rise?\n\nOver the past year, Ethereum (ETH) has exhibited robust performance, witnessing a remarkable 79% increase in its price. Impressively, it outpaced 53% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies during this period, demonstrating its strength within the volatile crypto market. Trading consistently above the 200-day simple moving average signifies a sustained positive trend. The coin boasts high liquidity, as reflected in its substantial market capitalization.\n\nHowever, recent market trends reveal a degree of volatility, with only 14 green days in the last 30 days, accounting for 47% of the observed period. Moreover, ETH currently stands at a -54% decline from its all-time high, highlighting the challenges the cryptocurrency has faced in maintaining its peak valuation. These multifaceted indicators underscore the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s journey in the crypto landscape.\n\nWill the ETH Price Hit $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOver the long term, positive trends, such as the circulating rumors surrounding a potential Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by BlackRock, have the potential to significantly influence and drive the price of Ethereum (ETH) higher. The introduction of an ETF, particularly from a financial heavyweight like BlackRock, could enhance Ethereum\u2019s accessibility and appeal to a broader range of investors.\n\nSuch a development might instill confidence in the market, attracting institutional and retail investors alike, and potentially leading to increased demand for Ethereum. Positive sentiments surrounding strategic financial instruments often contribute to sustained upward momentum in the cryptocurrency market. As these rumors persist, they may act as a catalyst for increased adoption and investment, fostering a positive trajectory for Ethereum\u2019s price in the long run.\n\nThere is a possibility of another substantial surge in Ethereum\u2019s price in the upcoming months. Ethereum shares similar bullish factors with Bitcoin. The reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s supply due to the Bitcoin Halving and the potential introduction of spot ETFs could lead to a substantial increase in demand, potentially influencing Ethereum\u2019s price positively.\n\nPresently, the Ethereum price appears to be intricately connected to the fluctuations in the Bitcoin market, possibly more than ever. In the event of a significant surge in Bitcoin prices, there is a likelihood that the Ethereum value could experience a delayed but notable increase. Moreover, the introduction of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has the potential to contribute to additional upward momentum in the Ethereum price.\n\nNevertheless, a projection for the Ethereum price in 2024 doesn\u2019t currently indicate a value of $10,000. However, a surge to $5,000, surpassing its previous all-time high, could be plausible in a bullish cryptocurrency market over the next 12 months.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH<\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nRaoul Pal warns of potential crypto bubble cycle.\n\nPal predicts a 20% year-on-year increase for NASDAQ by May 2024\n\nHe also thinks a Ethereum will be bullish in the first half of 2024.\n\nHe foresees sustained growth for Bitcoin beyond 2025 and the emergence of an altcoin season due to rising liquidity.\n\nFormer Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal recently suggested that the crypto markets might be approaching a colossal bubble cycle.\n\nIn a recent discussion with crypto enthusiast Scott Melker, the macroeconomics expert and CEO of Real Vision expressed that although he perceives the current market cycle as typical, there\u2019s a 20% probability it could escalate into an enormous bubble cycle.\n\nMassive Bubble Scenario Possible\n\nRaoul Pal outlined his assessment of the probable future of crypto market cycles, attributing a 60% chance to a regular cycle akin to the last one or perhaps more reminiscent of the 2017 cycle, which witnessed some frenzy. He considers there to be a 20% likelihood that the current cycle might be compressed in time due to overwhelming retail demand, potentially leading to a shorter cycle than anticipated.\n\nPal reflected on the possibility that, similar to previous cycles, this one might also fall short of expectations in terms of duration. Additionally, he allocated another 20% probability to the scenario of a massive bubble cycle, comparable to those seen in 2012-2013 and 2015, driven by the now widespread ability for participation, potentially leading to extreme market behavior.\n\nPal expressed uncertainty about which of these three scenarios will materialize, but believes each holds a substantial chance of unfolding.\n\nPal observed that the prevailing investor sentiment leans towards a shorter market cycle. However, he noted that, while investors might be correct about the rising prices, they are likely mistaken about the actual duration of the cycle being shorter.\n\nHe said: \u201cEveryone was a little shocked we didn\u2019t have a final leg the last time around, so they\u2019ve now got that imprint\u2026 so now they\u2019re all expecting it to be a smaller cycle. And I always look for where the crowd can be wrong but still be right, which is [that] it goes up, but it goes up more [than they think].\u201d\n\nEthereum Poised for Bullish Start\n\nCurrent projections for the NASDAQ suggest a possible increase of 20% year-on-year, potentially climbing to $175,000 by May 2024. In tandem, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory, which aligns with the global liquidity index, shows a bullish trend for the first half of 2024. Predictions say it could reach around $5,300.\n\nPal revisits his \u201ceverything code\u201d theory, highlighting the strategies of central banks in balancing the devaluation of currency to manage interest payments on burgeoning debts. This concept offers a lens to understand the recurring patterns in economic cycles.\n\nThrough an analysis of major trends since 1990, Pal identified Bitcoin and the NASDAQ as key influencers. He notes the consistent superior performance of the NASDAQ, which is expected to potentially reach between $25,000 to $30,000 by the end of the current cycle. His analysis provides a historical context to the evolving trajectories of these major financial assets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Long-Term Growth and Altcoin Season Potential\n\nPal delved into Bitcoin\u2019s cyclical nature and foresaw continued growth for the digital asset beyond 2025. He also explored the possibility of an altcoin season, fueled by increasing liquidity, indicating a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA few insights from .@RaoulGMI on the current crypto market: 1. \u201cDon\u2019t f*ck this up\u201d. pic.twitter.com/1JJNx5w3Qo \u2014 Real Vision (@RealVision) November 30, 2023\n\nPal advocated for a focused approach, recommending Bitcoin and Solana as core holdings. He stressed the importance of adopting a structured strategy and allocating a small portion of investments for speculative bets.\n\nNavigating Correction and Identifying Key Trends\n\nDespite the current market correction in crypto, Pal maintained a long-term perspective, emphasizing the importance of capturing the overall trend. He suggested a potential shift in focus from Bitcoin to Ethereum, driven by upcoming events and reduced Ethereum supply.\n\nPal explained his decision to shift Ethereum holdings to Solana, citing breakout patterns on price charts and network activity. He expressed immense optimism towards the Exponential Age, urging viewers to appreciate its transformative potential."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA new Solana project called \u201cLess Fn Gas\u201d captured the attention of Crypto Twitter earlier this week when it airdropped 40% of its LFG token supply to Ethereum users.\n\nIt was a ploy to entice Ethereum maxis to give Solana a try\u2014hop over the proverbial fence, see that the grass on the SOL DeFi field might actually be greener, and, well, spend less f\u2019n gas. (That is, of course, spend less on transaction fees, which can be quite expensive on Ethereum.)\n\nAnd despite soaring to a $129 million fully diluted market cap, and then crashing down to around $25 million once the hype began to fade, the team behind the project isn\u2019t stopping there. They\u2019re now planning a second airdrop\u2014one that will be even more inclusive than the first\u2014and establish a grants program for Ethereum devs who make the switch to Solana, a pseudonymous core team member of LFG tells Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver 50,000 ETH users claimed the LFG airdrop within the first 24 hours of the token launching on Monday. Wormhole, a popular bridge between Ethereum and Solana saw $35 million in volume the same day\u2014the first time it\u2019s seen an increase since Solana meme coins started cooling down last week. It apparently burned too hot too fast, though, and the token is now down roughly 80% from its peak on Tuesday.\n\nOne of the pseudonymous devs behind LFG, who goes by Bobby Axelrod (borrowing the name and likeness of the character from the Showtime series \u201cBillions\u201d), told Decrypt that he\u2019s spoken with high-profile members of the Solana community about building a project to bring Ethereum users over to Solana.\n\n\u201cI don't know how many of the 50,000 users that claimed are genuinely new to Solana, but judging by how many DMs I have asking how to set up a damn Phantom wallet, I\u2019d guess there\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said, referring to the popular Solana wallet Phantom.\n\nThe project got the attention of some of the key thought leaders from the Solana community, including Kyle Salmani, Multicoin Capital founder, and even Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.\n\n\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udc32 check all links and always use a burner wallet https://t.co/BCUOZp3VOy \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) January 2, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEth people This is a good reason to try solana. Even if for no other reason than to insta sell https://t.co/3YYCzlAiwq \u2014 Integrated Kyle e/acc (@KyleSamani) January 1, 2024\n\nUnfortunately, scammers also noticed the quickly surging token and posted phishing links in the replies to tweets about the project. If you\u2019ve spent any amount of time on Crypto Twitter, you know this happens all the time. But this one managed to fool the CEO and co-founder of Nest Wallet, Bill Lou, who fell victim to the wallet-draining scam.\n\nI'm devastated guys... I just got scammed out of $125k of stEth while trying to claim the $LFG airdrop. And I'm a fking founder of a wallet startup that's trying to improve wallet security... I can't believe this is happening, I've always been so careful. I saw article guide to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/x56HR2z8xK \u2014 Bill Lou (@BillLou95) January 2, 2024\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Crypto Twitter from degening.\n\ndidn't get drained what a start to the new year https://t.co/o2Ho9IuXpA pic.twitter.com/oirz8nyBC2 \u2014 DeeZe \ud83e\udee1 (@DeeZe) January 1, 2024\n\nPopular pseudonymous crypto trader Deeze took to Twitter to show he had claimed his airdrop, and fellow trader 0xQuit put out a thread featuring a brief security audit where the token contract was declared safe.\n\n3/ On the SOL side, you'll see something like this: I will not pretend to be an expert on the SVM, but the transaction looks fairly straight forward. If you want to be safe, claim using a fresh Solana wallet. pic.twitter.com/CBJJzKme6E \u2014 quit (\ud83d\udc40,\ud83e\udd84) (@0xQuit) January 1, 2024\n\nSo what\u2019s next for LFG? \u2018Tis the season for airdrops, so more is on the way, Axelrod says. The first one was limited to Ethereum wallets that had spent more than $4,269 in gas during the last 12 months. The next one will target a wider audience\u2014users only will have to have spent $1,000 in gas to be eligible. Additionally, LFG will be airdropping tokens to a few additional buckets including developers on Ethereum who have deployed a smart contract, users who have interacted with major Solana protocols, and people who put up liquidity for the LFG token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAxelrod said the LFG project is now also focused on bringing Ethereum developers to Solana. \u201cA big part of this [second] airdrop is going to be geared towards people who have deployed contracts on Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nThe LFG dev added that Less Fn Gas also plans to use a portion of its treasury to start a decentralized grants program. Ethereum developers will be able to apply for grants, paid in LFG, to build on Solana.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the project has legs, given how far it\u2019s fallen from its peak already. But with so many prominent figures from the Solana ecosystem seemingly rooting for it, anything is possible.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "The Ethereum price is exchanging hands at $2,237 as of 1:30 a.m., down 5.78% over the last 24 hours.\n\nETH experienced a 13% drop on Jan. 3 as its price dropped from a high of $2,385 to $2,100 within two hours, levels last seen in early December 2023.\n\nThe flash downswing resulted in liquidations of more than $100,000 worth of ETH futures, which were leveraged bets on the price increase.\n\nThe downswing has left traders debating the significance of the price correction with the Decilizer crypto community acknowledging that ETH had the most losses.\n\nBIG DAY FOR $BTC \ud83d\udd25\n\nGrayscale is in talks with JPMorgan & Goldman Sachs for its Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, #Crypto hack losses dropped 51% in 2023, but Ethereum $ETH saw the most losses.\n\nSecurity measures are improving, but the industry must stay vigilant. \ud83d\udea8#Bitcoin #BitcoinETF pic.twitter.com/ZCFafTZTFG \u2014 Decilizer (@decilizer) January 4, 2024\n\nIs this the end of the bullish momentum for the largest altcoin by market capitalization? Note that Ether has tried without success to break above the $2,400 thrice over the last month alone. This is also the third time the smart contract\u2019s token dropped toward the $2,000 zone over the same period.\n\nThe Jan. 3 marketwide sell-off appears to be triggered by an analysis report published by the digital assets platform Matrixport. The firm asserted that the SEC plans to reject the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto prices crashed within an hour of the report\u2019s release.\n\nCan ETH reclaim the $2,300 Level?\n\nThe cause of the 13% flash crash on Jan. 3 may never be definitively determined. This does not necessarily invalidate Ether\u2019s bull run or make gains above the $2,400 resistance less likely before the ETF decision.\n\nFor now, the bulls have to focus on reclaiming the $2,300 level. The long lower wick on Wednesday\u2019s candlestick suggests that the buyers are aggressively defending teh $2,000 support level.\n\nIncreased buying from the current level could see ETH scale higher with the first target being a return to $2,300 and later the equal highs around $2,300. If this happens, it will indicate the ability of the buyers to confront resistance from the $2,400 major resistance.\n\nETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nSupporting this bullish outlook was the upward-facing moving averages. Ether also sat on strong support on the downside. These were areas defined by the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,182, the $2,000 psychological level, embraced by the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA at $1,930.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) was also facing upwards, a suggestion that day traders had begun re-entering the market.\n\nOn the downside, failure to climb back above $2,300 would imply the inability of the buyers to sustain the uptrend. The bears would then pull the price toward the 50-day with the downside probably being capped around the $2,000 buyer congestion zone.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "If interest rates continue to decline, it will likely boost the appeal of cryptocurrencies, given their higher risk profile compared to most other assets.\n\nEthereum encountered some turbulence earlier today, dropping below the $2,100 mark, only to swiftly rebound and exhibit renewed strength.\n\nThis suggests that some investors reacted nervously, while others seized the opportunity to make purchases.\n\nThis pattern will likely persist since easy access to funds tends to push cryptocurrency prices higher.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems only a matter of time before buyers drive this market to higher levels, possibly targeting the $2,500 range and even extending towards $2,750. However, it's important to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency market, in general, is known for its volatility. Be cautious with your position sizing because of this, but at the end of the day it looks like each of these pullbacks are going to end up being nice buying opportunities.\n\nBuying dips in this market\n\nConsidering this, it's prudent to consider buying during price dips, but exercising caution and not committing all of your capital immediately. The ongoing activities of institutional investors as they establish new positions for the upcoming year will likely contribute to market fluctuations. Additionally, monitoring the U.S. bond market and interest rates is essential, as rising interest rates can negatively impact cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. As you go further along the risk spectrum, things get even more volatile.\n\nIf interest rates continue to decline, it will likely boost the appeal of cryptocurrencies, given their higher risk profile compared to most other assets. In light of these factors, it appears that buying opportunities during price dips are still viable, as demonstrated earlier today when the market swiftly turned around at approximately $1,950. However, it's crucial to be prepared for the inherent volatility that characterizes this situation.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nAt the end of the day, Ethereum experienced a dip below $2,100 followed by a rapid recovery, highlighting the market's resilience. The potential for easy access to funds is expected to keep driving cryptocurrency prices higher. Buyers are likely to push Ethereum towards the $2,500 and $2,750 levels in the near future. Nevertheless, it's essential to exercise caution and not rush to invest all your capital. Institutional activities for the new year and developments in U.S. interest rates should be monitored closely, as they can impact the cryptocurrency market. Overall, buying opportunities during price dips remain a viable strategy, but investors must be prepared for the accompanying volatility.\n\nReady to trade our Ethereum forecast?

        "content": "The turn of the new year brings new milestones for several tokens in the crypto industry. Projects like Polygon (MATIC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are some of the assets that reached new milestones in the last few months, making them some of the best coins to invest in this year. Meanwhile, the Everlodge (ELDG) project is rising in reputation and popularity due to several valuable factors. Find out more.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) Looking Set Resistance Level Above the $1 Threshold\n\nThe data from Coinmarketcap shows that Polygon (MATIC) has reached the $1 price value for the first time since May 2023. Based on the Polygon price chart, the coin has gained over 28% in the last month. The coins trading volume has risen by over 23% in the last few days, which means more increased trading activity.\n\nIn the meantime, the price of the Polygon token may fluctuate back below the $1 mark. Nonetheless, there are high hopes that the coin will maintain a steady growth that will see Polygon reach $2 before the end of Q1 of 2024.\n\nPositive Price Turn for Ethereum Classic (ETC)\n\nIn the crypto market, stats show that Ethereum Classic (ETC) has gained over 17% in price value within the last month. Also, the Ethereum Classic trading volume has risen by more than 20% in the last few days, with more investors joining to benefit from the ongoing rally. Although the ETC token has crossed the $20 benchmark, there is still a higher chance of a downturn in the coming weeks if it drops under $20.\n\nEthereum Classic has wallowed below the $20 mark for eight months before eventually reaching the milestone last December. As it stands, Ethereum Classic will be looking to maintain its bullish sentiment, which may propel it towards $30 within the next few months. With the anticipated bull run, Ethereum Classic is one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term gains.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Soars as it Synergizes Blockchain and Real Estate Investment\n\nAs a property marketplace, Everlodge (ELDG) is attracting investors due to the cutting-edge innovation that the project has kick-started. Everlodge\u2019s goal is to make real estate investment generally inclusive and safe for every individual regardless of one\u2019s capital strength.\n\nWith Everlodge, individuals can invest in luxury assets by purchasing digitally fractionalized NFT tokens that are backed by real-world assets. With as low as $100, individuals can become luxury asset owners.\n\nAs a result of the high growth potential of Everlodge, the project\u2019s native token (ELDG) has attracted a massive troop of investors as well. ELDG token which is currently at its 9th stage of presale, is going for only $0.029. The project\u2019s presale has sold over 18 million ELDG tokens since its presale with more investors buying for the future.\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb Check out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we\u2019ve added.

Moreso, the ELDG tokens come with a fixed monthly interest that acts as a source of passive income.\n\nOverall, investing in Everlodge is an opportunity to be part of the trillion-dollar real estate industry. At the current trajectory, the Everlodge token is poised to grow by 280% at presale.

        "title": "Goldman (GS) Conidered as Potential AP for Spot Bitcoin ETF - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS is being considered to become the authorized participant (AP) for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which Grayscale and BlackRock Inc. BLK are planning to launch.\n\nApart from GS, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM is being considered as a potential AP for the ETF. This was first reported by Coindesk.\n\nBLK became the first asset manager to file for the spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, paving the way for a wave of filings by other asset managers like Fidelity, Invesco and WisdomTree, Inc. WT.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to announce its decision on the trading of spot bitcoin ETF\u2019s latest by Jan 10, 2024. To date, the approved cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States are those that include future contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The pending approval from SEC will provide investors direct exposure to the price of cryptocurrency without having to purchase them.\n\nBlackRock also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF named iShares Ethereum Trust in November 2023. The Ethereum ETF, if approved, will be the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nWhile BLK is expanding its cryptocurrency exposure, JPM has been undertaking measures to subdue them. In September 2023, JPM stated that its retail bank, Chase, in the U.K. had decided to restrict customers\u2019 access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scams and fraud cases. Nonetheless, it has been exploring the concept of launching a blockchain-based deposit token for customers, provided it receives the required regulatory approval.\n\nJPMorgan and Goldman as APs for spot Bitcoin ETF would be entrusted with the responsibility of tracking the ETF share price with underlying assets of fund. The companies will be required to create and redeem the shares of ETF, thus supplying the required liquidity.\n\nBeside this, Goldman has been focusing on growth in its core strengths of investment banking and trading since it has been pulling back from its consumer lending business. Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPer an internal memo circulated last year, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives\u2019 positions as it intended to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term.\n\nFurther, it has been aiming to expand its offerings across the high growth countries. In December 2023, Bloomberg reported that GS was planning to enhance its credit business in India as it is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Per Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman in India, the bank intends to broaden the range of its loan offerings in this country.\n\nThe firm also desires to obtain a license to boost its currency trading that would permit it to deal with counterparties like financial investors, equity customers or a corporate customer. This apart, GS believes that deal-making activity in the country is likely to receive a boost.\n\nGoldman\u2019s shares have gained 16.9% over the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s 11.3% growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGS presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCryptocurrencies have been prone to fluctuations which have varying effects on investments. Veteran traders pay attention to market data and watch the analysis to step in at the right moment and back the right assets. This analysis goes into the latest market trends around two of the biggest coins in the crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nWe will also take a look at Pushd (PUSHD), a newcomer that is bringing decentralization to global e-commerce and online marketplaces.\n\nSupporters of Pushd (PUSHD) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nEthereum (ETH) community enjoys new high\n\nThe second biggest crypto in terms of market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) is a popular decentralized asset for many traders. The network has an expansive number of use cases including for smart contracts and DeFi. Its blockchain also serves as the base for many other networks and tokens.\n\nYet, keen observers would notice that Ethereum (ETH) has dropped by around 5.61% in the last 24 hours, and around 6.26% in the last 7 days. It has also seen a significant decrease in trading volume in that period. Analysts have attributed this trend to several factors including a period of short-term profit-taking and price movements of other assets.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) supporters enthusiastic as standoff with SEC continues\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is considered the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and has the highest market cap of any digital asset. However, it is still not immune to the volatility in the market. The value of 1 Bitcoin BTC declined by 4.46% in the past day, liquidating some $500 million worth of positions.\n\nThis was following a report by Matrixport, a financial services company, that predicted that the SEC would reject Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETF proposals. While some experts argue that this reversal in value is not connected to the report, it seems to have affected confidence in the asset. Other analysts believe technical price metrics are instead responsible for the drop in value.\n\nPushd (PUSHD) presale gains traction\n\nThe innovative project promising to revolutionize how online marketplaces work through blockchain technology, Pushd (PUSHD), has recorded an important milestone. Pushd (PUSHD) saw over 5,000 new users register for its presale in just five days. This represents a growing confidence in the world's first decentralized online marketplace.\n\nKey features like the absence of KYC verification and its associated delays continue to make Pushd (PUSHD) stand out, on top of its lower fees and faster transactions. It also has a unique rewards program, allowing users and investors to benefit in many ways, including for completing milestones. Coins can also be swapped quickly and with no extra cost, a feature unique to Pushd (PUSHD)."

        "content": "SEC Implicitly Recognizes Ether as Commodity, Paving Way for ETF\n\nAn Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF is due to reach the U.S. market after a slew of Bitcoin (BTC) based equivalents are likely greenlighted next week, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nDuring a private webinar with CryptoQuant on Thursday, the analyst argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quietly recognized ETH as a commodity rather than a security, placing it in the same regulatory category as BTC.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs,\u201d noted Seyffart, referring to the mass approval of funds from VanEck, ProShares, Bitwise, and Valkyrie in August.\n\nSponsors were inspired to apply at the time after witnessing the SEC approve the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June. This signalled to the market that regulators might now be willing to list crypto products with a higher risk profile, like Ethereum futures.\n\n\u201cSo again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures,\u201d explained Seyffart.\n\nThe distinction is important: commodities and securities face different regulatory, tax, and reporting requirements, with greater burdens arguable attached to the latter.\n\nThe Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \u2013 the SEC\u2019s sibling market regulator \u2013 has long considered both BTC and ETH to be commodities.\n\nBy contrast, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has long kept a tight lip regarding ETH\u2019s classification, dodging interviewers when probed on the matter.\n\nThat said, the agency excluded mentioning ETH in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last year, which named dozens of other top cryptos including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) as securities.\n\nLikelihood Of ETF Approval\n\n\n\nThe SEC has also offered few explicit details about whether it will approve or deny Bitcoin spot ETF applications its received from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others, only noting that it\u2019s making a \u201cfresh evaluation\u201d of such proposals after losing its court case with Grayscale in August.\n\nGiven rising engagement and discussion with applicants in recent months, analysts like Seyffart assign a 90% likelihood to ETFs being approved early next week. Ethereum ETFs aren\u2019t quite so guaranteed yet, but the SEC will have a hard time denying them. He added:"
