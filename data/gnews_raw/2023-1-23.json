        "content": "Crypto may be in a slump right now, but there's a silver lining.\n\nOne of the best ways to make a lot of money in the stock market is to buy during the low points, then simply wait for your investments to recover. By investing in the right places, you could see lucrative returns during the next upswing.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.13%) is currently down around 68% from its peak in late 2021, which could make right now a fantastic opportunity to buy the dip. But could it make you a millionaire this year? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWill Ethereum recover in 2023?\n\nThe short answer: Nobody knows for certain. Crypto is still a speculative investment, so there are no guarantees that this industry will even exist years or decades from now.\n\nThat said, Ethereum remains one of the strongest players in the field. It's the second most popular crypto behind Bitcoin, and with a market cap of around $202 billion, Ethereum makes up a significant portion of the $1 trillion crypto sector as a whole.\n\nEthereum also has a few distinct advantages that could help it succeed over time:\n\nSmart contracts: A smart contract is a self-executing contract that's built on a blockchain, and they have the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries -- particularly when it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nA smart contract is a self-executing contract that's built on a blockchain, and they have the potential to revolutionize a variety of industries -- particularly when it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi).

While NFTs aren't as popular as they were in recent years, they still have niche followings. The metaverse: Ethereum is also one of the most popular blockchains for metaverse projects.

Major applications like and -- which are leading the way in expanding the metaverse -- are built on Ethereum's blockchain. Other cryptocurrencies: Finally, Ethereum also hosts other cryptocurrencies on its network, including big names like Shiba Inu and Polygon. If the next breakout star is hosted on its blockchain, Ethereum will benefit from it.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum is well-diversified within the crypto world. If any areas of crypto thrive -- whether it's NFTs, DeFi, the metaverse, or some other cryptocurrency -- Ethereum may be poised for serious growth.\n\nHow much can you earn with Ethereum?\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, there's no way to know precisely how Ethereum will perform throughout 2023. Its price could continue to fall throughout the year, or it could rebound significantly.\n\nIt's wise, then, to keep a long-term outlook when investing in crypto. The short term could be rough, especially if we haven't seen the worst of this downturn yet. But Ethereum has faced worse in the past. And if history shows us anything, it's that riding out the storm can be incredibly profitable.\n\nFor example, back in 2018, Ethereum's price fell by a staggering 94% throughout the year. But if you invested at its lowest point, you would have earned returns of roughly 657% over the following two years alone. Within three years, nearly 4,500%.\n\nEthereum Price data by YCharts\n\nIn other words, if you had invested $1,000 in Ethereum at the end of 2018, you'd have nearly $46,000 by the end of 2021.\n\nOf course, 2020 and 2021 were exceptional years for crypto, and there are no guarantees we'll ever see short-term growth like that again. But with all of Ethereum's potential, many experts have high hopes for its long-term returns.\n\nThere are risks to consider, too, such as the speculative nature of the crypto market and Ethereum's constant struggle with slow transaction times and high gas fees. Before you buy, make sure you're willing to take on a high-risk investment, and consider whether the potential rewards outweigh those risks.\n\nDespite its drawbacks, though, Ethereum still has plenty of long-term potential. While it may not make you a millionaire in the coming months, by staying invested for the long haul, it could potentially be a lucrative investment."

        "title": "Explained: How Ethereum\u2019s token burns are making it a deflationary cryptocurrency - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Multiple crypto projects in the market oscillate between being inflationary and deflationary in nature. Ethereum, the biggest altcoin in the market has recently gained the status of being a deflationary cryptocurrency, thanks to its recent burning rate.\n\nBut before we delve deeper into the subject, let us give you a quick understanding of when an asset becomes deflationary.\n\nWhy do cryptos become deflationary?\n\nThe terms inflationary and deflationary stem from an asset's supply and demand. It is important to note that the majority of crypto assets can be inflationary in nature. This directly relates to the supply of circulating tokens in the market. The more tokens are out there in circulation, the higher the chances of the crypto being affected by inflation.\n\nSeveral crypto assets come with a limited supply, such as Bitcoin (21 million) or BNB (200,000,000) while many other projects come with an infinite supply of coins. Some examples of the latter are Solana, Dogecoin, and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a crypto asset can be deflationary despite having a limited or unlimited supply. In the case of coins with an infinite supply, there needs to be a burning mechanism in which a certain number of tokens are \u2018burnt\u2019 (destroyed) or they are moved away from circulation in a separate wallet that cannot be accessed. Therefore, the tokens which are burnt are rendered useless.\n\nHowever, burning is an essential component since it creates a balance between supply and demand, which in turn helps determine the prices of these tokens. If demand exceeds supply, the prices will likely go up and vice versa.\n\nBitcoin, Shiba Inu, or BNB are some good examples of deflationary tokens. Now Ethereum too is hailed as a deflationary crypto asset. So, what caused this transition?\n\nHow did Ethereum transition to a deflationary crypto asset?\n\nThe reason Ethereum is now considered a deflationary cryptocurrency is that the number of ETH tokens that are entering into circulation is less than the number of tokens that are being burnt on a regular basis.\n\nEthereum launched the EIP-1559 protocol back in August 2021, where EIP stands for Ethereum Investment Protocol. The protocol entails that with every transaction conducted on the Ethereum blockchain, a fraction of the transaction fee or gas fees will be burnt.\n\nEver since the launch of the EIP-1559, almost 2.8 million ETH worth $4.6 billion (at present prices) has been burnt so far and removed from circulation in the process. Currently, an estimated ETH burn rate is 1.62 ETH per minute, as per reports. This has rendered Ethereum to be more deflationary than even Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to becoming a deflationary asset cannot be credited only to its burning rate. The previous year, Ethereum switched from being a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. This was a massive game changer for Ethereum and was popularly termed the Ethereum Merge.\n\nPoS is a more efficient mechanism that allows users to stake their ETH in return for yields. This transition from PoW to PoS has attracted numerous investors. As per Etherscan, more than $24 billion worth of ETH is deposited on the Beacon Deposit Contract, which is a smart contract at the core of the new transition.\n\nIt has been witnessed that the NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) activities conducted on the Ethereum blockchain have resulted in the maximum burning of ETH over the previous week alone (almost 8,000 ETH).\n\nIn Conclusion: Is this good news for the ETH community?\n\nExperts indicate that the massive burning rate of Ethereum has positively affected the coin's economy. After a disastrous previous year, ETH prices this year have gone up significantly.\n\nExperts believe that if Ethereum can continue its burning rate and maintain a lower circulation supply than the number of tokens burnt, ETH prices will likely continue to go up, which can be great news for long-term investors. At the time of writing, ETH was trading hands at $1,633.22, gaining 0.40 percent over the previous day.\n\nAlso Read: Top 5 crypto presales to watch out for this month"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether, has turned deflationary. Again.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the latest shift is a combination of factors, according to Blockworks Research analysts, previous reporting and crypto data providers. Among them:\n\nNFT trading volumes picking up steam since the start of 2023 after a period of depressed activity. The result has been rising gas fees, which power transactions on the Ethereum network. That increase, in turn, has triggered \u201csubsequent base fee burn\u201d for traders, Blockworks Research analysts said. (Base fees set a floor for gas and are burnt, or removed from circulation, to control the availability of ether on the market.)\n\nLingering effects from the Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. A Blockworks Research report said the move was \u201cundeniable\u201d in terms of \u201cthe impact [proof-of-stake] has had on Ethereum\u2019s supply.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s pending Shanghai upgrade, which is set to allow stakers that validate the blockchain\u2019s transactions to withdraw their locked-up ether for the first time.\n\nRamped-up volatility in terms of trading ether, which has an impact on the native token\u2019s overall supply. And bullish headwinds to start the year for bitcoin, ether and additional cryptoassets.\n\nEther (ETH) was trading around $1,600 as of Tuesday afternoon in New York, holding relatively flat on the day. That\u2019s significantly up from the start of the year, when ether was trading in the $1,200 range.\n\nThe cryptoasset \u2014 which has typically been inflationary \u2014 took a deflationary turn in November 2022 for the first time since the Merge. It previously had become deflationary in November 2021 and has flip-flopped at least three times this month.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe total ETH burn in the next cycle will be at least as great as the previous cycle,\u201d said Dan Smith, a senior analyst with Blockworks Research.\n\nEthereum has about 18 times more TVL (total value locked) than most layer-2 blockchains, according to Smith, which are \u201cbarely even [layer-2s] in their current state.\u201d Ether now has a peak burn rate of -2.8% compared to its last bull run, he said, based on an analysis of on-chain data from Oct. 26, 2022 to Jan. 24, 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: The effect of Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecurity budget\u201d on its inflation status\n\nNFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur have burned more than 6,500 ETH over the past month, contributing significantly to the inflation versus deflation narrative, per Blockworks Research.\n\nAdded Smith: \u201cWhile layer-2s showed continued innovation and adoption in 2022, they lack decentralization in their current state.\u201d\n\nDecentralizing elements such as sequencers or provers will come later in 2023 or 2024, developers say.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The new testnet appears to have been created in order to test the conditions needed for Ether (ETH) staking withdrawals, which are currently disabled but are intended to become enabled in the update.\n\nWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing\n\n\n\nIt started out with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes,. \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 23, 2023\n\nThe name of the testnet is \u201cWithdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1.\u201d According to Web3 node provider Alchemy, a \u201cshadow fork\u201d is a fork of the mainnet that is intended to be used only for testing purposes.\n\nVan Der Wijden stated that he and another developer named \u201cPotuz\u201d will create malicious nodes that will send bad blocks and messages to other nodes on the testnet and try to convince them to join a false version of the network. For now, the network is running smoothly, but Van Der Wijden has stated that he wants to \u201csee if Potuz and I can break it.\u201d This is apparently being done to see if the upgrade can prevent malicious attacks or if further changes need to be made before it is implemented on mainnet.\n\nRelated: Metamask provides liquid staking solutions from Lido and Rocket Pool\n\nThe launch of this testnet comes after devs have expressed an increasing urgency to make Ether staking withdrawals a reality. On Jan. 6, they held a meeting during which they agreed to exclude the proposed EVM Object Format (EOF) from the Shanghai upgrade. EOF was intended to make Ethereum easier to upgrade in the future. But because of its complexity, the devs decided to leave it out of Shanghai for fear that it would delay withdrawal implementation.\n\nOver 14.5 million ETH (over $23 billion worth, at time of writing) has been deposited into the Ethereum staking contract and cannot currently be withdrawn, according to a December report by Nansen. In November, Ethereum devs came under harsh criticism for allegedly moving the goalpost in regards to enabling withdrawals.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is currently scheduled to be implemented sometime in March."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a \"stealth address system\" to improve transactional privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. In a research blog, Buterin wrote that privacy is \"one of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem.\"\n\nThe stealth address system is based on a mechanism that would allow any Ethereum wallet to generate cryptographically obfuscated public addresses called \"stealth addresses'' in order to receive funds in a private manner and access them using a special code called a \"spending key.\"\n\nButerin described that stealth addresses give the same privacy properties as someone generating a fresh address for each transaction. These proposed stealth addresses are a way to increase privacy on Ethereum by creating unique, anonymous addresses for each transaction.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nEach time someone makes a transaction, they can generate a new stealth address so that it is difficult for anyone to track the transactions or determine who is sending and receiving assets. This means that each user's transactional history can remain private. Buterin also suggested using ZK-SNARKs, shorthand for zero-knowledge proofs, to boost the privacy of the system and make it difficult to link the stealth addresses.\n\nOn Ethereum, transactions are public by default, which can pose a privacy concern. There are ways to attain transactional privacy on the network, such as using cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash. However, such methods can raise regulatory issues. This was seen with Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for potentially illicit activities."

It was then that he co-founded and started writing articles for Bitcoin magazine. He began traveling to speak with BTC developers around the world in a bid to construct a new, potentially superior iteration of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn late 2013, Buterin described the idea of yet another digital currency in a white paper and sent it to a few of his friends. The vision was to develop a blockchain with a built-in programming language and platform for decentralized applications, an \u201candroid of the cryptocurrency world\u201d of sorts.\n\nSubsequently, Ethereum was officially announced on Bitcointalk on January 23rd, 2014. It has been exactly nine years since then.

Buterin\u2019s commentary, titled \u201cWelcome to the New Beginning, noted,\n\n\u201cEthereum is a modular, stateful, Turing-complete contract scripting system married to a blockchain and developed with a philosophy of simplicity, universal accessibility, and generalization. Our goal is to provide a platform for decentralized applications \u2013 an android of the cryptocurrency world, where all efforts can share a common set of APIs, trustless interactions, and no compromises.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining his brainchild, Buterin then called for the community to join the new ecosystem as volunteers, developers, investors, and evangelists. The focus was to enable a \u201cfundamentally different paradigm for the internet and the relationships it provides.\u201d\n\nChallenging the Idea of \u2018Bitcoin Dominance Maximalism\u2019\n\nThe same year, Buterin challenged the Bitcoin Dominance Maximalism, a school of thought that is still very much relevant in the crypto ecosystem. His treatise essentially separated people who simply want to improve Bitcoin from those who can be called \u201cBitcoin domination maximalists,\u201d often categorized as aggressive, hostile, and toxic.\n\nThis was the first time he questioned the ideology. Since then, Ethereum itself has become the most consistent and high-profile target of criticism by the proud \u201cBitcoin Maximalist.\u201d Despite the differences in culture and workings, Ethereum has still managed to retain its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, almost a decade after its existence, even as most prominent altcoins faded away."

        "title": "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin describes his vision for stealth addresses - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has put forward a general approach to stealth addresses, as seen on his personal blog on Jan. 20.\n\nStealth addresses, as described by Buterin, circumvent the fact that public blockchains like Ethereum reveal a significant amount of transaction data.\n\nStealth addresses essentially conceal the recipient of certain transactions. Stealth addresses also reproduce the benefits of a standard privacy practice that some crypto users adhere to: creating a new address for every transaction received from a new sender.\n\nButerin noted that, despite their privacy benefits, stealth addresses do not provide any way to pay transaction fees. To resolve this, he suggested two approaches. The first approach involves ZK-SNARKS and would be expensive; the second approach involves specialized transaction aggregators and seems to be his preferred solution.\n\nButerin further noted that stealth addresses make it more difficult to create social recovery wallets \u2014 that is, wallets that can be recovered by third parties if the main holder loses their private key. Though Buterin proposed certain solutions, he said that developers could \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and recognize that recovering a wallet is costly and expensive.\n\nButerin also distinguished stealth addresses from Tornado Cash. He said that although Tornado Cash can obscure transactions involving ETH and major ERC-20 tokens, it is not useful in obscuring transactions involving NFTs and minor ERC-20 tokens. He added that Tornado Cash is most practical for self-directed coin mixing.\n\nButerin has discussed stealth addresses in the past. In March 2020, he suggested a stealth address scheme compatible with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). In August 2022, he suggested a stealth address scheme compatible with ERC-721 NFTs.\n\nButerin did not say when or if Ethereum will add stealth addresses. However, he said that stealth addresses \u201ccan be implemented fairly quickly today\u201d and would provide significant privacy benefits to users. He added that wallets should introduce native privacy features, such as automatic address generation, in the absence of stealth addresses.\n\nAt least one existing Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP-5564, puts forward a standardized way to create stealth addresses on Ethereum. However, the status of that proposal suggests that it is likely to change in the future.\n\nVarious blockchains, including Zcash and Monero, already use stealth addresses. Lesser-known projects such as Verge also include the feature.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $5,000 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Once upon a time, what historians call November 2021, Ethereum (ETH 0.28%) was worth more than $4,890 per digital coin. Then a bitter crypto winter set in, driving Ethereum prices all the way down to $896 last summer.\n\nToday, the roller-coaster ride stands at the $1,633 station. Can the largest and oldest blockchain platform for smart contracts reach new all-time highs of $5,000 or more in 2023?\n\nThe short answer is, \"maybe.\" The most honest answer I can give you is, \"probably not; ask again next year.\"\n\nTo see the long answer, and my recommendations for Ethereum investors, keep reading.\n\nThe final destination\n\nI expect cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to disrupt economic systems around the world. The next generation of banking, money transfers, insurance, and asset management will look radically different. Go-betweens are dropping out of the equation, transactions will be faster and more automated, fees are going lower, and I'm just scratching the surface of what a decentralized financial system will look like.\n\nEthereum is one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrencies on the market, with a larger group of app developers and projects than its younger rivals. It is also under active development, as seen in last summer's Merge and an ambitious long-term road map. So as the crypto market evolves, Ethereum should stay in the vanguard.\n\nGiven this potentially spectacular future, Ethereum should gain a lot of value over time. And $5,000 should be an early stop on a long ride up. Growth investing superstar Cathie Wood of Ark Invest fame expected Ethereum to reach \"triple-digit\" prices before 2030. That prediction may sound outdated since she published it nearly one year ago, but Wood has also doubled down on her long-term faith in Ethereum more recently.\n\nSpeed bumps in the road ahead\n\nHowever, those promising targets are pointing a few years into the future. Ethereum looks like a robust long-term investment, but I can't guarantee that it will make you a fortune in 2023.\n\nDecentralized finance is in its infancy, with as many stumbles as success stories. The Ethereum 2.0 development is incomplete after The Merge, leaving many crucial technology improvements for future platform upgrades. In addition, investors and consumers need time to rebuild their general trust in cryptocurrencies after multiple cash-burning scandals in 2022. And we are still waiting for sectorwide catalysts such as a firm regulatory system for crypto trading and ownership or large-scale involvement by banks and institutional investors.\n\nThe $5,000 price target is more than triple Ethereum's current price. Meeting it this year is a tall order, requiring many uncertain events to work out in Ethereum's favor -- and quickly.\n\nSo Ethereum may very well double in price this year, and maybe even triple. Crypto winters melting into a new spring can have that effect. At the same time, the gains can also take years to develop and Ethereum's price might dip again along the way.\n\nHow to invest in Ethereum this year\n\nIn other words, it's not a good idea to bet the literal farm on Ethereum right now. Building your holdings more patiently makes far more sense, allowing you to take advantage of the current price dip, as well as the potential potholes of the future.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is really not different from buying stocks. Get-rich-quick schemes rarely work out in your favor, while patiently building your portfolio for the long haul is the real secret to lasting wealth.\n\nTherefore, I recommend picking up some Ethereum coins (or fractions of coins) in several buys across 2023. If it reaches that tantalizing $5,000 level, you'll celebrate getting in early enough to triple some of your first investments. And if the price chart dips again, your celebration will be just as heartfelt when Ethereum zooms past $5,000 to Cathie Wood's triple-digit targets in a few years.\n\nIt's just a matter of time and patience. Life in Wall Street's fast lane can be slow sometimes."

        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) rallied 16% between Jan. 14 and Jan. 21, peaking at $1,680 before facing a 5.4% rejection. Curiously, the same resistance level resulted in a substantial correction in late August and again in early on Nov. 2.\n\nEther/USD price index, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nFrom one side, traders are relieved that Ether is trading up 35.5% year-to-date, but the repeated corrections that follow retests of the $1,680 resistance may have weakened investors' sentiment.\n\nNegative newsflow might have limited Ether investors\u2019 appetite after troubled cryptocurrency company Digital Currency Group (DCG) faced more legal issues this week. On Jan. 23, a group of Genesis Capital creditors filed a lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws. In addition, the plaintiffs allege the lending firm made false and misleading statements as part of a scheme to defraud potential and existing digital asset lenders.\n\nAnother new concern for Ether holders came on Jan. 22, after a \u201ctemperature check\u201d proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 protocol to BNB Chain received overwhelming support from the Uniswap community. Some 80% of Uniswap\u2019s UNI governance tokenholders have voted to deploy the additional version of the decentralized exchange protocol.\n\nOn the bright side, Ethereum developers have created a testing environment for the upcoming Shanghai network upgrade. According to Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden, the testnet appears to have been created to evaluate staking withdrawals, which are currently disabled on the mainnet. Over 14.5 million ETH (worth $23 billion) has been deposited into the Ethereum staking contract, and harsh criticism followed the multiple delays in enabling withdrawals.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the $1,680 price rejection has impacted crypto investor sentiment.\n\nETH futures finally enter the neutral area\n\nRetail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Meanwhile, professional traders prefer these instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates in a perpetual futures contract.\n\nThe three-month futures annualized premium should trade between 4% to 8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. When the futures trade at a discount versus regular spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from leverage buyers and this is a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe above chart shows that derivatives traders are no longer bearish because the Ether futures premium reached the 4% threshold for neutral markets. So, bulls can celebrate that the indicator shifted to a modest premium, but that does not mean traders expect the immediate result of positive price action.\n\nFor this reason, traders should analyze Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers are pricing the odds of future price movements.\n\nOptions traders are comfortable with downside risk\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 10%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew indicator below -10%, meaning the bearish put options are discounted.\n\nEther 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nRelated: Why is crypto pumping? Watch The Market Report live\n\nThe delta skew has stabilized near 0% in the past week, signaling that Ether options traders are presenting a neutral sentiment. That is a stark contrast from the end of 2022 when the 25% skew index hovered near 18% \u2014 indicating a lack of comfort in taking downside risks.\n\nUltimately, both options and futures markets point to pro traders moving out of the neutral-to-bearish sentiment to a neutral positioning, meaning there is no discomfort after the rejection at $1,680 and subsequent correction.\n\nConsequently, the odds favor Ether bulls because the negative newsflow could not prevent the 35.5% year-to-date gains and the demand for shorts using futures contracts remains thin.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared a possible solution to what he describes as the \u201clargest remaining challenge\u201d for Ethereum \u2014 privacy.\n\nIn a blog post on Jan. 20, Buterin acknowledged the need to come up with a privacy solution because by default, all information that goes onto a \u201cpublic blockchain\u201d is public too.\n\nHe then arrived at the concept of \u201cstealth addresses\u201d \u2014 which he said can potentially anonymize peer-to-peer transactions, nonfungible token (NFT) transfers, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) registrations, protecting users.\n\nAn incomplete guide to stealth addresses:https://t.co/21Q18BrD30 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2023\n\nIn the blog post, Buterin explained how on-chain transactions can be carried out between two parties with anonymity.\n\nFirstly, a user looking to receive assets will generate and keep a \u201cspending key\u201d that is then used to generate a stealth meta-address.\n\nThis address \u2014 which can be registered on ENS \u2014 is then passed onto the sender who can perform a cryptographic computation on the meta-address to generate a stealth address, which belongs to the receiver.\n\nThe sender can then transfer assets to the receiver\u2019s stealth address in addition to publishing a temporary key to confirm that the stealth address belongs to the receiver.\n\nThe effect of this is that a new stealth address is generated for each new transaction.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s stick figure diagram of how a stealth address system may work. Source: Vitalik\u2019s website\n\nButerin noted that a \u201cDiffie-Hellman key exchange\u201d in addition to a \u201ckey blinding mechanism\u201d would need to be implemented to ensure that the link between the stealth address and the user\u2019s meta-address can' be seen publicly.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder added that ZK-SNARKs \u2014 a cryptographic-proof technology with built-in privacy features \u2014 could transfer funds to pay transaction fees.\n\nHowever Buterin emphasized that this may lead to problems of its own \u2014 at least for the short term \u2014 stating \u201cthis costs a lot of gas, an extra hundreds of thousands of gas just for a single transfer.\u201d\n\nRelated: Crypto privacy is in greater jeopardy than ever before \u2014 here's why\n\nStealth addresses have long been touted as a solution to address on-chain privacy issues, which have been worked on since as early as 2014. However very few solutions have been brought to market thus far.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t the first time Buterin has discussed the concept of stealth addresses in Ethereum.\n\nIn August, he dubbed stealth addresses as a \u201clow-tech approach\u201d for anonymously transferring ownership of ERC-721 tokens \u2014 otherwise known as NFTs.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder explained that the stealth address concept proposed offers privacy differently to that of the now U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)-sanctioned Tornado Cash:\n\n\u201dTornado Cash can hide transfers of mainstream fungible assets such as ETH or major ERC20s [...] but it\u2019s very weak at adding privacy to transfers of obscure ERC20s, and it cannot add privacy to NFT transfers at all.\u201d\n\nButerin offered some advice to Web3 projects that are developing a solution:\n\n\u201cBasic stealth addresses can be implemented fairly quickly today, and could be a significant boost to practical user privacy on Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do require some work on the wallet side to support them. That said, it is my view that wallets should start moving toward a more natively multi-address model [...] for other privacy-related reasons as well,\" he added.\n\nButerin suggested that stealth addresses may introduce \u201clonger-term usability concerns,\u201d such as social recovery issues. However, he is confident the problems can be properly addressed in time:\n\n\u201cIn the longer term, these problems can be solved, but the stealth address ecosystem of the long term is looking like one that would really heavily depend on zero-knowledge proofs,\u201d he explained."

But ever since he started busting myths about Ethereum and suggesting that Bitcoin was being left behind by smart contracts, scaling and NFTs, they\u2019ve liked him much less.\n\n(in case he deletes it)\n\ni'm enjoying this eric wall arc pic.twitter.com/Qd7lGrHW5j \u2014 Tony Link \u262f (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@chainlank) August 2, 2022\n\nAs you have no doubt gathered, Wall goes to great lengths to prove he is correct and once spent a month downloading an Ethereum node purely to bust the Bitcoiner myth that it took 8 terabytes of data to fully validate transactions.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely difficult, but it was possible, and it didn\u2019t take 8 terabytes of space on the hard drive.\u201d\n\nOne of the big reasons for the shift from maxi to mini (he\u2019s still a proponent of Bitcoin) is that Wall has been fascinated for years with building decentralized finance on an open and permissionless settlement layer. That was the essential subject of his thesis, and the need for decentralization to bring it about was only reinforced by seeing the limitations of permissioned blockchain platforms while working for Cinnober and Nasdaq. So, he was naturally drawn to the DeFi sector on Ethereum when it began to emerge in 2019.\n\nThat same year, it became clear that Ethereum and other blockchains could scale using zk-Rollups or optimistic fraud proofs, whereas Bitcoin had \u201calmost entirely abandoned\u201d the idea of doing anything with DeFi. So, he got behind DeFi on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThat made me fall out of favor with Bitcoin maximalists because I was their golden kid: the one that was supposed to slay the altcoins, not one that was supposed to say actually, there is a use case here though, and this system actually does scale, and it\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d\n\nEric Wall. Source: LinkedIn\n\n\u201cSo, then I had to change Bitcoiners\u2019 understanding of the Ethereum system because they were now the ones that were spreading false facts about how the system works.\u201d\n\nHe concedes his former Bitcoiner friends think he\u2019s become a \u201cshitcoiner for financial motives.\u201d But Wall also wants to scale Bitcoin, too, and is involved in a research project with StarkNet and the Human Rights Foundation to investigate how to apply zk-Rollup scaling to Bitcoin, pondering \u201cwhat the benefits of that would be and how feasible it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I am working on that, on trying to introduce that system and those technological benefits to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the Wall?\n\nWall was born in 1991 in the Swedish city of Link\u00f6ping and spent a gap year after high school traveling through Australia and Norway, working odd jobs from a deckhand on a luxury yacht to a \u201cchugger\u201d (charity mugger).\n\nHe studied computer engineering at Lund University, and his time there was notable for his organizational efforts as the \u201cfunmaker\u201d of \u201cSweden Silent Party,\u201d a series of silent disco events inspired by one the best nights of his life in Byron Bay. He also became one of the first Scandinavian engineers to write a Master\u2019s thesis about using blockchain to run a securities exchange in conjunction with local fintech Cinnober.\n\nEric Wall organized silent discos while at university. Source: Lund University\n\nHe was introduced to Bitcoin in his first year of university in 2011 by a classmate who showed him an article about darknet marketplace Silk Road. Buying Bitcoin at the time for $4 was a week-long process that required wiring money to Mt. Gox in Japan, so he gave up. A year later, Bitcoin had doubled to $8, and he thought he\u2019d \u201cmissed the boat.\u201d \u201cBut I became interested in this asset that increased 100% in one year\u201d and saw an opportunity to \u201cget an edge\u201d in a totally new asset class. He lost everything in Mt. Gox but gained a new career as a blockchain researcher and, later, blockchain lead at Cinnober.\n\nDuring his time there, and later at Nasdaq, he realized that companies or even countries weren\u2019t going to agree to create the sort of infrastructure required to build a genuinely decentralized, cross-jurisdictional system for the settlement of securities.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be something that the Chinese and the Japanese and the U.S. can use as a mutual system,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that was a gargantuan task. That\u2019s never going to happen from the inside. I understood that later. It has to be a system that comes from the outside and keeps growing.\u201d The only likely candidates were Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHe told his bosses to put a hold on the enterprise blockchain stuff and to instead sell their incredibly fast matching engine tech to the big crypto exchanges. His colleagues thought crypto was a game or a joke \u2014 until Bitstamp turned up in a private jet.\n\n\u201cEven big stock exchange teams didn\u2019t spend that kind of money on a meeting with Cinnober,\u201d he says. \u201cThen they actually did take it seriously, and we did deliver a solution to them.\u201d\n\nMedia crypto commentator\n\nDuring this time, he also became the Swedish media\u2019s go-to guy for crypto commentary. He was determined to seize the opportunity but hated the stressful, anxiety-inducing process of appearing on live TV, so he\u2019d load up on valium to get through it.\n\n\u201cThen everything was fine. It didn\u2019t matter like getting a big camera in my face. I was completely zoned out,\u201d he says.\n\nEric sometimes adopts the persona of the slightly nicer Erica Wall online. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cBut because I was so into crypto, I was doing crypto 17 hours a day. Even in that state, I could still articulate and explain everything about Bitcoin and what was going on even if I was only half conscious.\u201d\n\nIt was a similar story at crypto conferences, where Wall\u2019s ingrained Swedish standoffishness made the hundreds of brief interactions he had as a well-known figure quite stressful.\n\n\u201cFor them, they only get, like, five seconds with me on an escalator, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to remember me for years. So, I always feel like I want to deliver on that interaction. Which makes me feel a lot of pressure.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s stopped taking meds these days after realizing he was meeting the same people multiple times at conferences and forgetting them.\n\n\u201cI have realized that now, at this point, like, I\u2019m gonna just be natural. I think I feel comfortable. I\u2019ve overcome my Swedishness eventually.\u201d\n\nNasdaq takeover\n\nCinnober was eventually taken over by Nasdaq in early 2019 for $190 million, and Wall found himself in a massive bureaucratic organization with little agency and lots of rules.\n\n\u201cAfter Nasdaq acquired, they told us, well, \u2018The great thing about Nasdaq is you\u2019re never gonna have more than six bosses above\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a very flat organization,\u201d he says with dry humor. \u201cEvery tweet that I wrote had to go through the Nasdaq approval department.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Wall was fighting with multiple token projects online about their hyped claims. \u201cI thought that I was doing something very important,\u201d he explains. One notable conflict, still running today, was with the Iota founders after he argued in a 2017 Medium post saying the protocol does not provide any censorship resistance and is centralized around the Iota foundation\u2019s coordinator node.\n\nThis guy bet me 1 BTC that IOTA would disable the Coordinator in 2018 based on a technology I had debunked in detail how it was fraudulent (it was admitted years later and the CTO was fired and the project completely redesigned)\u2014yet he is upset me with *me* for wasting his time. https://t.co/MufJ6E0b0U \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) November 25, 2022\n\nUnfortunately, Iota was also being considered by the Swedish Central Bank to help create a central bank digital currency, so Wall\u2019s online antics were not considered politically helpful.\n\n\u201cPeople were lying about what their technology could do, and you still had to treat them as respected industry participants, which I wasn\u2019t going to do. So, I didn\u2019t ask for permission from Nasdaq to tweet, and it ended up with us going our separate ways.\u201d\n\nArcane Assets\n\nWall then decided the best way to participate in the blockchain revolution was to participate in the economy, \u201cSo, I changed strategy and became a hedge fund manager,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the leap from engineer to trader, and Wall tried and abandoned a variety of approaches. Initially, he learned technical analysis, using rules-based trading around indicators like Bollinger Bands and moving average convergence/divergence. But after writing an algorithm to backtest the rules, he realized they performed no better than random chance. Similarly, he thinks most charts and models are ludicrous, which is why he constantly jokes about the superiority of the Rainbow Chart (\u201chas emoji\u201d).\n\n1/15 Today, I'm comparing the two currently most popular bitcoin price models: Rainbow chart vs S2F!\n\n\n\nRainbow chart:\n\n\u2705 Tried & tested log regression (2014)\n\n\u2705 Never changed\n\n\u2705 Has emoji \ud83c\udf08\n\n\n\nS2F:\n\n\u274c New & complex (2019)\n\n\u274c Changes often\n\n\u274c Sounds like a sex position\n\n\n\nA thread \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/1Td6pZXPM4 \u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) April 15, 2020\n\nThen he moved on to investigating the technological fundamentals of projects to guide investment decisions, only to see his returns totally dwarfed by people who invested based on what the logo looked like. He\u2019s since settled on a new approach to trading: Work out what unsophisticated investors will buy in the future and buy it first.\n\n\u201cThe price is driven by just social factors. Basically, there\u2019s no fundamentals,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen I go out and I write some articles about a particular technology component in some cryptocurrency that undermines the whole value proposition, that\u2019s a completely different thought process than the investment process. The investment process is just about, well, are people going to buy it?\u201d\n\nBut having to explain to his serious hedge fund bosses that he was buying tokens because he thought the masses would buy any old token with a dog on it, was tricky.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the things that I didn\u2019t like so much. These are regulated, traditional \u2018we run a pretty posh hedge fund that took capital from institutional level investors\u2019 and they don\u2019t want to hear: \u2018Well, people like the dog picture.\u2019 But that\u2019s how the market works.\u201d\n\nHe recalls investigating whether investing based on the viral growth of crypto hashtags on TikTok could be a path to riches, but the fund wouldn\u2019t give the strategy the go-ahead. Instead, Arcane insisted he invest based on rules and a checklist \u201cto make it an institutional-grade crypto fund that avoided all the bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cProblem is if you avoid all the bullshit, you avoid most of the profit.\u201d\n\nSo, again, Wall found himself chafing at the requirements of working for a big organization.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m like a degen in my blood. I think that the cryptocurrency space moves extremely fast, and you have to be as nimble as the space is. If the market one day says \u2018Okay, but screw all the technology \u2014 we\u2019re trading pictures of monkeys now,\u2019 you have to make the decision extremely fast that monkeys is what it is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, if I\u2019m going to do something else, now it\u2019s going to be somewhere where the mandate is completely open.\u201d\n\nHe handed in his resignation in the first quarter of 2022 to work on a super-secret project that he\u2019s yet to reveal even a year on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now in the process of doing something else that hasn\u2019t been announced yet,\u201d is all he\u2019ll reveal."

        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) rally versus Bitcoin (BTC) is not only showing signs of exhaustion but is also in danger of breaking below a key technical support level.\n\nETH slides vs. BTC in the second half of January\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair declined nearly 9.25% on Jan. 24 from its local top of 0.0779 BTC established on Jan. 11. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has been slightly outpacing Ether in terms of United States dollars, rising 38% versus 35%, respectively.\n\nETH/BTC daily candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, Ether\u2019s pullback versus Bitcoin has landed its price at the bottom of its EMA ribbon range, as shown below.\n\nETH/BTC weekly candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe EMA ribbon indicator shows numerous exponential moving averages of increasing timeframe on the same price chart. Dropping below the ribbon range increases an asset\u2019s likelihood of seeing an extended down-move.\n\nIn other words, breaking lower would increase its possibility of declining by more than 20% from its current price levels.\n\nConversely, rising above the ribbon range raises the asset\u2019s chances of a broader rally.\n\nEther\u2019s price capped by key descending trendline\n\nThis week, ETH/BTC dropped to the 55-week exponential moving average (the red wave) \u2014 a bottom wave \u2014 of its EMA ribbon indicator, as shown below. Buyers took control near the 55-week EMA, prompting Ether to recover a mere 0.35% versus Bitcoin to 0.0708 BTC on Jan. 24.\n\nRelated: This $25K BTC price target would spell misery for Bitcoin shorters\n\nBut now, the likelihood of retesting the EMA ribbon bottom is high due to a multi-month descending trendline resistance (black trendline in the chart below), where sellers have been more active as of late.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart focusing on descending trendline resistance. Source: TradingView\n\nTherefore, one cannot rule out the possibility of ETH/BTC breaking below the EMA ribbon range, similar to how the pair did in May 2022 in the wake of the Terra collapse.\n\nBack then, Ether fell by over 25% versus Bitcoin to 0.0490, a level coinciding with its 200-week EMA (the blue wave).\n\nTherefore, if a similar breakdown occurs in the coming weeks, the ETH/BTC pair may test the 200-week EMA near 0.0550 BTC as its primary downside target, or roughly a 20% price drop from current levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "A \u201ctemperature check\u201d proposal to deploy the Uniswap v3 protocol to BNB Chain received overwhelming support from the Uniswap community on its governance forum.\n\n80% of voters holding Uniswap\u2019s UNI (UNI) governance token have voted in favor of deploying the third version of the decentralized exchange protocol on BNB Chain, a rival of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn a proposal posted on Jan. 17, Ilia Maksimenka, CEO of the decentralized finance protocol Plasma Finance, argued why the Uniswap v3 protocol should be deployed to BNB Chain, writing:\n\n\u201cWe believe this is the right moment for Uniswap to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).\u201d\n\nAfter the discussion on the governance forum, the Uniswap community conducted a \u201ctemperature check\u201d poll to see if the community approved of the idea. Eighty percent of the votes were in favor of the deployment, while the remaining 20% voted against it.\n\nBlockchain software firm ConsenSys supported the move. According to Cameron O\u2019Donnell, DAO governance strategist at ConsenSys, the firm views the brand of the protocol as \u201cstandalone and not beholden to any particular chain\u201d despite centralization concerns. O\u2019Donnell explained:\n\n\u201cRegardless of personal views, Uniswap entering the BSC market will provide current and future users with a secure and established medium for decentralized exchange.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the ConsenSys executive also said that the firm believes that it\u2019s important for Uniswap to be \u201cchain agnostic\u201d to better serve all users within the Web3 space.\n\nFollowing the approval of the governance proposal, the Plasma Finance team estimates that the deployment of the necessary smart contracts to BNB Chain may take around five to seven weeks.\n\nRelated: BMW taps Coinweb and BNB chain for blockchain loyalty program\n\nOn Dec. 22, BNB Chain surpassed the Ethereum network in the number of unique addresses. BSC Scan data showed that the blockchain had 233 million addresses compared with the 217 million unique addresses on Ethereum. However, while the chain claims to be \u201cthe largest layer 1 blockchain,\u201d the numbers are far from the Bitcoin network\u2019s 1 billion unique addresses.\n\nUpdate: A part of the article has been updated to reflect that the proposal in question is to check the community's interest in using BNB Chain for v3 protocol deployment, which is the first of three votes required to pass a governance proposal."

        "content": "Morgan Creek Capital CIO Mark Yusko says Avalanche (AVAX) has the potential to go on a massive surge and outperform the rest of the crypto market in the next cycle.\n\nIn a new interview with Paul Barron, the crypto veteran says the smart contract platform could skyrocket 50x in the next bull market cycle, as long as Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall digital asset market succeed.\n\n\u201cThe key to investing in this ecosystem is diversification. Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. You want to have a big chunk in Bitcoin, fine. But if you think about it, if Bitcoin is as successful as we all think it will be, it won\u2019t be the best performing, full stop. Just because it\u2019s the largest. It\u2019s just the law of large numbers. You\u2019re not going to go from $400 billion today \u2013 even if you go to $4 trillion, that\u2019s a 10 bagger. Ethereum at almost $200 billion \u2013 if it gets to a $4 trillion that\u2019s almost twice as much.\n\nBut if Avalanche actually becomes that intermediate layer, or becomes a bridge to connect Ethereum\u2026 it could be maybe 50x.\u201d\n\nAvalanche is changing hands at $18.02 at time of writing, a more than 68% increase from where it was at the start of the year. With a market cap of $5.7 billion, Avalanche is the 17th largest crypto asset.\n\nYusko also makes an analogy between the potential future infrastructure of crypto, and the internet\u2019s infrastructure, such as the Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and World Wide Web (WWW).\n\nThe comparison is one reason he thinks these blockchain projects will survive the volatile markets and have an important utility in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cI can argue that on top of Web3 is\u2026 Bitcoin is the base layer, Filecoin is FTP, Ethereum is WWW and Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche are SMTP, HTTP, I don\u2019t know which ones.

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based gaming altcoin surged this weekend ahead of a large token unlocking event, defying conventional trading wisdom.\n\nAxie Infinity (AXS) rallied from trading around $9.20 on Saturday to a high of $13.84 on Sunday, a more than 50% increase.\n\nAXS, the 41st-ranked crypto asset by market cap, has since partially retraced and is trading at $12.18 at time of writing.\n\nThe price jump happened in advance of a roughly 4.8 million AXS token unlocking event that happened on Monday, according to the tokenomics data website TokenUnlocks. The unlocking event represented 1.812% of the asset\u2019s total supply and was worth more than $60 million at current prices.\n\nThe recent price action of AXS flies in the face of conventional wisdom about token unlocks, which give investors opportunities to sell digital assets after vesting periods expire. Traditionally, token unlocks are viewed as bearish catalysts.\n\nAxie Infinity\u2019s next token-unlocking event will occur on April 17th. The unlock will represent 1.45% of the asset\u2019s total supply (worth nearly $50 million at time of writing), according to TokenUnlocks.\n\nAXS is up more than 100% since the start of 2023 when it was trading around $6.00. Despite its price surge this month, the token still remains over 92% down from its all-time high of $164.90, which it hit in November 2021.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) has been making new highs despite the fact that bulls are taking a moment to recover their breath following an incredible run. This gradual movement appears to be laying the stage for a slight pullback, but depending on the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and how it behaves, things might very well alter dramatically.\n\nEther Shows Confidence\n\nAccording to the most recent data obtained, the total value of all cryptocurrencies has increased by 0.31%, reaching $1.05 trillion. And, at the time of writing, the overall trading activity has also witnessed an increase of 6.96% to $53.53 billion. The price of Ethereum, on the other hand, recently breached the macro downward trendline. The consensus among market watchers is that a significant amount of buying confidence might be generated for a new uptrend in Ethereum (ETH) prices if the altcoin king is successful in overcoming the lower high of $1,700.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, in the world of cryptocurrencies, fundamental analysis also plays a vital role apart from the technical aspects. With the total ETH staked on the Beacon Chain reaching over 16 million ahead of the Shanghai upgrade; which is almost 13.4% of the total circulating supply, Ethereum price may set off another run-up. A move along these lines will not change the bearish divergence, but it will enable market makers to collect the buy-stop liquidity that is currently lying above $1,679 and catch the early bears in their trap. And while this chase for liquidity is going on, the price of Ethereum might reach as high as $2,000.\n\nRead More: Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Surge\n\nAdditionally, as pointed out by macro and Bitcoin expert tedtalksmacro, the USD stablecoin has significantly increased in the past 24 hours. Recording almost a $320 million growth in supply, it acts as a potential indicator of higher buying demand by retailers and whales in the crypto market.\n\nUSD stablecoin uptick in the past ~24hrs Approximately $320M increase in supply, steady lads. pic.twitter.com/YVbMLIi2vy \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) January 23, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, the price threshold of $2,000 isn\u2019t the only thing holding Ethereum back from continuing its ascent. A bullish perspective for the short term, even if it is running on fumes, is warranted if the price of Ethereum does decide to go higher. If Bitcoin bulls can make a strong return, this perspective will shift significantly. In such a scenario, there is a chance that ETH will keep climbing higher and possibly breach the coveted $3,000 mark. As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,634. This represents a decrease of 0.44% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 5.24% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.\n\nAlso Read: DOGE Fan Elon Musk Announces New Feature For Twitter"

        "title": "Where in the World is Ethereum? - This Morning On Chain",
        "content": "We broke down where the bulk of Ethereum nodes are run, and the amount of centralization is pretty surprising.\n\nThe Ethereum network is obviously distributed across the globe, and anyone holding 32 ETH is capable of running a node and contributing to the network. Even if you don\u2019t have 32 ETH, you can stake on managed nodes, using exchange hosted nodes (Coinbase for example) or projects like Rocketpool. However, there has been concern about Ethereum\u2019s concentration.\n\nEthereum nodes are really top heavy when it comes to distribution by country. The US is nearly half the network. Given that, I can kind of understand why the DOJ felt like they could sanction crypto mixers like Tornado Cash. Here\u2019s the breakdown by country:\n\nEthereum Node Percentage by Country:\n\nUnited States (46.7%)\n\nGermany (11.9%)\n\nSingapore (4.5%)\n\nUnited Kingdom (3.7%)\n\nJapan (2.9%)\n\nIf you\u2019re going to run your own node, you\u2019re going to want some threshold of tech skills and operational management. The easiest way for most people to do this is through a cloud provider, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Essentially you pay AWS to run the machine and keep it online, then you can log on and do whatever you want within that machine. Using a service like AWS means you don\u2019t have to worry about your computer going down, so your node will always be active. Prior to services like this, you would have to manually restart your service if something happened, meaning you\u2019d lose yield.\n\nGiven how easy and reliable running a node on these cloud providers has become, it\u2019s the go-to option. That means most of the Ethereum nodes are not just concentrated by country\u2013they\u2019re concentrated by data center. Here\u2019s where the hosting of these nodes come from:\n\nEthereum Node Percentage by Network Type:\n\nHosting\u2013Mostly Cloud Provider (64%)\n\nOf this, 62% is AWS\n\nResidential\u2013People\u2019s Homes (33.1%)\n\nBusiness (2%)\n\nThe crazy thing about this distribution is how concentrated nodes are within countries due to major cloud hosting services using their own large data centers. In the United States, 45% of all nodes are in Ashburn, Virginia. A town of 46,349 people hosts nearly half of all the Ethereum nodes in the country because that is where Amazon\u2019s primary East coast datacenter lives.\n\nUltimately, I think the risk around Ethereum centralization is overstated. We have to balance the level of centralization with the rate of progress we want to make, and I\u2019m not concerned about the scale Ethereum is at. But decentralization junkies do have a point, a single disaster could take out 45% of the Ethereum nodes in an instant."

        "content": "BR\u00d8K, the Norwegian government project to track unlisted stock ownership, moved into the sandbox phase earlier this month. What\u2019s a little different compared to other solutions is it plans to use a public blockchain. Specifically, it is using Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum with lower transaction costs.\n\nMany countries around the world have corporate registries where you can look up information on companies of any size, including unlisted ones. These often have some stockholder data, but it\u2019s usually up to a year old. For up-to-date details, one needs to contact the company. Norway\u2019s corporate registry, which keeps records on 380,000 companies, is no different.\n\nHence the concept of creating a blockchain system to track the change of ownership of any private stock and get a current view of the \u2018cap table\u2019 \u2013 who owns stock, how much they own and when they bought it.\n\nAnother benefit of using a blockchain is immutability. Because companies only share snapshots of stock ownership irregularly, there\u2019s scope to manipulate the cap table, although it\u2019s not a particularly common fraud. In fact, the most likely victim is the government if there are share transfer taxes and there\u2019s a desire to shift the timing. Unsurprisingly the tax agency is a participant in the ecosystem.\n\nThere are benefits to the company as well. The most obvious one is they only have to log stock transactions rather than manage the cap table. It makes it easier to sell stock with less due diligence on the cap table itself. That\u2019s because the buyer and seller have to agree to blockchain transactions, providing some level of third party validity. Additionally, stock can be used as security for a loan, and the charge over the stock will also be logged on the blockchain.\n\nThe solution provides a good foundation for the coming wave of tokenization as stocks are stored using the ERC1400 Ethereum security token standard.\n\nThe project has been in the works for some time with the developer Blockchangers posting code for a solution three years ago, which has moved on since then. Now it is making the software development kit (SDK) available.\n\nBR\u00d8K combines blockchain, an open database and custom software. The solution is GDPR compliant, so personal information is not stored directly on the blockchain. However, it uses the Ceramic protocol for the personal information, an open distributed database that allows for data to be deleted and corrected, as required by GDPR.\n\nThis might be one of the first times a government is using blockchain for cap tables, but it\u2019s far from being the first cap table solution. One of the first for private securities was Swiss firm daura, a joint venture between BDO, BEKB, SIX, Swisscom and Sygnum. Another Swiss example is Aequitec. In the U.S., Figure Technologies has developed a cap table solution using its Provenance public blockchain."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former lead of Ark Invest's crypto department, Chris Burniske, believes Solana and Ethereum can be used as more than trading and investment instruments but also as risk indicators. Here's how.\n\nCrypto risk spectrum\n\nAccording to the analyst, the SOL/ETH trading pair can be used as a key indicator of the crypto risk spectrum or, simply put, a tool to evaluate the risk tolerance of cryptocurrency investors on the market. Considering that both Solana and Ethereum are historically far more volatile than Bitcoin, using them to determine if the current risk level on the market is beneficial.\n\n$SOLETH has become a key indicator of crypto risk-spectrum appetite for me, alongside the OG of $ETHBTC. \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) January 24, 2023\n\nHowever, Solana and Ethereum are not only assets that can be used as risk indicators. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is a reflection of risk tolerance among investors. Digital assets are extremely volatile and sometimes illiquid, which makes crypto investors extremely vulnerable to double-digit swings, especially if margin trading is in effect. Those who expose themselves to such instruments are considered risk tolerant from the standpoint of a traditional investor.\n\n\"Doesn't look like it wants to stop\"\n\nAccording to Burniske, it seems like ETH to SOL does not look like it will be retracing any time soon, suggesting that appetite for risk is going to move upward only, instead of going down. However, considering cryptocurrency' s market dependency from stocks and traditional markets in general, Solana or Ethereum should not be considered as market-moving assets or indicators.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the cryptocurrency market had an enormous and explosive rally that led to numerous breakthroughs and helped assets to reach important resistance levels that, if broken, will most likely lead to long-term reversals and the beginning of a prolonged new bull market."

        "content": "CRV extends gains amid increased whale activity.\n\nETH whales contribute to the demand for CRV despite being heavily overbought.\n\nCurve Finance\u2019s native token CRV just jumped to the top of the list of most traded crypto tokens among ETH whales. This outcome may pave the way for the next major price move for CRV given its current position.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 CRVs worth today?\n\nAccording to WhaleStats, CRV managed to surpass Shiba Inu to become the most traded token by ETH whales. Why is this important? Well, ETH whale activity often underscores strong demand, in which case investors can expect more upside.\n\nThere is also a chance that the observed ETH whale activity may also represent incoming sell pressure but is that the case? CRV\u2019s supply distribution reveals that the top addresses have been buying in the last three days.\n\nThis suggests that CRV continued to enjoy strong demand during the weekend. In addition, the supply held by top addresses metric confirms that whales have continued to accumulate CRV. This may suggest that the observed surge in ETH whale transactions pertaining to the CRV token may reflect buying pressure.\n\nAre whales shielding CRV from the bears?\n\nCRV\u2019s price action has continued to extend its upside despite being deeply overbought. It managed a 7.40% upside in the last 24 hours at press time, reflecting strong demand. This allowed it to extend its rally above the 200-day moving average.\n\nCRV traded at a 120% premium from its lowest price level at the end of December 2022. This makes it one of the top gainers among the major cryptocurrencies. However, CRV\u2019s deeply overbought nature may encourage some selling pressure.\n\nBoth the MVRV ratio and the mean coin age are currently in the upper monthly range. This means CRV holders are deep in profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the CRV Profit Calculator\n\nThis outcome is contrary to the expectations of a pullback. A potential reason for this is that investors, especially whales, are more focused on long-term gains.\n\nIf the recent rally is the start of the next bull run, then the upside seen so far might just be the start of more recovery ahead. This might explain why whales are currently not in a rush to secure short-term profits.\n\nNote that all this is speculative based on what we have seen so far. There are still some risks that may trigger a retracement and perhaps an erosion of the latest gains. Nevertheless, whales continue to demonstrate confidence in the market, and this may continue to favor the upside."

On-chain specialists assume that funds are moving to staking contracts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, funds on the ICO wallet started moving back in October. The wallet that has been dormant for six years moved almost 50,000 ETH to staking, worth approximately $80 million.\n\nWe noticed that an ETH ICO participant who has been dormant for 6 years started to stake 48,992 $ETH ($80M) in October this year.\n\n\n\nThe ICO participant received 120K $ETH at Genesis via 3 addresses.\n\n\n\nAnd transferred 32,015 $ETH($53M) to a new address 5 hrs ago. (stake again? ) pic.twitter.com/huO4PVBpUB \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 22, 2023\n\nLater on, the wallet received 120,000 ETH at Genesis with three addresses, making it one of the biggest entities on the whole network that are not related to cryptocurrency exchange. However, shortly after, the whale decided to move $53 million worth of funds received from Genesis to a new address \u2014 5 hours ago.\n\nWhy do dormant addresses matter?\n\nWhile it may seem like the movement of funds on whales' addresses is not important, the general tendencies we can highlight from their actions is what really matters. A large number of noteworthy Ethereum addresses has been actively moving funds to staking addresses, which is a signal in and of itself.\n\nEthereum's staking contract temporarily locks the funds of investors until the staking period is over, practically removing a significant amount of ETH out of market circulation. In addition to burning operations, a large percentage of the staked Ethereum supply may act as a bullish factor for Ethereum, considering the fact that some percentage of the supply does not hit the market.\n\nAs whales like one we discovered move funds to staking, we should expect far less selling pressure on the market in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, Ethereum staking is a double-edged sword: when funds get unlocked, investors should brace themselves for a rapid spike in ETH sales and abnormally high volatility."

        "content": "The FBI announced Monday it has concluded that North Korean hacker organization Lazarus Group was behind the $100 million hack of Harmony Protocol last June.\n\nOver $60 million of ETH stolen during the heist was laundered on January 13, six months after the fact. That allowed the law enforcement agency to confidently identify the Lazarus Group and APT38\u2014another North Korean cyber group\u2014as the architects of the crime.\n\nThe hackers used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, in an attempt to obscure their transactions. Even so, a portion of the funds were then frozen and recovered by exchanges when the hackers attempted to swap them for Bitcoin. Unrecovered funds were subsequently sent to 11 Ethereum addresses.\n\nThe FBI and its investigative partners will \"continue to identify and disrupt North Korea\u2019s theft and laundering of virtual currency, which is used to support North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and Weapons of Mass Destruction programs,\" according to the announcement.\n\nUS Treasury Connects North Korean Hackers to $622M Axie Infinity Exploit\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of June\u2019s Harmony hack, blockchain analysts tied the exploit to Lazarus Group using a combination of on-chain sleuthing and comparisons to previous hacks committed by the group. While the American government has been previously vocal about the threat posed by Lazarus Group, however, it did not formally accuse the entity of responsibility for the Harmony hack until today.\n\nThe hack targeted a cross-chain bridge connecting Harmony, a layer-1 blockchain, to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Binance Chain. The strategy echoes previous attacks linked to Lazarus Group, including a massive $622 million hack last April of Ronin Network, an Ethereum sidechain used by play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity.\n\nSince 2017, North Korean hacker groups including Lazarus Group and APT38 have stolen an estimated $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency, according to an Associated Press report.\n\n\"The FBI will continue to expose and combat the DPRK\u2019s use of illicit activities\u2014including cybercrime and virtual currency theft\u2014to generate revenue for the regime,\" the announcement read.\n\nStory continues\n\nBiggest Crypto Exploits and Hacks of 2022\n\nNorth Korea-affiliated cyber groups have also reportedly expanded their activities beyond hacks. In late December, a report argued that the Lazarus Group is also pretending to be venture capitalists, potential employers, and banks.\n\n\"Intrusions begin with a large number of spearphishing messages sent to employees of cryptocurrency companies\u2014often working in system administration or software development/IT operations (DevOps)\u2014on a variety of communication platforms,\" according to a federal cybersecurity alert issued last April. \"The messages often mimic a recruitment effort and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency applications.\"\n\nIn response to these crypto-focused attacks, the American government has targeted coin-mixing services: tools that allow users to obfuscate the otherwise public trails of cryptocurrency transactions. In August, the Treasury Department banned Ethereum coin mixer Tornado Cash and numerous wallet addresses associated with the service, citing its use by Lazarus Group to launder funds from previous hacks as justification for the action.\n\nThe move was widely decried in the crypto community as an illegal overreach that unnecessarily threatened user privacy. An ongoing lawsuit helmed by crypto policy nonprofit Coin Center is challenging the ban."

        "content": "The whales on Curve Finance have requested for more gauges to be added to Ethereum.\n\nCRV was significantly overbought at press time and might be due for a price correction.\n\nFollowing a request from whale addresses on its platform, Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Curve Finance has put forward a proposal to add more gauges to its liquidity pools on Ethereum.\n\nAfter seeing how well v2 pools work with different tokens given enough liquidity, there was a request from whales for more gauges on Ethereum. Adding one per several weeks, we start that batch with MATIC/ETH \u2013 up for a vote now!https://t.co/LAnrvFSNJh \u2014 Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) January 22, 2023\n\nThe gauge system on Curve Finance measures the liquidity of a particular pool or set of pools on the platform. The gauges are used to determine a given pool\u2019s stability fee (or interest rate), with pools with lower gauges having a higher stability fee. With gauges on Curve Finance, liquidity is distributed evenly among its pools.\n\nRead Curve Finance\u2019s [CRV] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to Curve Finance, the request for adding more gauges to the Ethereum Network was due to the success of its V2 pools made up of different tokens with sufficient liquidity. These gauges will be added by adding one gauge per several weeks, starting with the MATIC/ETH, Curve Finance said.\n\nAdding more gauges to the Ethereum network on the Curve Finance platform will expand the number of pools available for users, providing more options for exchanging various assets.\n\nAs of this writing, all 22 votes cast were in favor of adding more gauges.\n\nCRV amongst the top gainers\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the Curve DAO Token [CRV] saw a 20.89% increase in value over the past week, making it one of the top five cryptocurrencies with the highest gains during this period. As of this writing, the altcoin traded at $1.08, having seen a 7% price jump in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs the overall cryptocurrency market has been showing positive sentiment since the start of the year, the number of unique addresses trading CRV tokens has increased since 1 January.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant rise in demand for the token as the daily number of new CRV addresses created has increased by 103%.\n\nWith increased CRV accumulation since the year started, the alt was overbought at press time. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 84.60 Its Money Flow Index (MFI) was spotted at its highest position ever, 100.\n\nAt these significantly overbought highs, a price correction is common. Buyers typically find it challenging to support any further price rally at these highs, and the bears often return to the market to initiate a price drawdown.\n\nA look at the alt\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) confirmed this. At press time, CRV\u2019s CMF was spotted in a downtrend, although still above the center line.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the CRV Profit Calculator\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s CMF is trending downward while the price of the asset is increasing, it can indicate that the asset\u2019s price is rising on weak buying pressure. It means that the asset is being bought by a smaller number of investors or that the buying pressure needs to be stronger to support the price increase.\n\nThis typically suggests that the asset is overbought and that a price correction is more than likely to occur."

        "content": "Privacy tools have always been heralded as a key to financial freedom in the crypto industry. In the Ethereum ecosystem, discussions surrounding the subject matter have revolved mostly around privacy-preserving transfers of ETH and mainstream ERC20 tokens.\n\nIn a bid to improve the state of privacy on the network, its co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a stealth address system.\n\n\u201cLast Remaining Challenge for Ethereum\u201d\n\nThe concept of Stealth addresses using elliptic curve cryptography was first introduced in the context of Bitcoin by BTC core developer Peter Todd in 2014 to obscure transaction details. In the latest blog post, Buterin acknowledged that privacy is \u201cone of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem\u201d while highlighting the need for a privacy solution because \u201canything that goes onto a public blockchain is public.\u201d\n\nStealth addresses, on the other hand, can help in this regard. Buterin noted that such a mechanism in place will enable the Ethereum wallet to generate stealth addresses to receive funds privately and access them using a special code called a \u201cspending key.\u201d\n\nThe proposed stealth addresses can be generated by either party, but they can only be controlled by one of them. The user receiving the assets generates the stealth address and keeps secret a spending key, which will then be used to generate a stealth meta-address that can be passed on to the sender.\n\nThis allows the sender to perform a computation on this meta-address to initiate a stealth address belonging to the receiver. The sender can then send any assets they want to send to this address, while the receiver will have full control. Along with the transfer, the sender publishes some extra cryptographic data on-chain confirming that the stealth address belongs to the receiver.\n\nButerin asserted that stealth addresses give the same privacy properties as a user generating a fresh address for each transaction.\n\nStealth Address Vs. Tornado Cash\n\nSeveral methods have been employed in recent years to obfuscate transactional details. This includes Tornado Cash which was recently sanctioned by the OFAC. Buterin, for one, said the proposed concept of stealth address provides a different kind of privacy to that of the popular Ethereum-based coin mixer. He explained,\n\n\u201cTornado Cash can hide transfers of mainstream fungible assets such as ETH or major ERC20s (though it\u2019s most easily useful for privately sending to yourself), but it\u2019s very weak at adding privacy to transfers of obscure ERC20s, and it cannot add privacy to NFT transfers at all.\u201d"

        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain, which is touted as the most commercialised distributed ledger network in the world, is up for more updates that will calibrate it for better uses in the future. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has stated that \u2018privacy' is the \u2018last remaining challenge' for the blockchain, which will be finetuned in the coming days. Buterin has named \u2018stealth addresses' as a potential solution that could safeguard all the information that is saved on the public blockchain.\n\nEthereum is a public blockchain that processes transactions of billions of dollars. Anybody can view transaction histories of the Ethereum blockchain on Etherscan, which is a block explorer and analytics platform.\n\n\u201cBy default, anything that goes onto a public blockchain is public. Using the entire suite of Ethereum applications involves making a significant portion of your life public for anyone to see and analyse,\u201d Buterin wrote in a blog post while highlighting that \u2018stealth addresses' could increase the privacy quotient on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat Are Stealth Addresses\n\nThese addresses, which are registered on Ethereum Name Services (ENS), can add anonymity to the peer-to-peer transactions of digital assets.\n\nUsing stealth addresses would maintain transactional records on Ethereum while also keeping the privacy between the transacting parties intact on the public blockchain.\n\n\u201cSuppose that Alice wants to send Bob an asset. When Bob receives the asset, he does not want the entire world to know that it was he who got it. Hiding the fact that a transfer happened is impossible. A stealth address is an address that can be generated by either Alice or Bob, but which can only be controlled by Bob. Alice can then send any assets she wants to send to this address, and Bob will have full control over them,\u201d Buterin explained in a blog post.\n\nAn incomplete guide to stealth addresses:https://t.co/21Q18BrD30 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2023\n\nAs for now, it remains unclear when Ethereum developers would open the stealth address feature on a mass level for the blockchain. Buterin has, however warned that executing stealth addresses could spike up the gas fees for each transfer.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain successfully completed the transition from its energy-intensive PoW mining model to the energy-efficient PoS model last year. The name of the revamped and green Ethereum is the \u2018Merge'.\n\nIn March 2023, Ethereum will be implementing the Shanghai update to its network, which would allow people who staked Ether tokens to validate the blockchain withdraw their tokens. It is estimated that $22.38 billion (roughly Rs. 1,82,520 crore) worth of Ether tokens are currently staked on the blockchain.\n\nAffiliate links may be automatically generated - see our ethics statement for details."

        "content": "The FBI is pinning the blame for a $100 million cryptocurrency heist last June on the Lazarus Group, a team associated with the North Korean government that is notorious for stealing cryptocurrency to help support that country\u2019s military and weapons programs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FBI released a statement identifying Lazarus Group, also known as APT38, as the culprit for the June 24 attack on the Harmony Horizon bridge that resulted in the loss of $100 million in Ethereum. The Harmony Horizon bridge is a connection between various cryptocurrency systems, specifically Harmony and Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Binance Chain. In June, attackers were able to gain access to the bridge and make off with the Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe Harmony team has identified a theft occurring this morning on the Horizon bridge amounting to approx. $100MM. We have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds,\u201d Harmony said at the time of the incident.\n\nThe FBI, along with the Department of Justice\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, and various United States attorney\u2019s offices has been investigating the Harmony heist and on Tuesday said that the Lazarus Group was responsible for the attack and had used its malware tool known as TraderTraitor as part of the operation.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, January 13, 2023, North Korean cyber actors used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, to launder over $60 million worth of ethereum (ETH) stolen during the June 2022 heist. A portion of this stolen ethereum was subsequently sent to several virtual asset service providers and converted to bitcoin (BTC),\u201d the FBI said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, January 13, 2023, North Korean cyber actors used RAILGUN, a privacy protocol, to launder over $60 million worth of ethereum (ETH) stolen during the June 2022 heist.\"\n\nThe Lazarus Group has been operating for many years and is closely associated with the government of North Korea and typically operates in support of the government\u2019s interests. The group\u2019s best-known operation was an attack on the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 that netted it $81 million and Lazarus has continued to target banks and crypto exchanges in the ensuing years.\n\nTraderTraitor is actually a group of tools that Lazarus Group uses in many of its intrusions at cryptocurrency firms, exchanges, and other targets. Those operations often start with the attackers sending phishing emails to employees at a target firm, trying to entice them into downloading a file that includes the malware.\n\n\u201cThe messages often mimic a recruitment effort and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency applications, which the U.S. government refers to as \u2018TraderTraitor\u2019,\u201d CISA said in an advisory in April.\n\n\u201cThe term TraderTraitor describes a series of malicious applications written using cross-platform JavaScript code with the Node.js runtime environment using the Electron framework. The malicious applications are derived from a variety of open-source projects and purport to be cryptocurrency trading or price prediction tools. TraderTraitor campaigns feature websites with modern design advertising the alleged features of the applications.\u201d\n\nThe Lazarus Group has used TraderTraitor in a number of intrusions and has found quite a bit of success with it. They also have used other tools, including an older macOS backdoor called AppleJeus.\n\n\u201cThe Lazarus Group used AppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency applications targeting individuals and companies\u2014including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services companies\u2014through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. These actors will likely continue exploiting vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency technology firms, gaming companies, and exchanges to generate and launder funds to support the North Korean regime,\u201d the CISA advisory says.\n\nThe FBI said it worked with some of the exchanges to which the Lazarus Group moved the Bitcoin from the Harmony intrusion to freeze those assets."

However, very few solutions have reached the market thus far.\n\nHe described stealth addresses as a \u201clow-tech approach\u201d for anonymously transferring ownership of ERC-721 tokens, also known as NFTs, in August.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The most massive Ethereum whales are actively stockpiling Shiba Inu, a dogecoin rival.\n\nThe enormous Ethereum whale has collected over $228 million in SHIB and is currently holding more than 18 trillion tokens, according to blockchain tracking firm WhaleStats.\n\nBy eliminating the ETH portion, the whale, whose identity is still unknown, has given SHIB 75% of his total portfolio as of this writing.\n\nMore details: The meme coin has a strong start to the year and is presently trading at $0.00001209, up roughly 50% year to date. As the ecosystem prepares for the introduction of Shibarium, the proposed layer-2 solution that intends to provide scalability among other aspects, price movement and whale buildup is taking place.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), the token intended to be used for gas on Shibarium, has also experienced rallies. At the time of this writing, BONE is selling for $1.40, up 60% on the year.\n\nA meme coin is a word used in the digital market space as an asset referred to well-liked currencies that have ardent online supporters and traders and are occasionally portrayed with humorous or animated memes. Meme coins may be entertaining, but they are also extremely hazardous investments that may or may not have any real value.\n\nThis group includes currencies like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and others that may be more entertaining than practical. Understanding the dangers is essential while purchasing or trading meme coins so that you can steer clear of unforeseen volatility and losses.\n\nThe whales: According to CoinMarketCap, the aforementioned whale holds the sixth-largest stake in SHIB, accounting for 1.88% of the coin\u2019s total supply.\n\nIn addition, the wealthy investor\u2019s wallet also has the decentralized oracle service Chainlink and the Polygon (MATIC) scalability solution for Ethereum (LINK).\n\nData from WhaleStats revealed that additional Ethereum whales are aggressively allocating to SHIB in a similar fashion. SHIB is currently the largest holding among the top 1,000 Ethereum whales, excluding stablecoins and ETH itself, according to a recent analysis from Whalestats.\n\nShibarium\u2019s release has been teased by Shiba Inu creators earlier this month, but no precise date has been announced. However, a sizable number of financial analysts describe meme coins as sophisticated pump-and-dump operations. Investors should be extremely cautious when entering these markets as a result of this claim and should be aware of meme currencies."

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Services Make Up 70% Of Staked ETH Supply - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Data shows more than 70% of the total staked Ethereum supply is contributed by staking services, with Lido accounting for the most amount.\n\nEthereum Staking Service Providers Have Locked In A Total Of 11.4 Million ETH\n\nLast year, ETH successfully completed a transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which meant that miners no longer had a role to play on the network as chain validators called \u201cstakers\u201d filled in their role.\n\nJust like miners, stakers earn rewards for acting as network nodes and handling transactions, but to become a staker, all an investor needs to do is lock in a collateral of 32 ETH into the Ethereum staking contract, and unlike what mining needs, the validator here doesn\u2019t require any significant computing power to carry out the task.\n\nBut as the 32 ETH requirement is a bit too high for the average investor (at the current exchange rate, a 32 ETH stack would be worth around $52,400), some companies have started providing staking pool services, where holders can generally deposit any amount of tokens and earn staking rewards on them. These services usually work by pooling together the coins locked in by the different users, so that the combined amount exceeds at least 32 ETH.\n\nAs per data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the total value locked into the Ethereum staking contract is now around 16.1 Million ETH in the overall network (that is, including all platforms as well as investors with self-custodial wallets). This is about 13.4% of the total circulating supply of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHere is a chart that shows how much of this ETH is coming from the different staking services in the market:\n\nLooks like Lido is the largest player in the market right now | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the total amount of Ethereum staked by all these services adds up to 11.4 million ETH, which is just under 71% of the entire staking supply. Lido alone contributes 4.7 million ETH, which is more than 29% of the total coming from these platforms.\n\nLido is a decentralized liquid staking pool, which is a type of platform that adds the investors\u2019 ETH to the staking pool and gives them another token in return that\u2019s backed 1:1 with their original position. This token provides liquidity to the users on their locked ETH, meaning that they can sell it whenever they like, or make use of it in other services (like derivative positions).\n\nCoinbase, Kraken, and Binance, the next three biggest providers in the sector, combined have locked in about 4.3 million ETH. Their individual dominances are 12.8% for Coinbase, 7.6% for Kraken, and 6.3% for Binance. Clearly, even their combined dominance at 26.6% is still lesser than Lido\u2019s on its own.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,600, up 6% in the last week.\n\nThe value of the crypto seems to have been moving sideways since the surge a few days ago | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Zoltan Tasi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com"
