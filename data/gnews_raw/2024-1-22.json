        "title": "Ether supply could be affected by Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, analyst says - The Block",
        "content": "The supply of ether could be impacted by the Ethereum ETH +1.25% network's upcoming Dencun upgrade, according to CoinShares Ethereum research associate Luke Nolan.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will enable Layer 2 transactions to be sent to the Ethereum network through blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism. This could result in reduced gas usage and, consequently, a lower amount of ether being burned.\n\nAll of the ether used to pay gas base fees for transactions is currently burned.\n\n\"Transactional calldata makes up 90% of the costs Layer 2s pay in terms of gas fees. But after the Dencun upgrade, instead of posting their data through calldata, Layer 2s can use the new blobspace mechanism, which has significantly lower gas costs. So, if we expect layer 2s to gradually shift to using this new blobspace mechanism, we could see gas prices settle at lower levels, which means less ether is burned,\" Nolan told The Block.\n\nImpact on the ether burn mechanism\n\nThe possible reduction in ether burned could have an impact on the growth of ether supply.\n\n\"Gas demand on the Ethereum network drives ether's deflation mechanism via gas burn which can reduce the circulating supply of ether. The Dencun upgrade could see gas prices settle at lower levels,\" Nolan added.\n\nHowever, the impact of the Dencun upgrade and the introduction of the blobspace mechanism could be mitigated by other factors. Nolan stressed that Layer 1 demand is what significantly drives deflation, and that \"even very high blob usage has a low impact on circulating supply.\"\n\n\"Even if we see this reduced gas price because layer 2s are using the blobspace, there is no real concern that Ethereum will become significantly inflationary. The point of the Dencun upgrade is to decrease gas fees for users transacting using roll-ups, and bring users back to the network because of lower transaction fees, so more activity means more gas usage overall,\" Nolan said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nNolan added that the end goal of the Dencun upgrade is to solidify Ethereum's market share, \u201cso secondary effects are a net positive over the long run, regardless of short-term gas fluctuation.\u201d\n\nDencun upgrade schedule\n\nThe Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17 and introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Of particular interest is EIP-4844, which enables the blobspace mechanism.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade on the Sepolia testnet is expected to be activated by Jan. 30, while the same upgrade on the Holesky testnet remains scheduled for activation on Feb. 7.\n\nAccording to Nolan, the mainnet activation of the Dencun upgrade could come as soon as March of this year. \"Ethereum core devs expect that at least one month after Holesky the mainnet activation of the Dencun upgrade will go live. So at least March, or likely after. It is hard to give an exact time, as testnet bugs appear and change timeline,\" Nolan said.\n\nThe price of ether has fallen by over 3% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2,377, according to The Block's Prices Page."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Slumped More Than 6% Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Megacap cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH 1.13%) has continued to sell off in today's session, now having given up most of its gains since the sector-driven mania following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum declined 6.1% over the past 24 hours, dropping below the $2,350 level. This move appears to be tied to a number of market-driven forces, but also some token-specific headwinds that investors are pricing in today.\n\nHere's what's behind today's big downside move in Ethereum.\n\nSignificant Ethereum selling pressure impacting this token\n\nWhen certain investors sell a given cryptocurrency or stock, investors pay attention. Accordingly, news that the Ethereum Foundation (the nonprofit doing much of the behind-the-scenes work to keep Ethereum up and running) sold more than $1.6 million worth of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency has sent shockwaves reverberating through the market.\n\nRecent reports show that this large sale, in which 700 Ether were sold, continues a trend of capital-raising from the Ethereum Foundation. A previous sale of 100 Ether tokens on Jan. 16 from the same wallet suggests that the ongoing development work may be more costly than initially thought, providing some downside selling pressure on this token.\n\nEthereum does have another upgrade on the go, with its so-called Dencun upgrade already underway as of last week. Thus, it's possible that these token sales could dry up as development activity slows, but it's a key factor in the supply/demand equation investors are digesting right now.\n\nAdditionally, concerns around capital flight from the crypto sector, evidenced by more than $2 billion of Bitcoin ETF outflows, has some concerned about the secondary impacts on Ethereum. So far, the excitement around these exchange-traded products hasn't stoked the kind of investment many initially thought would come. For future Ethereum ETFs, that's not great, and this sector-wide selling pressure will likely continue to flow through to the Ethereum ecosystem as well.\n\nWhat to make of today's move\n\nOccasionally, it's important to reflect on the cost impacts various development initiatives have on various blockchain networks and their associated tokens. Given Ethereum's aggressive upgrade schedule and top-tier talent in terms of the developers working diligently on ensuring this protocol's stability, these token sales may not be surprising. But it does appear some in the market have been caught off guard by the corresponding selling pressure and sentiment shift caused by these sales.\n\nThat said, it could also be true that these ongoing upgrades provide outsized value relative to their initial up-front costs. Crypto investors and users want to see an Ethereum network that's as low cost and efficient as possible. That's what this Dencun upgrade aims to achieve.\n\nAdditionally, some recent news around MetaMask launching an Ethereum validator staking feature could result in more locked-up Ethereum tokens, potentially offsetting some of the recent selling pressure we've seen from the Ethereum Foundation and others.\n\nThese effects likely won't offset the institutional capital flight we're seeing from the crypto sector. However, it's the longer-term supply-and-demand dynamics investors will need to consider when it comes to this top-tier crypto.\n\nThus, I think the jury remains out with respect to how Ethereum will perform as it continues its ongoing upgrades in the coming months. For now, sentiment has soured, but long-term investors may want to consider this dip as a potential buying opportunity, as traders look elsewhere to take on bullish positions."

If this support holds strong, there seems to be a clear path ahead with minimal resistance, offering the potential for upward movement.\n\n#Ethereum Market Update: $ETH is currently in a key demand zone, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460.

Ali states that if ETH fails to maintain this level, a pullback to the next significant support area of around $2,000 might occur.\n\nA trip to around $2,000 would mean a 17% drop from the current price of $2,408. The next major support below $2,000 is the daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) 200, which is currently at $1,923.\n\nA breach of this level could open the doors for more losses, possibly toward the $1,800 and $1,700 levels. Meanwhile, the daily SMA 50 level at $2,338 might seek to curtail losses in the immediate term.\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH sees a reversal from its current declines and bounces off the $2,388 and $2,460 support zones, it could resume its uptrend and target the $2,614 level again.\n\nA successful break above this level could pave the way for a rally toward the $2,717 and $2,900 levels, where the coin faces the next hurdles. The ultimate target for bulls is to reclaim the $3,000 psychological level last reached in April 2022."

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has sold more than 1,000 Ether (ETH) in the past several weeks, according to blockchain analytics company Arkham Intelligence, which has been tracking his ETH holdings for the past several months. It obtained the data through Trump's financial filings and disclosures.\n\nMost of the ETH comes from royalties for non-fungible token (NFT) projects that Trump created. In December 2022, Trump released a set of 45,000 NFTs, each priced at $99. The project has amassed trading volumes of over $35 million or 15,000 ETH.\n\nThe NFTs are largely trading above their original price of $99. As of Jan. 19, the cheapest NFT is listed for over $600 and the highest sale was for 37 ETH.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn early 2024, Trump announced another trading card NFT project that has some unique rewards for owners. Some of the potential perks could be dinner with the former president, or even a small piece of fabric from the suit he wore in his Georgia mugshot.\n\nHowever, Trump and his companies are not directly associated with these NFT projects. NFT International created and distributed the NFTs and uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nTrump sold 1,075 ETH for over $2.4 million through Coinbase.. At its peak, it was worth more than $4 million.\n\nThe sale comes after a strong month for Ethereum. The price was up more than 17% in the month leading up to the sale, 30% in the six months before and 60% over the past year.\n\nEven though Trump said during his presidency that he was \"not a fan\" of Bitcoin and that crypto is a \"disaster waiting to happen,\" it is hard to pass on several million dollars. Though Trump is largely unaffiliated with the project, he is still earning royalties. While his stance on crypto is still up in the air, the recent sale is an interesting development in Trump's relationship with crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, it will be important to watch for news relating to presidential candidates' stances on crypto, as this could have large implications for prices, future adoption and use cases going forward.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Donald Trump Sold $2.4 Million Ethereum: Smart Move Or Big Mistake? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

The last time the price dropped below this level was in May 2022, when Ether sank 63% and traded below $1,000.\n\nETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNotably, Ether slid below the demand zone earlier on Monday, Jan. 22, suggesting a major drawback in the making. The first major line of defense could emerge from the $2,000 level \u2013 embraced by the 200-day exponential moving average.\n\nEthereum network TVL rises while unique active wallets fall\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) is a metric commonly used to examine the health and demand of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem TVL reached a 19-month high on Jan. 11 of $34.7 billion before sharply declining to $32.2 billion on Jan. 22.\n\nEthereum TVL is down 3.1% over the last 7 days, signaling decreasing demand for the blockchain.\n\nEthereum TVL. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIn addition, nine of the top 10 Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) have witnessed a 7-day decline. Notably, Instadapp and Compound Finance saw a respective 11% and 9.6% decrease in their TVL.\n\nEthereum network DApps by TVL. Source: DefiLlama\n\nTo determine whether the decline in Ethereum\u2019s TVL correlates with a decline in its user base, it is important to monitor the utilization of DApps. Investors should note that certain DApps, such as gaming platforms and marketplaces, do not require substantial deposits.\n\nRelated: BTC price risks $40K breakdown as GBTC ETF steps up Bitcoin outflows\n\nThe number of active addresses using DApps is down, which is a point of concern. In the last 30 days, the main DApps on Ethereum had 22.65% fewer unique active wallets (UAW). This might reflect dissatisfaction with the cost of transacting on the network.\n\nEthereum data \u2013 summary. Source: DAppRadar\n\nEther traders have negative expectations\n\nMarket analysts are showing pessimistic perspectives in regard to Ether\u2019s shorter and medium-term price performance. While looking at technical price aspects of Ether\u2019s movement, independent analyst Limbo posted a chart showing the price of Ether below $2,400 suggesting that ETH is a short trade.\n\nOn the other hand, crypto blogger Market Profit highlighted the downward potential for Ethereum by pointing to bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nInvestors\u2019 appetite for Ethereum could continue to diminish if the downturn in the broader crypto market continues. The constant GBTC-linked selling of BTC at Coinbase could continue impacting the whole market, bringing crypto prices down.\n\nOn the upside, the eventual increase in the use of Ethereum-based protocols and the potential of a spot Ether ETF may prove to be a long-term catalyst for price growth.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Polymer Labs, a modular IBC-based networking protocol, has secured a $23 million Series A co-led by Blockchain Capital, Maven 11 and Distributed Global.\n\nOther investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Placeholder, Digital Currency Group, North Island Ventures and Figment Capital also participated in the round.\n\nPolymer can be described as a modular layer-2 network that employs Cosmos SDK\u2019s IBC protocol, OP stack\u2019s settlement functionality and Eigenlayer\u2019s data availability layer. It is the brainchild of Bo Du and Peter Kim.\n\nAfter being in the blockchain industry for a few years, the Polymer founders experienced firsthand how difficult it was to build interchain products. In the summer of 2021, they made a decision to drop their side projects and focus on fixing blockchain interoperability.\n\nRead more: The Interchain Foundation puts aside $26.4M to grow Cosmos ecosystem\n\nInitially, the team wanted to design their own interoperability protocol \u2014 similar to that of many general message-passing protocols that exist today. However, during their research, they came across the Cosmos SDK\u2019s Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, Du told Blockworks.\n\nIBC is an inter-blockchain communication protocol, as its name suggests. It allows different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate with each other. The protocol is designed to ensure that information can be securely transferred between separate operating chains.\n\nRead More: DeFi users \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 what chain apps are on\n\n\u201cIBC already had years put into its design and architecture, so we decided to stick with IBC and not invent a whole new standard,\u201d Du said.\n\nKim added that at the time, IBC was the most decentralized, elegant solution to establish connections and pass messages between chains.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe realized this was something that could be expanded to other chains; basically export the technology to have industry penetration rather than just the Cosmos app chains,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe team wanted to find ways to make the already established interoperability protocol on Cosmos a mainstream standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to integrate IBC natively into all these different chains, which is why we designed the virtual IBC protocol, which essentially allows chains that don\u2019t natively implement IBC to access IBC execution through Polymer and have Polymer execute IBC on its behalf,\u201d Du said.\n\nMany blockchain interoperability protocols today are focused on the state component of interoperability, which involves aligning the status of the data stored within separate systems, but Du believes this is just one part of the interoperability problem.\n\nRead more: Interoperability isn\u2019t just a buzzword\n\nBeyond the state layer, two other layers need to be considered. This includes the application layer \u2014 that is, the layer responsible for encoding and decoding sent data and the transportation layer (TAO) \u2014 which manages the routing of raw data.\n\n\u201cAll of IBC\u2019s core logic will live on the transportation layer; this becomes decoupled from the application layer, and Polymer will hold the IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d Du said.\n\nThis means that at the end of the day, the application \u2014 which lives on Ethereum \u2014 will be able to interact with the IBC network through Polymer smart contracts.\n\n\u201cPolymer will then take the apps intended actions and execute the associated IBC logic and produce a commitment to the IBC state of that chain on Polymer \u2014 so essentially, Polymer is maintaining this merkle-ized IBC state on behalf of the connected chain,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: 2023\u2019s top 5 DeFi protocols by revenue\n\nSimilar work to decouple state, application and transport layers is being explored by the interoperability protocol LayerZero.\n\nIBC has been around for a long period of time. Du notes that its specs cover various considerations ranging from authentication, timeouts and acknowledgment, somethings its competitors may not have.\n\nThis means that applications will not have to individually implement these different changes when there are protocol upgrades.\n\n\u201cIf you want to design a protocol that is going to last for generations of builders, you need to be able to handle these different edge cases properly,\u201d Du said. \u201cThis is a foundational level protocol.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Polymer Labs, Yuan Han Li and Joshua Rivera from Blockchain Capital, shared this sentiment.\n\nThey note in a press release reviewed by Blockworks that \u201cwhile numerous arbitrary messaging protocols have emerged to address the cross-chain interoperability, they have all done so by building a new messaging standard, paradoxically causing more fragmentation when a standardized and battle tested way to move data between heterogeneous blockchains already exists.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Polymer team is hoping to ensure that IBC becomes a widely adopted interoperability standard that will shape how blockchain applications of the future will communicate. This latest funding round will bring the team closer to launching mainnet.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum infrastructure company Nethermind recently resolved a critical bug in multiple versions of its execution client, which had prevented users from processing blocks on the ETH network.\n\nThe problem, primarily affecting Nethermind users, a minority client, has sparked discussions among Ethereum community members about the need for greater diversity in client usage, moving away from the predominantly used client, Geth.\n\nIn a Jan. 21 tweet, Nethermind\u2019s co-CTO, Daniel Cadela, confirmed that the consensus issue was present in versions 1.23 to 1.25 of their client. The hotfix update, version 1.25.2, was released within hours after users reported failure to process blocks.\n\nWe have the fix!\n\nPlease update to 1.25.2\n\nNo resync is needed.https://t.co/fV3MEdipVX\u2026\n\nVersions up to 1.22 don't have that bug, only 1.23-1.25 are affected. \u2014 DanielC (@_D4nie1_) January 21, 2024\n\nThe bug was first brought to light by a GitHub user, \u201cwga22\u201d, who reported their Nethermind execution client was no longer processing blocks. Although the bug impacted a minority of Ethereum nodes, it has reignited debates over the network\u2019s heavy reliance on the Geth client.\n\nYou might also like: MetaMask rolls out Validator Staking, opening path for user-run Ethereum nodes\n\nPresently, Geth is responsible for powering more than 84% of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer. In contrast, Nethermind holds a smaller market share of 8.2%. This disparity has led to concerns about the risks of centralization on a single client, with advocates for decentralization highlighting the importance of client diversity for network resilience.\n\n\u201cClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements,\u201d noted analyst Anthony Sassano in a tweet from last August, a time when the distribution between Geth and Nethermind was more evenly balanced.\n\nClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements pic.twitter.com/x4irTl2pr1 \u2014 sassal.eth/acc \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) August 6, 2023\n\nThe urgency of the hotfix release underscores that any client, regardless of its usage rate, is susceptible to bugs.\n\n\u201cNothing against Geth, but you\u2019re taking on disproportionate risk by running it,\u201d stated advocate \u2018marceaueth\u2019 in a Jan. 21 post on platform X.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/marceaueth/status/1749176026805010475\n\nA similar issue in the majority of Geth clients could pose significant threats to Ethereum. The push for execution client diversity has been particularly pertinent since Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake with the Merge. The Ethereum Foundation had previously urged stakers to switch from the predominant client to ensure a more evenly distributed upgrade process.\n\nThe recent issue with Nethermind\u2019s client illustrates the importance of maintaining a diverse range of clients to avoid systemic vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile decentralization advocates argue that Ethereum\u2019s heavy reliance on a single client like Geth is counter to its foundational principles, some critics believe the current level of client distribution is sufficient, noting that previous outages involving minority clients have been effectively managed.\n\nThe Nethermind episode serves as a reminder of the necessity for fault tolerance and redundancy in blockchain networks, especially those aiming for high-security standards.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Most Ethereum Staking Pools Are Using Just One Execution Client, Potentially Increasing Risks to the Network ... - Unchained",
        "content": "The Ethereum community\u2019s concerns about execution client diversity has intensified, as roughly 84% of all validators are running Go Ethereum.\n\nMost Ethereum staking pools use just one execution client: Go Ethereum (Geth). As a result, some Ethereum enthusiasts have publicly encouraged people to avoid using Geth for their validator duties because of the potential risks of over-relying on one client.\n\nMore than four-fifths of all validators, which are in charge of proposing and validating new blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, use execution client Geth, according to data provided by the crypto analytics website clientdiversity.org, which covers about 60% of the entire Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum clients are software implementations people can download to run the Ethereum network. In order to perform its duties, a single validator typically runs two clients simultaneously to address different components of Ethereum \u2014 the consensus side and the execution side.\n\nNethermind, the second-largest execution client for Ethereum running on about 8% of validators encountered a bug yesterday, Ethereum core developer \u0141ukasz Rozmej said on X. The bug, which has since been resolved, has sparked a conversation about a hypothetical bug impacting Geth.\n\nWhile the consensus side has seen its client diversity improve, execution client diversity on Ethereum is weak. Specifically, the following Ethereum staking pools and service platforms \u2014 per execution-diversity.info \u2014 likely use Geth as their only execution client for their validator duties: Allnodes, Ankr, Blox Staking, Binance, Bitcoin Suisse, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, and Stakefish.\n\nIn addition, Lido, the largest liquid staking platform with more than nine million ETH staked, has connected over three-quarters of its validators to Geth as well.\n\nA \u2018Supermajority Client\u2019\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, designed Ethereum to work on different software clients, not just one, so that a bug affecting a single client would not adversely impact the whole blockchain.\n\nHowever, Geth is considered a \u201csupermajority client.\u201d As such, validators that run Geth have the capability to finalize the Ethereum blockchain without agreement from validators running other software clients, such as Nethermind, Besu, and Erigon. This has the potential for disastrous results such as a network split, loss of funds, and reputational damage to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cShould Go-Ethereum, likely to be the majority execution client after the Merge, produce an invalid block, it could get finalized and thus cause the catastrophic failure described in scenario 3,\u201d wrote Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist in a 2022 blog post. Scenario three entails a hypothetical situation where a client with more than two-thirds of the stake has a bug in its software and includes an invalid block to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nValidators running a minority client would only lose a small amount of rewards for having a bug, while the cost of having a bug for validators running a supermajority client would be massive.\n\n\u201cCounterintuitively: staking with a minority client bears significantly less risk \u2013 those affected by the recent Nethermind bug hardly lost the rewards of one to two days. Being on the wrong side as part of a majority, however, can lead to significant loss of stake,\u201d wrote co-founder of Gnosis Chain Martin K\u00f6ppelmann on X on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Lefteris Karapetsas, the founder of portfolio tracker Rotkiapp, noted on X that \u201cIn case of a supermajority Ethereum client bug that leads to complete loss of the stake of those stakers at the moment this would burn > ~20% of the entire ETH supply.\u201d\n\nLido did not immediately reply to Unchained\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\n\nOn Monday night, Coinbase announced on X its goal of including an additional execution client in its validator infrastructure, after the Ethereum community expressed concerns about Coinbase\u2019s single client staking steup revolving around Geth.\n\nThe largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S. said it relied solely on Geth for validation because it was the only execution client that met the company\u2019s technical requirements. But Coinbase said it is open to change.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve evaluated execution clients since 2020, none have met Coinbase Cloud\u2019s requirements to date,\u201d wrote Coinbase on X. \u201cMany other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is currently assessing alternative execution clients, and said it would share their next steps by the end of February.\n\nUPDATE (January 23, 2:00 pm. ET): Updated with details of Coinbase\u2019s announcement."

Polymer also aims to launch its mainnet sometime this year, \"depending on testnet performance,\" Kim said.\n\nPolymer said its team has had professional working experience at firms including Google, Citadel, McKinsey, Amazon, Verizon, EY, and Uber.\n\n\"While many bridges have prioritized go-to-market and business development, we emphasize the importance of building the right solution for the long term,\" Kim said. \"Most of our engineering team members were brought on outside of crypto \u2014 more senior developers with experience specifically around scaling the infrastructure for the internet in web2.\""

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's \"agreement.\"\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n\n\nAccording to this, validators would lose ~.01 Eth for an activity leak lasting 10 hrs.\n\n\n\nObviously wouldn't be great for Ethereum, but not super devastating for any validators who are paying attention.https://t.co/VexfZo2pKF \u2014 MevRefund (@MevRefund) January 22, 2024\n\nIf validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as \"equivocating\" validators.\n\nWhat makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.\n\nFor the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is \"pretty scary,\" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue."

While the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was able to spout nonsense for over 10 years in its various denials of its BTC equivalent, the watchdog can no longer hide behind diffuse objections to what is a patently clear commodity ETP filing.\n\nIndeed, as was observed by Commissioner Hester Peirce in her damning indictment of the SEC\u2019s conduct over this approval published on Jan. 10, the denials of these applications never made sense.\n\nRelated: Will Bitcoin keep dropping because of the ETFs?\n\nRather than follow what was always a very clear process for these products, the regulator denied applications based only on \u201cprejudice\u201d against Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 a prejudice that was only, finally \u2014 ended by Greyscale\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe result, as Peirce observed, has not only been the erosion of trust in the SEC, but a \u201ccircus\u201d around these crypto products that would otherwise not have been witnessed \u2014 a fact to which the $1 billion of assets now sitting in BlackRock\u2019s BTC spot ETF can attest.\n\nSuch a circus will not be seen around an Ether ETF. Currently, there are seven ETH spot ETF applications sitting on the SEC's desk. This time, VanEck is the first in line with a deadline of May 23, 2024. The deadline for BlackRock\u2019s application is in August, but while typically we would expect the world's largest asset manager to dictate the terms of the approval, the securities watchdog has already instituted proceedings on VanEck's applications.\n\nEthereum ETF deadlines. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nAs such, it would have to come up with an awfully good reason for a denial, which would have a knock-on effect on other pending applications. This is why the market appears so certain that an approval is coming in May.\n\nAnd this will not be the result for just an ETH product, either. The path has now been cleared for any kind of crypto-backed or linked ETP \u2014 from spot products to more complex instruments like structured products, all linked to digital assets.\n\nAs a really long shot, the only potential obstacle in the way of a spot ETH approval is liquidity. Just as the size and scale of the market was a concern for a Bitcoin spot product, it will be even more so for Ethereum, whose move to proof-of-stake has further constrained the supply of ETH.\n\nMoreover, while BTC \u2014 now used almost purely as a store of value - can be held long-term inside large investment funds, ETH is a working currency used to pay for ever-growing numbers of transactions on the highly composable chain.\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler approved the ETFs \u2014 but now he\u2019s striking back\n\nThis and this only may throw a spanner in the works for the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency when it comes to a spot ETF approval, but it truly is an outside chance. Indeed, the same argument could be applied to equities \u2014 and it never is.\n\nThe liquidity issue will continue to plague almost all markets as these mega ETP funds soak up assets from the pensions savings of an aging global population, and solutions will continue to be found. Right now, in fact, we are seeing a lot of Bitcoin flowing into Coinbase wallets, which is almost certainly whales doing over-the-counter (OTC) deals to satisfy institutional demand.\n\nThe question of whether ETH is a security is also null and void as, once it becomes an ETF, it becomes a security. And we already have commodity ETFs \u2014 lots of them.\n\nThe reason it took 10 years for a Bitcoin ETF to be approved was politics \u2014 plain and simple. The SEC was neither sure or ready to be sure until the asset managers were sure and ready to be sure that this new asset class should be allowed through the door. We now have clarity on this.\n\nWith the approval of the BTC spot ETF, cryptocurrency is not only through TradFi\u2019s hallowed door, but sitting firmly at its table. Now, more than the approval of a spot ETH ETF, we can prepare for the full-scale institutional colonization of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nLucas Kiely is the chief investment officer for Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

        "title": "Making Vitalik Buterin's cypherpunk dream for Ethereum a reality - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has a dream. He wants to make Ethereum cypherpunk again \u2014 harkening back to the foundational values of blockchain, like decentralization, open participation, censorship resistance and credible neutrality.\n\nIn the Dec. 28, 2023 post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d Buterin argued that these concepts should shape not only the future of Ethereum but also the future of the internet as Web2 develops into Web3.\n\nAt the same time, Buterin lamented \u201cdegen [-erate] gamblers\u201d on Ethereum who put their money into memecoins or nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the hope of outsized financial rewards.\n\nAccording to Buterin, degens \u201ccan be okay in moderate doses,\u201d but \u201cwhen they are the largest group using the chain on a large scale, this adjusts the public perception and the crypto space\u2019s internal culture,\u201d among other negatives.\n\nIf the Ethereum founder is to avoid what he sees as degeneracy and ever get closer to his dream, he has a long way to go. As Buterin says himself, \u201cThe only non-financial application that is actually being used at a large scale on-chain is ENS.\u201d\n\nWhile that\u2019s a grand endorsement of ENS \u2014 the Ethereum Name Service \u2014 it\u2019s not a fantastic record of achievement either. ENS launched in 2017, so by Buterin\u2019s admission, not a single successful Ethereum project launch since then has met the standards he\u2019s setting. That\u2019s a fairly lamentable record.\n\nWith that being the case, can all of the blame really be laid at the feet of degens?\n\nA single shining cypherpunk beacon\n\nIf the vast bulk of projects on Ethereum can either be classed as cypherpunk and not successful or as successful and not cypherpunk, then it is worth examining the supposed single exception to the rule: the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nENS is a domain naming service for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a standard Ethereum address\u2019s randomly created letters and words to be personalized into easily recognizable words or phrases, such as a name or a brand. As the internet has \u201c.com,\u201d Ethereum thusly has \u201c.eth.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service, to find out what kind of forces might drive Ethereum\u2019s cypherpunk renaissance.\n\nAs Johnson sees it, the cypherpunk idealogy -\u2014 which also drives the shift from Web2 to Web3 \u2014 will prove increasingly popular with the public as ordinary people become more familiar with centralization and its negative associations. He believes this is especially true for hot-button issues such as privacy:\n\n\u201cWeb3 is poised to be a tangible reality as individuals see the impact of centralized technology on their lives, especially their data, and gradually recognize the inherent value in decentralized and credibly neutral technologies.\u201d\n\nJohnson pointed out that while the solutions take time to develop and emerge, \u201cAs blockchain technology advances, there is a decentralized alternative for every centralized option.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Buterin singled out ENS as unique among the whole Ethereum ecosystem because it brings \u201ca true non-financial use case to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nRecent: Crypto community speculates about Bitcoin transfer to Satoshi\u2019s genesis block\n\n\u201cThe .eth naming system now stands as a foundational pillar within Web3\u2019s architecture and is a gateway for Web2 companies scaling into Web3, proving we have slowly entered the transition to Web3. ENS believes in building an internet that adheres to the original ethos of Ethereum to foster inclusivity and self-sovereignty,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe transaction fee problem\n\nVitalik Buterin may lament the rise of \u201cdegeneracy\u201d on Ethereum, but he sees high transaction fees, rather than individual users, as the main culprit and driver of the phenomenon.\n\nButerin writes, \u201cWhen the cost of writing to the chain is $0.001, or even $0.1, you could imagine people making all kinds of applications that use blockchains in various ways, including non-financial ways. But when transaction fees go to over $100, as they have during the peak of the bull markets, there is exactly one audience that remains willing to play \u2014 and in fact, because coin prices are going up and they\u2019re getting richer, becomes even more willing to play: degen gamblers.\u201d\n\nIf that point is accepted as true, there is a further argument to be made that the high cost of transactions on Ethereum is due to historical and current network limitations. A more charitable assessment may be that Ethereum is a victim of its own success, making it difficult to keep up. However you chose to phrase the matter, it boils down to an essential indisputable point: Ethereum is struggling to meet demand.\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum switched from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake in a bid to improve throughput and provide a future platform for increased scalability.\n\nBut even with Ethereum\u2019s consensus change, much work remains. The network currently processes 30 transactions per second or lower. The stated goal is to reach anywhere up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nEthereum can do it with time\n\nThe road to a cypherpunk Ethereum may be long, but some have confidence that the network is on the right path.\n\nBarney Mannerings, co-founder of the Vega Protocol decentralized exchange, believes that Buterin can succeed in making Ethereum a more cypherpunk network, but \u201cThe caveat is that it remains to be seen how big the market for this is and how much adoption can be gained.\u201d\n\nWhat founders envisage and what the market responds to do not always perfectly align.\n\nMannerings told Cointelegraph that he sees a parallel with end-to-end encryption for messaging, saying that cypherpunks \u201cfought for strongly end-to-end encrypted communications for years. Initially, they succeeded, technically, with the likes of Phil Zimmernan\u2019s PGP [Pretty Good Privacy], but this has always suffered from a bad UX and low adoption \u2014 a lack of \u2018product market fit.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecent: 100 days out: What the Bitcoin halving means after BTC ETF approvals\n\nMannerings says it wasn\u2019t until later, when Signal arrived with its improved user experience (UX), that the concept fared better. Mainstream messaging apps such as WhatsApp now offer encryption but with some compromises.\n\n\u201cI expect the same to happen here,\u201d said Mannerings. \u201cIt will be easier to technically create and disseminate the tools and building blocks of Vitalik\u2019s cypherpunk dream than it will be to get everyone using them, and for these building blocks to filter through to the real world in a big way could take decades.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to make an argument against the attempt. In fact, as Mannerings points out, \u201cI think it is a strong vision and one worth building toward and fighting for, and I think Ethereum is well placed to lead the charge from a position of strength, with an aligned community and ecosystem.\u201d"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nA dormant Ethereum wallet from the Satoshi era has recently come to life. Whale Alert, a popular tracker of large-scale cryptocurrency transactions, reported that a pre-mine address containing 133 Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $329,492, has been activated after lying dormant for 8.5 years. This unexpected activity has stirred considerable interest in the crypto community, given the long inactivity of the wallet.\n\nRevival of ancient Ethereum addresses\n\nThe recent activation of this Satoshi-era Ethereum wallet is not an isolated incident. Over the past few months, several dormant pre-mine Ethereum addresses have been reactivated. For instance, Whale Alert reported on Jan. 14 that a wallet with 200 ETH (worth $506,140) resumed activity after 8.5 years.\n\nSimilar awakenings were noted on Dec. 23, 2023, with a wallet containing 11,640 ETH ($26.5 million) becoming active after 8.4 years, and on Oct. 21, 2023, a wallet with 2,000 ETH ($3.2 million) reactivated after 8.2 years.\n\nThese reactivations have sparked discussions and speculations within the cryptocurrency community, as they represent significant movements within the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nPotential reasons\n\nThe activation of these pre-mine Ethereum addresses is particularly noteworthy because Ethereum was obscure during its early years. Pre-mine addresses refer to wallets containing cryptocurrencies that were mined before the public launch of the blockchain.\n\nThe sudden activation of such wallets, dormant for nearly a decade, raises questions about the motives behind these transactions. Speculation ranges from owners regaining access to lost keys, to strategic financial moves influenced by the current market dynamics.\n\nThe re-emergence of these wallets could also be linked to long-term holders (often called \"HODLers\" in the crypto world) deciding to cash in on their investments or diversify their portfolios in response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nHowever, such transactions are usually too small to potentially impact the liquidity and price volatility of ETH."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction 2024 \u2013 2030\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency (by market cap) and the world\u2019s most popular smart contracting platform. It was designed to operate as a world computer and has overcome many hurdles in its short, 8 year existence\u2014some self-induced, others put there by those threatening to stifle innovation.\n\nIn this Ethereum price prediction, we dive into what Ethereum is aiming to accomplish through its development roadmap, what has happened to it in the past, and how all this has, and will, affect Ethereum\u2019s price in the future. We\u2019ll also look at the myriad of factors that affect the Ethereum price.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Ethereum and the ETH price at this crucial moment in Ethereum\u2019s history?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Overview\n\nThe Ethereum network was launched in 2015, and ETH\u2019s first registered price is $1.2222\n\nThrough 2017 Ethereum gained an astounding 17,970.6%, rising from $8.10 to peak at $1,463.72\n\nEthereum lost value after The Merge, the biggest network upgrade in its history\n\nWe predict that Ethereum will get its first 5 figure all-time high (ATH) of $10,200 in 2029, as a result of the Bitcoin Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, regulators, the global economic picture, network upgrades, and institutional usage rates are all factors impacting the price of Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap lays out how it is going to scale to 100,000 transactions per second and onboard thousands of users\u2014we discuss how these upgrades will affect the price of ETH\n\nThe table below contains a summary of our Ethereum price prediction for each year:\n\nYear Low Prediction Average Prediction High Prediction 2024 $2,200 $3,600 $4,200 2025 $3,400 $4,200 $6,600 2026 $3,500 $4,500 $5,800 2027 $3,900 $5,200 $4,400 2028 $4,200 $5,800 $6,300 2029 $7,100 $8,800 $10,200 2030 $8,800 $9,000 $9,600\n\nHistorical Evolution of Ethereum\n\n\n\nThe idea for Ethereum was first conceived in 2013 by a young programmer, Vitalik Buterin, after his father introduced him to Bitcoin. Vitalik authored the initial Ethereum whitepaper, outlining the idea that blockchain technology could be used for more than just the transfer of value\u2014as Bitcoin is.\n\nMore specifically, Vitalik proposed that blockchain technology could be used to host contracts (what we today call \u201csmart contracts\u201d) that could perform a whole host of functions and that the distributed network could function as a world computer.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Beginnings\n\nIn 2014, Vitalik took his idea to the North American Bitcoin Conference, in Miami, where he outlined his vision in a 25 minute speech. After this address, Vitalik and a few others from the conference, now considered the cofounders of Ethereum, who were excited by the idea, rented a house to work on the idea.\n\nOne of these individuals, Gavin Wood (creator of Polkadot), then wrote the Ethereum Yellow Paper, which defines the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u2014the operating environment that makes smart contract execution possible.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the Ethereum Foundation was created, as a non-profit to oversee the development of Ethereum. Funds for this development were raised through a crowdsale\u2014which was one of the first initial coin offerings (ICOs)\u2014where Ethereum tokens were sold for Bitcoin\u2014raising more than $18 million.\n\nOver the next 18 months, the initial Ethereum protocol was developed, multiple testnets were run and the network was officially launched on July 30th, 2015, with the creation of the Ethereum genesis block.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum was initially a proof-of-work network. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum had an uncapped supply, which made it an inflationary asset.\n\nThe DAO Hack and DAO Hard Fork Controversy\n\nAn important part of Ethereum\u2019s history is often glossed over as it is considered a stain on the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency\u2019s reputation.\n\nIn 2016 a group, containing many members of the Ethereum Foundation, proposed a project simply called The DAO. The DAO\u2019s goal was to become a crowdfunded venture capital firm to invest in new projects building on Ethereum.\n\nThe DAO had initial success, raising $150 million\u201414% of the total supply of Ethereum at the time\u2014in its own crowdsale.\n\n\n\nHowever, after the crowdsale had concluded, a bug was found in the DAO\u2019s smart contract that allowed someone to drain funds from the contract. A hacker noticed it first and made away with 30% of all the raised funds before well-intentioned hackers stepped in to secure the other 70%.\n\nTo solve the problem of stolen funds a soft fork was proposed and implemented on the network. However, a bug was quickly found in the soft fork and the miners rejected it, forcing the need for another solution.\n\nA hardfork was proposed which, controversially, would return all the funds from the hacker\u2019s account to The DAO. A short, and also controversial, vote was held to authorize the fork, which was subsequently implemented 5 days later.\n\nPrior to this incident, the mantra \u201ccode is law\u201d was one of Ethereum\u2019s calling cards, meaning that whatever happens on the blockchain cannot be changed\u2014regardless of its origin. There are those who vehemently disagreed with the idea of the hard fork on these grounds, and its implementation can be seen as an evolution in the network\u2019s principles.\n\nThe Birth of a Classic (Ethereum Classic) After the hardfork was implemented it was thought that just one chain would exist, and the unchanged chain would disappear. However, some miners continued to support the original chain. Two exchanges gave this chain price discovery and rebranded it to Ethereum Classic, which is still its name today. The DAO hack and subsequent infighting is a long story with many twists and turns. If you want to know more, this post tells the in-depth story of the DAO hack and subsequent community divisions, and this timeline offers a chronological overview of events.\n\n\n\nHardforks and Network Evolution\n\nThe DAO fork was not the first or last hard fork on the Ethereum blockchain, as hard forks are how the Ethereum protocol is upgraded. There have been multiple in Ethereum\u2019s history, some of which are more consequential in the history of Ethereum than others, these we\u2019ve summarized in the table below:\n\nHardfork Name Date Most Significant Impact Byzantium October 2017 Allowed for the creation of layer 2s to scale the network Constantinople February 2019 Initial setup for move to proof-of-stake (PoS) Istanbul December 2019 Improved layer 2 and smart contract functionality Beacon Chain December 2020 The initial deployment of the PoS chain for Ethereum London August 2021 Introduction of fee burning mechanism reducing the inflation rate and increasing the chance of ETH being deflationary Bellatrix September 6th 2022 Second upgrade to the Beacon chain, preparing it for The Merge \u201cParis\n\n(The Merge)\u201d September 15th 2022 Proof-of-work (PoW) was switched off, PoS was switched on, completing The Merge and Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake consensus\n\nAs said, this isn\u2019t a complete list, and each hardfork introduced more than just the significant impact we\u2019ve stated here. Those looking for a deeper dive into each hardfork and the technical evolution of the Ethereum blockchain can read this complete history of Ethereum hardforks.\n\nCryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, and NFTs Here it is worth noting another important step in the evolution of Ethereum and the cryptocurrency world, NFTs. In 2017 a revolution started on Ethereum with the launch of CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks were one of the earliest examples of NFTs on Ethereum, and have continued to remain relevant; the current lowest price for a CryptoPunk is just under 60 ETH, around $150,000. This collection of 10,000 algorithmically generated pixel characters were not actually NFTs, but they did help to spur the creation and implementation of the ERC-721 NFT standard on Ethereum. Later on in 2017, the cats began to take over Ethereum, with the rise in popularity of the CryptoKitties game. In this game, users take NFT kittens and breed them together to create new, unique kittens that draw on the traits of their parents. This game grew so popular that it took up 20% of Ethereum\u2019s computation and drastically increased transaction costs. This hastened the need for scaling solutions, because who\u2019s going to want to use a network that can be put out of action by a viral cat game?\n\n\n\nEthereum, The Merge, and Proof-of-Stake\n\nThe Merge was an event almost 5 years in the making, and it was the talking point of the cryptocurrency ecosystem for a long time before, and even after, it happened. Ethereum cofounder, Joe Lubin, said to Time that the Merge \u201cmay end up being more significant\u201d than the genesis day.\n\nThe Merge combined the existing Ethereum PoW blockchain with the PoS Beacon chain that had been running alongside it since December 2020. This merging of the two chains meant that the Ethereum network didn\u2019t lose any of its history as it switched from PoW to PoS\u2014all without affecting the users at all.\n\nThere are several reasons Ethereum switched to a POS consensus model:\n\nReduced Energy Consumption: Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption was reduced by over 99% after the switch to proof-of-stake, and some even stated that \u201cthe merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%\u201d. This was all coming at a time when passions around climate change were high and the power consumption of blockchains was one of the pieces of vitriol being thrown at them.\n\nDeflationary Potential: Prior to The Merge around 13,000 ETH was issued per day. With the switch to PoS this shrank to around 1,700 ETH per day\u2014significantly reducing ETH inflation.\n\nThe London hardfork also introduced a burning mechanism that removes the minimum fee attached to each transaction from circulation. If a single day has an average gas price of more than 16 gwei then the burned amount of ETH exceeds the issuance limit and results in deflation of ETH in that day.\n\nStaking Interest: Ethereum users can now stake their ETH to help secure the network and earn interest (in newly issued ETH) for doing so. A user requires a minimum of 32 ETH to operate a validator and earn this reward.\n\nLower Barrier to Entry: Mining is an expensive operation that requires massive amounts of energy, limiting the number of people with the resources and capacity to secure the network. Staking made it easier for more people to participate in securing the network, making it more decentralized in the process. However, at current prices, a user needs over $88,000 worth of ETH to run a validator node.\n\nNew Scaling Possibilities: Moving to a PoS consensus mechanism allows for future scalability upgrades that are not possible when using a PoW consensus mechanism. This allows Ethereum to scale to meet the needs of a global, digital society.\n\nCurrent State of Ethereum\n\n\n\nEthereum is a fully functioning, decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain that works as a global computer where people can interact and transact in a permissionless manner, from anywhere in the world. It is used by individuals and enterprises for a wide variety of functions, from transferring value to taking out loans to storing data in an immutable fashion.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem contains many of the world\u2019s most popular dApps and some of the biggest technological transformations to come from the cryptocurrency movement, including NFTs, DeFi, zero-knowledge privacy solutions, and layer 2 scaling networks. Here\u2019s a quick look at the Ethereum blockchain in numbers:\n\nAlongside these stats, the Ethereum network processed an average of more than 1 million transactions per day over the past year, a number that is only expected to grow as the number of unique addresses and daily active addresses continue to increase.\n\nWhile these numbers are impressive there are also more than 8 layer 2 networks posting their transactions to Ethereum and taking the load off the main chain, and many more in the pipeline to be launched\u2014meaning the number of transactions secured by the Ethereum layer 1 is much higher than the counts expressed above.\n\nRecently there has also been the launch of an application-specific (for gaming) layer 3 on top of the Arbitrum layer 2.\n\nMarket Position and Performance\n\nEthereum is sat at #2 on CoinMarketCap\u2019s ranking of coins by market cap, as it has been since 2016. In the same article linked above, it is also pointed out that Ethereum is the third best performing asset in the CoinMarketCap top 100 since 2013, with a more than 700x increase.\n\nIn the past year, the price of Ethereum has seen a over 80% increase in price, from $1,643.30 on February 22nd, 2023, to $2,966.91 on February 22nd, 2024. The total supply of available ETH has also been slowly decreasing since the introduction of The Merge in September 2022 making Ethereum a deflationary asset, a move that Vitalik said was giving Ethereum \u201clegitimacy\u201d as \u201cultra sound money\u201d.\n\nOverall, Ethereum\u2019s recent performance has been strong through the Crypto Winter of 2022\u20132023. Its market dominance of 17\u201319%, also held strong through the Bitcoin ETF speculation-fueled price rises and a sudden and sustained surge by Solana in early 2024.\n\nFinally, before we dive into our Ethereum price prediction, Ethereum is the only cryptocurrency that is currently available to institutional investors as a futures contract, approved in October 2023 by the SEC. It is also seen as the next candidate for ETF approval, reflected in the markets the day after Bitcoin ETF approval with a 9% ETH price pump. There are already 7 Ethereum ETF spot applications registered with the SEC, with the first approval deadline set for May 23rd, 2024, and a Bloomberg analyst giving them a 70% chance of being approved.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions 2024-2050\n\n\n\nHere we take a look at what is in store for the Ethereum network in each of the coming years, along with the impact it could have on the price of Ethereum, and we make an Ethereum price prediction for each year.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2024\n\n2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the world of cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators on the weekly chart for Ethereum, we find that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is toying with the 200-day SMA after coming down to touch in Q2 of 2023. The last time this happened was in late 2020, when a \u201cgolden cross\u201d movement had ETH make the move upward to make those ATHs 12 months later.\n\nEthereum has also broken upward out of the trading channel on the chart below, but has met heavy resistance at $3,000\u2014just as the Bitcoin price has also net heavy resistance at $52,000. If the current rally is sustained and Ethereum sustains this breakout then we could have the same scenario as in 2020\u20132021 on our hands, wit the potential of new all-time highs.\n\nMany things could help to spur this move onward, not just market sentiment built on indicators. These other factors include the upcoming deadline for Ethereum ETF approval in May, increasing investor confidence throughout the year as the Fed cuts interest rates, and the release of the Dencun upgrade for the network, targeted for March 13th, that will make Ethereum more secure and introduce faster operations for layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\nAll-in-all, our Ethereum price prediction 2024 is a low of $2,200, a high of $4,200, and a median price of $3,600.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2025\n\nIt is widely predicted that the cryptocurrency narrative in 2025 will be dominated by the effects of the 2024 Bitcoin Halving event. These Halving events typically induce new ATHs for Bitcoin and many altcoins 12\u201318 months after they\u2019ve occurred, meaning that these gains are expected to arrive in 2025.\n\nAs a result, our ETH price prediction 2025 is a new ATH high of $6,600, a low of $3,400, and an average price of $4,200.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2026\n\nIf the expected narrative is correct, and we feel the positive price effects of the 2024 Bitcoin Halving in 2025, then 2026 is when we\u2019ll be coming down off these highs.\n\nHowever, with Crypto prices prominent in the news last year thanks to new ATHs, we can expect governments around the world to be well on the way to implementing cryptocurrency regulations. So long as these are positive and foster the continued evolution of crypto, which we expect them to and be and do, then we can expect the bleeding to be somewhat restrained by these positive developments.\n\nAdd to this the fact that scaling developments should be implemented onto the Ethereum network by this point, greatly increasing its utility, and we are mutedly bullish for Ethereum in 2026, with no new ATH predictions but sustained highs of $5,800, lows of $3,500, and an average price of $4,500.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2027\n\nNot every year is going to be as exciting as the others, and 2027 might be that year for Ethereum. Many big regulatory moves have already been made, no Halving events are affecting the price, and the global economy should be chugging along nicely after everything has settled from the recession scares of 2022 and 2023.\n\nInstitutional use of the Ethereum protocol will hopefully continue to grow into 2027, increasing demand for ETH. However, this demand will be countered by technical improvements that make ETH cheaper and easier to use.\n\nAs a result, we may find that prices have contracted into a smaller range for 2027, with highs of $5,200, lows of $3,900, and an average price of $4,400\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2028\n\n2028 will be the year of the 5th Bitcoin Halving event, and with cryptocurrencies now mainstream and, with investors knowledgeable of the Bitcoin Halving cycle and the expected increase in cryptocurrency prices, we can expect rises in the price of Ethereum based on investors speculation. However, will the Ethereum and Bitcoin prices have decoupled by this point? It is unlikely, and ETH will still be at BTC\u2019s mercy.\n\nThis is why we predict highs of $6,300\u2014close to the ATHs set in 2025 as no one wants to buy higher than this just yet. We also predict lows of $4,200, and a high median price of $5,800.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2029\n\nIn 2029 we can expect most of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades to either be complete or very close to implementation. Here we\u2019re likely to see growing institutional and public use of the network for all sorts of business and personal use cases that greatly impact the way we conduct commerce and value transfer.\n\nOn top of this, while everyone thought the Bitcoin Halving event was priced in, prices continue to climb and Ethereum, if it retains the title of the most used and most popular smart contracting platform in the world, could see its first 5 figure ATH of $10,200, a low of $7,100, and an average price of $8,800.\n\nETH Price Prediction for 2030\n\nIf Ethereum has retained its place as the top altcoin then we could see it decouple from the Bitcoin price, and the fallout from the Bitcoin Halving event, if it does hit the crypto market at all, will hardly impact the Ethereum price, helping to bring greater price stability to ETH.\n\nWe should also be in, or close to, the Splurge section of the Ethereum roadmap, where developers are tidying up the existing code and fine-tuning the Ethereum protocol. It is also highly likely that new ideas will be under development by this point, and may even be close to implementation\u2014with the possibility of taking blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to new heights.\n\nWith all that said, 2030 could bring much more stability to the Ethereum price with people looking to the future for it to be a major part of society. This is why we\u2019re predicting a much tighter range, with highs of $9,600, lows of $8,800, and an average price of $9,000\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\n\n\nThere are numerous items that affect the price of Ethereum. The most important of those have been detailed here.\n\nBitcoin: Arguably the biggest influence on any altcoin is the price of Bitcoin and the happenings on the Bitcoin network. The price action of Ethereum, just like any other altcoin, is closely tied to that of the world\u2019s #1 cryptocurrency.\n\nHere we must also mention the Bitcoin Halving, which has historically driven Bitcoin and all altcoins to new ATHs 12\u201318 months after the event occurs. The next Bitcoin Halving event is due to happen in April of 2024 and investors will be watching it closely.\n\nRegulator\u2019s Definition of Ethereum: In June of 2023, the SEC separately sued both Coinbase and Binance, labeling Ethereum as a security in both lawsuits (prompting large drops in the price of Ethereum). The New York General Attorney also called Ethereum a security in 2023, in a lawsuit against the KuCoin exchange.\n\nUntil these regulators remove this label, the presumption that ETH is a security will keep downward pressure on the price. However, when, or if, this is cleared up, we could likely see the price of Ethereum skyrocket.\n\nRegulatory Landscape: Changing the stance on Ethereum as a security is one thing, but once regulators around the globe begin enacting regulations for cryptocurrencies there\u2019ll be a lot clearer picture for retail investors about what will happen to them if they use or interact with cryptocurrencies.\n\nRegulations permitting and clarifying the use of crypto will likely result in positive price action, whereas those decrying and restricting crypto are likely to drive negative price action.\n\nInstitutional Usage Rate: If Ethereum is accepted under a regulatory framework in some of the world\u2019s biggest economies then this gives institutions and corporations the green light to begin using it for products and services\u2014which could include everything from identity solutions, to tokenized assets and supply chain tracking.\n\nThe news of big companies or institutions choosing to use Ethereum is sure to drive price action, while the increase in network traffic brought by such use will also drive demand for ETH, increasing the price.\n\nProtocol Upgrades: The Ethereum roadmap is discussed below and there we discuss the connection between network upgrades and price movements. In short, until the price of Ethereum decouples from that of Bitcoin, protocol upgrades are unlikely to have a large price impact.\n\nHowever, if, or once, Ethereum\u2019s price does decouple from that of Bitcoin, then protocol upgrades will have a much larger impact, expected to result in a net-positive, on the price of Ethereum.\n\nThe Macroeconomic Environment: At the moment, cryptocurrencies are seen as a monetary asset and speculative asset class. These are traditionally only popular during times of economic growth and stability. While the global economy has been quite chaotic since the global pandemic, with interest rates hitting new highs as the Fed tries to avoid an recession in the USA, an occurrence that could have a knock-on effect in other economies around the world.\n\nHowever, the worst is said to be behind us\u2014with the Fed expected to cut interest rates 3 times or more in 2024. A return to normal means investors typically move out of safer assets and into more speculative assets, like cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is expected to be one of those cryptocurrencies thanks to its prominent position and future hopes of an EFT approval.\n\nSupply and Demand: When it switched from a PoW to a PoS network the Ethereum network\u2019s daily reward rate was greatly reduced\u2014and there is now the potential for it to be a deflationary asset. According to the Ether Supply Growth Chart on Etherscan, the total supply of ETH has been steadily decreasing since The Merge.\n\nThis might only be a 0.30% decrease over the course of 17 months, but as network usage grows, the supply is expected to continue decreasing. The increase in network usage will also increase demand for ETH, and these two factors combined will put upward pressure on the price of ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis and Historical Sentiments\n\n\n\nEthereum was officially launched on July 30th, 2015, and the first price information for Ethereum on CoinMarketCap is from August 12th, 2015, where it was valued at $1.2222 per coin. Here we\u2019ll briefly cover the history of Ethereum and its price action from Launch thought to today.\n\nHistorical Price Movements\n\nIn its first few months of existence, Ethereum traded below $2 and also hit its all-time low of $0.4209 on October 21st, 2015. Then, at the beginning of 2016, Ethereum started to climb, and hit local highs of $18.36 in mid-June 2016. This climb existed alongside Bitcoin\u2019s price rise back in 2016\u2014showing just how long altcoins, even new altcoins, have been tracking Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nHowever, any further positive price movement was halted by the news of The DAO hack. ETH lost almost half its value over the next few months, trading as low as $7.2764.\n\n2017 was when a larger part of the world really heard about cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin climbed from ~$900 at the beginning of the year to peak just below $20,000 in December 2017. Ethereum was one of the altcoins that faired best in this time, rising from an opening price of $8.10 on January 1st, to peak at $1,463.72 just over a year later, on January 13th, 2018\u2014a meteoric gain of 17,970.6% that made it one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies of the time and firmly placed it as the world\u2019s most popular altcoin.\n\nLike Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s price then plummeted, reaching lows around $80 in 2018, and finding critical support at $120. Ethereum then bumbled along slowly and didn\u2019t see prices above $1,000 again until January 4th 2021, spending most of its time between 2018 and 2021 under $400.\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving happened in May 2020 and is widely said to be responsible for the price action that started in the crypto markets in 2021, resulting in new ATHs for the majority of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is included in that list, rallying 563% from an opening price of $737.60 at the start of 2021 to its current ATH of $4,891.70 on November 16th.\n\nFrom here the price of Ethereum steadily declined along with the rest of the crypto market as the Crypto Winter of 2022 set in\u2014all assisted by the collapse of Luna and the Terra (UST) in May\u2014to hit local lows of $880 in June 2022, an 82% decrease, before quickly establishing support at $1,000 and $1,275.\n\nEthereum remained at these levels for a month, until the 13th of July when it bounced off a low of $1,005.61 to start a price rise in anticipation of The Merge event, now scheduled for September 2022 after numerous delays. This culminated in highs of just over $2,000 in August.\n\nOn September 6th, the Belatrix hardfork successfully upgraded the Beacon Chain causing ETH to 15% in anticipation of The Merge on September 15th with the Paris upgrade. However, by this date Ethereum had lost these gains and was trading in the same range as it was for the Belatrix hardfork on the day of The Merge\u2014a day where, despite the success of Ethereum\u2019s biggest ever upgrade, ETH lost 8.29% of its price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Performance Post-Merge\n\nEthereum\u2019s poor start to life as a PoS blockchain continued, as further losses throughout the remainder of September and October saw it lose another 19.74% of its value and hit lows of $1,181.76. It then traded sideways before rallying to above $1,600 for the beginning of November 2022.\n\nNovember 2022 saw the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, which shook the crypto markets to its core, and caused huge sell-offs. Ethereum lost over 34% of its value before finding support at $1100.\n\nFrom here Ethereum has recovered well, starting 2023 with a three week rally that saw it gain 40%, and retake the same price levels as before the collapse of FTX.\n\nHowever, from here regulatory scrutiny, and vagueness, around the case of whether ETH is a security, by both the New York Attorney General, Gary Gensler, and the SEC, caused some wild individual day drops in the Ethereum price throughout 2023\u2014some of over 15%.\n\nDespite all this regulator-induced FUD, the price of ETH continued to rise throughout the year\u2014showing hugely positive sentiment from investors. ETH also ended 2023 on a high, thanks, in part, to gains driven by the expected approval of a Bitcoin ETF\u2014closing 2023 at $2,282.89 with YoY gains of 91%.\n\n2024 has since been positive, and the approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 saw ETH pump 9% (while Bitcoin remained stable) on expectations that it might be the next cryptocurrency to have an ETF approved. Ethereum has since followed in the lead of Bitcoin as it rallied toward $52,000 in February, and rallied up toward $3,000, with both cryptocurrencies meeting strong resistance at these marks.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions by Experts and Analysts\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s position as the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency by market cap and the world\u2019s most popular smart contracting platform, means that there\u2019s no shortage of ETH price predictions from experts and analysts. Here we\u2019ve summarized Ethereum price predictions from some expert analysts.\n\nCathie Woods\u2019 ETH Prediction\n\nCathie Woods, the Ark Invest CEO, has stated that she expects Ethereum to reach a $20 trillion market cap by 2030. If the circulating supply of ETH remains relatively stable between now and then, then that equates to a $160,000 to $180,000 valuation for a single ETH.\n\nBill Barhydt\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nBill Barhydt, the CEO of the Abra platform for private and institutional investment in cryptocurrencies, predicts that Ethereum could reach prices as high as $40,000, albeit, without specifying a timeframe. He also states that he is more bullish on Ethereum than he is on Bitcoin.\n\nFinder\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nA panel of experts at Finder.com, a renowned comparison website, offers an ETH price prediction that sees the world\u2019s #2 cryptocurrency hit $5,824 by 2025 and $14,411 by 2030. Notably, this is a slight reduction in their predictions, previously given in July 2023.\n\nVanEck\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nThe VanEck investment management company predicts that ETH will hit a token price of $11,800 by 2030. This, they state, will be driven by \u201cimproving functionality, lower take-rates and an ethos of inclusivity.\u201d\n\nGeoff Kendrick\u2019s ETH Prediction\n\nGeoff Kendrick, analyst and Head of Crypto Research at the Standard Chartered Bank, predicts that Ethereum could hit $8,000 by 2026. But labeled this as only a \u201cstepping stone\u201d on the way to a larger valuation of $26,000\u2013$25,000, with no timeframe given for this larger valuation.\n\nBonus Prediction: While they have not predicted the price, at the end of 2023 JP Morgan said that they expect Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024 as a result of the release of proto-danksharding on the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum development roadmap lays out the future of the Ethereum network and how developers plan to upgrade it in the near and distant future. At the Ethereum Developer Conference in July 2022, Vitalik Buterin shared that Ethereum would only be about 55% complete after the Merge.\n\nIn the same talk, Vitalik described the next steps\u2014which rhyme\u2014for Ethereum\u2019s growth, these are called the Surge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. The most updated roadmap was shared by Vitalik at the end of 2023 on X\u2014with an added step called the Scourge. Here we\u2019ll take a closer look at what these upgrades involve, and their potential impact on the Ethereum price.\n\nUpcoming Developments and Roadmap\n\nThe Surge:\n\nA focus on scaling and getting Ethereum to 100,000 transactions per second using a combination of scaling solutions like sharding and layer 2s like rollups. This stage, specifically the development of rollup technology, is well underway, with numerous layer 2s already deployed on the network, and a rollup friendly network update scheduled for March 13th.\n\nThe Scourge: According to Vitalik, this is \u201cabout fighting economic centralization\u201d, specifically that caused by liquid staking platforms\u2014issues which he raised in a blog post\u2014like Lido, which, at the time of writing, controlled 31.61% of all the staked ETH securing the network.\n\nThe Verge: Introduces Verkle trees, which, in short, will allow for stateless clients to exist\u2014a stateless client is a node that validates blocks but doesn\u2019t have to store the state of the entire blockchain\u2014lowering the hardware requirements for nodes and increasing decentralization.\n\nThe Purge: This will simplify the protocol by allowing the existence of nodes that only store the last year of data, significantly reducing their storage requirements, reducing network congestion, and making it easier to participate in the network.\n\nThe Splurge: The tinkering phase, where developers are making sure that everything already done is working smoothly, and adding upgrades to fine-tune all the elements of the protocol.\n\nPotential Impacts on ETH Price\n\nThese protocol upgrades will happen over a course of 5\u201310 years, and it is likely to be closer to the higher end of that period before we\u2019re near the Splurge. If we look back at the most significant protocol upgrades in Ethereum\u2019s history, detailed in the Historical Evolution of Ethereum section earlier, and the price action around them, we find little to no correlation between the release of these upgrades and price movements in either direction.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum seems to correlate much more tightly with movements in the price of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market than it does with any calendar of previous protocol upgrades.\n\nAs an example, the two hardforks, Belatrix and Paris, that initiated The Merge\u2014the biggest and most anticipated event in Ethereum history\u2014happened in the first half of September 2022. Over the course of that month Ethereum saw gains of just 1.57%.\n\nAs a result, it is unlikely that upgrades to the Ethereum protocol will significantly impact its price. That is, at least until it has decoupled from tracking the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBottom Line for Ethereum Price Prediction\n\n\n\nPrice predictions are just that, predictions, and those that you\u2019ve read here should not be taken as gospel. There are many Ethereum price predictions out there and this one, looking at technical indicators for the short term, and diving deep into the many technical, economic, and regulatory factors for the long term, has returned a positive price prediction for the future of Ethereum\n\nIf we\u2019re to look to the other end of the scale, for balance, we need to look no further than the words of successful investor Warren Buffet, who is one of the world\u2019s 10 richest people: \u201dIn terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.\u201d\n\nFAQs\n\nWill ETH Price Cross Key Milestones? (e.g., $3,000, $5,000)\n\nAccording to our comprehensive Ethereum price prediction, Ethereum will be back above $3,000 in 2024, and will climb above $5,000 to hit new ATHs of $6,600 in 2025. Furthermore, we expect Ethereum to reach $10,000 in 2029.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Long-Term Investment?\n\nIn our in-depth Ethereum price prediction, which takes into account a myriad of factors, we find that Ethereum is indeed a good long-term investment as the price of Ethereum is likely to increase multiple-fold between now and 2030\u2014making it a solid pick for any investor.\n\nRisks and Considerations in Ethereum Investment\n\nThose investing in Ethereum should know that it comes with many risks and price influences. These include regulatory scrutiny, price volatility, and the macroeconomic climate. We dive into these elements in detail in our Ethereum price prediction for 2024-2030. Investors also have to consider exchange hacks and how they should store their coins."

        "title": "Here\u2019s How Low Can ETH Go Following Recent 4% Decline: Ethereum Price Analysis - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In the recent market developments, Ethereum showcased a remarkable upswing, surging to a yearly high of $2717.\n\nHowever, this ascent was met with considerable selling pressure, prompting a slight retracement and setting the stage for a potential short-term consolidation correction.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart uncovers a significant recent surge, with the price reaching a yearly peak of $2.7K. Simultaneously, ETH has emerged within an ascending expanding wedge pattern, identifiable by the orange lines. This pattern holds the potential for a bearish reversal, contingent upon the price breaking below the lower boundary.\n\nDespite this, after Ethereum\u2019s notable upward movement, the price encountered a pivotal resistance zone, notably \u2013 the static $2.7K level aligning with the upper boundary of the ascending wedge pattern.\n\nThis led to a slight retracement. Considering recent market sentiment and price action, there is an anticipation of a continuation in the correction leg, possibly resulting in a pullback to the multi-month ascending wedge pattern (green lines), coinciding with the lower boundary of the recent short-term expanding wedge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, the price faced considerable selling pressure following the impulsive surge, initiating a correction phase. Accordingly, Ethereum seems confined within a crucial range, bounded by substantial support at $2.4K and notable resistance at $2.7K, resulting in a mild downward consolidation.\n\nCurrently, the price has approached the lower boundary of this significant range. Notably, the lower boundary aligns with a significant support region, defined by the price range between the 0.5 ($2408) and the 0.618 ($2335) levels of the Fibonacci retracement. Hence, this offers robust support to the price.\n\nGiven the potential presence of buyers within this critical support zone, an expected scenario is for the price to find support, facilitating a renewed upward movement. However, in the event of a bearish breakout, sellers may target the multi-week ascending trendline as their next objective.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe funding rates are critical in the analysis of Ethereum\u2019s futures market sentiment, as illustrated in the accompanying chart. This metric serves as a pivotal gauge to discern whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders with heightened aggression.\n\nThe chart prominently reveals an upward trajectory in the funding rates metric, mirroring the robust surge in price. This alignment signals a pronounced bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that elevated values in funding rates raise concerns about a potential overheated state in the perpetual markets, signaling the possibility of an impending long-squeeze event.\n\nIn the wake of a recent short-term correction, a noteworthy development is the substantial decline in funding rates. This decline signifies that the overall sentiment remains bullish, concurrently indicating a cooling-off in the perpetual markets from their previously overheated state. Consequently, there exists the potential for the price to resume its upward trajectory following the completion of the ongoing correction stage."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation, an NPO supporting the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, has engaged in a major ETH swap. The organization reportedly exchanged over $1.5 million worth of ETH for Dai (DAI) stablecoin. The swap was initiated right before the Ethereum price extended below the $2,400 level today.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s ETH swap & other whale transactions\n\nAccording to data from Etherscan, a blockchain tracking platform, the Ethereum Foundation sold 700 ETH on Cow Protocol, valued at $1.68 million, considering the price of $2,409 at the time. Subsequently, the organization acquired 1.68 million DAI tokens. The sell-off move comes after the crypto extended massive declines in today\u2019s trading session.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition, major ETH whale activity suggests a massive sell-off, which could push the prices down further. According to Whale Alert, the most recent transaction witnessed a dump of 27,729 ETH worth $66.19 million to Binance via an undisclosed wallet. Moreover, another whale transfer registered a shift of 10,000 ETH, valued at $23.88 million, to Binance.\n\nFurthermore, 13,198 ETH (worth $32.08 million) was offloaded to Coinbase through an unknown wallet. The three recent transactions account for a dump of ETH worth $122.15 million within five hours. Earlier, about 15 hours before the latest transaction, a massive $151.02 million worth of ETH was moved to Bitfinex.\n\nAlso Read: Will ETH Price Hit $2000? Expanding Channel Pattern Sets Dive Below $2400\n\nETH Price falls below $2,400\n\nThe Ethereum price is hitting lower lows lately after it plunged lower than $2,400. The ETH value dropped to $2,378.69, indicating a decline of 3.78% at press time on Monday, January 22. The crypto held a market cap of $285.89 billion, down by 3.77%.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH\u2019s trading volume skyrocketed by 87.08% to $8.71 billion in the past 24 hours. Whilst, the ETH price attained a low of $2,361.66 during the day. Earlier, after the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant upswing and surged to a high of $2,710.42.\n\nOn the other hand, the moving average indicators on TradingView suggest that the ETH holders should opt for a \u2018sell\u2019 move. The ETH price is trading fairly below the 10-day EMA of 2,461.6, indicating a short-term bearish downturn. However, ETH is trading above the 50-day EMA and 100-day EMA of 2,325 and 2,147.3, respectively, indicating a bullish sentiment in the long term.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Remains Within Key Demand, Here\u2019s the Next Support Level"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s market share in stablecoins soared from 1.2% to nearly 32%.\n\nSolana\u2019s network is now challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nSolana is faster, but Ethereum still has the first-mover advantage.\n\nEthereum, the biggest smart contract network, has long dominated the stablecoin market. However, high transaction costs and slow speeds have been constant issues for users. Now, Solana is finally taking advantage of this.\n\nBetween October 2023 and January 2024, Solana experienced an unprecedented surge in market share, leaping from a modest 1.2% to nearly 32%. This dramatic increase signals a potential realignment in the stablecoin market, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance.\n\nSolana\u2019s Stablecoin Volume Rivals Ethereum\n\nRecent data shows that Solana\u2019s total stablecoin volume reached $322 billion in January after a dramatic surge since October. In that period, Solana\u2019s volume went from a modest $12 billion in the market to within striking distance of Ethereum.\n\nThe USD Coin\u2019s (USDC) and Paxos\u2019 stablecoin USDP\u2019s launch on the Solana blockchain played crucial roles in this growth. These tokens attracted more users and transactions to Solana.\n\nEthereum, which long dominated stablecoin transfers, registered a $335 volume in January, just $13 billion more than Solana. Now, Solana is close to flipping Ethereum in transfers after taking the second spot, overtaking the Tron Network.\n\nCan Solana Overtake Ethereum?\n\nOne of Solana\u2019s most compelling advantages is its high transaction speeds. Boasting a system capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, Solana offers an efficient and scalable solution for stablecoin transfers. This means that users must pay lesser fees when sending money by Solana.\n\nStill, it won\u2019t be easy for Solana to flip Ethereum. As the first mover in the blockchain industry, Ethereum has established a robust ecosystem, a loyal user base, and decentralized applications. This first-mover advantage provides Ethereum with a significant competitive edge.\n\nMoreover, despite challenges, Ethereum continues to innovate. The platform is actively addressing its limitations with upgrades to improve scalability and efficiency, such as Ethereum 2.0.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict future market movements in certain, current trends show that Solana has an advantage over Ethereum. However, overtaking Ethereum involves challenges such as building trust with users and ensuring the security and scalability of the network. Solana\u2019s success will depend on that.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSolana\u2019s rise in the stablecoin market came after SOL saw a dramatic rise in 2023. On Monday, January 22, Solana was up 254.79% from last year, having recovered from the FTX crash.\n\nSolana Mobile\u2019s smartphone launch has also boosted the credibility of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSolana\u2019s adoption and its blockchain\u2019s performance are not just about SOL. They also drive the adoption and mainstream acceptance of blockchain technology.\n\nRead more about Solana\u2019s surge in the stablecoin market:\n\nSolana Inks Record-High $300B Stablecoin Volume in January\n\n\n\nRead more about the new crypto phone by Solana Mobile:\n\nSolana\u2019s New Phone Bags 30k Preorders Ahead of 2025 Release"

According to Ethereum client diversity data, 84% of Ethereum validators rely on it, raising security apprehensions within the community over its dominance.\n\nThe concerns were escalated after a bug issue briefly took all Nethermind validators (approximately 10% of the network) offline. Although a prompt fix was implemented, community members highlighted the potential impact of a similar occurrence on Geth.\n\nLachlan Feeney of Labrys, the development studio behind MEV Watch, a tool addressing censorship risks on the Ethereum blockchain, explicitly warned that stakers running Geth face the prospect of losing up to 100% of their assets in the event of critical bug discovery, which instantly halts the network chain\u2019s finalization."

Peirce mentioned that the regulators will change their approval process for ETH ETF applicants, and they will make regular consumer and market considerations, as it does with all ETF products.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right.\u201d \u2013 Hester Peirce, SEC Commissioner\n\nNEW: SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce tells me the SEC won't repeat the same mistakes with ETH ETFs after fumbling Bitcoin ETFs:\n\n\n\n\"That's not how we're going to do our approvals \u2026 I think that kind of a lesson will certainly stick with us.pic.twitter.com/QNu52Gmr3H \u2014 Zack Guzm\u00e1n (@zGuz) January 23, 2024\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase faces headwinds as Bitcoin and ETF interest dips, says JPMorgan\n\nThe Commissioner also expressed her frustration over the long delays in Bitcoin ETF approvals, as she always thought these products met the requirements for approval long ago.\n\nPeirce also shed light on the SEC\u2019s X account hack, which previously posted the fake approval post, leading to a brief market manipulation. She believes the hack might not have happened if the SEC hadn\u2019t built up so much attention around these approvals and that the agency could\u2019ve avoided this by using its regular approach to ETF applications.\n\nThe lack of heightened anticipation will be a key consideration in Ethereum ETF approvals, as the SEC shouldn\u2019t be building hype around a regulatory decision.\n\nPeirce further emphasized that approving spot Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the SEC will change how it regulates crypto. She also mentioned that the agency is not in the business of policing crypto, rather its focus will also be on regulating securities products based on crypto that trades on securities exchanges, just as it does with the gold market.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Polymer Aims to Unify Ethereum Ecosystem With 'Interoperability Hub' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s a new entrant in the already very crowded field of Ethereum layer-2 solutions\u2014and this one wants to be the chain that rules them all.\n\nPolymer today announced it has completed a $23 million Series A with investments from top-tier VCs in the crypto space, including Coinbase, Placeholder, and Digital Currency Group. The company plans to use the cash to build its eponymous network, which it describes as \u201cthe first Ethereum Layer 2 that provides interoperability-as-a-service to Ethereum and its rollups.\u201d\n\nWhat that means, essentially, is that Polymer aims to be a hub, of sorts, for Ethereum and all other Ethereum-based networks, such as Arbitrum and Optimism. It\u2019s the network you\u2019d use to defragment the vast Ethereum ecosystem, and the one that would make sure that the financial data, assets, and applications across the ecosystem all play nice\u2014at least, that\u2019s the plan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo do that, Polymer uses the Cosmos IBC protocol. Cosmos basically provides the software framework from which all manner of blockchains can be built. There are many popular Cosmos-based chains on the market today, such as Injective, Cronos, Thorchain, and the buzzy Celestia. The Polymer team thinks IBC can be to Web3 what TCP/IP was for the internet.\n\n\u201cThere were several different organizations and universities that established TCP/IP as the internet\u2019s standard. We\u2019re one of those organizations trying to establish IBC as the standard for interoperability in Web3,\u201d Polymer co-founder Peter Kim told Decrypt.\n\nThe interoperability holy grail\n\nPolymer aims to empower developers to build cross-chain applications by introducing a \u201cneutral standard\u201d that can be used to deploy applications on multiple chains, without the usual headaches that this entails. The standard, according to Polymer, will allow applications on different chains to communicate with each other\u2014without introducing new trust assumptions.\n\nUniversal communication across blockchains is hard, and users end up carrying the burden of this by being confined to only using applications that are available on the blockchain or layer-2 network they\u2019re using at any given time. This results in users typically picking a chain where they place most of their capital and leaving it there. And this can be especially problematic in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nData can\u2019t be passed between decentralized applications on different layer 2\u2019s because the system \u201clacks a decentralized and open interoperability standard,\u201d Polymer said in a press release. As such, Ethereum and its many rollups are the first market Polymer is focusing on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolymer co-founder Bo Du told Decrypt that while Polymer is still in a private testnet, he encourages builders working on interesting projects to reach out to him directly so that he can \u201cget them building right away.\u201d Once they\u2019ve moved on from their private testnet, they\u2019ll be launching a partner program to help onboard new developers.\n\nDu will have plenty of competition though. Ethereum is littered with layer-2s, rollups and sidechains that all compete for both market and mindshare. Throughout the years, we\u2019ve seen many Layer 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s make a big splash\u2014only to fizzle out due to not being able to capture the attention of builders. There was a point in time where even Tezos was called a \u201cghost chain\u201d due to its lack of developer attention. There are only so many crypto devs to go around, after all\u2014and fewer and fewer every year, according to Electric Capital.\n\nBlockchain interoperability is also something of a \u201choly grail\u201d in crypto\u2014and has been for some time. Competing Ethereum-based network Layer Zero has also thrown its hat in the interoperability ring, and has seen a lot of usage\u2014although it\u2019s largely driven by speculation that early participants will receive an airdrop.\n\nWhy neutral standards are important\n\nStill, Polymer believes it can set itself apart from the pack by introducing a \u201cneutral standard\u201d that other Ethereum-based chains will then abide by.\n\n\u201cThe reason standards are important is that any of these subprotocols can be difficult for an application developer to spec out, implement, and most importantly, do the prior two correctly,\u201d Du told Decrypt.\n\nIn other words, having no standards in place for cross-chain operability makes building applications that facilitate it far more challenging. Developers have to essentially build everything from scratch. If you\u2019re a developer building a cross-chain application, you need to build an integration for each chain you want to be compatible with. Without standards in place, each of these integrations looks different. Each chain integration is a new problem for a dev team to figure out.\n\nBut creating a new standard is easier said than done.\n\nYou not only need to build the product, you then need to build the social consensus from the community being addressed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolymer believes the best way to achieve this is through neutrality, and making it as easy and robust as possible for developers to work with. The company acknowledges that there are others out there already addressing cross-chain operability, but it believes those competitors sacrifice neutrality in exchange for simplicity or speed to market.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, both chain developers and application developers are more likely to adopt standards that are neutral and not tied to any one company. While Polymer is, in fact, a company, IBC is an open-source framework\u2014one that has the neutrality that Polymer believes it needs in order to become the new standard for interoperability."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.\n\nOver the past 2 days, an entity with 8 wallets withdrew $46.02M in $ETH from #Binance and #Bitfinex at ~$2,419, then staked with #Lido:\n\n\n\n- 5 wallets withdrew 50.15M $USDT from #Aave to CEX for 19,021 $ETH ($46.02M).\n\n\n\n- 3 wallets still hold ~30M $USDT in #Aave and may deposit it\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vqPYTTaWjT \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 23, 2024\n\nSubsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.\n\nEthereum price struggles\n\nThe timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.\n\nCoinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses."

The latest update introduces several new features, including multichain support, an in-app web browser, a revamped visual design, and support for multi-party computation (MPC).\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon and BNB Chain. This integration allows users to easily manage and transfer assets across multiple blockchain networks from a single wallet. The new version of the Ronin wallet includes an in-app web browser that enables users to access decentralized applications (dApps) and interact with blockchain-based services directly from the wallet.\n\nThe wallet's visual design has been revamped to provide more detailed information on specific token activities and NFT information. Users can now easily view their asset balances, transaction history, and NFT collection in a more user-friendly interface.\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports MPC, an optional security feature that allows users to divide their wallet's login information on the backend. This feature requires two or more pieces of login information instead of a single private key, enhancing the security of the wallet. When combined with a social login, the MPC feature can be used across multiple Ronin-based games like Axie Infinity and Pixels without creating separate wallets for each game.\n\nThe Ronin wallet upgrade is a significant step forward for the Ronin ecosystem, providing users with a more versatile and secure platform for managing their digital assets. The addition of multichain support and other features is likely to attract new users and further drive the adoption of the Ronin blockchain.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Ethereum's record number of hodlers downgrades Bitcoin to second place - Baltic Times",
        "content": "Comparisons between Bitcoin and Ethereum have made the topic of many crypto debates, leading to many different conclusions. Bitcoin is the holder of many notable records and achievements, including being the first decentralized cryptocurrency established by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the most valuable digital asset and the one that occupies the largest share in the cryptocurrency market. As a result, Ethereum, which was founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has always lived in Bitcoin\u2019s shadow, alongside all the other digital currencies that emerged in its wake, forming the altcoin pack.\n\nHistorical cryptocurrency data reveals that the two assets have moved in tandem, with the flagship crypto dictating the price trajectory. Judging by the difference between the current Ethereum price and the Bitcoin price, the latter wins by a landslide. Ethereum always seems to be several steps behind Bitcoin, unable to pose a real threat to its dominance and yank it off its throne.\n\nHowever, if we delve a bit deeper, we can see that the altcoin leader also showcases a series of strong suits and key metrics that place it at the top of the cryptocurrency hierarchy, in front of its longtime rival, and hodler count is one of the areas where Ethereum excels.\n\nEthereum hits record number of hodlers in 2023\n\n2023 has been a good year for Ethereum for several reasons. The second-ranked crypto has been on an appreciation journey for the better part of the year, with a 20% gain in the last month and a 38% gain over the past 60 days. Apart from the considerable price increase, Ethereum has also seen a significant surge in hodler numbers.\n\nHodler is a popular crypto slang term that designates long-term holders of a cryptocurrency. These investors buy and hold onto assets regardless of price volatility, trusting their long-term value and their ability to weather market fluctuations.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, addresses that have held Ether for more than 12 months currently make up 72% of all Ethereum holders, reaching the highest level since 2018. At the moment, Ethereum counts approximately 73.9 million long-term holders, after a 44.2% increase, while Bitcoin\u2019s holder figures stand at 33.6 million.\n\nHodlers play an important role in the health and performance of digital assets. Coins backed by a large number of holders tend to be less susceptible to market volatility and are generally perceived as more resilient and trustworthy. So, the fact that Ethereum\u2019s holder community is growing is certainly a positive development for the network.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum also outclasses Bitcoin in terms of whales, which refers to persons or entities that own a large amount of a single cryptocurrency, between 1000 and 10,000 coins. By the latest count, the number of Ethereum whale addresses has recently reached 5,370, marking a 12% yearly increase, while Bitcoin whale wallets amount to 1,920.\n\nThis proves that Bitcoin is not the only coin boasting record-breaking performances in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ethereum outshines the original crypto in many ways, so even though there\u2019s still a huge price discrepancy between the two, the top altcoin continues to attract an increasing number of investors.\n\nWhat prompted Ethereum\u2019s holder increase?\n\nNot too long ago, Bitcoin used to hold supremacy in hodler numbers as well. What\u2019s more, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have had impressive runs this year and recorded increases in their hodler metrics. So, what exactly caused the tables to turn and lead to such a notable disparity between the two assets?\n\nEthereum\u2019s surge in long-term holders can be attributed to a series of factors. One of the most likely causes for the increase is the rise in Ethereum staking registered this year. The amount of staked Ether has nearly doubled since the beginning of 2023, with roughly 24% of all Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply being locked in staking deposits. Since most staked funds remained untouched for more than 12 months, this led to a major rise in the Holder Ratio.\n\nHowever, there are other factors that have contributed to the phenomenon which have to do with the purpose and the evolution of the two crypto projects. On one hand, Bitcoin has continued to operate as a deflationary store of value and a peer-to-peer form of digital money, so it hasn\u2019t strayed away from its original purpose and use cases.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has undergone massive transformations since its launch back in 2013. Designed by Vitalik Buterin as a programable blockchain, Ethereum started its journey as a platform that enables the deployment of decentralized apps (dApps). However, over the years and after multiple upgrades and updates, the Ethereum ecosystem expanded considerably, with applications and use cases spanning across many other areas, including gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nBitcoin is clearly more established and mainstream than Ethereum, having a longer track record in the market and being superior in terms of price performance and scalability. Ethereum is in a weaker position from this point of view, but price action is not the only aspect that attracts investors and drives crypto adoption.\n\nThe fact that Ethereum boasts a diversity of use cases and represents a hub for innovation in the crypto sphere has caught the eye of stakeholders and that has led to an increase in hodler numbers.\n\nThe Ethereum network also seems to respond better to the changing needs and demands of market participants. The Merge and Shapella upgrades, which saw Ethereum switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, stand as proof of Ethereum\u2019s adaptability, flexibility and its constant focus on innovation. These attributes have turned it into a decentralized blockchain powerhouse and continue to draw in more investors and holders.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nEthereum\u2019s record number of long-term holders might not be enough to steal the leader position from Bitcoin, so it\u2019s rather premature to make assumptions about a potential flippening in the near future. However, changes in this key metric serve as an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s strength and potential and are worth taking into account by crypto enthusiasts."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.\n\nThis potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum\u2019s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.\n\nAdditional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum\u2019s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.\n\nThe current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.\n\nBitcoin in trouble\n\nBitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.\n\nOn the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.\n\nShiba Inu gets hit\n\nThe token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.\n\nThe current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.\n\nIn terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range."

According to data from Spot on Chain, the organization has moved a total of 800 ETH for $1.937 million DAI at an average price of $2,422.\n\nWeb3 Firms and Internal Transfers: the New Trend\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s fund movement has spooked members of the community, it is worth noting that blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc. is also known to move significant XRP around month-on-month.\n\nThough different explanations are tied to some of these transactions, they are ideal for running functional Web3 firms and the trend might not taper down anytime soon."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is working to add another Ethereum execution client to its infrastructure as critics continue to sound the alarm over Geth dominance across the ecosystem.\n\nA post on X (formerly Twitter) published on Jan. 22 drew attention to the exchange\u2019s renewed efforts to move away from its total dependence on go-ethereum, or Geth. As the thread details, Coinbase Cloud found that Geth was the only Ethereum execution client that met its technical requirements when it launched Ethereum staking.\n\n1/ Execution client diversity on Ethereum is a critical concern for all of us at Coinbase.

Many other operators on the network have reached the same conclusion, which is part of the reason why 84% of Ethereum validators run Geth. However, the tide is turning,\u201d the thread reads.\n\nGeth is an Ethereum execution client that handles transactions and the deployment and execution of smart contracts.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs air concern over Vitalik\u2019s plan to increase gas limit\n\nCoinbase is now undertaking a technical assessment of alternative Ethereum execution clients with the intention of adding another to its infrastructure. The exchange is set to release a formal update on the process by the end of February 2024.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s statement regarding its dependence on Geth was prompted by an X post from cryptocurrency investor Aftab Hossain. Posting from his DCinvestor profile, which has around 236,000 followers, Hossain unpacked his decision to unstake Ether (ETH) from Coinbase due to its reliance on Geth:\n\ndear @coinbase\n\n\n\ntoday, i unstaked all of the ETH i had staked with you since the first day you offered it as a service. i kept it there to earn passive yield, but also to support your work for the crypto industry (which i greatly value)\n\n\n\nbut i can't ignore the risks of what\u2026 \u2014 DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) January 22, 2024\n\n\u201cI can't ignore the risks of what appears to be a single client staking setup (reliant on geth) at this time. If I have misinterpreted your architecture, please use this post as an opportunity to clarify it,\u201d Hossain wrote.\n\nThe post drew a direct reply from Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong, who noted that the exchange was looking into the matter. Hossain also had contact with Coinbase staking product lead John Zettler and protocol specialist Bienvenido (Ben) Rodriguez, with both indicating that the exchange is working to address community feedback.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Zettler and Coinbase regarding its reliance on Geth, the potential alternatives, and the potential risks of relying on a single execution client.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\n\nEthereum.org has a page dedicated to client diversity and estimates that 85% of all nodes operate on Geth. The page highlights the potential for a bug in Geth that affects transaction handling or execution payload, which could lead to consensus clients finalizing problematic or bugged transactions.\n\nConcerns around execution client bugs are pertinent after Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind addressed a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that reportedly caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum on Jan. 22.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "According to on-chain data from SolanaFloor, Solana is dominating other blockchains, including Ethereum and Polygon, across various non-fungible token (NFT) activity metrics in the third week of January.\n\nSolana Dominates Ethereum, Bitcoin In NFT Activity\n\nIn a post shared on X on January 23, Solana maintained its NFT dominance among competing blockchains, mainly Ethereum and other high throughput alternatives. Thus far, the blockchain has the highest numbers in unique wallets, transactions, unique buyers, and first-time wallets over the past week.\n\nTo illustrate, Solana had over 106,000 unique wallets by the third week of January 2024. This is more than twice those created in Ethereum. Meanwhile, there were over 22,000 first-time wallets on Solana, roughly 3X those in Ethereum and 2X in Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, more than 2.8 million transactions were posted on Solana. This figure is over 20X those in Ethereum during the same time frame.\n\nExtrapolating from this data suggests that the blockchain is increasingly popular among NFT projects, collectors, and traders. Several factors could be contributing to Solana\u2019s NFT success.\n\nThe platform is known for its high throughput and low transaction fees. Considering how minters and active traders are sensitive to trading fees, Solana is emerging as a layer-1 option for projects wishing to enjoy the security of the mainnet while also benefiting from low transaction fees.\n\nLegacy chains, including Ethereum, continue to struggle with on-chain scalability. Minting on the mainnet often translates to high fees, which can decrease profitability, especially for active traders and collectors.\n\nBeyond scalability advantages, Solana\u2019s ecosystem is rapidly expanding. Despite the catastrophic drop of SOL prices at the end of 2022, the spectacular revival in 2023 activated on-chain activity with meme coins blooming and NFT projects opting to launch on Solana.\n\nThe ongoing recovery of SOL and the increasing number of projects opting to deploy on the mainnet could further drive on-chain activities, including NFT minting and trading, to new levels in 2024.\n\nDevelopers At Work, Will SOL Reclaim $125?\n\nAs the network draws users, its developers are also working to make the platform more robust and decentralized. In 2024, Solana developers plan to activate Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Capital. This client will help further decentralize Solana\u2019s infrastructure, improve performance, and substantially improve reliability, eliminating network hitches that plagued the blockchain in 2022 and early 2023.\n\nSOL is cooling off, trading at around $80 when writing. The coin is down 34% from December 2023 peaks and below the dynamic 20-day moving average, pointing to bears.\n\nKey support remains at around $70. If there is demand at this price point, SOL may recover and retest $125 in the sessions ahead.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nWith the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), attention in the crypto space turns to the potential approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. However, JP Morgan analysts, in a note to clients, have expressed skepticism about the likelihood of approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nETH Facing Regulatory Challenges\n\nJP Morgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, are not so optimistic about the SEC approving Ethereum ETFs. The analysts attributed their cautious stance to regulatory and judicial considerations, estimating the likelihood of approval to be no higher than 50%.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand the arguments, we doubt the SEC will classify ether as a commodity by May,\u201d said JP Morgan analysts.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC recently delayed the decision on Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF, extending the deadline to March 5, 2024, for further evaluation. Moreover, the SEC\u2019s final decision on Spot Ethereum ETF applications is now anticipated between late January and August 2024.\n\nPerhaps, the approval of Ethereum futures ETFs in January 2024, completely acknowledging Ethereum as a commodity, brings a glimmer of hope. However, JP Morgan analysts emphasized that the SEC\u2019s classification of Ethereum\u2014whether as a commodity or a security\u2014will play a pivotal role in determining the fate of Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Impact on SEC Decision\n\nA key date that could provide more clarity on the possible introduction of these ETFs is January 25\u2014the deadline for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF application\n\nEarlier, grayscale, which successfully challenged the SEC in the past for rejecting its Bitcoin ETF, is now seeking approval for an Ethereum Spot ETF.

        "content": "SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: No Lawsuit Needed for Spot Ethereum ETF Approvals\n\nHester Peirce, a commissioner at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has stated that the SEC should not require a lawsuit to approve spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. Speaking to Coinage Media, Peirce emphasized that the SEC should learn from the Grayscale court ruling that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. She believes that the SEC should not need a court to tell it that its approach is \"arbitrary and capricious\" in order to make the right decisions.\n\nPeirce acknowledged that the facts and circumstances vary with each ETF application, but she expects the SEC to apply the same precedent that came from the Grayscale case. She stressed the importance of ensuring that the disclosures align with how the product actually works.\n\nSeveral companies, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, have submitted spot Ether ETF applications to the SEC for approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates a 70% chance of a spot Ether ETF approval by May. The SEC has specific deadlines to decide on each application, ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously stated that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF does not signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for other cryptocurrency ETF applications. He emphasized that most crypto assets are investment contracts subject to federal securities laws."

        "title": "Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is edging closer to significantly lower gas fees and faster transaction speeds for layer-2 rollups as the Dencun upgrade hits the network\u2019s three testnets in early 2024.\n\nThe Dencun network upgrade was activated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17 and introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Of particular interest is EIP-4844, which enables proto-danksharding, a highly anticipated improvement touted to reduce L2 transaction fees.\n\nPrysm encountered a bug right at Goerli's hard fork. The bug has been identified, and a fix is currently being merged. A hot patch image will be released within the next few hours. Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience!https://t.co/PR9V0lqoCN \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) January 17, 2024\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the deployment of Dencun to Goerli suffered a four-hour delay caused by a bug that prevented the testnet from finalizing the upgrade. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nebojsa Urosevic, co-founder of Ethereum development platform Tenderly, unpacked the details of the bug.\n\n\u201cThe network could not sync with nodes because of a bug in Prysm, Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake client,\" Urosevic said.\n\nThe Tenderly co-founder, who is also the senior vice president of its engineering team, noted that client synchronization delays are common, which allowed for the bug to be identified and rectified quickly:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why there are multiple clients and why testnets exist.\u201d\n\nEthereum Foundation protocol lead Tim Beiko also shared a debrief from the latest All Core Developers Execution Call on Jan. 18, which outlined the historical root issue. Historical roots are a legacy mechanism that Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain uses to manage the computational load of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nAs Beiko sums up, the bug was related to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake client Prysm setting the historical roots value to 0, which prevented the Goerli testnet from finalizing the Dencun upgrade:\n\nIn short, every 256 epochs, CL clients save a specific value, called the Historical Root. A bug in Prysm set this value to 0 instead of copying over the last historical root when Deneb activated. \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 18, 2024\n\nDencun roadmap\n\nAs the official Ethereum blog outlines, Dencun incorporates nine different EIPs. Urosevic highlighted proto-danksharding and blob transactions as the most anticipated of the EIPs:\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding is a major step toward improved Ethereum scalability, thanks to the use of blob-carrying transactions instead of calldata.\u201d\n\nUrosevic explains that data blobs will improve storage efficiency by making transaction data temporarily available in a compressed format. He adds that they are more cost-effective than calldata, with a potential cost reduction of 80%\u201390%.\n\nRelated: Big changes coming to Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction to save on gas\n\nFollowing the successful implementation on Goerli, the Sepolia and Holesky testnets are next in line to undergo the Dencun upgrade. Urosevic notes that successful deployment on all three testnets is required before plans are made to upgrade Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nDencun\u2019s storage improvements\n\nEthereum sidechain Gnosis\u2019 infrastructure director Philippe Schommers highlights that Dencun will provide more block space and lower costs to L2s, while data that was previously stored indefinitely on-chain will be discarded after two weeks:\n\n\u201cThis is scalability in a way that is compatible with our endgame without sacrificing decentralization.\u201d\n\nUrosevic echoes these sentiments, citing storage improvements as one of the major impacts of the Dencun upgrade.\n\n\u201cL2 networks will be able to store data on L1 more efficiently. Blobs will be deleted approximately every two weeks, which is enough for L2s to manage, retrieve and verify the data. This makes blobs cheaper than typical transaction calldata, which is stored indefinitely,\u201d Urosevic explains.\n\nThe result sees Dencun deliver lower gas fees and faster transaction fees, which stands to open opportunities for \u201cnew, more complex applications on L2 solutions\u201d:\n\n\u201cDencun will probably lower rollup transaction costs by up to 10 times, depending on blob space demand.\u201d\n\nRollups stand to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new upgrade, with their economic viability and scalability enhanced by reduced operational costs.\n\nAnurag Arjun, a co-founder of data availability blockchain Avail, adds that the significant growth in demand for block space from rollups in 2023 suggests an expected increase in the demand for block space for data availability from L2s moving forward:\n\n\u201cProto-danksharding will provide some relief, but it\u2019s clear that rollups need a whole lot more block space for data availability, and we need to be thinking about how we can achieve this in a way that still prioritizes decentralization, scalability and security,\u201d Arjun tells Cointelegraph.\n\nWhile the systematic upgrades of the Ethereum network work toward lower fees and faster transactions, protocols like Avail could help address the block space demands of rollups in the interim.\n\nRelated: Ether price jumps 20% vs. Bitcoin as BlackRock boosts Ethereum ETF bets\n\nArjun notes that recent benchmarks of Avail\u2019s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine Validium reduce transaction fees by 90% by posting transaction data to Avail instead of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt still settles to Ethereum and provides data availability guarantees that are decentralized and secure. This is becoming quite an attractive option for blockchains looking to move into the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nUrosevic describes the end game of the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet, commenting that its implementation will be the first time scalability issues are addressed directly on the mainnet. \u201cMultiple EIPs will bring greater storage efficiency, lower gas fees and an overall better experience for developers while making rollups even more cost-efficient,\u201d Urosevic said.\n\nMagazine: Slumdog billionaire 2: \u2018Top 10\u2026 brings no satisfaction\u2019 says Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal"

Per the report, BTC\u2019s adoption exploded primarily because of institutional interest and the coming of spot BTC ETFs from issuers like BlackRock.\n\nSpot BTC ETFs received the green light on Jan. 10 and saw billions in trading volume in the first week after trading opened.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of inscriptions and ordinals reinforced on-chain activity on crypto\u2019s largest decentralized network. Inscriptions allow users to create assets akin to Ethereum NFTs and ERC-20 tokens on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale CEO: Most spot Bitcoin ETFs will not survive\n\nBRC-20 tokens, as they are called, drew demand and scrutiny alike after debuting in the first half of 2023. CoinGecko tags this category as a $2.7 billion market, with speculators predicting further market cap appreciation during the year.\n\nConversely, developers questioned the new narrative, arguing that inscriptions are a bug, and even reported Bitcoin Ordinals to U.S. authorities.\n\nEthereum (ETH), crypto\u2019s second-largest network and asset, saw its ownership ascend from 89 million to 124 million. This 39% increase accounted for an estimated 21% of global owners. The Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked staked Ether and allowed withdrawals, is a major factor attributed to this growth.\n\nThe update was pivotal following Ethereum\u2019s transition from its former proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake design in the network\u2019s largest technological overhaul. Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade, Dencun is already in its testing phase and recently deployed on the Georli testnet.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Now that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the crypto space anticipates more ETFs to enter the market, particularly Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nDespite this, analysts at JP Morgan, an American multinational financial service firm, have revealed a less than optimistic outlook for the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Approval Prospects\n\nIn a note to clients issued on Thursday, January 18, JP Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the Managing Director at the financial service firm, expressed their reservations regarding the anticipated approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC.\n\nThe analysts cited regulatory and judicial reasons as the basis for their prediction, asserting that the likelihood of Ethereum Spot ETF approval is no higher than 50%.\n\n\u201cWhile we are sympathetic to the above arguments, we are skeptical that the SEC will classify ether as a commodity as soon as May,\u201d analysts at JP Morgan stated.\n\nJust last week, the SEC delayed the approval of Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF. The regulator postponed its decision date to March 5, 2024, stating it needed more time to evaluate Fidelity\u2019s application. Additionally, the deadline for the SEC\u2019s final decision on the Spot Ethereum ETF applications extends from late January to August 2024.\n\nThe most decisive date that would give the crypto space a better outlook on the potential launch of these ETFs is January 25, the deadline for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Spot ETF application.\n\nEarlier in June 2022, Grayscale took legal action against the SEC for its rejection of its Spot Bitcoin ETF. In August 2023, the asset management company emerged victorious in its lawsuit, after the US Columbia Court of Appeal ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nWith the SEC\u2019s recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF after months of legal and regulatory challenges, many crypto enthusiasts anticipate a lengthy regulatory process before the potential approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs. If Ethereum Spot ETFs are accepted by the SEC, then it would offer investors an unprecedented opportunity to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without the need to own it.\n\nETH bulls lose control to bears | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nWhy ETH Spot ETF Approval Hovers At 50%\n\nPresently, the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies in the United States is still shrouded in uncertainty. This includes XRP, which suffered a lawsuit from the SEC after the regulator labeled it a security in 2020. Additionally, there have been many other cryptocurrencies the SEC has identified as a security.\n\nThe potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs generally hinges on the SEC\u2019s classification of the digital asset, whether it is a commodity or a security. In January 2024, the regulatory agency approved Ethereum futures ETFs, \u2018implicitly\u2019 accepting Ethereum as a commodity.\n\nIf the SEC identifies Ethereum as a commodity, then the potential approval of an ETF application may be in sight. However, as JP Morgan analysts have stated, it may take a considerable amount of time before the SEC makes that decision.\n\nThe regulatory agency has continually taken an aggressive approach in its regulation of cryptocurrencies in the US. Following the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler publicly declared that the agency still does not approve or endorse Bitcoin, labeling all cryptocurrencies as investment contracts subject to federal securities laws.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market are down bad this week. But some of the biggest losers near the top of the market were once recently stars of the show, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIn recent weeks, all three of those top 20 cryptocurrencies were making big gains as they attracted institutional investor interest. Now, each has slipped by at least 14% over the past seven days, and have posted sizable losses on the day.\n\nEthereum is down sharply this morning, per data from CoinGecko, falling 7% over the past 24 hours to a current price of about $2,200 and pushing its seven-day dip to 14%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana is down almost 16% over the past seven days at a current price of $82.50. It has rebounded slightly from earlier this morning, but remains down about 5% on the day.\n\nMeanwhile AVAX, which is the 11th largest cryptocurrency, has plunged 19% on the week to a current price of just under $29. Like Solana, it has shored up some of its losses since this morning, now down about 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nIt was just over a week ago that Ethereum came just shy of hitting $2,700, its highest price since April 2022. Excitement over Ethereum grew amid the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs as investors considered the next wave of prospective institutional adoption, particularly as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked up the prospect of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nSOL had been on a big run starting from the end of October. It was expected to take a hit during the trial of disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, who was heavily invested in the asset via his now collapsed crypto empire, FTX.\n\nBut major companies such as Visa and Shopify sung the project's praises and said they'd use its blockchain. A growing developer base also meant the price of SOL shot up. It rose as high as $123 in December 2023, nearing a two-year high after plunging to a price of about $8 in December 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAVAX also attracted interest when investment banking giant J.P. Morgan said in November it had used the Avalanche blockchain to tokenize portfolios.\n\nLong-term holders have reason to be optimistic, though\u2014despite the recent dips in price, both coins over a one-year period are doing well: SOL is up 239%, while AVAX has jumped by 64%. Even Ethereum is up by 35% over the last year.\n\nThe broader crypto market has taken a nosedive as it follows the price action of the biggest digital asset by market cap, Bitcoin.\n\nSince crypto fund Grayscale converted its flagship BTC fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and started trading on the stock market, investors have been keen to redeem shares previously locked into the product.\n\nThis has put pressure on the price of the biggest and oldest digital coin in recent days.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Networks has been moving a very large number of its Ethereum holdings to exchanges in recent days. This unstaking of ETH and moving it to exchanges comes as part of its recovery plans amid the ongoing bankruptcy process.\n\nCelsius Moves $35 Million Worth of Ethereum\n\nIn the latest insights from on-chain data provider LookonChain, the Celsius wallet has executed significant transactions in the past 10 hours. A deposit of 13,000 ETH, equivalent to $30.34 million, was made to Coinbase, while another transaction involved the deposit of 2,200 ETH, amounting to $5.13 million, to FalconX.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs of the latest data, two staking wallets associated with Celsius continue to hold a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH). The combined holdings in these staking wallets total 557,081 ETH, valuing approximately $1.3 billion. These transactions and the significant Ethereum holdings in Celsius wallets add an interesting dimension to the ongoing movements and activities within the crypto space.\n\nArkham Intelligence revealed that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius liquidated over $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) coins. As said, this sale particularly aims at repaying creditors. Concurrently, Dune Analytics reported a more extensive trend of redemptions, with over $1.6 billion worth of staked Ethereum redeemed in the same timeframe. These redemptions represent the largest recorded since the Shanghai upgrade last year.\n\nETH Price Pressure\n\nAmid the recent movement of ETH coins by Celsius, the ETH price has come under strong selling pressure. As of press time, the ETH price has tanked an additional 4% dropping under $2,350 levels. Thus, one area of concern is that the ETH price has dropped under its key demand zone of $2,388 and $2,460.\n\nIf Ethereum is unable to sustain the mentioned support, there is a potential for a retracement to the subsequent significant support level, projected to be approximately $2,000. As shown in the Santiment chart, when there are sudden increases in big transactions by wealthy investors (whales), it aligns with moments when Ethereum holders are also taking profits, according to the NRPL metric. When these large wallet owners sell to take profits, it usually puts more selling pressure on the asset and causes prices to go down."

We\u2019ll be going through key moving averages and oscillators that will allow us to get a better idea of how Ethereum is positioned in the market right now.\n\nPeriod Daily Simple Daily Exponential Weekly Simple Weekly Exponential MA3 $ 2,483.53 (SELL) $ 2,416.91 (SELL) - - MA5 $ 2,452.01 (SELL) $ 2,380.54 (SELL) - - MA10 $ 2,463.33 (SELL) $ 2,323.92 (BUY) - - MA21 $ 2,395.77 (SELL) $ 2,232.92 (BUY) $ 2,799.51 (SELL) $ 2,033.55 (BUY) MA50 $ 2,313.67 (BUY) $ 2,074.80 (BUY) $ 2,482.72 (SELL) $ 1,900.02 (BUY) MA100 $ 2,104.79 (BUY) $ 1,945.07 (BUY) $ 1,607.35 (BUY) $ 1,876.10 (BUY) MA200 $ 1,927.88 (BUY) $ 1,854.46 (BUY) $ 1,986.60 (BUY) $ 1,657.07 (BUY)\n\nPeriod Value Action RSI (14) 53.13 NEUTRAL Stoch RSI (14) 67.40 NEUTRAL Stochastic Fast (14) 54.09 NEUTRAL Commodity Channel Index (20) 66.67 NEUTRAL Average Directional Index (14) 19.16 NEUTRAL Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) 122.52 NEUTRAL Momentum (10) -158.30 NEUTRAL MACD (12, 26) -7.52 NEUTRAL Williams Percent Range (14) -45.91 NEUTRAL Ultimate Oscillator (7, 14, 28) 53.13 NEUTRAL VWMA (10) 2,520.84 SELL Hull Moving Average (9) 2,471.57 SELL Ichimoku Cloud B/L (9, 26, 52, 26) 2,426.71 NEUTRAL\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is a widely used indicator that helps inform investors whether an asset is currently overbought or oversold. The RSI 14 for Ethereum is at 53.13, suggesting that ETH is currently neutral.\n\nThe 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 50) takes into account the closing price of Ethereum over the last 50 days. Currently, Ethereum is trading below the SMA 50 trendline, which is a bearish signal.\n\nMeanwhile, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 200) is a long-term trendline that\u2019s calculated by taking an average of the ETH closing price for the last 200 days. ETH is now trading below the SMA 200, signaling that the market is currently bearish.\n\nThe bottom line about this Ethereum prediction\n\nAfter considering the above factors, we can conclude that the current forecast for Ethereum price prediction is Neutral. ETH would have to increase by 8.06% to hit our $ 2,506.30 target within the next five days. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor the ETH market sentiment, the key support and resistance levels, and other metrics. However, we have to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable, and even the largest crypto assets display a lot of price volatility.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Remains Within Key Demand, Here\u2019s the Next Support Level - CoinGape",
        "content": "During the wider cryptocurrency market downturn, Ethereum has faced selling pressure, resulting in a 2.02% decrease in its price. It is currently trading at $2,421 with a market capitalization of $291 billion.\n\nEthereum Price Remains In the Key Demand Zone\n\nIn a recent market update, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez sheds light on the current state of Ethereum ($ETH). The second-largest cryptocurrency is positioned within a crucial demand zone, fluctuating between $2,388 and $2,460. According to Martinez, the strength of this support level will determine the trajectory for Ethereum in the near term, with a favorable scenario suggesting a clear path for upward movement due to minimal resistance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Martinez issues a cautionary note, indicating a potential downside if Ethereum fails to maintain the mentioned support. In such a scenario, there\u2019s a likelihood of a pullback to the next significant support area, estimated to be around $2,000. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these key levels as Ethereum navigates the current market conditions.\n\nKey ETH Developments\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum Dencun upgrade is likely to go live on the Sepolia testnet by January 30, with the corresponding upgrade on the Holesky testnet slated for activation on February 7. A comprehensive update on client releases for both upgrades is set to be consolidated and communicated through a blog post scheduled for January 23, providing stakeholders with detailed insights into the activation process for the respective testnets.\n\nThere is a level of optimism in the market regarding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by May 23 this year, aligning with the SEC deadline for the Ark 21Shares application. However, JPMorgan (JPM) suggests that the likelihood of the SEC granting approval for the ETF by May is estimated to be no more than 50%.\n\nSince the rise of the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF narrative in the market last year, attention has shifted to Ethereum as the next plausible candidate for spot ETF approval in the United States. This sentiment is reflected in the discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which, according to JPMorgan, has been contracting since the summer and maintaining around 12% over the past two months.\n\nJPMorgan notes that some argue the SEC\u2019s decision not to reference ETH in its lawsuit against crypto exchanges for securities law violations could imply the regulator is leaning toward classifying the cryptocurrency as a commodity in the coming months\u2014a crucial condition for spot ETF approval. Others contend that the approval of ether futures-based ETFs in September last year inherently suggests that ether is considered a commodity."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Drops Lower and ETH Takes a Hit \u2013 Time to Buy the Dip\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are facing pivotal moments. Bitcoin, the most prominent cryptocurrency, has witnessed a continual downward trajectory, plunging to the $41,000 threshold on Monday.\n\nThe entire global crypto market cap reflects this downturn, showing a 1.65% loss in the last 24 hours, settling at $1.62 trillion. Despite consolidating at $41,000 over the weekend, the market remains in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, creating a state of uncertainty.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is hovering around $2,350, a precarious position given its recent inability to breach the $2,500 level. Amidst these fluctuations, the crypto market is also reacting to recent developments such as Grayscale\u2019s substantial Bitcoin sell-off and the impact of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals.\n\nThese events are significantly influencing market dynamics, adding layers of complexity to the already intricate crypto trading environment.\n\nETF Approval: Impact on Bitcoin & Ethereum Flows\n\n\n\nThe recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has notably triggered selling pressure, leading to modest outflows totaling $21 million in cryptocurrency products.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced the largest outflows, amounting to $24.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, the Bitcoin Short fund, which profits from BTC\u2019s decline, saw an inflow of $12.7 million.\n\n#BTC has actually gone down in price since spot bitcoin ETFs hit the US market. https://t.co/EE2w85bxju You won't believe the 21 million reasons bitcoin ETFs are dumb as heck and super-risky! Oh wait, of course you will \u2014 Amy Castor (@ahcastor) January 21, 2024\n\nIn the meantime, the altcoins faced challenges, with Litecoin losing $1.5 million and Solana experiencing an $8.5 million outflow.\n\nIn terms of regional trends, Canada and Germany had significant outflows, while the USA and Brazil attracted inflows, with the USA leading at $263.2 million. Therefore, the news of outflows in Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the surge in trading volumes, likely contributed to selling pressure.\n\nHowever, the impact on BTC price depends on various factors, including market sentiment and external events.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s $2.14B Bitcoin Sale\n\n\n\nThe recent slowdown in cryptocurrency market momentum can partly be attributed to Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, offloading approximately $2.14 billion worth of Bitcoin, totaling about 52,227 BTC.\n\nThis significant sale occurred in the wake of the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, a pivotal development in the financial integration of cryptocurrencies. Other major players like BlackRock\u2019s iShares, Fidelity, and Bitwise also hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off had a impact on Bitcoin prices, causing a temporary setback. However, the overall market context suggests that the fundamental drivers of the bull market, like growing crypto adoption and institutional interest, remain strong.\n\nBitcoin has a history of bouncing back from corrections, and the market is likely to recover once the immediate impact subsides.\n\nHence, Grayscale\u2019s massive Bitcoin sell-off, totaling $2.14 billion, triggered a swift dip in BTC prices. Despite this setback, the market\u2019s fundamentals, driven by increasing adoption and institutional interest, suggest a potential recovery.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction"

        "content": "Altcoin Crypto Funds Like Ethereum and Solana See Outflows After Bitcoin ETFs Launch\n\nA new report from digital asset fund manager CoinShares reveals that investors are withdrawing funds from high-profile crypto funds following the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this month. According to CoinShares, investors pulled $21 million out of crypto funds issuers last week.\n\nCoinShares suggests that investors seeking exposure to digital assets are shifting their money into the new Bitcoin ETFs. The report notes that \"incumbent, higher cost issuers suffered in the U.S., seeing $2.9 billion of outflows, while newly issued ETFs have now seen a total of $4.13 billion inflows since launch.\"\n\nIn contrast, short Bitcoin products, which bet on the price of crypto going down, received inflows of around $13 million, as investors bet on further price weakness from Bitcoin. Other altcoin funds providing exposure to Ethereum and Solana also experienced outflows, reaching $14 million and $8.5 million respectively.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10 marked a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. Of the 10 ETFs currently trading, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust is the best performer, with $1.3 billion in assets under management.\n\nHowever, Grayscale, which manages billions of dollars worth of crypto assets, has experienced significant outflows. The Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recently converted to a Bitcoin ETF, and investors have been cashing out rapidly. CoinShares reports that over $2.2 billion has been withdrawn from GBTC since its conversion.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

However, this price decline has continued amid a broader market correction.\n\nETH Sheds Recent Gains\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $2,320, down nearly 6% in the past 24 hours as it sheds gains that had seen it surpass the $2,600 price point on speculation that the SEC was set to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024.\n\nThe recent market correction follows concerns over significant outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, which have placed downward pressure on the BTC price.\n\nOn Sunday, January 21, prominent analyst Ali Martinez warned that ETH risked a pullback to the $2,000 price level if it failed to hold support at $2,388.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum\u2019s price dip appears more linked to a broader market correction than the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sell-off.\n\nExperts have predicted that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe move from the Ethereum Foundation potentially increases the selling pressure on ETH.\n\nRead this for more on Ethereum\u2019s recent dump:\n\nWhales Pour XRP & ETH into CEXs, Triggering Altcoin Sell-off\n\n\n\nFind out more about the oral arguments in the SEC case against Binance:\n\nHere\u2019s Why Tense Binance SEC Court Drama May End in a Split"

        "content": "The crypto industry eagerly anticipates the official mainnet for Dencun\u2019s upgrade that will potentially reduce the outrageous gas fees associated with Ethereum.\n\nIn a significant stride toward reducing gas fees and enhancing transaction speeds, the Ethereum ecosystem is nearing a transformative shift with the introduction of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade, activated on the Goerli testnet on January 17, promises to address key challenges, particularly in the realm of layer-2 (L2) rollups.\n\nDencun to Boast Ethereum\u2019s Efficiency\n\nDencun\u2019s upgrade integrates several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with a spotlight on EIP-4844. The proposal introduces proto-danksharding, a highly anticipated enhancement poised to reduce L2 transaction fees significantly.\n\nIn addition to the EIP-4844, the Dencun upgrade introduces changes to both Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layers, incorporating a total of nine distinct EIPs. Among these, proto-danksharding and blob transactions emerge as particularly awaited improvements.\n\nProto-danksharding transforms transaction handling by employing blob-carrying transactions instead of calldata. This innovation bolsters scalability and promises substantial cost reductions, estimated between 80% and 90%.\n\nOther EIPs expected to come with the Dencun upgrade include Transient storage opcodes (EIP-1153), Beacon block root integration in the EVM (EIP-4788), and the introduction of Shard Blob Transactions (EIP-4844).\n\nThese advancements collectively propel Dencun toward a more efficient and cost-effective Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDencun Timeline Commitment\n\nOn January 17, the Dencun\u2019s upgrade experienced a temporary setback during its deployment of Goerli. Ethereum core developers encountered a four-hour delay during the activation of the testnet due to a bug in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake client Prysm.\n\nHowever, experts believe such challenges are instrumental in refining the system despite the temporary setback.\n\nNebojsa Urosevic, co-founder of the Ethereum development platform Tenderly, shed light on the bug, emphasizing that synchronization delays are common and can be quickly rectified due to the existence of multiple clients and testnets.\n\nDespite the issues during the Goerli testnet, the Ethereum core developers remain committed to the Sepolia and Holesky testnet launch timeline.\n\nThe developers plan to continue with the release scheduled for Sepolia on January 30, 2024, and Holesky on February 7, 2024. According to the official Ethereum blog post, once the three upgrades run effectively without issues on the testnets, mainnet activation will be scheduled for launch.\n\nChristine Kim, vice president of the research team at Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused financial services firm in the United States, said there is a 60% probability of the upgrade\u2019s mainnet activation by the end of March.\n\nThe crypto industry eagerly anticipates the official mainnet for Dencun\u2019s upgrade that will potentially reduce the outrageous gas fees associated with Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Dominates Developer Preferences\n\nMeanwhile, while the Ethereum community awaits the mainnet debut of Dencun\u2019s upgrade, a recent report by Electric Capital found that interest in the blockchain protocol has continued to surge among developers.\n\nAccording to the study, Ethereum is the preferred blockchain for crypto developers, with over 70% of new contract codes debuting on the network. The 2023 Crypto Developer Report discovered that the developers are now living outside North America in countries in Latin America and Western Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the report found that Ethereum\u2019s appeal lies in its distinctive smart contract code, initiating 71% of contracts on the platform.\n\nA noteworthy trend is the surge in multi-chain developers, increasing from 3% in 2015 to an impressive 34% in 2023, reflecting a tenfold rise in eight years. This cross-pollination extends between Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains, encompassing BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and various layer 2 networks.\n\nElectric Capital observed that BNB Chain hosts the largest share of multi-chain developers, followed by Ethereum at 39%, Polygon at 36%, Arbitrum at 24%, and Avalanche at 18%.\n\nInterestingly, the report also disclosed that 40% of developers actively engaged with both the Ethereum and Bitcoin protocols in 2023. Despite Bitcoin experiencing a 25% decline in monthly active developers, Ethereum remained resilient. The drop in Bitcoin\u2019s figures was mainly attributed to part-time developers and those exploring multi-chain solutions."

        "content": "Since Ethereum (ETH) peaked at $2,717 in the last two weeks, the asset has experienced a gradual decline, culminating in its arrival at a key demand zone, which could be instrumental in determining its imminent price trajectory, according to a prominent crypto analyst.\n\nCritical Support Zone Flags Continuous Bearish Move\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Ali has pinpointed a critical demand zone for ETH, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460. The resilience of this support level could pave the way for an upward trajectory, offering Ethereum a much-needed respite from bearish pressures.\n\nHowever, should Ethereum falter, a bearish slide to the next major support level of around $2,000 may be imminent. Such a decline would represent a significant drop of nearly 20% from its current price around the $2,300 mark, posing a stern test for Ethereum\u2019s market upward stability.\n\n#Ethereum Market Update: $ETH is currently in a key demand zone, ranging between $2,388 and $2,460. If this support holds strong, there\u2019s a clear path ahead with minimal resistance, offering a potential for upward movement. \u26a0\ufe0f However, if #ETH fails to maintain this level, we\u2026 pic.twitter.com/F0HfyrSdGF \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 21, 2024\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum has witnessed a noticeable 4.3% decrease in value, breaching Ali\u2019s critical demand zone. Currently, ETH trades at $2,368, signaling a possibility of a further plunge from here.\n\nThis price dip is mirrored in Ethereum\u2019s trading volume, which has seen a significant decrease from $19 billion last Monday to just over $10 billion today, indicating lesser trading activity and a shift in investor sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Dynamics: Whales Buying Dip and Rising Dominance\n\nThe current market dip has not gone unnoticed by savvy investors. According to Lookonchain, a crypto analytics platform, a prominent Ethereum whale has capitalized on the opportunity, acquiring 3,600 ETH valued at around $8.9 million.\n\nAfter the price of $ETH dropped today, this smart whale bought 3,600 $ETH($8.9M) back at a lower price 5 hours ago. This whale is very good at buying $ETH at low prices and selling $ETH at highs. The profit is ~$25.8M currently!https://t.co/UzXbheftr1 pic.twitter.com/DannZzsQVk \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 19, 2024\n\nThis strategic move is part of a larger pattern observed in the whale\u2019s trading history, marked by buying low and selling high. This tactic has reportedly amassed profits estimated at $25.8 million.\n\nAmid this bearishness, Ethereum has shown resilience in terms of market dominance. A recent report by analytics firm Santiment reveals that Ethereum\u2019s market share, relative to the total crypto market capitalization, has surged by roughly 22.4% in just one week.\n\nThis growth is complemented by a significant increase in active Ethereum addresses, with an average of 89,400 new addresses joining the network daily, reaching a peak of 96,300 new addresses in a single day.\n\nThese figures suggest a growing interest and engagement in the Ethereum ecosystem despite the current market conditions.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum\u2018s price dominance continues to surge against #Bitcoin\u2018s, now +22.4% in a week.

        "content": "Since ETFs were approved, the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Gap has declined.\n\nThe coin\u2019s price remained prone to swings despite the decrease in volatility.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] Coinbase Premium Gap has shrunk since the launch of Bitcoin [BTC] spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the 10th of January, data from CryptoQuant revealed.\n\nThis metric tracks the difference between ETH\u2019s price on Coinbase and Binance. When this indicator returns a positive value and rises, it means that the coin is trading at a premium on Coinbase.\n\nConversely, when it declines, it means that the coin trades at a much lower price on Coinbase than on Binance, mostly due to a shift in sentiment or buying pressure between US-based investors.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, ETH\u2019s Coinbase Premium Gap was -1.53 at press time, declining by over 450% since BTC ETF went live.\n\nAn assessment of the Asian markets revealed that the coin\u2019s Korean Premium Gap stayed positive after BTC ETFs became tradable.\n\nETH\u2019s Korean Premium Gap measures the price gap between South Korean exchanges and other exchanges. When it climbs, it indicates the presence of strong buying pressure among Korean retail investors.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s Korean Premium Gap was 3.32, per data from CryptoQuant.\n\nImpending price volatility?\n\nCoinbase ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Hence, the sustained decline in ETH\u2019s Premium Gap on the exchange is one to take note of.\n\nThis is because a sustained discrepancy between exchange prices could increase Ethereum\u2019s market volatility.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator on a daily chart showed a steady widening of the gap between this indicator\u2019s upper and lower bands.\n\nWhenever this gap widens, it signals that an asset\u2019s price deviates more from its average.\n\nHowever, at the same time, ETH\u2019s Average True Range (ATR) and its Chaikin Volatility, which are also market volatility markers, have trended downward.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s ATR was 102.20, falling by 18% since the 12th of January. Likewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Volatility has since plunged by over 150%.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWhen these indicators trend downward, it suggests a decrease in the volatility of an asset\u2019s price movements.\n\nTherefore, while ETH\u2019s BB indicator hints at potential price swings, the declining ATR and Chaikin Volatility suggest that the trend has become less volatile."

Details were scarce, but the hush-hush retreat has now inspired a new initiative\u2014spinoff \u201cZu-villages\u201d funded by Ethereum grants.\n\nEthereum Funds New \u2018Zu-Villages\u2019 Inspired by Invite-Only Gathering\n\n\n\nA recent post on the blockchain crowdfunding platform Gitcoin announced quarterly matching pools totaling 250 ETH, around $590,000 at current prices. This has fueled speculation that Zuzalu may reconvene this year.\n\nThis past weekend I was fortunate enough to join the Zuzalu camp put on by @VitalikButerin and others. @afropolitan welcome me with opened arms and gave us all a sense of being and direction. A short thread on my experience \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/rvL19e4ies \u2014 jordan (@cryptosmiff) May 4, 2023\n\nThe stated goals are advancing \u201cpop-up city\u201d events and supporting technology-driven projects. Recipients can tap into two pools\u2014166.5 ETH for events and 83.5 ETH for tech projects.\n\nTo qualify for the matched funds, at least one team member must have been invited to Zuzalu last year and participated for a minimum of one week. The blog post does not state if Zuzalu is happening again this year or provide details on timing or location.\n\nButerin is supposedly contributing a big portion of the ETH grants, although a representative later backtracked, telling CoinDesk there is no record of Buterin committing funds. His precise involvement is unclear as of now.\n\nZuzalu Retreat Shrouded in Mystery\n\n\n\nThe Zuzalu retreat itself is shrouded in some secrecy. It was never announced beforehand and details trickled out after the fact via social media posts. Some paint it as a glorified camp discussing esoteric topics, while others reference a Silicon Valley exclusivity.\n\nBut it seemingly made an impression on Buterin and other creators who hope to replicate the temporary community under the Zu-village banner. The requirement of at least one core member who attended Zuzalu 2023 hints at an air of exclusivity around the new pop-ups as well."

The limitations of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4,844 in scaling Ethereum were examined.\n\nMoreover, this highlights the need for more efficient data publication methods. In this context, the PeerDAS protocol offered a promising approach, bringing forth a blend of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe AMA also tackled the challenge of liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum L2. Vitalik Buterin expressed optimism about open, permissionless cross-L2 transfer protocols, citing UniswapX as a notable example.\n\nThis approach aims to address the composability challenges on ETH L2, facilitating smoother asset transfers across different layers.\n\nETH\u2019s potential improvement prospects\n\nThe discussion ventured into the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), exploring potential collaborative avenues. The role of privacy in Ethereum\u2019s future was another crucial topic, with an emphasis on balancing privacy features with scalability and other pressing concerns.\n\nA significant part of the AMA was dedicated to discussing the re-stake risk of EigenLayer and its implications for Ethereum\u2019s security model. The conversation also explored the scenario of most L2s choosing alternative data availability (DA) layers over ETH. This further helps in assessing the impact on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe AMA highlighted the Ethereum Foundation\u2018s commitment to enhancing the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability, security, and user experience.\n\nWhat does ETH\u2019s future hold?\n\nWith these discussions, the Ethereum community aims to navigate the complexities of blockchain technology. Also, this ensures Ethereum L2 remains at the forefront of innovation and user-centric development.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s AMA represents a vital effort in addressing the community\u2019s concerns and guiding the blockchain\u2019s future trajectory. As ETH continues to evolve, these discussions play a critical role in shaping its path toward a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform."

Ethereum price crashed right after the ETF approval, which was unexpected for most investors. What might be the reason? Is there any hope for Ethereum price to go up?\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price DOWN?\n\nIn the past seven days, Ethereum has experienced a notable price downturn, declining from $2,600 to $2,300. This substantial drop of $300 reflects a significant shift in market sentiment and raises questions about the factors contributing to this downward movement. Metrics such as trading volume, market capitalization, and key technical indicators should be closely examined to better understand the extent of this price crash.\n\nIn fact, most day traders were anticipating this huge event led many speculators to short cryptos, including Ethereum.\n\nWill an Ethereum ETF Approval Help ETH Prices?\n\nThe vigorous market movement is fueled by speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has intensified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. An Ethereum ETF approval could serve as a significant catalyst, attracting a new wave of institutional and retail investment.\n\nShould you Buy Ethereum Today?\n\nInvestors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions haven\u2019t triggered the expected volatility, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to Bitcoin\u2019s investment landscape. It is advised currently to wait for Ethereum to stabilize around a support price before taking any position on ETH.\n\nFrom the looks of it, it seems as if Ethereum is eyeing the next support price of $2,280 and the next support at $2,200.\n\nWhere to Trade Ethereum?\n\nBitget emerges as an excellent choice for cryptocurrency enthusiasts seeking a reliable broker for purchasing digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH).

        "title": "Ethereum Price Crash 2024 Happening Now? Or Is Ethereum \u2018Simply\u2019 Retracing? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "The short answer: we are not concerned about an Ethereum price crash, for many reasons. However, the panic that is being created for Ethereum\u2019s retracement might make you think otherwise. As always, we prefer to let the data speak, first and foremost the charts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s topping pattern was too obvious\n\nWe explained that is not the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, contrary to what many make you believe. Consequently, this is not the end of Ethereum\u2019s bull market and there should be no Ethereum price crash.\n\nIt was so clear that a breakdown in Bitcoin would occur, it was too obvious.\n\nBut a pullback and a price crash are two completely different things.\n\nWe predicted, mid-December, in our premium service, and recommended members in our crypto investing research service to take profits. We called for a choppy January, that\u2019s what we got.\n\nFrom our premium crypto alert sent on Dec 21st, 2023, \u2018How To Spend Cash Realized From Free Tokens? Hint: The Mega Opportunities Of 2024!\u2018 (available for anyone after signing up here):\n\nShort term, it is blatantly clear that we are hitting a big resistance area. Like with any resistance area that has its roots many years back in time, the local top requires time to complete. In the end, if anything, the market would like to keep this bull market hidden. BTC has to come down a bit, it might be 34.5k or a little higher where it will find support. It might be a slow process, choppy, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nIt\u2019s not a crash. It is a buy opportunity.\n\nIn that same premium research alert, mentioned before, we wrote the following:\n\nMuch more important is the following: the big, huge, giant profits will be made in tokens that nobody is talking about. We see tremendous reversals. We cannot believe what we start seeing on the charts: it\u2019s going to be huge, mark our words. But a minority will hit those multi-baggers. Why? Because the market will follow a different script, a very different script. The point is that the market never follows the same path, every cycle is different. The majority of investors will be looking for a replay of 2020/2021, we are telling you \u2018it won\u2019t happen like 2 years ago\u2019, it will happen in a very different way.\n\nIndeed, the concept of the HIDDEN BULL MARKET is one we have covered extensively in our research service. Interestingly, we explained it even on our public blog: Crypto\u2019s bull market 2024 is an hidden bull market.\n\nHidden bull market? What about Ethereum\u2019s price crash?\n\nThe one and only way to neutralize these loaded topics, like the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market and the so-called Ethereum price crash, is to look at the data. Charts are data. They may be read differently, but it\u2019s data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price chart, shown below, shows a rising channel.\n\nA rising channel is an uptrend.\n\nAn Ethereum price crash would occur in a downtrend. The direction of the channel would point down, the color of the channel would be red.\n\nWe have the exact opposite in place now.\n\nDownside targets of Ethereum\u2019s retracement? We see $2100.56 and $1849.01 as candidates, in that order. We think in terms of closing prices, so we cannot exclude a scenario in which Ethereum dips, intraday, to $1849 only to close that same day around $2100. This is the world of crypto, volatile are normal.\n\nMore evidence: no Ethereum price crash\n\nWe have been shouting from the roof: crypto in 2024 will come with a HIDDEN BULL MARKET. We also have been calling for a bi-furcated alt season 2024.\n\nHardly anyone is talking about this, but finally there is this one social media post that suggests there is another analyst on this planet that shares our expectations:\n\nWith the #Bitcoin ETF becoming a classic sell-the-news event, we explore the market\u2019s risk appetite for tokens further out on the risk curve. There are some indicators alluding to #Ethereum outperformance, as well as interesting divergences in altcoin price action relative to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/r2P897hmVd \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) January 23, 2024\n\nBuying Ethereum? Sentiment is negative, selling makes more sense.\n\nThat\u2019s the sentiment when price is dropping, indeed.\n\nYou need a lot of courage to be contrarian. When prices are dropping, they can continue to drop. A contrarian call can be disastrous if you don\u2019t have a decent price analysis methodology in place as an analyst.\n\nAt InvestingHaven, we are convinced there will be no Ethereum price crash in the coming months, certainly not in the coming 3 months.\n\nHow can we know?\n\nBecause there is no secular bearish turning point in our cycle analysis.\n\nAnalyzing charts, analyzing Ethereum, analyzing any other market or stock requires price analysis combined with time analysis. Both, combined, make a price analysis methodology complete.\n\nWhile we can always be wrong, we simply have not detected a secular bearish turning point that suggests a crash is underway in the short term, not in Bitcoin nor in Ethereum.\n\nYou may want to consider receiving our premium research notes because all the points we made in this article were shared a month ago in our research service.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Celsius selling large amounts of Ethereum to address financial issues.\n\nDespite selling, Celsius still holds a significant Ethereum reserve\n\nAnalysts anticipate possible descent below $2,000 for Ethereum if key support levels are breached.\n\nThis week, Celsius Networks made some big moves in the Ethereum space that got people\u2019s attention in the digital currency world, even though the company is having money problems and is in the process of filing for bankruptcy.\n\nIn the past 10 hours, Celsius Networks recorded significant deposits, including 13,000 ETH ($30 million) on Coinbase and an extra 2,200 ETH ($5 million) on FalconX. Paired with other substantial Ethereum movements, these transactions highlight Celsius\u2019s proactive approach in addressing financial challenges.\n\nThe $35 Million Ethereum Sell-Off\n\nReports from Arkham Intelligence shed light on Celsius\u2019s extensive Ethereum sales, totaling over $125 million from January 8 to January 12. This strategic move aligns with the platform\u2019s commitment to liquidating assets to meet financial obligations and fulfill creditor demands.\n\nSimultaneously, Dune Analytics identified a noteworthy trend of Ethereum redemptions, surpassing $1.6 billion during the same period. This surge in redemption activity, the highest since last year\u2019s Shanghai update, indicates a substantial shift in Ethereum market dynamics.\n\nDespite facing financial constraints from court proceedings, Celsius still maintains a significant Ethereum reserve. Two staking wallets belonging to Celsius currently hold over 557,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.3 billion. This reserve complicates the matter further for Celcius.\n\nThe Ethereum Market Reacts\n\nIn an effort to satisfy creditors during bankruptcy proceedings, Celsius is auctioning its Ethereum holdings, leading to a 4% dip in Ethereum\u2019s value. Analysts express concern over breaching the $2,350 threshold, a crucial point within the demand zone of $2,380 to $2,461.\n\nAnalysts anticipate a potential descent to $2,000 or lower should this level be breached.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval Is Next \u2013 With 50% Chances\n\nWhales at Play\n\nSantiment\u2019s historical data introduces the intriguing concept of \u201cwhales,\u201d significant players capable of triggering profit-taking activities. While this often results in market dips, decreasing funding rates suggest underlying optimism. This subtle shift hints at a possible cooldown in perpetually overheated markets, offering hope for Ethereum\u2019s resurgence once selling pressures subside."

        "content": "Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind has fixed a critical bug in several versions of its execution client that reportedly caused users to fail to process blocks on Ethereum.\n\nWhile the situation affected the users of Nethermind, a minority client, the incident has led some Ethereum community members to reiterate the importance of diversifying away from the majority client, Geth.\n\nThe latest hotfix addresses a consensus issue in Nethermind that had been introduced in version 1.23.0, according to a Jan. 21 post on Nethermind\u2019s GitHub account.\n\nNethermind co-chief technology officer Daniel Cadela confirmed that versions 1.23\u20131.25 were impacted and called on node validators to update to version 1.25.2. In a follow-up post on X (formerly Twitter), Cadela described the bug as critical.\n\nWe have the fix!\n\nPlease update to 1.25.2\n\nNo resync is needed.https://t.co/fV3MEdipVX\u2026\n\nVersions up to 1.22 don't have that bug, only 1.23-1.25 are affected. \u2014 DanielC (@_D4nie1_) January 21, 2024\n\nThe issue was first voiced by GitHub user \u201cwga22,\u201d who reported their Nethermind execution client was no longer processing blocks.\n\nThe new version, 1.25.2, came approximately 2.5 hours after the firm\u2019s technical lead, Lukasz Rozmej, said the firm was investigating the issue.\n\nAt first glance, Ethereum advocate Superphiz referred to the dilemma as \u201cno big deal\u201d so long as the consensus issue only impacted minority clients.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, it\u2019s a very deliberate design decision not to rely on any single point of failure,\u201d Superphiz added.\n\nI just heard about a potential client bug in Nethermind. This is no big deal as long as it only affects minority clients - as a matter of fact, it's a very deliberate design decision not to rely on any single point of failure. https://t.co/HrjtsG4ckw \u2014 superphiz.eth \ufe0f (@superphiz) January 21, 2024\n\nHowever, several members of the Ethereum community argued the situation could\u2019ve been much more damaging had the issue come about in Geth, which currently accounts for 84% of execution clients on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s beacon chain hiccup has once again highlighted the importance of EL client diversity,\u201d explained Ethereum advocate \u201cliam\u201d in a Jan. 21 X post.\n\n\u201cSwitch to a minority client, and help keep Ethereum secure!\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Ethereum devs air concern over Vitalik\u2019s plan to increase gas limit\n\nNethermind currently only accounts for 8.2% of execution clients on Ethereum, data shows.\n\nHowever, in August 2023, Ethereum bull Anthony Sassano shared a screenshot that showed a much healthier execution client diversity, with Geth and Nethermind accounting for 48% and 26% of execution clients, respectively.\n\n\u201cClient diversity is one of the Ethereum ecosystems greatest achievements,\u201d Sassano said at the time.\n\nThe increased reliance on Geth now has several members of the Ethereum community worried.\n\n\u201cNothing against Geth (they\u2019re great) but you\u2019re taking on disproportionate risk by running it,\u201d said Ethereum advocate \u201cMarceau\u201d on Jan. 21.\n\nLook y'all\n\n\n\nBesu had an issue earlier this month. It wasn't a big deal cuz they're ~4% of the network\n\n\n\nNethermind has an issue today. It's not a big deal cuz they're ~10% of the network\n\n\n\nClient bugs can happen IN ANY CLIENT. Geth could be next. It would be a big deal https://t.co/MxbWpxlFQR \u2014 nixo.eth (@nixorokish) January 21, 2024\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "Ethereum has been significantly down in the past week with a current 17.9% share of the market. Although, it remains bullish on the higher timeframe, looking for a support line to foot a fresh increase.\n\nAfter breaking higher to a multi-month high of $2,717 two weeks ago, Ethereum initiated a drop and quickly lost steam, closing that week slightly bearish.\n\nLast week\u2019s trading started a bit strong but later ended in a red following several drops. From that multi-month high, ETH has seen almost 15% loss and is now trading below the $2,400 level.\n\nWhile it is still within a buying range, the ascending trend line remains a crucial dynamic support to watch for a possible resurge. This setup should come into play if Bitcoin stays a bit calm above its one-month low. But from the look of things, a breakdown is more likely to occur.\n\nFailure to initiate a buy from this dynamic support may result in a further dip, which is capable of slipping the price towards the $2,100 level, held as an important support for the past month.\n\nAs can be seen on the daily chart, the price is trading far above this important level. A monthly close below this level could trigger a crackdown to $2,000 before resuming positive actions.\n\nETH\u2019s Key Level To Watch\n\nNow that the $2,300 level stands as a potential rebound area for Ethereum, a broader correction could plunge the price to the low of $2,222. The support below this level is located at $2,100.\n\nThe recent breakdown level of $2,445 is now serving as an immediate resistance on the daily chart. Above this resistance lies the $2,566 and $2,717. Overcoming these levels could fuel more rally in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nKey Resistance Levels: $2,445, $2,566, $2,717\n\nKey Support Levels: $2,300, $2,222, $2,142\n\nSpot Price: $2,373\n\nTrend: Bearish\n\nVolatility: High\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you're a regular DeFi user on Ethereum, you\u2019ve likely had transactions fail from time to time because you didn\u2019t pony up enough ETH for gas\u20140x aims to solve that.\n\n0x\u2014a prominent developer of web3 infrastructure, including the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) Matcha\u2014today announced the launch of their newest trading API: Tx Relay.\n\nTx Relay facilitates \u201cgasless\u201d swaps, or the ability to swap between cryptocurrencies without spending any ETH on gas fees. Gas fees are the costs a user pays to execute a transaction\u2014whether it\u2019s a swap, a mint, or a token approval, it needs gas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe problem is, on average, 8-10% of DEX transactions fail, and this figure spikes up to 20% during times of network congestion (when Ethereum is experiencing an abnormally high volume of transactions). The Tx Relay API abstracts away the usual process of pre-emptively setting how much gas you want to use on your transaction by covering all the gas needed for the transaction and combining it into the transaction itself.\n\nThe cost of the gas is then added to the swap, and paid by the user in the form of the token they\u2019re swapping. The API is available today on Ethereum and Polygon, but the team plans to launch on Arbitrum shortly after in Q1 of 2024.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Product Manager Claudia Haddad believes that network fees have been a top pain point for the last few years. The simplified trading experience gasless swaps create is a \u201chuge UX unlock,\u201d she told Decrypt.\n\nCrypto users are no strangers to gas fees and the headaches that come with them. Coinbase, which is both an investor in 0x and a beta tester for the new API, claims that 69% of Ethereum swaps encounter a \u201cnot enough gas\u201d error when the user starts the trade. Figuring out gas fees, or getting your transactions to execute at all during times of high congestion, are common pain points for the average crypto trader. They\u2019re also common hurdles for new crypto users.\n\nFor example, gas can typically only be paid in the blockchain\u2019s native token. For example, on Ethereum you pay in ETH. A common mistake many new crypto traders make is not leaving enough Ethereum in their wallet to cover transaction costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a similar vein, crypto wallet Giddy last year announced what it called the \"first-ever Autogas feature for Polygon,\" which allowed users perform transactions on Polygon without holding MATIC in their balance\u2014paying with the USDC stablecoin instead. \u201cWe believe \u2018Autogas\u2019 will become an industry standard in the not so distant future,\u201dsaid Giddy co-founder and CEO Eric Parker at the time.\n\nWith 0x\u2019s new gasless swap, users don\u2019t have to worry about maintaining a balance of whatever their blockchain\u2019s gas token is, the fee is deducted from their trade in the background.\n\nGasless swaps made using the Tx Relay API also benefit from MEV protection. In simple terms, that means protection against bots and other advanced tools. While sophisticated traders often run their trades through private mempools or custom RPCs, most users are either unaware or just plain too lazy to implement the basic protections available. The Tx Relay API aims to abstract this too away from the user.\n\nExample of how a trade using Tx Relay works. Image: 0x\n\nLast year, crypto wallet Giddy announced what it called the \"first-ever Autogas feature for Polygon,\" which allowed users perform transactions on Polygon without holding MATIC in their balance and paying with USDC instead. \u201cWe believe \u2018Autogas\u2019 will become an industry standard in the not so distant future,\u201dsaid Giddy co-founder and CEO Eric Parker at the time.\n\nGasless swaps have been pretty popular with 0x users during their beta. Coinbase reported thousands of users using them in December alone. Matcha has also reported that using the feature reduced failed trades by 85%. When asked how the new API would deal with large spikes in network congestion, 0x co-CEO and co-founder Amir Bandeali said cases of congestion-related failed transactions were rare, but when they occur, the transactions would be automatically resubmitted and executed.\n\nIf everything works as expected, this could create a much better overall user experience for crypto traders, and make the task of conducting on-chain transactions less intimidating to new users.\n\nEditor's note: this article was updated to add mention of the Giddy wallet's gasless approach."

        "content": "Ethereum price faces immense bottlenecks amid a sustained drop from its 2024 peak at $2,715 to slightly above $2,200. The sell-off impacting the performance of ETH over the last couple of weeks stems from the downturn that swiftly followed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nWhile many altcoins and even Bitcoin crumbled under the weight of post-ETF approval blues, Ethereum price stood defiant, briefly basking in the warm glow of investor optimism. But even its flame couldn\u2019t withstand the icy grip of the relentless market malaise.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNow, the king of smart contracts teeters precariously, its crown at risk of slipping below the $2,000 mark.\n\nIs this a good time to buy Ethereum price dips?\n\nThe path of least resistance is majorly inclined downwards, reinforced by a vivid sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nAccording to the daily chart, most traders and speculators missed a negative Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergence from ETH price possibly due to optimism around the ETF.\n\nWith the RSI neutral but falling below 40, an immediate recovery could be a pipe dream. Therefore, it could be prudent for traders to be ready to dollar-cost average (DCA) while anticipating a rebound.\n\nRecommended: Which Top Altcoin To Buy For The Bull Run Today: LINK, SHIB, LUNC?\n\nFibonacci levels reveal that the trend reversal might continue slightly below $2,000 but precisely at $1,980, as highlighted by the 0.618 retracement ratio.\n\nFor such an outcome, Ethereum price will have to flip the highly contested $2,200 level into a resistance as well as the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (purple) at $2,016.\n\nHolding above $2,200, on the other hand, could usher in another bullish era, where bulls push for an upswing beyond the January peak of $2,715 and aim for highs above $3,000.\n\nSeveral crypto analysts like @Gotzeuus agree with the short-term bearish outlook, suggesting that Ethereum price will dive to sweep the $2,067 low. If this level holds, a rebound could ensue.\n\nThe analyst warned on X that Ethereum and altcoins could take a beating from Bitcoin price action, implying that this might not be the time to \u201coverexpose\u201d the crypto portfolio to altcoins.\n\n$ETH update There is high change we go to take 2067 low if we don't hold here, so patience ETH/BTC also looking ready for a pullback after 0.061 bearish retest, therefore expect ETH and alts to suffer from BTC price action Not the days to overexpose yourself in conclusion https://t.co/5Cjqz0DGis pic.twitter.com/mSiLtzrwYD \u2014 Gotzeuus (@Gotzeuus) January 23, 2024\n\nFor now, the best advice could be to exercise patience and avoid rushed decisions. Letting the doldrums settle will provide a clear trajectory Ethereum will likely follow.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Ethereums Future: Will Ethereum Recover? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In this exploration, we tackle the critical question: Will Ethereum recover? We\u2019ll look at Ethereums future and analyze ETH\u2019s present market status, potential for resurgence, the anticipated impact of the progress on Ethereum 2.0, and share expert price predictions.\n\nWill Ethereum Recover? Analysis\n\nThe question \u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201d depends on numerous factors. As of November 2023, Ethereum has shown signs of rebounding from its 2022 lows, suggesting a potential bottoming out. Key developments like the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the introduction of EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 1559, launched all the way back in August 2021, which brings deflationary pressure on Ethereum\u2019s supply, making it a more attractive investment.\n\nAdditionally, Layer 2 (L2) technologies are enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability, addressing previous challenges of high transaction fees and slow speeds. Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the smart contracts sector and its substantial role in the decentralized finance ecosystem further strengthen its recovery prospects. However, predicting the exact trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s recovery remains complex, with varying forecasts suggesting both potential ups and downs in the near future.\n\nEthereums Future: Top-10 Factors Impacting ETH Price\n\nThese ten factors could be crucial for answering the question \u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201c:\n\n#1 Future Upgrades:\n\nEthereum\u2019s development roadmap includes significant upgrades like Proto-Danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, and Full Danksharding, which could greatly impact its scalability and functionality. The successful implementation of these upgrades can boost confidence in the network and the Ethereums future price.\n\n#2 Regulatory Approvals:\n\nRegulatory decisions, such as the approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), can have a substantial impact on Ethereum\u2019s status as a digital asset. BlackRock filed for a spot ETH ETF in mid-November 2023.\n\n#3 Overall Crypto Market Trends:\n\nEthereum\u2019s performance is closely tied to the broader cryptocurrency market. A general uptrend in the crypto market, catalyzed by events like the Bitcoin halving, can positively influence Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\n#4 ETH Burn Rate:\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism includes a mechanism called EIP-1559, which introduces a fee-burning mechanism. The more ETH is burned in transactions, the scarcer it becomes, potentially increasing its value.\n\n#5 Layer-2 Solutions:\n\nThe adoption and success of Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, can significantly improve the network\u2019s scalability and reduce transaction fees. This could attract more users and developers.\n\n#6 DeFi And NFT Activity:\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem heavily relies on DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) applications. Increased adoption and activity in these sectors can drive demand for ETH and positively impact its price.\n\n#7 Competition:\n\nEthereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms like Solana and Cardano. The success or failure of these competitors can affect Ethereum\u2019s market position.\n\n#8 Macroeconomic Factors:\n\nEconomic events, such as inflation, monetary policy decisions, and global financial crises, can influence investors\u2019 choices. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are sometimes seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability.\n\n#9 Network Security:\n\nThe security of the Ethereum network is crucial. High-profile hacks or vulnerabilities can undermine trust in the platform and lead to price declines.\n\n#10 Ecosystem Development:\n\nThe growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, including the number of dApps, users, and developers, can affect its adoption and value.\n\nEIP-1559: Understanding The Ethereum Burn Rate\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn rate is a key aspect of its economics, influencing both its supply dynamics and long-term valuation. To grasp the Ethereum burn introduced with EIP-1559, examining the latest data and understanding how this mechanism operates within the Ethereum ecosystem is crucial.\n\nEthereum Is \u201cUltra Sound Money\u201d\n\nEIP-1559 was a proposal that fundamentally restructured Ethereum\u2019s fee market. Before this proposal, miners received the entire transaction fee. With activation on August 5, 2021, EIP-1559 introduced a base fee for transactions, which is burned (permanently removed from circulation), and only an optional tip is given to miners. This mechanism aims to make transaction fees more predictable and the network more efficient.\n\nThe \u201cultra sound money\u201d meme emerged from the community in response to EIP-1559. It plays on the concept of \u201csound money,\u201d a term traditionally used to describe money that is not prone to depreciation and is a reliable store of value, like gold.\n\nWith EIP-1559, Ethereum\u2019s supply becomes more predictable and potentially deflationary\u2014if the amount of ETH burned exceeds the new ETH issued, the total supply will decrease over time, hence the term \u201cultra sound money.\u201d This is seen as an enhancement over \u201csound money,\u201d with Ethereum not just maintaining its value but potentially increasing it due to the decreasing supply.\n\nEthereum Burn Rate Projections\n\nThe attached chart underscores the impact of these changes on Ethereum\u2019s supply, especially post-EIP-1559, where the supply curve starts to flatten, suggesting a reduction in the growth of Ethereum\u2019s total supply. This aligns with the concept of Ethereum becoming a deflationary asset post-EIP-1559, contributing to the narrative that Ethereum\u2019s future could be as an \u201cultra sound\u201d form of money.\n\nOn November 17, 2023, the Ethereum supply stood at 88 million ETH in accounts, 3.7 million ETH in contracts, and 28.5 million ETH in validators, totaling 120.3 million ETH. The dotted line indicates Ethereums future decrease in total supply due to the burning of ETH and the issuance changes post-Merge. The chart projects that the ETH supply will shrink to 117.7 million ETH in November 2025.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future: Will Ethereum Go Back Up?\n\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency, technical analysis serves as a navigational tool to gauge market sentiment and potential price movements. Examining the 1-week ETH/USD chart provides insight into Ethereum\u2019s price action and helps address the burning question: \u201cwill Ethereum recover?\u201d\n\nFibonacci Levels And Price Targets\n\nThe chart showcases several Fibonacci retracement levels, which are crucial in identifying potential support and resistance zones based on previous price movements. Here are the key Fibonacci retracement levels highlighted:\n\n0.236: At $1,847, this level acts as a potential support zone.\n\nAt $1,847, this level acts as a potential support zone. 0.382: $2,441 is the next key Fib level, displaying the next resistance.\n\n$2,441 is the next key Fib level, displaying the next resistance. 0.5: The $2,922 level represents a psychological midpoint.\n\nThe $2,922 level represents a psychological midpoint. 0.618: At $3,402, this level is often considered the \u2018golden ratio,\u2019 a significant reversal point.\n\nAt $3,402, this level is often considered the \u2018golden ratio,\u2019 a significant reversal point. 0.786: $4,085 is a deeper retracement level that can signal strength in the prevailing trend.\n\n$4,085 is a deeper retracement level that can signal strength in the prevailing trend. 1: The full retracement level at $4,956 marks a complete return to all-time high.\n\nThe full retracement level at $4,956 marks a complete return to all-time high. 1.618 : At $7,471, this extended Fib level could be the first long-term bullish target.\n\n: At $7,471, this extended Fib level could be the first long-term bullish target. 2.618: $11,540 represents an optimistic projection in a strong Ethereum bull run.\n\n$11,540 represents an optimistic projection in a strong Ethereum bull run. 3.618: This level at $15,609 would be an extraordinary target for a sustained bull run.\n\nThis level at $15,609 would be an extraordinary target for a sustained bull run. 4.236: The $18,123 Fib level is the highest projected target on the chart, indicating an extreme bull case scenario.\n\nTrend Lines, Resistance Zones And RSI\n\nThe chart shows a black ascending trend line, tracing the lows and signifying a potential area of support that Ethereum\u2019s price could respect. If the price maintains above this line, it may indicate continued bullish sentiment.\n\nThe red box, or resistance zone, around the Year-To-Date (YTD) high at $2,137 underscores a region where sellers have previously entered the market. Overcoming this zone is critical for Ethereum to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), sitting at 48.07, shows Ethereum is neither in the overbought nor oversold territory. This indicates a neutral momentum, which could precede a move in either direction.\n\nConclusion: Will Ethereum Recover?\n\nWhile the chart presents strong arguments for an Ethereum bull run, with ETH price sustaining above critical support levels and challenging notable resistance zones, the future price action will depend on how the market interacts with these technical indicators. If Ethereum can break through the resistance encapsulated by the YTD high, we could see an affirmative answer to \u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201d However, it is imperative for investors to monitor these levels closely, as they serve as a roadmap, not a crystal ball.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction By NewsBTC\u2019s Head Of Research\n\nTony \u201cThe Bull\u201d Severino, NewsBTC\u2019s Head of Research, has provided an in-depth analysis of Ethereum\u2019s market behavior in his latest edition of Coin Chartist. He observes, \u201cEthereum has yet to begin trending with a reading above 20 on the ADX, nor has it broken above the upper Bollinger Band. But these signals are likely coming soon.\u201d This suggests Ethereum\u2019s significant uptrend might be on the horizon.\n\nComparing Ethereum with Bitcoin, Severino notes, \u201cETHUSD is much lower within the Ichimoku Cloud than BTCUSD,\u201d indicating Ethereum is currently lagging behind Bitcoin. However, he anticipates Ethereum will soon \u201cswitch to over-performance.\u201d\n\nHighlighting a positive development, Severino states, \u201cETHUSD 1W was finally able to crack above its TDST downtrend resistance.\u201d Yet, Ethereum needs to form a perfected TD9 series for further bullish confirmation. On the monthly chart, Ethereum\u2019s overbought status on the Stochastic indicator suggests a strong trend, as Severino points out, \u201cEach time the Stochastic has confirmed a 1M above 80 on the Stock, there was a massive push higher.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Severino underscores the importance of Ethereum\u2019s performance against Bitcoin, \u201cBut if ETHBTC can push back above 20 this will generate a buy signal on the 1M Stochastic and kickstart Ether\u2019s over-performance above Bitcoin.\u201d This analysis provides a detailed perspective on Ethereum\u2019s potential future trajectory in the crypto market.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Price Prediction\n\nThe continuous evolution of Ethereum through its 2.0 upgrades sets the stage for an optimistic price prediction. As the network becomes more scalable, secure, and sustainable, the intrinsic value of Ethereum is likely to increase.\n\nThe successful completion of the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, which introduced staking, is already a significant milestone that demonstrates the network\u2019s commitment to its roadmap. Such advancements are expected to reinforce investor confidence and could catalyze a bullish outlook for Ethereums future price.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Roadmap\n\nEthereum 2.0 represents a series of upgrades aimed at improving the network\u2019s scalability, security, and sustainability. Contrary to the previous term \u2018ETH2\u2019, the roadmap is now defined by more specific upgrade milestones:\n\nPast and Completed Upgrades\n\nThe Merge: This critical upgrade on September 15, 2022 marked Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) and was a foundational step in the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, eliminating the need for energy-intensive mining.\n\nAnother key feature, staking withdrawals has already been enabled with the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, which went live on April 12, 2023\u200b\n\nFuture Ethereum Upgrades\n\nThe Surge: The next phase involves scalability improvements through rollups and data sharding. Danksharding, a key component, aims to make layer 2 rollups cheaper by incorporating \u201cblobs\u201d of data into Ethereum blocks\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe next phase involves scalability improvements through rollups and data sharding. Danksharding, a key component, aims to make layer 2 rollups cheaper by incorporating \u201cblobs\u201d of data into Ethereum blocks\u200b\u200b. The Scourge: This phase focuses on ensuring censorship resistance, decentralization, and addressing protocol risks, such as those arising from miner extractable value (MEV).\n\nThis phase focuses on ensuring censorship resistance, decentralization, and addressing protocol risks, such as those arising from miner extractable value (MEV).

The Purge: This stage aims to reduce computational costs and simplify the protocol, making running nodes more efficient.\n\nThis stage aims to reduce computational costs and simplify the protocol, making running nodes more efficient. The Splurge: This includes miscellaneous upgrades that do not fit into the other categories but are essential for the network\u2019s growth and enhancement\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Ethereum community has replaced the term \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d with more specific names for each upgrade, providing clearer insight into the network\u2019s transition and improvements. These upgrades aim to turn Ethereum into a fully scaled, resilient platform, capable of supporting a global decentralized application system. As implementation of these phases progresses, Ethereum\u2019s growing appeal as an investment could positively influence its price predictions.\n\nProto-Danksharding: EIP-4844\n\nEIP-4844 introduces \u201cshard blob transactions\u201d to enhance Ethereum\u2019s data availability in a way that aligns with future full sharding plans. This proposal creates a new transaction format containing \u201cblobs\u201d \u2013 large data segments essential for rollups, a Layer 2 solution, but inaccessible for EVM execution. It serves as a temporary scaling solution, bridging the gap until full sharding implementation.\n\nNotably, rollups have become increasingly important for scaling Ethereum, as they offer a way to execute transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) and then post the data back to Layer 1. EIP-4844\u2019s format is expected to greatly reduce transaction fees for rollups by offering a cheaper data storage mechanism compared to current methods\u200b\u200b.\n\nFull Danksharding\n\nFull Danksharding, which advances from Proto-Danksharding, will likely further reduce costs for Layer 2 rollups. It introduces \u201cblobs\u201d in a format slated for use in the final sharding design. This includes a new transaction type and an independent fee market for these blobs.\n\nFull Danksharding will build on Proto-Danksharding and aims to further cut Layer 2 rollups\u2019 costs. It will comprehensively implement data availability sampling and essential components for a fully sharded Ethereum network, including proposer-builder separation and proof of custody. This approach aims to assign only a portion of the data to validators, reducing the network\u2019s load and enhancing scalability.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Price Predictions: Will Ethereum Recover?\n\nAs Ethereum continues to progress with its 2.0 upgrades, the financial community has been actively speculating on its future value. Here are some Ethereum price predictions from renowned institutions and analysts, answering the question \u201cwill Ethereum recover\u201d:\n\nVanEck: The investment management firm predicts that Ethereum\u2019s price could reach as high as $11.8k by 2030. This projection is based on their assessment that Ethereum\u2019s network revenues could rise from $2.6 billion to $51 billion in 2030, assuming Ethereum captures a 70% market share among smart contract platforms.\n\nStandard Chartered: Analysts at Standard Chartered are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential. They forecast that the price of ETH could hit $4,000 by the end of 2024 and double to $8,000 by the end of 2026. Their Ethereum bull run prediction is based on Ethereum\u2019s established dominance in smart contract platforms and the potential for emerging uses in areas like gaming and tokenization. Moreover, they suggest that the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024 could positively impact the broader crypto market, especially Ethereum\u200b.\n\nAlso, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the US could significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s price. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in mid-November 2023. The approval of this ETF would mark a major milestone for Ethereum, potentially attracting more institutional and retail investments and substantially boosting Ethereum\u2019s market price.\n\nFAQ: Ethereums Future\n\nWill Ethereum recover?\n\nEthereum\u2019s recovery depends on various factors including market trends, technological advancements, and broader economic conditions.

        "title": "Ethereum Drops After the SEC Delays Fidelity ETF, XRP, RON, SOL, Jan. 22 - Bitrates",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s expected ETF launch was delayed leading to sharp losses. XRP and SOL unwind speculative gains. RON leads the pack after an upgrade.\n\nETH\n\nEthereum lost over 5% this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed an exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering from Fidelity.\n\nAfter approving eleven bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC decided to delay a decision on Fidelity's Ethereum ETF application until at least March.\n\nAccording to a filing, the regulator wants more time to deliberate on the decision.\n\n\u201cThe SEC finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nThe move was expected by many after asset manager Fidelity filed its application last November, a month after ETFs for ether futures were approved. The Boston-based firm was making a similar move as rival asset manager BlackRock which also filed a spot ether ETF application. Stuart Barton at Volatility Shares said:\n\nThe fact that they allowed listing of the futures-based ETFs is enough to say they are thinking about ether the same way they are thinking about bitcoin and you can infer from that they're probably thinking it's not a security and not going to regulate it that way.\n\nBitcoin ETFs went live earlier this month and have already gained $1 billion from investors. The price action in Bitcoin, which has fallen 4% over the last week, has disappointed many investors who were buying into Bitcoin expecting a surge after the ETF launch.\n\nETH starts the week looking for buyer support with the $2,200 level as a possible target.\n\nXRP\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token had a rough week with losses of over 7.5% as court issues loom.\n\nThe SEC vs Ripple case continues to drag on and the regulator may have asked for post-complaint documents to argue a more punitive penalty for XRP sales to U.S. investors and entities. In July, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple breached Section 5 of the 1933 Securities Act when selling XRP tokens. If the Judge orders Ripple to provide the new documents, further breaches of Section 5 could hurt XRP.\n\nRipple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty posted more views about the hearing, saying,\n\n\u201cLast week (in Coinbase), the SEC told the Court that the question is \u201cwhether investors are \u201cpooling [their] capital with the promoter\u2019s efforts.\u201d That\u2019s wrong. Howey demands more than investing in efforts. You have to invest in a common enterprise. Revak (2d Cir. 1984).\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to bring it back to Howey compels us to look at the economic reality of whether investors are giving up their capital and pooling that capital with the promotor\u2019s efforts. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s being done here.\u201d\n\nThe SEC case has been a headwind for the XRP price since it was announced in December 2021. After some recent price gains following the speculative moves of Bitcoin, XRP has given up its advance and now heads for the $0.50 price again.\n\nRON\n\nRonin (RON) gained 35% this week after additional support was announced for crypto tokens.\n\nSky Mavis, the creator of the play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, has announced an upgrade to the Ronin blockchain's crypto wallet. The new features include multichain support, an in-app web browser, a new design, and support for multi-party computation (MPC).\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance\u2019s BNB Chain. The latest upgrade allows users to manage and transfer assets across different blockchain networks from a single wallet. The new version of the Ronin wallet includes an in-app web browser that enables users to access decentralized applications (dApps) and interact with blockchain-based services directly from the wallet.\n\nThe wallet's design has been updated to show more information on token activities and NFT information. The Ronin wallet now supports MPC, which requires two or more pieces of login information instead of a single private key. The wallet can also be used across different games such as Axie Infinity and Pixels without creating separate wallets for each game.\n\nThe Ronin wallet upgrade is a significant step forward for the Ronin ecosystem, providing users with a more versatile and secure platform for managing their digital assets. The addition of multichain support and other features is likely to attract new users and further drive the adoption of the Ronin blockchain.\n\nRON trades at $2.35 and has jumped into the top 100 coins at number 90.\n\nSOL\n\nSolana was one of the big losers in the top ten cryptos with a drop of over 7% for the week.\n\nThe project\u2019s BONK meme token also suffered with a 6.70% loss over the last seven days. Solana is still ranked at number five in the list of crypto tokens with a valuation of over $48 billion.\n\nCoinShares stated in its weekly crypto report that there were outflows of $21 million in cryptocurrency products last week. The majority of the outflows were said to be in Bitcoin and likely due to profit-taking.\n\nBTC experienced an outflow of $24.7 million last week, while Ethereum also saw an outflow of $13.6 million. The Bitcoin Short fund saw an inflow of $12.7 million this week. In the altcoin space, Litecoin experienced an outflow of $ 1.5 million, while Solana experienced an outflow of $ 8.5 million.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency investment products saw small outflows last week, totaling $21 million, but this top-line figure masks very high trading volumes in Bitcoin last week, which totaled $11.8 billion, 7 times the usual weekly trading volume in 2023, the report said.\n\nSOL Price Index\n\nSOL trades at $89 and needs to hold that support level or a swift move to the $60-70 range could happen."

This decline has been linked to substantial Bitcoin sales, notably influenced by the Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin ETF, fueling concerns about a possible further descent to the $38,000 level.\n\nBitcoin has fallen about 20% since the Jan. 11 launch of the first ETFs funds investing directly in the token https://t.co/3jGyNKrvfT \u2014 Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 23, 2024\n\nConcurrently, Ethereum, another major player in the crypto arena, is grappling with its own bearish momentum, having fallen to $2,347, marking a significant 24-hour drop of nearly 3%.\n\nThese movements come amidst a broader market context where Bitcoin has seen over a 20% decline since the launch of the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\n#BTC looks ready for bounce imo\ud83d\udc40 I\u2019m expecting bounce from here cause most important liquidity levels got hit last night \ud83d\udcaf In most worst case we can see $37K-$38K, hope this will not happen..

This correction not only rattled holders but also posed challenges for BTC miners.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, miners faced financial struggles with transaction fees hitting their lowest since June 2022. The pressure on miners may lead to selling, adding downward momentum to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin's average transaction fee hits $6.85, surging 35.5% from yesterday & a massive 448% YOY.

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the blockchain network\u2019s ecosystem, liquidated $1.6 million worth of ETH, according to crypto analytical firm Arkham Intelligence.\n\nData from the platform reveals that the foundation utilized the CoW Protocol to sell 700 ETH, acquiring $1.6 million in DAI stablecoin. Subsequently, the funds were transferred to an address \u201c0x9ee\u2026313D,\u201d identified as the Grant Provider by Etherscan.\n\nThis transaction, which may have occurred when ETH was valued around $2,400, closely mirrors a previous one on Jan. 16. During that instance, the foundation exchanged 100 ETH for $253,000, with the funds also directed to the Grant Provider wallet.\n\nDespite these recent sales, the Ethereum Foundation retains a substantial crypto portfolio. It currently holds 312.894K ETH, valued at approximately $747.40 million, and 31.2K WETH, valued at $74.65 million. Additional assets in its possession include $1.96 million DAI, $113.61K USDC, and $72.97K BUSD.\n\nGiven the considerable volume of ETH held by the foundation, its trading activities often influence the asset\u2019s price movements. Consequently, market observers often monitor its transactions for potential insights into the organization\u2019s plans.\n\nAs such, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s recent selling activities have contributed to a 4.3% decline in Ethereum\u2019s price, which currently trades at $2,386 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade\n\nInterestingly, these fund movements coincide with the recent launch of the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network\u2019s testnet, Goerli, on Jan. 17. This upgrade aims to alleviate gas fees and enhance transaction speed through improvements to the network\u2019s layer-2 rollups.\n\nThe upgrade is the most technical advancement the blockchain network has seen since the Shapella hard fork that allowed the withdrawal of staked ether (stETH).\n\nHowever, a bug delayed the network\u2019s launch for around four hours before the problem was fixed through a patch, allowing the network to run smoothly.\n\nPer Dencun\u2019s testing schedule, the next phase of its development will happen soon, with a planned upgrade to the Sepolia testnet and the Holesky testnet in the offing."

        "content": "Why Ethereum Price is Crashing and What Can Arrest its Fall\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nDespite the announcement of the Ethereum merge, the price of the largest altcoin in the world is crashing. However, an Ethereum increase in price following the new network upgrade? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nEthereum Price Correction\n\nEthereum and the broader cryptocurrency markets have been descending since 2022 \u2013 amidst the economic crisis following the pandemic, increasing inflationary data and interest hikes. In November 2021, Ethereum (ETH) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4,900.\n\nIn the chart above, Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed a significant price correction since 13th September 2022. From $1,748 on the 13th, the largest altcoin plummeted to under $1,300 on September 18th \u2013 equating to a 25% price correction in under a week. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $1,350 \u2013 72% below its November highs.\n\nSurprisingly, the sudden fall in the price of Ethereum has corresponded with the network\u2019s new merge update \u2013 which will see Ethereum shift from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. But why has the token corrected despite the announcement of the merge?\n\nWhat Has Ethereum Corrected?\n\nOn September 15th 2022, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, tweeted announcing the successful launch of the Ethereum verge. Earlier, Ethereum\u2019s network was facing trouble relating to scalability and slow transaction processing times. The new merge is expected to make the network a faster, cheaper and more scalable solution.\n\nDespite the launch, Ethereum has corrected right after the announcement. One of the reasons for this is the \u2018buy the rumour, sell the news\u2019 phenomenon. In trading, this means that a cryptocurrency\u2019s price tends to go up after positive announcements relating to a cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum, the token has recently delivered returns right before the merge news announcement. Between Mid-July to August 14th 2022, Ethereum rose from $1,000 to nearly $2,000 \u2013 a 2x price increase. This was the first sign of a solid upwards movement in the price of Ethereum since April 2022.\n\nMany analysts believe that the recent price correction is due to Ethereum\u2019s already inflated price tag caused by people buying the rumoured way ahead of the actual announcement.\n\nMoreover, the SEC (U.S securities and exchange commission) recently announced that staked cryptocurrencies might be subject to federal securities regulation. This announcement was made by Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, on 15th September 2022 \u2013 just a few hours after the Ethereum merge was finalised.\n\nSince the Ethereum merge will make the token a Proof of Stake cryptocurrency, many correlated the timing of the SEC announcement with Ethereum\u2019s new development. However, the SEC clearly stated that the announcement does not revolve around any particular cryptocurrency.\n\nThese factors may have led to a short-term bearish sentiment in the market, but can Ethereum become one of the best altcoins to invest in the future?\n\nCan Ethereum Go Up?\n\nAs stated above, the \u2018buy the rumour\u2019 sell the news\u2019 phenomenon may have resulted in the instant price decrease of Ethereum. However, the confirmation of the Ethereum news has the potential to make Ethereum one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to watch.\n\nBefore the merge, Ethereum was still the biggest cryptocurrency for developers to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) and NFT-based protocols. The merge aims to make the Ethereum network more sustainable \u2013 since the platform will rely on crypto staking, which is far more sustainable than the Proof of Work concept.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s historical price shows the token\u2019s strength to rebound in the long term. While past performance does not indicate future success, Ethereum\u2019s new upgrade may invite many investors to purchase the token at a lower price.\n\nBuy ETH on eToro\n\nDon\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.

Consequently, Coinbase has taken steps to move away from complete dependence on Go.ethereum.\n\nIt was revealed that launching the staking feature on the platform Geth was the only execution client that met the requirements of the exchange.\n\n\u201cCoinbase Cloud prioritizes the security of customer assets, and the underlying blockchain, above all else. When launching Ethereum staking and evaluating execution layer clients to maximize these traits, Geth was the only client that met our technical requirements.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, two years before the staking feature was rolled out, Coinbase Cloud and other network operators came to the exact conclusion that has led to the dominance of Geth.\n\nPresently 84% of Ethereum validators operate on Geth but alternative solutions are being developed and scaled up with the possibility of network integration in the future.\n\nThe exchange added that it has a record of taking client diversity seriously to improve users\u2019 overall experience. Coinbase also added that it would perform the latest assessments and conclusions towards the next step in this direction, which will be revealed in February.\n\nCoinbase user flags Geth dominance\n\n\n\nThis recent controversy was sparked with a post on X when a user complained of the risk Geth\u2019s dominance poses to the system. The user specifically stressed that he could lose his assets in the event of a bug.\n\n\u201cand in the event of an unforeseen geth consensus bug in the meantime, I could stand to lose a large percentage of my deposit. today, I\u2019ve decided that this is not worth the risk.\u201d\n\ndear @coinbase today, i unstaked all of the ETH i had staked with you since the first day you offered it as a service. i kept it there to earn passive yield, but also to support your work for the crypto industry (which i greatly value) but i can't ignore the risks of what\u2026 \u2014 DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) January 22, 2024\n\nBrain Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase noted that he would take a look into the incident spurring the comprehensive response.\n\nAddressing previous concerns\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the exchange addressed similar concerns of client diversity of eth2 regarding validators\u2019 dependence on Prysm. Coinbase noted that securing user assets was paramount to the network and decided to start with Prysm because it was the viable option.\n\n\u201cRemote signers allow validators to generate and store keys in isolated environments instead of keeping them on the validator itself, which greatly increases the security of the eth2 validators on Coinbase.\u201d\n\nA conclusion was drawn to secure onboard Lighthouse remote signers giving users and partners more options."

Discover SCENE\n\nWhistleblower turned international fugitive Edward Snowden today backed and endorsed the legal defense fund for the Tornado Cash founder.\n\nIn a Tuesday post on Twitter, the exiled former CIA contractor asked followers to pitch in to help Roman Storm, co-founder of the once popular but fatally sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing service.\n\nYesterday, Storm said on Twitter that he would launch a campaign\u2014in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\u2014to raise money for a lawyer. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Storm and charged him with money laundering for his part in the creation of Tornado Cash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTornado Cash was a popular cryptocurrency coin mixing application that allowed users to anonymously send and receive Ethereum, the second largest digital asset by market cap.\n\nBut the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022 banned Americans from using the service, claiming that criminals had used it to launder dirty money.\n\nThey then alleged that Storm and his colleague Roman Semenov laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Developer Alex Pertsev was also arrested.\n\nBut the new fundraiser\u2019s website argues that \u201cthe arrests of Roman Storm and Alex Pertsev are considered a direct attack on the open-source development space and may have devastating consequences for developers who write and publish code.\u201d\n\nIf you can help, please help.

The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap is pseudonymous: a user\u2019s identity isn\u2019t recorded on the blockchain but every single transaction is.\n\nAuthorities are, therefore, able to track down people who send and receive the digital coin if necessary.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade to Affect ETH Price, Analysts Say\n\nThe upcoming Dencun upgrade of the Ethereum network might have repercussions on the supply of ether, as noted by Luke Nolan, a research associate specializing in Ethereum at CoinShares.\n\nLuke Nolan, a research associate specializing in Ethereum at CoinShares, warns that the upcoming Dencun upgrade of the Ethereum network may influence the supply of Ether.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade introduces the blobspace, an alternative to the current transactional calldata mechanism, facilitating Layer 2 transactions on the Ethereum network. This change can reduce gas usage, decreasing the amount of Ether burned during transactions.\n\nCurrently, all Esther used for gas base fees in transactions is burned. Nolan explained, \"Layer 2s pay 90% of their gas fees for transactional calldata. With the Dencun upgrade, instead of using calldata, Layer 2s can opt for the new blobspace mechanism, significantly reducing gas costs. This shift could stabilize gas prices at lower levels, resulting in less Ether being burned.\"\n\nImpact on Ether Burn Mechanism\n\nThe anticipated reduction in Ether burned may impact the overall growth of Ether supply. Gas demand on the Ethereum network is a crucial driver of Ether's deflation mechanism through gas burn, potentially reducing the circulating supply of Ether. Nolan emphasized that even with reduced gas prices due to blobspace usage, Ethereum is unlikely to become significantly inflationary.\n\n\"Layer 1 demand is crucial for driving deflation. The Dencun upgrade aims to decrease gas fees for roll-up transactions, attracting users back to the network with lower fees. Increased activity means higher overall gas usage,\" Nolan explained.\n\nAccording to The Block, despite potential changes to the Ether burn mechanism, Nolan highlighted that secondary effects of the Dencun upgrade are likely to be a net positive in the long run. He underscored that Ethereum's goal is to solidify its market share, and any short-term gas fluctuations are overshadowed by the broader objective of enhancing user experience and network activity.\n\nDencun Upgrade Schedule\n\nThe Dencun network upgrade was initiated on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, introducing Ethereum Improvement Proposals, including EIP-4844 for the blobspace mechanism. The Sepolia testnet is set to activate the Dencun upgrade by Jan. 30, with the Holesky testnet following on Feb. 7.\n\nAccording to Coin Gape, Nolan indicated that mainnet activation of the Dencun upgrade could occur as early as March this year. However, he cautioned that unforeseen testnet issues could impact the timeline. Ethereum core developers anticipate the mainnet activation to happen at least one month after Holesky, but exact timing remains uncertain due to potential testnet challenges.\n\nPhoto by: Blank/Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "content": "An analyst has explained that the latest cooldown in the Ethereum futures market could suggest there is potential for a price rise to resume for ETH.\n\nEthereum Funding Rates Have Seen A Decline Recently\n\nAn analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the ETH funding rates have seen a cooldown from their previously overheated levels. The \u201cfunding rate\u201d refers to the periodic fees that futures contract holders on derivative platforms currently exchange with each other.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are paying a premium to the shorts to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies that most traders share a bullish sentiment right now.\n\nOn the other hand, the under zero indicates that a bearish sentiment is currently dominant in the futures market, as the short traders are overwhelming the longs.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum funding rates over the last few months:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been low in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum funding rates have been mostly positive during the last few months, implying that traders on the futures side of the market have mostly been bullish about the asset.\n\nThe few times that the metric did dip into the negative inside this period didn\u2019t turn out to be anything major, as the indicator only attained low red values and rebounded back inside the green territory without too much wait.\n\nThe chart shows that during some phases of this lasting period of bullish sentiment, the metric attained particularly high values. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that elevated values in funding rates raise concerns about a potential overheated state in the perpetual markets, signaling the possibility of an impending long-squeeze event,\u201d notes the quant.\n\nA \u201csqueeze\u201d is an event in which a sharp swing in the price triggers a large number of liquidations, which in turn feed into this price move, elongating it and causing further liquidations.\n\nWhen such a cascade of liquidations affects the long side of the market (that is, the price move in question is a rapid drawdown), the event is known as a \u201clong squeeze.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the side of the futures market most heavily dominated by traders is likelier to fall prey to a squeeze. Thus, when the funding rates are highly positive, a long squeeze can be more probable.\n\nRecently, though, as Ethereum has gone through its latest correction, so have the funding rates. Although they are still positive, their magnitude may no longer be associated with an overheated market, and the risk of a long squeeze would have thus fallen.\n\n\u201cConsequently, there exists the potential for the price to resume its upward trajectory following the completion of the ongoing correction stage,\u201d explains the analyst.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum has declined by around 5% during the past week as its price has now fallen under $2,400.\n\nLooks like the price of the coin has been sliding off recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An Ethereum whale has doubled down on Shiba Inu with a 606.36 billion buy that comes at a time of increased SHIB-focused whale activity.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market battles its way out of a downtrend, whale activity on the popular Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency is on the rise.\n\nOne of the notable transactions in recent times is a large 606.36 billion SHIB (approximately $5.9 million) accumulation by an Ethereum address that first bought Shiba Inu two years ago.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs on-chain data reveals, the latest acquisition makes SHIB the largest holding on the address. The whale now holds 733.2 billion SHIB (approximately $6.79 million) and has largely focused on acquiring SHIB, with minimal selling in the past two years.\n\nAlthough there is no clear way to identify the entity behind the address, further investigation reveals some interesting data. The wallet regularly moves a portion of SHIB to another address that now holds over 1 trillion SHIB tokens ($9.2 million).\n\nAdditionally, the address may be tied to a retail investor or a high-profile fund that invests in SHIB. During its early interactions with Shiba Inu, the address received 36 billion tokens from a prominent crypto exchange, Coinbase.\n\nSHIB Whale Activity On The Rise\n\nThe recent large Shiba Inu accumulation follows a trend of increased whale activity. Data tracker IntoTheBlock shows that whales have moved over $158 million worth of SHIB tokens in the past seven days.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAn increase in whale activity dominated by large buys typically indicates that prices have dropped to a region where large investors consider it necessary to increase their exposure to an asset.\n\nAs previously reported by The Crypto Basic, whale activity on SHIB surged after the cryptocurrency dropped below the $0.000010 support level, which it held for a considerable period.\n\nShiba Inu is trading at $0.00000927, representing a 4% decline in the past week. The bearish price action mirrors the performance of the broader cryptocurrency market as investors contend with a post-ETF sell-off led by GBTC holders."

        "content": "Celsius Networks, currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, has engaged in significant Ethereum transactions that are causing ripples within the digital currency landscape.\n\nIn the past 10 hours, on-chain analysts at LookonChain detected noteworthy transfers, including a 13,000 ETH deposit ($30 million) on Coinbase and an additional 2,200 ETH ($5 million) on FalconX. These transactions suggest a proactive stance by Celsius in addressing its ongoing financial challenges.\n\nCelsius Sells $125M ETH, Maintains $1.3B Reserve\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Celsius sold more than $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) coins between January 8 and January 12. The primary goal of this auction is to pay off creditors.\n\nDune Analytics also revealed a more widespread pattern of redemptions, with over $1.6 billion of staked Ethereum being redeemed during the same period. Since the Shanghai update last year, the amount of redemptions recorded is the highest.\n\nDespite facing financial constraints imposed by the court, Celsius still holds a substantial Ethereum reserve. This reserve amounts to over 557,000 coins in two staking wallets, with a total valuation of approximately $1.3 billion. The size of this reserve adds a layer of complexity to Celsius\u2019 current financial situation and underscores the evolving narrative within the crypto space.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nAs part of its obligations to creditors, Celsius has been actively liquidating its Ethereum holdings. These auctions, aimed at paying off outstanding debts, are integral to Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nSource: LookOnChain\n\nThe market has responded to these Ethereum transactions, resulting in a 4% decline in the price of ETH. The cryptocurrency slipped below the $2,350 mark, raising concerns among analysts, especially as ETH now wavers below its crucial demand zone ranging from $2,380 to $2,461.\n\nAnalysts predict that a failure to maintain this level could lead to a potential retreat towards the $2,000 mark.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,307.2 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nWealthy Investors Trigger Ethereum Profit-Taking\n\nSantiment\u2019s historical data reveals that significant transactions by wealthy investors, commonly known as whales, often trigger profit-taking activities among regular ETH holders. This phenomenon intensifies selling pressure and contributes to price declines.\n\nMeanwhile, decreasing funding rates suggest an underlying optimism in the market, hinting at a possible cooldown in previously overheated perpetual markets. This situation leaves room for ETH to rebound once the selling pressure subsides.\n\nAs the bankruptcy drama of Celsius unfolds, the scrutiny on its Ethereum transactions and the resulting market dynamics will persist. Investors and observers are closely monitoring the situation, eagerly awaiting further developments and anticipating the broader implications for both Celsius and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "For a lot of people, the idea of running a validator node can be nerve-wracking and intimidating. But MetaMask has emphasized that there is no need for technical know-how.\n\nWhen it comes to earning money from cryptocurrency, staking is popular among users for various reasons. These include being relatively low-risk, convenient, and so on. For Ethereum users who are interested in staking, a new option has emerged within the market from popular wallet provider MetaMask.\n\nThe provider announced on January 18, 2024, that users can now earn interest on their ETH tokens through validator staking. This will involve them depositing at least 32 ETH and managing their activities directly from their MetaMask portfolio.\n\nDetails About the Development\n\nOne of the things that MetaMask noted in its announcement is that users do not need to manage the hardware or software for staking by themselves. Instead, this will be done through Consensys Staking, which has notably run 33,000+ validators with zero slashed so far. Other accolades it boasts of include 99.99% validator uptime and up to 7% higher rewards rate than the network average.\n\nThose who choose to engage in validator staking using MetaMask also get to enjoy self-custody as they do so. While MetaMask handles the backend of the operation, the customer does not have to surrender their tokens. There is also a lot of emphasis on the removal of technical barriers.\n\nFor a lot of people, the idea of running a validator node can be nerve-wracking and intimidating. But MetaMask has emphasized that there is no need for technical know-how. This new program, \u201cunlocks simplicity and accessibility, removes the technical barriers needed to secure the network, democratizes participation in Ethereum staking for those unable or unwilling to solo stake,\u201d while also making withdrawals and deposits simpler.\n\nMetaMask users were instructed to navigate to their wallets and simply select the \u2018stake\u2019 option. Once done, they will have to select how much they want to stake (in multiples of 32 ETH) and can start earning rewards from there.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum switched from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022. When the Ethereum Foundation announced this change, it was touted as a way to make the network more environmentally friendly. Not only has it reduced the energy use of the network by over 95% but it also offers users the chance to stake and earn rewards from doing so.\n\nClearly, there has been a high demand for ETH staking as MetaMask notes $40 billion that has been staked thus far. And by making the process of validator staking more accessible to everyone, we can expect even more investors to get on board. Should Ethereum witness the bull run, ETF approval, and major other milestones that analysts are predicting, the ecosystem as a whole should enjoy a very successful year."

        "content": "Before the BTC spot ETF approval, the active validator count on Ethereum fell.\n\nThe network\u2019s participation rate, which dropped before the ETF approval, has climbed.\n\nThe number of active validators on the Ethereum [ETH] Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network has seen a sharp uptick in the past week.\n\nThis is after a period of decline before the approval of the Bitcoin [BTC] spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to data from Glassnode.\n\nInformation retrieved from the on-chain data provider showed between the 4th to the 12th of January, the active validator count on the Ethereum Network fell from 906,470 to 895,784.\n\nThe decline began a day after crypto investment services provider Matrixpot published a report predicting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would reject all Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAs many feared that the prediction might be accurate, leading asset prices plunged, causing over $500 million in liquidations.\n\nOn the Ethereum network, voluntary validator exit climbed to an all-time high of 17,821, and the count of validators that participated in verifying transactions on the chain fell.\n\nHowever, this decline has stopped since the 12th of January. As of the 20th of January, 904,754 validators were active on the Ethereum network, marking a 1% uptick from the former low.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nThe missed block count touched a year-to-date high of 115 blocks on the 6th of January.\n\nThis was because of the hike in validator exit and because some validators took their nodes offline as the market awaited the SEC\u2019s decision on the BTC ETF applications.\n\nA block is said to be missed when the validator charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot is unavailable. Since the hike on the 6th of January, it has trended downward and fallen by 76%.\n\nAs of the 20th of January, only 27 blocks were missed.\n\nDue to the unavailability of a sizable number of validators on the Ethereum chain on the 6th of January, the network\u2019s participation rate plummeted to a four-month low of 98.94%.\n\nAs validators returned online, this rallied and was spotted at 99.59% at press time.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior blockspace efficiency.\n\nAs of this writing, the total number of validators on the Ethereum PoS network was 1.17 million. This year alone, the validator count on the chain has increased by 4%."

        "title": "How to Buy Ethereum (ETH) in February 2024 - Cryptonews",
        "content": "How to Buy Ethereum (ETH) in 2024 \u2013 Easy Guide\n\nHad you invested in Ethereum during its 2014 ICO, you would have paid just $0.31 per ETH. Today, Ethereum is a multi-billion dollar asset class with all-time highs of almost $5,000. This translates to gains of over 1.6 million percent.\n\nThis guide explains how to buy Ethereum in 2024. We also explore the best places to invest in ETH, and what considerations to make before proceeding.\n\nKey Considerations Before Buying Ethereum\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to consider before exploring how to invest in Ethereum so it\u2019s key to understand what Ethereum is in the first place. Crucially, like all digital assets, Ethereum is volatile. The value of your investment can rise and fall dramatically, so investors should be preferred for a bumpy ride. For example, after Ethereum hit all-time highs of almost $5,000 in November 2021, it dropped to lows of just over $1,000 a year later. This represents a rapid decline of 80%. This shows that market timing can greatly impact your investment returns. After all, Ethereum has since recovered to 52-week highs of $2,700. Dollar-cost averaging your Ethereum investments can reduce the risks of short-term volatility. In addition, most countries tax cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. In the US, for example, Ethereum is considered property by the IRS, so capital gains tax will be required on profits. What\u2019s more, if you decide to \u2018stake\u2019 Ethereum for passive rewards, the proceeds will be taxed as income. In terms of regulatory implications, Ethereum can be bought and sold legally in most countries. The SEC has already confirmed that Ethereum isn\u2019t a security, so the project is clear to operate without regulatory hurdles. This is unlike XRP, which is still embroiled in a court case with the SEC. Ultimately, it\u2019s important to keep tabs on industry and project developments when investing in Ethereum. These factors will determine Etehreum\u2019s value over time, so it\u2019s wise to be informed.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s move on to our beginner\u2019s guide on how to buy ETH in 2024.\n\nStep 1: Selecting a Trading Service or Venue\n\nThere are many ways to invest in Ethereum, so the first step is deciding on the best avenue. In terms of convenience, safety, and speed \u2013 cryptocurrency exchanges are the best option. These are similar to stock brokers but they specialize in digital assets rather than shares. Ethereum is listed on hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges, so you\u2019ve plenty of options.\n\nFirst-time investors should look for exchanges offering a user-friendly experience. This means a simple registration process and support for everyday payment methods, like bank transfers and debit/credit cards. Fees are another important factor to explore. We prefer exchanges with low deposit fees and competitive Ether trading commissions.\n\nAnd of course, safety and security should be assessed. For instance, is the Ethereum exchange licensed to operate in your country of residence? And if so, how long has it been trading and how many users does it have? Asking these questions will ensure you buy Ethereum with a legitimate provider.\n\nStep 2: Register With an Ethereum Exchange\n\nNext, investors will need to open an account with their preferred Ethereum exchange. The registration process is similar across most providers.\n\nGet started by entering an email address and choosing a strong password.\n\nIt\u2019s also wise to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) if this is offered. 2FA will protect your account from unauthorized parties.\n\nAssuming you want to buy Ethereum with your local currency, you\u2019ll need to complete a quick KYC process. This comes in two steps.\n\nFirst, provide the Ethereum exchange with some personal information and contact details. Second, upload some verification documents, including proof of identity (e.g. driver\u2019s license) and address (e.g. bank statement).\n\nStep 3: Connect to a Payment Option\n\nA deposit will need to be made before you can buy Ether. The best cryptocurrency exchanges directly accept fiat payment methods like Visa, MasterCard, Neteller, PayPal, and bank transfers.\n\nThat said, some use third-party payment gateways like Simplex, Ramp, and Moonpay. Either way, choose your preferred payment method, type in the deposit amount, and confirm.\n\nStep 4: Understanding Fees and Costs\n\nSeveral fees should be considered when buying Ethereum from an exchange. These fees should be built into your cost basis, ensuring you know exactly how much you\u2019re making or losing.\n\nFor a start, consider how much you paid to deposit funds. For example, suppose you deposited $500 with a debit/credit card and paid a 2% fee.\n\nThis means you need the price of Ethereum to increase by 2% just to break even.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you\u2019ll also need to factor in commissions. For instance, if you paid a 1% commission to buy Ethereum, that\u2019s another 1% added to your cost basis.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to dollar-cost average your Ethereum investments, it\u2019s wise to create a spreadsheet. Each investment will adjust the average cost price, so you\u2019ll have a firm grasp of your position.\n\nStep 5: Placing an Ethereum Order\n\nWith a verified and funded account, you can now buy Ethereum.\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges offer a simple conversion model. This means you simply need to type in how much Ethereum you want to buy and the exchange will complete the order instantly.\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges require you to place a manual order. In this instance, search for \u2018Ethereum\u2019 and select a \u2018Market\u2019 order. Input the investment amount and confirm The exchange will execute the buy order at the best available price.\n\nStep 6: Safe Storage\n\nAfter buying Ethereum, the ETH coins can be found in your exchange account. The ETH can be kept there until you want to sell. However, the safest option is to withdraw the ETH coins to a private wallet. This removes the need to trust that the ETH coins are safe. After all, if the Ethereum exchange is hacked, you could lose your investment.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the best Ethereum wallets offer self-custody storage. This means you have control of your private keys. You also have full control over incoming and outgoing transactions. We discuss which storage options are best for beginners later in this guide.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\n\n\nStill not sure where to buy Ether in 2024? Read on to discover the most popular investment options.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges offer the best way to buy Ethereum. There are hundreds of providers to choose from, but we\u2019ve narrowed our selection down to just two.\n\n1. MEXC \u2013 Buy and Sell Ethereum With Low Commissions\n\nMEXC is a popular cryptocurrency exchange that supports some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy, including Ethereum. Verified accounts take minutes to set up. After that, you can buy Ethereum instantly with fiat money. Payment options include Visa, MasterCard, local bank transfers, and selected e-wallets.\n\nThe minimum Ethereum purchase is just $30. The ETH coins will then be added to your MEXC account straight away, meaning you don\u2019t need to worry about placing market orders. MEXC fees will vary depending on several factors. For instance, whether a third-party gateway is used, the preferred currency, and the selected payment type.\n\nThat said, trading commissions are fixed at just 0.1%. This means you\u2019ll pay just $0.10 in commission for every $100 you trade. MEXC doubles up as an Ethereum savings account, with competitive APYs of 4.8% currently being offered. There are no withdrawal penalties, meaning you can cash out at any time.\n\nPros In our view, the overall best place to buy Ethereum in 2024\n\nIn our view, the overall best place to buy Ethereum in 2024 Accepts local bank transfers, debit/credit cards, and e-wallets\n\nAccepts local bank transfers, debit/credit cards, and e-wallets Pay just $0.10 in commission for every $100 traded\n\nPay just $0.10 in commission for every $100 traded Supports hundreds of other altcoins\n\nSupports hundreds of other altcoins Huge liquidity levels ensure competitive pricing Cons Clients from the US, Canada, and Singapore are not accepted\n\nClients from the US, Canada, and Singapore are not accepted Fiat payment fees can be high when using a third-party gateway\n\nExchange Deposit Fee Commission to Buy Ethereum MEXC Stated when making the debit/credit card deposit.

Binance \u2013 Great Option for Buying and Earning Ethereum\n\nBinance offers a huge ecosystem that not only covers an Ethereum exchange but also earning tools. This means you can buy and earn ETH rewards on the same platform. Binance accepts fiat money deposits via debit/credit cards and local bank transfers. However, not all countries are supported for fiat payments, so you\u2019ll need to confirm this before proceeding.\n\nNonetheless, Binance charges a maximum commission fee of 0.10%, which is reduced when trading larger amounts. Fees can also be reduced when holding BNB, Binance\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Binance supports Ethereum 2.0 staking, with APYs currently paying 2.86%. Flexible Ethereum savings accounts are also available, but these yield just 0.83%.\n\nHigh-risk investors might also consider Ethereum dual investments, with APRs of over 123% on offer. Binance is also a great option for technical traders. It offers advanced analysis features like indicators and chart drawing tools. Binance also offers Ethereum futures and options. Although Americans are welcome, there\u2019s a separate Binance platform for US clients.\n\nPros Trade Ethereum with advanced analysis tools\n\nTrade Ethereum with advanced analysis tools Offers ETH staking, savings accounts, and dual investments\n\nOffers ETH staking, savings accounts, and dual investments Buy Ethereum at a commission of just 0.1%\n\nBuy Ethereum at a commission of just 0.1% Mobile app for iOS and Android\n\nMobile app for iOS and Android US clients have access to a dedicated platform Cons Fiat payments aren\u2019t available in all countries\n\nFiat payments aren\u2019t available in all countries Beginners might find the trading dashboard intimidating\n\nExchange Deposit Fee Commission to Buy Ethereum Binance Depends on the exchange (US or global), payment method, and currency. Some banking methods are fee-free. Debit/credit cards average 2% 0.10%\n\nDeFi Platforms\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency exchanges are the best option when buying Ethereum, some investors prefer decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This offers an alternative experience, as you can often trade without opening an account or providing any personal information.\n\nWe rate Best Wallet as the best decentralized exchange. Read on to find more.\n\nBest Wallet \u2013 Buy Ethereum Anonymously at Competitive Fees\n\nBest Wallet is a DeFi platform that offers an exchange and a decentralized wallet. Not only does it support Ethereum but all ERC-20 tokens. It\u2019s also compatible with other blockchain standards, including Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. Investors won\u2019t need to open an account when using Best Wallet. Nor do they need to provide any personal information.\n\nThe only requirement is to connect a private wallet to the exchange, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. That said, the wallet must already be funded with a cryptocurrency. This is because you\u2019ll be swapping another cryptocurrency for Ethereum. The trade will be executed by decentralized liquidity pools.\n\nThis means you can buy Ethereum without needing another market participant. Fees are very competitive; Best Wallet doesn\u2019t add any markups to the prices it secures. Investors will need to cover the network fee, as trades are conducted by smart contracts. Once the Ethereum purchase is made, the ETH coins will be added to your connected wallet.\n\nPros Buy Ethereum without opening an account\n\nBuy Ethereum without opening an account Connect a wallet and trade instantly and anonymously\n\nConnect a wallet and trade instantly and anonymously Supports all ERC20 and BEP20 tokens\n\nSupports all ERC20 and BEP20 tokens No added markups on exchange rates\n\nNo added markups on exchange rates Simple trading dashboard is ideal for newbies Cons While fiat gateways are supported \u2013 this requires ID verification\n\nWhile fiat gateways are supported \u2013 this requires ID verification Ethereum staking tools aren\u2019t yet available\n\nExchange Deposit Fee Commission to Buy Ethereum Best Wallet No fees for cryptocurrency deposits. Fiat gateway fees are determined by the payment provider None \u2013 exchange rates are determined by the liquidity pool. Network fees apply\n\nCrypto ATMs\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs allow you to buy Ethereum in the real-world. They work like conventional ATMs but in reverse. This is because you\u2019ll be inserting money into the terminal. And in return, you\u2019ll receive Ethereum.\n\nWith online exchanges now making it seamless to buy Ethereum, interest in cryptocurrency ATMs is waning. There\u2019s also the issue of high fees.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the median fee charged by cryptocurrency ATMs is 16%. Selling cryptocurrency from an ATM averages 15%. The same transaction on MEXC would cost just 0.1%.\n\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) Platforms\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) platforms connect cryptocurrency buyers with local sellers. First, buyers select their preferred payment method and investment amount. A list of sellers is then displayed, sorted by the most competitive exchange rate.\n\nAfter accepting a deal, the seller must deposit the ETH coins into the P2P escrow. This ensures that the buyer receives the coins once payment is made. The buyer proceeds to make the payment and subsequently receives their coins.\n\nWhile P2P platforms were once popular with cryptocurrency traders, volumes have declined significantly in recent years. One reason for this is because of increased KYC requirements. Most P2P sellers request ID documents from buyers to ensure they comply with anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nFailing to do so can result in criminal charges. Therefore, this makes P2P platforms less appealing to those wanting to buy Ethereum anonymously.\n\nPayment Gateways\n\nAn increasing number of fiat payment gateways have entered the cryptocurrency market in recent years. Some of the most popular include:\n\nMoonpay\n\nSimplex\n\nBanxa\n\nMercuryo\n\nOnramper\n\nThese providers form a bridge between cryptocurrency platforms and fiat money. For example, many Ethereum wallets will form partnerships with a payment gateway. This enables users to buy and sell Ethereum within their wallet interface, meaning an exchange isn\u2019t required.\n\nPayment gateways are also used by exchanges if they\u2019re not licensed to handle fiat money. However, using a payment gateway can be expensive. We found that some providers charge upwards of 5% \u2013 sometimes more.\n\nCryptocurrency Apps\n\nMost cryptocurrency exchanges offer a native app for Android and iOS. This allows users to buy Ethereum while on the move. Apps usually connect with a desktop website, meaning users can switch between the two at any time.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, cryptocurrency apps often double up as an Ethereum wallet.\n\nStoring Your Ethereum Safely\n\n\n\nBuying Ethereum is just one part of the investment process. The next step is to consider storage. After all, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are highly sought after by hackers. Therefore, ensuring your ETH coins are kept safe is crucial.\n\nLet\u2019s explore how the best crypto wallets work when storing Ethereum.\n\nCrypto Exchanges\n\nOnce you buy Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange, the ETH coins will remain in your account. The coins are held in a wallet controlled by the exchange, meaning you won\u2019t have access to your private keys. This presents some risks.\n\nFor a start, you can only transfer ETH to another wallet after the transaction is approved by the exchange. This goes against the decentralized ethos of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAnother risk is if the exchange is hacked. This could provide the hacker access to your ETH coins, resulting in a loss of funds. That said, some investors keep their ETH on exchanges for added convenience. However, we\u2019d advise against this.\n\nCold Wallets\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the safest way to store Ethereum, consider a cold wallet. The leading providers in this space are Ledger Nano and Trezor. Both offer cold wallets via a hardware device.\n\nThe main benefit of a cold wallet is that they\u2019re never connected to the internet. This makes remote hacks almost impossible. What\u2019s more, you\u2019d need to enter a PIN on the device to authorize Ethereum transfers.\n\nThe best hardware wallets are secured by backup passphrases, which are usually a string of 12 random words. You\u2019ll need this if the hardware device is lost, damaged, or stolen. Ultimately, if you\u2019ve invested a consequential amount into Ethereum, opt for a cold wallet.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy a hardware wallet, consider a paper wallet. Both achieve the same goal \u2013 as they offer cold storage. The main difference is that paper wallets are a lot less convenient. Plus, you\u2019ll only be able to store Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nNonetheless, paper wallets are super-secure.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to create a new Ethereum wallet address and a private key. This can be done from most software wallets, such as Trust Wallet.\n\nThen transfer the ETH coins to the wallet address.\n\nNext, print the wallet address and private key onto a sheet of paper.\n\nFinally, delete the software wallet from your device.\n\nAt this stage, the paper wallet is the only place storing your private key. If you want to transfer the ETH coins, you\u2019ll need to re-install a software wallet and import the private key.\n\nHot Wallets\n\nHot wallets are always connected to the internet. They\u2019re super convenient, allowing you to send and receive ETH coins with ease. Some hot wallets come as a browser extension. This means you can access your wallet from a desktop device.\n\nThat said, we prefer mobile hot wallets. They\u2019re still convenient but come with added security. For instance, the best hot wallets come with facial and/or fingerprint ID. All that said, hot wallets are always at risk of being hacked.\n\nSomething as simple as clicking an unknown link could be fatal. If a hacker obtains your private key, they\u2019ll be able to access the hot wallet remotely. In contrast, cold wallets are never exposed to live servers.\n\nHow is Ethereum Different from Ether\n\n\n\nWhile \u2018Ethereum\u2019, \u2018Ether\u2019, and \u2018ETH\u2019 are often used interchangeably, they refer to different parts of the ecosystem. Ethereum is the decentralized blockchain that facilitates transactions. It also enables developers to create and deploy smart contracts.\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency backing the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is required to pay GAS fees when transacting. ETH is simply the abbreviated term for Ether.\n\nSo, when you invest in Ethereum, you\u2019re actually buying Ether coins.\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 in 2014 Ethereum held its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Early-stage investors made just $0.31 per ETH.\n\nA $1,000 investment would have got you 3,225 ETH.\n\nEthereum hit an all-time high of nearly $5,000 in 2021.\n\nBased on 3,225 ETH, this would have valued your investment at almost $16 million.\n\nEven at current prices, your investment would be worth over $7 million.\n\nTherefore, this makes Ethereum one of the best crypto ICOs of all time.\n\nHow to Sell Ethereum\n\n\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, so selling your ETH coins is simple and fast. If you already have a verified account with an exchange, this is the best option. You can transfer the ETH coins to the exchange and sell them for fiat money. Binance is a good option here, as bank transfer withdrawals are supported in many countries.\n\nAlthough MEXC supports fiat money deposits, it doesn\u2019t directly offer withdrawals. You can, however, use the MEXC peer-to-peer exchange. This enables you to sell your ETH coins to a local seller. The seller will transfer fiat to your preferred payment type, such as a bank account or e-wallet.\n\nThe other option is to sell ETH coins for another cryptocurrency. This can be done on a decentralized exchange like Best Wallet. No account is required, let alone ID verification. Best Wallet enables you to swap ETH for thousands of other cryptocurrencies, including Tether, Uniswap, and Shiba Inu.\n\nAccording to CoinATMRadar, hundreds of cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to sell Ethereum. After locating a terminal, you\u2019ll be asked to transfer the ETH coins to the ATM\u2019s wallet address. The cryptocurrency ATM will then dispense cash. However, as we mentioned earlier, the average fee to sell cryptocurrency at an ATM is 15%.\n\nWhat Can You Buy with Ethereum\n\n\n\nWondering what you can buy with Ethereum in 2024? We found that Crypto Emporium offers thousands of luxury products, from cars and real estate to electronics, designer clothes, and artwork. All items can be purchased securely with ETH coins.\n\nOther merchants accepting Ethereum include Newegg, CheapAir, Overstock, Twitch, and Chipotle. If you find a merchant that\u2019s partnered with BitPay, you\u2019ll also be able to use Ethereum.\n\nStaking Ethereum for Passive Rewards If you believe in the future of Ethereum, you might consider staking your ETH coins.\n\nThis means temporarily locking the coins into an Ethereum staking contract.\n\nIn doing so, you\u2019ll help keep the network safe and earn passive rewards.\n\nThese are paid in ETH, so you can organically build your portfolio without investing more money.\n\nWhat the Future Holds for Ethereum\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum is still in its infancy. Even so, it has a huge market capitalization of over $280 billion \u2013 making it more valuable than most blue-chip companies. That said, Ethereum still trades more than 50% below its all-time high of almost $5,000. In the short term, investors will aim for a return to all-time high levels.\n\nIn the long term, the upside could be unprecedented. According to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Ethereum could hit $180,000 by 2030. Based on current prices, this would require an upside of over 7,700%. This would also give Ethereum a market capitalization of several trillion dollars.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s future is also dependent on its technological advancements. While Ethereum was originally a proof-of-work ecosystem, it has since upgraded to proof-of-stake. This reduced Ethereum\u2019s impact on the environment by over 99%. The proof-of-stake upgrade also means that investors can stake their ETH coins for passive rewards.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains a sluggish ecosystem. It can still only handle about 30 transactions per second. In contrast, other smart contract blockchains can handle several thousand transactions in the same time frame. Moreover, Ethereum GAS fees also remain a problem. During busy periods, fees can exceed $10.\n\nThere are thousands of decentralized applications operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Each ecosystem requires transactions, which can overload the Ethereum network further. Therefore, for Ethereum to reach its full potential, it must increase scalability and decrease fees. If not, then competitors like Solana could eat away at Ethereum\u2019s market share.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIn summary, Ethereum remains the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It offers huge upside potential, although it must improve on scalability to fend off competition from other blockchains.\n\nConsidering it now trades over 50% below all-time highs, now could be a great time to buy Ethereum. MEXC offers a safe place to invest and charges commissions of just 0.1%. MEXC also offers Ethereum savings accounts with APYs of 4.8%.\n\nReferences\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Buying Ethereum\n\nHow do I buy Ethereum?\n\nYou can buy Ethereum on MEXC at commissions of just 0.1%. Open an account, upload your ID, and buy Ethereum instantly with a debit/credit card. Hundreds of other exchanges also list Ethereum.\n\nCan I buy $10 worth of Ethereum?\n\nYes, Ethereum can be split into tiny units \u2013 so $10 investments are possible. However, make sure you check the minimum deposit requirement with your chosen exchange.\n\nIs Ethereum better than Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin have two completely different target markets. While Bitcoin is considered a store of value, Ethereum is a smart contract ecosystem that supports decentralized applications.\n\nCan I sell Ethereum for cash?\n\nYes, you can sell Ethereum for cash. You\u2019ll need to use a cryptocurrency exchange that supports fiat money withdrawals. Consider fees, safety, and minimums before proceeding."
